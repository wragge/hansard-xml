                        <para>- Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> asked whether there was any objection to laying upon the table of the Senate copies of all documents relating to the classification of the position occupied by, and the promotion of, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blakney.</inline> In reply, I stated that, personally, I saw no objection to complying with the honorable senator&#39;s request, and that I thought that procedure was adopted in all such cases. My reason for making that statement was that on the previous day I had tabled, pursuant -to Statute, some papers in connexion with the promotion of an officer in . the Postal Department named Liston. I pointed out that if that&#39; were the usual course of procedure in such cases,- it would be followed in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Blakney.</inline> But in any case I promised to bring the matter under the notice of the Public Service Commissioner. Upon looking into section  23  of the Public Service Act, however, I find that the reason why the papers were tabled in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Liston&#39;s</inline> case was that that officer had -not been promoted in the ordinary way. That is to say, he had not been advanced from subdivision to subdivision, after spending at least a year in each, but had stepped up a few subdivisions, and in all such cases it is necessary that the papers relating to them should be laid upon the table. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. That officer has merely been advanced one step I find, although advanced to another class. In the case that I quoted as an illustration, only the formal papers were tabled, but in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blakney&#39;</inline> s case I take it that what is desired is not so much the formal documents but the substantial reasons for the action which has been taken. I shall ask the Public Service Commissioner to report as to the substantial reasons for the action that has been taken in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blakney&#39;s</inline> case, and I shall have very much pleasure in laying the report upon the table of the Senate. </para>

In this connexion, I desire to &#34;ask whether the Minister recollects the promise w&#34;hich he made that other States whose circumstances are somewhat similar to those of Tasmania should be communicated with, for the purpose of ascertaining if they desire to make a similar claim. Have other States been communicated with, and, if so, did their Premiers put forward any claim upon the same ground? </para>

                    <para>. - We are now dealing with a proposed duty of 3d. per lb. on liquorice under the General Tariff. This represents an attempt, I suppose, to give work to people in Australia in the manufacture of liquorice. The steps taken are clear. The liquorice root, which obviously is not produced in Australia, is made free, in order to encourage its importation. The next stage, in paragraph  b,  is to allow crude liquorice, crude paste, and block juice - liquorice manufactured to a certain stage - to come in at a duty of1d. All this is typical of the protectionist idea. But when we come to the final paragraph there is proposed a duty of 3d., which, if translated into <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> proportions, must mean 100 per cent. at least. </para>

                        <para>- I have not, but this is hardly a question of importation, seeing that we do not grow liquorice here. One object of the three duties taken together is, I suppose, to give employment to what obviously must be a limited number of people in Australia, in converting the liquorice, either from its crudest form or from its semi-manufactured form, into the finished article for general consumption. Even if Australia were absolutely unanimous on the question of protection, it should not be necessary to induce our people to enter into such an industry by means of a Tariff like this. The proposed duty cannot under any circumstances have any other effect than to enhance the price; and even if it were thought desirable to turn Australian labour into such a channel, it should not be necessary to impose so heavy a duty. If we left a margin of 2d., or even of1d., between the root and the finished article, it should be ample, even if we desired to encourage so small an industry. I know that protectionists are now inclined to say that they do not object to enhanced prices, so long as employment is given in the country. </para>

The displacement of labour under free imports would be so infinitesimal as to make no difference; and I am certain that a duty of 2d. more than outweighs any disproportion in the cost of labour; indeed, a duty of1d. would more than compensate for that. Under the circumstances, however, I propose a duty of 2d. </para>

It is no doubt the desire that we should have the benefit of any labour involved in the production of the manufactured article; but liquorice has always borne&#39; the same duty as confectionery, and, in addition to the protectionist reason, the idea is to keep them in line. The duty on confectionery was  fixed  at  3d. </para>

From France the quantity sent was  42,509  lbs., of a value of&#163;1,600; from Italy  121,029  lbs., valued at&#163;4,386  ;  while we got some from Spain, and a small quantity from the United States of America. The total importation is  212,435  lbs., valued at&#163;7,837. There is no reason why liquorice should not be manufactured here. Due provision is made for the importation of the raw material, and of the semi-manufactured article, and I think that protection should be given to the workmen engaged in putting the finished product on the market. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;11. 3&#93;.  - I take the same position in regard to liquorice that I did in regard to confectionery, under which heading it really comes. In the case of confectionery, the Government proposed a duty of3¾d., which the House of Representatives reduced to  3d.,  while on liquorice they proposed a duty of  3&#189;d.,  which the House of Representatives reduced to  . 3d.  There is no reason why liquorice should not be manufactured in Australia ; the question we have to consider is whether the industry would not be reasonably protected by a lower duty. The free introduction of liquorice root must be of great advantage to the local manufacturers, and no doubt a considerable quantity of liquorice is manufactured in Australia. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has not given us any evidence in support of his statement that the industry will be strangled or ruined if a duty of  2d.  is imposed.

I am merely remarking that we are being asked to increase by 50 per cent. the duty under which, so far as we know, the industry has flourished in the past, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council has given us no adequate reason for the increase. Both sections of the Tariff Commission recommend a duty of 2d. per lb. on liquorice, the protectionist section adding that, when the import value is more than1s., the duty should be 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- According to the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, page 8, a Western Australian manufacturer admitted that the selling price of imported goods is from 2s. 8d. to 2s.11d. per box of from 5 to 6 lbs., which works out at less than 6d. per lb., and of the local article, 2s. 9d. per box of 7 lbs., or about 4d. per lb. Those are probably the wholesale prices. He said that the local manufacturers were forced to reduce their price to 2s. 9d., in order to get below the English prices, and were therefore unable to make a fair profit. On those figures a duty of 3d. per lb. is equivalent to 75 per cent. of the wholesale price of the locally-manufactured liquorice, and is more than 50 per cent. of the wholesale price of the imported liquorice. Another small item of fact worth bushels of theory and argument is the statement of Messrs. Blogg and Hoadley, two Victorian manufacturers imbued with the Victorian view of protection. The report states - </para>

                <para>Are we to go behind that? What are we doing? Even according to the view of the Government and my honorable friends who take a strong view as to protection, we are coming to the aid of these manufacturers. They tell us that if the crude article is admitted free they want nothing more than a duty of 2d. per lb. If the crude article is admitted free, why should we give them more than that protection? I think it is folly to do so. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will not resist the proposal to make the duty 2d. per lb. This is not a question which involves in the slightest degree any matter of preference ; it is not a proper subject for preference. The question is, Are we to make the duty more protective? If we leave the duty at 3d. per lb. we shall, from my point of view, unnecessarily increase the price to the consumer, because the manufacturers do not ask for that; whereas if we keep the duty down we shall do justice to the manufacturers; we shall meet their request literally. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is quite right. We shall give these manufacturers all they ask for. The great bulk of this commodity comes from Italy and other foreign countries, only one-fifth of the imports coming from the United Kingdom. The question is simply whether we are going to confine ourselves to meeting the request of these manufacturers for the protection which they think will be sufficient, or to increase the price, as we must do, by raising the duty by&#189;d. or1d. per lb. No alleviation will be given to the consumers of this country by taking off&#189;d. per lb. in respect of the small quantity that comes from the United Kingdom. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will see his way to fall in with the request of Messrs. Blogg and Hoadley, and leave the duty at 2d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee can only deal with what is contained in the schedule. We have been discussing paragraphc. The Committee has decided in favour of a lower duty. The honorable senator cannot, therefore, move a higher duty than 2d. in that paragraph. The only way in which he can achieve what he desires is to move that the House of Representatives be requested to insert a new paragraph dealing with high-grade liquorice. </para>

                <para class="block">The matter has been fully argued, and* from the returns that we have before us it is shown that a considerable amount of liquorice must be introduced into the Commonwealth worth over1s. per lb. The duty that has been collected absolutely shows that. The argument that has been used is that it would be a perfectly fair thing to impose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on expensive liquorice. It has been stated that liquorice of high grade does not come from Great Britain. As far as I know, liquorice is principally manufactured in Italy, Spain, and the West Indies. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> states that the returns show that liquorice is imported of a value of over1s. per lb. I should like to know from what source the honorable senator gets his figures. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> statistics - and I am not going to question them - in 1906, 103,624 lbs. were imported into Australia at a value of &#163;11,288. Those facts are contained on page 74, Part I., of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> tables. They relate to crude liquorice. Honorable senators will see that those figures work out at less than 6d. per lb. The honorable senator desires to impose a higher duty on liquorice of a value over1s. per lb. Clearly, he is wrong in assuming upon the basis of these figures that such liquorice is imported.  His  argument does not apply in that case. Take the &#34;Other&#34; class of liquorice. It will be seen from the figures that 104,099 lbs. were imported at a value of &#163;7,817. That does not work out at1s. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I am simply talking of liquorice, and that is what we are dealing with. So. far as I have been able to gather we imported from Greece last year only about 231 lbs., of a value slightly exceeding 1s! 4d.per lb. The imports may be much larger than I have stated, but the point made by my honorable friend is that this was a recommendation of the Tariff Commission, and that it must have had some evidence on which to found it. </para>

                    <para>. - The explanation is perfectly simple. I can say with some confidence that liquorice of the value of1s. per lb., or over, is imported for medicinal purposes and does not in any circumstances come within the category of liquorice used as an alternative for confectionery. I am quite prepared, since I cannot obtain anything better, to vote for a duty of 25 per cent. on all liquorice of the value of1s. per lb., or over, provided that it is not intended for medicinal purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - * would point out to the Committee that the Tariff Commission recommended no such qualification as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> suggests, and that if such a qualification were imposed it would render the suggested request absolutely worthless. There is complete facility in respect to this item for evading any duty of the kind, and I would therefore repeat that the qualification suggested would make the item utterly worthless. </para>

                    <para>. - At the outset of the debate on the Tariff honorable senators generally expressed . a desire that there should be a mutual effort to make some progress; but it is rather disheartening to those who are endeavouring to do so to find that the Vice-President of the Executive Council absolutely declines to meet the view of a considerable number of honorable senators respecting a very small matter the difficulty in regard to which could be overcome by a simple Customs regulation. It has been said that the duty has been reduced. Here is a proposal to .put it up again. The quantity of liquorice of a value of more than is. per lb., which is imported, must be small, and it is only proposed to put back the duty to the point which the Minister originally desired, making an exception where, if ever an exception was made, it ought to be made, and that is in the direction of liquorice for medicinal purposes. The Minister has urged as a reason against the adoption of that course the possibility of fraud and evasion. </para>

                        <para>- Knowing .the adroitness of our experienced Customs, officials in meeting all attempts of the kind in more complicated cases, I am surprised that the Minister should suggest that they could not overcome this little difficulty. In Excise cases, in the matter of the implements made and wages paid by certain manufacturers, we accept a declaration, and if in a case of this kind a declaration from the importers is not sufficient, there is another simple method of meeting the difficulty. The Department has already a determination regarding the importation of opium&#39; under regulations, and if it is thought that this is a sufficiently serious matter to warrant regulations to defeat any attempt to defraud the Customs, surely the officials have sufficient ability to. frame them. I rose to express my regret that, in a matter of this kind, the Minister is not prepared to accept a request which goes nine-tenths of the way that he desires to take. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will not persist in his suggestion. Liquorice, in the public mind, is very different from opium. Nearly everybody has an idea that liquorice possesses medicinal properties, and buys it in the belief that its use has some restorative effect. I have bought liquorice, and have met thousands of others who have done the same, believing that it would cure or relieve a cold or some other like ailment. Sarsaparilla has &#39; a similar reputation. If confectionery were manufactured containing sarsaparilla, it would be purchased in the same way as liquorice, for what were believed to be its medicinal properties, and thus our object in passing the Tariff would be defeated. For the reason that I have given, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> might withdraw his suggestion and allow the Committee to go to a vote on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> request. </para>

I regard the new leader of the Opposition as a very sensible and reasonable man, and while I am prepared to allow the honorable senator a great deal of latitude as a free-trader, I appeal to him, seeing that he is opposed to increased duties, to say how any deficiency in the revenue should be made up. In this instance, it is not so much a question of the particular duty which should be imposed, but of leaving a loophole in the Tariff which would enable importers of this article to evade the payment of any duty at all. I am astonished that such a proposal should have been made by such a wideawake senator as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> Dealing with the suggestion that liquorice is used as a medicine, I remind honorable senators that no such proposal as that now made was submitted to the Committee when we were considering the duty on whisky, which is frequently ordered by doctors, and taken by people as a medicine. I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> whether, as the son of a doctor, he is prepared to apply the same principle to the duty on whisky. I am satisfied that if that principle were applied to the duty on whisky, we should receive little or no Customs revenue from importations of that article. I regard liquorice as a luxury, and if we are to derive revenue through the Customs, let it be by the imposition of duties on luxuries. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> desires to maintain his position as a leading protectionist. I hope he will try to get back to the fold on this item. </para>

                    <para>.- Because of a remark which I have just overheard, I point out that if the request as proposed to be amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> be carried, it will not follow that liquorice required for medicinal purposes can be imported free of duty. It will be subject to the duty of 2d. per lb., already approved by the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, I regard the duty proposed as a purely revenue duty. The imports of coffee into the Commonwealth last year totalled 1,693,990 lbs., upon which, under a Tariff of 3d. per lb., .&#163;20,973 was paid by way of duty. It is now proposed .to retain the same rate. Personally, I intend to extend adequate protection to, every genuine Australian industry ; but I am not prepared to assist the Government to impose revenue duties upon articles of daily consumption. I regard coffee as the workingman&#39;s drink. It is about the only&#34; drink that he can purchase at a low price, and, seeing that tea has been placed upon the free list, we cannot logically refuse to place coffee in the same category. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not agree to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> It is not very long since the Senate, in dealing with another measure, went very exhaustively into the consideration of the question of the growth of coffee in Australia. During the course of the debate upon, that occasion a good deal of information was forthcoming regarding coffee production throughout the world. As a result of that discussion Parliament decided that a bounty of id. per lb. should be paid for eight years upon all the coffee produced in Australia under the conditions laid down in the Bounties Act. It would be rather a curious procedure if with one hand we were to offer a bounty for the production of coffee, whilst with the other we took away the protection which has been accorded to the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. In 1903 the imports of coffee into the Commonwealth totalled 1,425,415 lbs., in 1904 they were 1,291,000 lbs., in 1905 they aggregated 1,754,000 lbs., and in 1906, 1,093,000 lbs. When a higher duty was operative in Queensland, the output of coffee there was greater than it has been since the reduction of that duty, notwithstanding that coincident with that reduction Inter-State free-trade was established. Upon a former occasion I think it was pointed out that the quantity of coffee consumed in Australia, per head of the population, is very small relatively to that consumed in other parts of the world. In Great Britain, too, the people do not drink much coffee. There, the consumption is 0.7 lbs. per head per annum, whilst the consumption in other countries ranges from 3 lbs. per head in France, to 23 lbs. per head in Holland. <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> estimates that the coffee requirements of Australia are 2,300,000 lbs. per annum. Nothing like that quantity has ever been produced locally, but that fact does not conclusively demonstrate that with the aid of a fair protective duty, and of the bounty, we shall not be able to foster the industry to such an extent that it will be able to supply a large portion of the demands of the Commonwealth in the near future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> was reminded by interjection during his speech that Queensland coffee is being consumed upon these very premises. Only a day or two ago I made an inquiry upon this matter, and I was informed that the coffee supplied to honorable senators in our Parliamentary Buildings comes from Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that it is not advisable to reduce the duty upon coffee, much less to place that article upon the free list. The policy of this Parliament has been to endeavour to promote its growth, and to this end we have gone to the length of adding to the existing duty of 3d. per lb. a further measure of encouragement, by authorizing the payment of a bounty of1d. per lb. It was never intended that we should offer that bounty to encourage coffee production, with a. view to subsequently reducing the duty. </para>

                        <para>- They will probably vote for the duty of 3d. per lb. There is no doubt that the majority of people in Australia have declared in favour of a protectionist policy, and are extremely anxious for, the development of every part of the continent. We must not regard the question from a State point of view. To urge that some honorable senators are supporting the duty because coffee-growinsr will probably flourish better in Queensland than in some other State, is to take a very narrow view. </para>

                        <para>- According to the official figures the area cultivated for coffee in Queensland has not increased since this Parliament lowered the duty. It is evident that if Australia is to be a nation worthy of the name, serious consideration must be given to the protection of industries which are yet in their infancy. Coffee can undoubtedly be grown in various parts of Australia successfully and profitably if sufficient encouragement is given to the industry. It is &#39; established beyond the shadow of a doubt that pure coffee of excellent quality, altogether different from some of the adulterated coffee which finds its way to Australia to-day, has been placed upon the market from Queensland in various States, and has been supplied in the refreshment rooms in this building. Those who are competent to express an opinion have pronounced it to be the finest coffee they have ever tasted. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly their palates have become accustomed to the adulterated imported coffee. The public will have to be educated up to the pure article. We know the history of adulteration in the Old Land. When the co-operative societies started there they found it almost impossible to sell pure coffee and butter, because numbers of their customers had been in the habit of buying the adulterated articles, and had become accustomed to them. </para>

We have in Victoria a Pure Food Act, and I hope similar measures will be passed by the other States Parliaments. The people will then be educated up to the necessity of having pure foods. </para>

                        <para>- I would force them in their own interests to drink the pure as against the adulterated article. The question of whether this item shall be retained or not is a serious one in the interests of Australia. If the duty on coffee is removed what is to become of the undeveloped and unpeopled parts of the Continent? Within a very short period Parliament will probably agree to take over the Northern Territory, which has an area six times that of Victoria and a population of only about 3,000. of whom 2,000 are coloured people. The Territory is eminently suitable for coffee growing. </para>

                        <para>- We have not yet made a start to do so, but what coloured people can do white people can do. In many respects white labour on the whole is cheaper than coloured. If the duty is removed and coffee admitted free the Bounties Bill in respect of coffee becomes a farce. One penny per lb. is offered in that Bill for the encouragement of the industry. With that amount, and a duty of 3d. per lb., there is a possibility of a very big industry being established not only in Queensland, but in parts of Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It has been said that the north-western parts of Australia have similar soil and  ai  somewhat similar climate to certain parts of the Northern Territory. If so, they are suitable for coffee culture. Coffee is not altogether a  poor man&#39;s beverage. It is used to a very limited extent by what are called the poorer classes. Tea is the poor people&#39;s drink. Many people in good circumstances take no Other beverage than coffee, sometimes with milk and sometimes without, in the belief that it is a better stimulant than alcohol. I trust that the duty will remain as proposed by the Government. </para>

When the Bounties Bill was before the Chamber I took up in regard to this item precisely the same attitude as I intend to take up now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> gave us then some very useful information as to the prospects and possibilities of Queensland as a coffee country, but he showed that under a high State duty coffee culture had been, as it were, played at. He proved that every man who attempted to grow coffee in Queensland did so on a little patch in his spare moments while doing other things of a more useful character. </para>

                        <para>- We can get it from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The report of the Committee of experts on the Bounties Bill also gave very clear and sufficient reasons why coffee should be admitted free. Admitting, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> claims, that Australia has declared in favour of a policy of protection, has it decided to adopt a policy of mad-headed protection? Are we to impose duties upon articles with which we have not the remotest possibility of supplying ourselves, in order to cai ry out a policy of high protection? Surely Australia has not reached that point yet. The decrease in the production of coffee in Queensland has clearly shown that the industry is a failure. That fact is in keeping with the statement that every man who attempted to grow coffee there did so on little patches. </para>

We have the fact that already countries more suitable to the industry are prepared to supply the whole of the markets of the world. I have no objection to the coloured man producing anything in his- own country, if he stops in his own country. We drink the coloured man&#39;s lea, and are likely to do so for a considerable time, because we know that that course is absolutely wise. The evidence in. the case of coffee is quite as strong as it is in the case of tea; and it is idle, simply for the sake of showing that we are highly protectionist, to continue to levy taxation on the people of Australia, amounting to nearly ^&#163;30,000 per annum. There is no possibility whatever of this industry ever becoming even worthy of an attempt to establish it in Australia, and I heartily support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft&#39;s</inline> motion. </para>

                    <para>- I resent the insinuation that I am speaking now purely from a States point of view. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has pointed out, Western Australia has as good an opportunity, if an opportunity exists at all, to grow coffee as Queensland is supposed to have, and I cannot be accused of opposing this duty because of any hostile spirit towards Queensland or any other State. From what I have seen of the Northern Territory, I am under the impression that it would be ages before we could grow there sufficient coffee to supply our own requirements. For years past protection equivalent to 75 per cent, has been accorded to coffee ; and if that is not sufficient there is no possibility of any duty establishing the industry. I opposed the proposal under the Bounties Bill to devote ,&#163;12,000 for eight years to the encouragement of the production of raw coffee, and I am supported in that attitude bv the fact that, when visiting the Northern Territory. I saw there an abandoned coffee plantation. </para>

                        <para>- In pre-Federation days the owner of that coffee plantation had the advantage of as high a duty as is proposed now. We find that in the ten years from 1896 to 1905, notwithstanding the high protection, the acreage under coffee cultivation increased only from 26 acres to 335 acres. This information I get from a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, who used the fact as an argument in favour of a bounty on coffee. The statement that the attempt to grow coffee has simply been in small garden patches is amply borne out. </para>

                        <para>- I would rather vote for a duty of1s. than for the proposed duty of 3d. ; but I decline to lend myself to the imposition of any revenue duty. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that coffee is not a poor man&#39;s drink ; but, in my opinion, it is just as much a beverage of the poor man as is tea. I admit, of course, that the consumption of coffee is not so large as that of tea, but nevertheless it is a poor man&#39;s drink, and ought to be admitted free, in view of the fact that no duty is imposed on tea. Each year there is an increase in the imports, and the official figures show that Brazil is prepared to supply the whole of the world. To that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> reply is that we ought to encourage the production of coffee by white labour rather than the importation of coffee produced by black labour. I quite agree with that view; but I contend that the proposed duty will not bring about that result. The honorable senator has failed to convince the Committee that the proposed duty will encourage the development of coffee culture in Australia by white labour. The attitude I am taking up now is only consistent with that I took up in regard to the bounty, which I regard as a waste of money. I seek to have coffee placed on the free list, not because I am actuated by hostile feeling towards any State, but because I am confident that we cannot, by means of a duty, foster the industry in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather amused at the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that he is a pronounced protectionist. However, I am becoming accustomed to people proclaiming themselves to be one thing, and proving by their conduct that they are either something entirely different, or that they have no conception of the meaning of the language they use. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is a pronounced protectionist he will vote for a higher duty instead of the total abolition of the duty on the ground that it does not encourage production. If he regard? this as merely a revenue duty he ought to vote, not for its abolition, but for its increase. </para>

                        <para>- I am not optimistic without reason. I have seen coffee growing, and I have drunk coffee entirely  manipulated upon the premises, and better I have never tasted. Some honorable senators, from whom I certainly expe.ct.ed some-  thing better, have poured contempt and ridicule on the industry because it is a small man&#39;s industry - because, as they put it, coffee is grown in patches. If there is one reason stronger than another why I support this duty, it is that this is a small man&#39;s industry. It is pre-eminently an industry in which a man with a small family can engage, and one which will assist to root a large number of selectors to the soil. Although we have been told that coffee cannot be grown in Australia, there were under cultivation in 1906 216 acres, producing 107,445 lbs., of coffee. </para>

                        <para>- It has been said a thousand times that Australia would never be able to grow enough wheat to feed her population.&#39; The old squatters, of whom I suppose some honorable senators to be the lineal descendants, though they do not possess their broad acres, used to say that the Darling Downs, one of the most fertile tracts in Australia, would not grow a cabbage. They said that because they had a personal interest in preventing small men from invading their territory; but I do- not &#39;know why my honorable friends wish to block settlement, unless from pure cussedness, or want of knowledge of the capabilities of the country. We are not yet producing enough coffee to meet our requirements, because Parliament has not offered sufficient inducement to persons to embark in the industry. A bounty of id., with a duty of 3d., may encourage our farmers to grow coffee more largely ; but if it be found that the encouragement is insufficient, I shall be prepared to vote for more protection. Indeed, had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> moved to make the item, free, I should have moved to make the duty 4c!. However small an industry may be, it gives employment ; and an industry which helps to root settlers to the soil, and enables them to bring up their families in decency and comfort, should have the support of every patriot. The people of Australia, as I read their mind, have determined that protection&#39; is the best policy for them, and I hope, therefore, that the request will be defeated, and that the Committee will ask the House of Representatives to make- the duty 4d. </para>

There appears in the report of the Tariff Commission an explanation of the decrease in the production of coffee since Federation as compared with the pre-Federal days. The Commissioners say that - </para>

                    <para class="block">Queensland Tariff had been in existence for years, and had given the industry its first start. The areas which were placed under coffee cultivation in 1895 would have scarcely come into bearing before Federation, as it took four years to obtain a crop of coffee from newly-planted trees. Thus it was that the industry di&#39;d not make any real progress between 1895 and 1900. In 1895 the production of coffee in Queensland had been 14,060 lbs. ; in 1896, 9,707 lbs. ; 1897, 81,614 lbs. ; 1898, 56,55* !bs. ; 1S99, 104,981  and 1900, 102,134 lbs. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In 1906 the output was 107,445 hbs., the second largest output in the history of the State, whilst it is generally believed by those who have a -knowledge of the position that the crop of 1907 was still larger, though, the returns are not yet complete. I do not claim that the industry has yet made any great advance, as the area under coffee has decreased. Unfortunately many experimental crops have failed, which is often the case in the pioneering of an industry ; but the present production shows that Australia can produce her own coffee at a reasonable cost. The country in which coffee can be grown is not limited to one or two patches. There are large areas in the Northern Territory suited for the cultivation of the tree, while coffee is being grown under marketable conditions in Cairns, in the Mackay district, in the neighbourhood of Brisbane - where the bean is sold in the parchment roasted, and put on the market, and, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Agricultural Journal,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Bell has grown coffee successfully at Chatsworth Island, on the Clarence River.  His  crop last year was  1,694  lbs., and sold at from 1s. to1s.  3d.  per lb., whilst this year he expects to get  6,000  lbs. Therefore coffee can be grown in various large centres, along a coast line  1,500  miles in length, and Parliament has granted a bounty for its production. I regard bounties as a means to direct the attention of the people to the possibilities of producing various commodities, but having granted a bounty of1d. per lb. for the production of coffee, I would not afterwards turn round upon the producer, and, by removing the duty, place him in a worse position than he occupied under the old Tariff, with a duty of  2d.  per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is, of course, the humorist of the Chamber. I do not doubt that in this case his statement was a joke, but it was rather misplaced. He made jest of the fact that, in a speech on the Bounties Bill, I had alluded to the coffee growing business as being &#34; a small man&#39;s business.&#34; He went so far as to say that it was carried on in tiny gardens, and that when they had nothing else to do the wife and children picked the berries, took them inside, and roasted them. Of course, it is unnecessary for me to assure honorable senators that that was all pure imagination on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline> In the first place, he does not know anything about the matter; and, secondly, that is not what I said, so that he could not have got the information from me.

                <para class="block">It is hardly justifiable to contend that this coffee is grown on a very tiny scale in a back yard or a front garden, where it can be picked by the wife and the children at their leisure. It has also been contended that we cannot grow coffee of the required quality - that, I take it, is a point which must be replied to - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> interjected, &#34; Why do people not drink it? &#34; The bulk of the locally-grown coffee with which I have any acquaintance is readily purchased by the public at a very decent price. I will admit, however, that in the coffee-growing business, just as in the sugar-growing business many years ago, each grower has an idea that he will establish a little plantation and do his own roasting and curing, and&#39; so forth. At one time, each sugar-grower wanted to own a plantation and a little tin-pot mill, with the idea of acquiring fame as the grower of a particular brand of sugar. In many cases where coffee has been roasted on a plantation or farm, a bad roast has been put on the market, and that may account for the fact that a certain quantity of coffee has not been readily accepted by the people and consumed. But we have proved conclusively that where the coffee from. Cairns, Mackay, and Buderim has been sold to professional roasters and put on the market - not held in a roasted form for months before it is sold but put on the market promptly and properly - excellent results have been obtained. I am in a position to say that, not long ago, the experts who roast coffee for Parliament House, as well as for the principal clubs, hotels, and restaurants in Melbourne, received from Queensland a  50-lb.  bag of coffee beans - that is green coffee hulled - and roasted it here. They tested the coffee and pronounced it as being of the highest quality, inferior possibly to Mocha. That was the most that they could say against Queensland coffee. </para>

                        <para>- It was part of 107,000 lbs. that were grown. The same verdict was given in connexion with a smaller quantity of coffee which was sent down as a sample from the Buderim district. Honorable senators know that in our refreshment room Queensland coffee was served for weeks and was praised all round. I think that there is no doubt about the quality of Queensland coffee. As regards the question of price at the present time imported coffee - the cheap and poor kind and probably the adulterated variety that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> spoke about - can be bought at as low as is. 3d. per lb., but the average coffee of decent quality which is bought here costs is. 6d. per lb. Of course is. 3d. per lb. would be the price of such coffee if there were no duty to be paid. Growers in the southern part of Queensland are selling coffee in the parchment - that is with the parchment on it, but with the pulp taken off - at 10d. per lb. in Brisbane. To hull it, roast it and put it on the market would, probably cost 4d. per lib. There is a very slight margin between the price at which coffee can be put on the market in Queensland and the price at which first-class imported coffee can -be bought. Consequently honorable senators can see that coffee can be produced in Australia with a reasonable amount of profit, and that the industry can be made an important and valuable one. Let me also draw their attention to this passage in the report of the Tariff Commission: - </para>

                    <para>In Queensland it was said that the bulk of the coffee sold was produced in countries where labour was both cheap and plentiful. It came into the southern markets in the raw state - that was hulled, but not manufactured - and principally from the States of Central and South America, India, Ceylon, and Java. In Queensland, 6s. Sd. per day was paid for labour against 4d. per day in other coffee countries. </para>

White labour is employed at decent wages, and with this amount of protection the industry can compete with imported coffee. I hope that my honorable friends from Western Australia will not insist upon taking off the duty. I firmly believe that the industry is now on a sound basis, and that with the encouragement given under the Bounties Act it will become one of the most important industries in Australia. </para>

The Ministry have positively submitted a proposal to  the Senate to place a duty of 6d. per lb. on an article which is sold in London for only 1 Id. </para>

                        <para>- But my remarks apply to the fact that chicory and coffee are mixed up in this schedule, and that both  a  and  b  refer to the two articles. I think it desirable that the two should be dealt with separately, otherwise we are prevented from rational divisions upon entirely different subjects. However, in view of the Chairman&#39;s direction I suppose it would be better for me to reserve my remarks with regard to chicory. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the item as it stands, and to oppose the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> The incidental effect of my action will be to show that at all events there is no foundation for the allegation that has been made that the senators from the West are influenced by geographical considerations. When the Bounties Bill was under consideration I voted in opposition to the proposal to give a bounty for the production of coffee, because I then thought it would be useless to try to establish the industry in this country. I believed that coffee was in the same category with two or three other articles that are produced abroad, and that to spend money in endeavouring to establish the industry here would simply conduce to waste. But there is a feature connected with the coffee-growing industry of which I was not then aware, but which has caused me to revise the opinion I held upon the Bounties Bill. I allude to the opportunity that the growth of coffee in Australia provides to a number of our poor and struggling people to earn a livelihood. The evidence on that point collected by the Tariff Commission is very clear. I do not think that we have any reason to doubt the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scriven,</inline> who states that the average holding on which coffee is grown is only about 10 acres. Taking the average yield for the last two years, as shown in the Queensland records, we find that in  1902  it amounted to  350  lbs. per acre, and in  1903  to  497  lbs. The average was  420  lbs. A holding of  10  acres produces, therefore,  4,200  lbs. of coffee. That quantity divided into the amount of the imports for  1906  yields a dividend of something like  404  holdings that would be required for the production of the coffee consumed in Australia. The importations amounted to  1,600,000  lbs. If we do not give this assistance to the coffee-growing industry it means that the  402  persons who might supply the  1,600,000  lbs. of coffee required in Australia would not be given employment. For my part I hesitate before I cast a vote which will have the effect of depriving any Australian of employment. It may be thought that my present position is inconsistent with my vote on the item coffee in the Bounties Bill. But I look upon the matter in this light : We have committed ourselves to paying  &#163;12,000  in eight years on account of coffee. We are merely making half an effort if we do not follow that up by giving ample protection to the growers. That consideration is sufficient to reconcile the vote which I intend to give on the item before the Chair with that which I gave on. the Bounties Bill, and my general attitude towards this Tariff is that I will not tolerate any item unless I think it is designed to give ample protection. At present we have determined to give a bounty of1d. per lb. on coffee. If we do not give ample protection that money will be wasted. So far as sugar is concerned, the policy of Australia is that our people are willing to pay a higher price per lb. for their sugar in order to keep the industry alive. Now coffee is not far removed from sugar. In New South Wales, before Federation, even some revenue tariffists were favorable to paying a higher price for sugar in order to maintain the sugar-growing industry. Why should not the same argument apply to coffee -growing ? </para>

                        <para>- That coffee can be produced in Queensland has been amply demonstrated, and in view of the fact that we have taken half a step towards establishing the coffee-growing industry upon a firm basis, my judgment tells me that we should supplement what we have done by imposing an adequate protective duty. Coffee growing is essentially a small man&#39;s industry. </para>

                        <para>- It certainly does not enter into household consumption to such an extent as do sugar and tea. In the case of sugar we have decided to pay a high price to encourage the industry. The same reasoning as led us to do that applies with the same force to coffee. As we have made an effort to encourage the industry I am not going to allow the money we have determined to spend to be thrown away. Seeing that we are engaged in framing a Tariff that will stand for some time, I wish by my vote to assist in proving whether or not it is possible to produce coffee in Australia, and I feel that the industry cannot be established unless we grant this additional protection. </para>

                    <para>. - What surprises me in the debate on this question is the attitude of senators holding views such as are entertained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I have always understood that many prominent members of the Labour Party were honestly opposed to the raising of an enormous revenue through the Customs. There has been since the establishment of Federation a heavy duty on coffee, and that duty will continue to be for many years a heavy revenue-producing one. Even the most sanguine believer in protection and our own industries will not say that for many years hence Australia will produce anything like as much coffee as we require for our own use, and so long as she fails to do so this will be a heavy revenue-producing duty. That, from my point of view, means the heavy taxation of the consumers of coffee, to whatever class they belong. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. The printed statement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has referred is in many respects erroneous in regard to the recommendations of the free- trade section of the Commission. This item, of course, involves to some extent that of the bounty on coffee. I can conceive of one set of circumstances in which I should be found voting for a bounty; I Can almost go further and say that I should welcome an opportunity to vote for a bounty if it would lighten the burden of taxation and enable an Australian product to be obtained at a reasonable rate as compared with the price at which the same article could be fairly sold elsewhere under good wages conditions. I have always felt that such a state of affairs would justify the bounty system, and if I could be shown that it would result, I should be willing on more than one occasion to vote for a bounty. We have agreed to the payment of a bounty on the production of coffee, and we admitted in doing so that many years would elapse before that bounty would produce any possible result. </para>

                        <para>- In all probability it will be six years hence. If I could be fairly shown that, as the result of the operation of this bounty, Australian producers would some years hence be enabled to grow coffee under fair conditions and sell it at a reasonable price, I should be prepared to advocate its continuance, and, if necessary, an increase of it. But it is largely because a bounty has been granted on the production of coffee that I shall vote to make coffee free. I cannot see why protectionists should not do the same. I could understand a protectionist saying, &#34; Owing to the operation of the bounty, coffee can be satisfactorily produced in Australia, but, even so, let us impose a duty until we know that it is not going to be imported.&#34; But I cannot understand any honorable senator, relying solely on protectionist arguments, saying, with the fact staring us in the face, that this duty is nothing more nor less than an iniquitous revenue impost, that, he is prepared to vote for it. It used to be one of the tenets of protection that it was desir-able to impose heavy duties on things which could be made or produced in Australia; but protectionists were altogether indifferent as to the imposition of duties on goods that could not be produced here. Some would go so far as to say that goods which could not be produced -here ought not to foe taxed.  This item seems to belong to that class of commodities which protectionists should hesitate to tax. It may be said that those who are not protectionists consider that a duty on such an item as coffee is desirable ; but my opinion is that we should remove the burden ot taxation in respect of such items. I shall be found supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> in his request that the item be made free, and, indeed, shall support any motion to remove the burdens of taxation imposed by this schedule. </para>

                    <para>. - The argument addressed specially to protectionists by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is that this is a revenue duty. It is true that in the first instance, in most, if not all, of the States, this tax was imposed for revenue purposes, and had it been proposed, at that time, to abolish it, I, for one, as a protectionist, should certainly have voted against the duty.; but it would be strange for a protectionist, who has had imposed upon him, against hrs will, possibly, for many years, a revenue duty, to vote for its abolition just as it was becoming incidentally protective. That is the position. The duty on coffee, for a number of years, has been incidentally protectionist. It certainly produces revenue, but not a very large sum. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know the percentage, but the quantity of coffee used in Australia is not very large. I heard the Minister of Home Affairs say that it was equal to about \ lb. per head of the population, so that the - people&#39;s consumption is so small that this impost does not fall heavily upon them as <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> tax. The point that I wish to make in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> appeal to protectionists to abolish a revenue duty, is that this duty, which is still largely a revenue one, was, in the past, completely and only a revenue duty; but that it has now become, in some degree protectionist, and that it would, therefore, be wrong for &#39; protectionists  10  abolish it. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise as much to ventilate a complaint I have against the members of the Tariff Commission as for any other purpose. I believe that the members of neither section of the Commission did their duty in connexion with this question. Had they made recommendations according to the evidence placed before them, the free-trade section could not have recommended a revenue duty of 3d. per lb., nor could the protectionist section have recommended a similar duty from a protectionist stand-point. The evidence given by all the witnesses proved that a duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee had lamentably failed to effect any protective purpose at all. Tariff reform was urged as much for the purpose of removing anomalies as for anything else, and I hold that the duty on coffee, having been shown to be an anomaly, should be removed. It is of no value in encouraging the development of the local coffee industry. I base my opinion on the question not only upon the evidence given by the witnesses who appeared before the Tariff Commission&#39;, but upon the years of experience of the industry we have had and the position it occupied some five years ago. The imposition of a duty on coffee was inconsistent with the attitude which we adopted in abolishing the duty on tea. because no reason can be urged for the abolition of a duty on tea which would not apply with equal force to the abolition of a, duty on coffee. </para>

                        <para>- I still contend that if we afforded the same amount of protection to the production of tea as we have given for the production of coffee, tea might have been produced quite as successfully as coffee. Five years ago, we were told that by the imposition of a duty on coffee we should assist an established industry in Queensland. It is true that the industry was established, but only in, a very small way, and to such an extent as to be hardly worth considering. Representatives of Queensland in the Federal Parliament urged with great ardour the imposition of a duty on coffee. They said that the industry was growing, and would continue to grow, and that all that was necessary to bring about an industry in Queensland and in other tropical portions of Australia in the production of coffee as extensive and important as the sugar industry was the imposition of a protective duty on the article. AVe took the Queensland representatives at their word on that occasion, and in&#39; one of those spasms of generosity which has been on more than one occasion displayed towards Queensland industries, Parliament imposed a duty of 3d. per lb. on the commodity, representing a protective duty of something like 33 per cent. What has been the result? Notwithstanding the fact that in the meantime it has had thrown open to it the whole of the markets of Australia, and has been backed up by a bonus of &#163;12,000, the industry is to-day practically at the stage which it had reached five years ago. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had my experience in this Parliament, he would take a different view of this question. I have been through the stage through which he is now passing. I have had my moments of generosity in the granting of all kinds of assistance to these industries. We have given every encouragement to the coffee industry, and the production of coffee, so far from increasing, has been decreasing. We now produce only about 100,000 lbs. of coffee annually, and in a few short years the industry will probably disappear, whilst the consumers of coffee in Australia &#39;are being saddled with an annual burden of ,&#163;30,000 of unnecessary taxation for revenue purposes only. As a; protectionist, if I saw any reasonable prospect of the establishment of a valuable industry, even at such expense to the people of the Commonwealth, I should do what I thought necessary to establish it, but I should be a fool if I shut my eyes to our experience in connexion with this industry. If &#39;we were dealing with the matter for the first time to-day, and knew nothing of the history of the industry in the past, I could understand honorable senators being prepared to extend to it a generous measure of protection. But honorable senators who call themselves protectionists should consider their position and whether they are likely to forward the doctrine they advocate by attempting to foster an impossible industry. We might just as well impose a duty to encourage the production of orchids at the North Pole as a  duty to encourage the production of coffee in Australia. I am talking in no parochial sense, because in the northern latitudes, of Western Australia the country is as suitable for the production of this article as is North Queensland. </para>

But I can assure him that in attempting to foster the production of coffee in Australia we are fostering a hot-house industry. The figures prove that beyond all doubt. Every year since Federation has seen a decline in the production of coffee in Australia, and yet in spite of that experience we have honorable senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> prepared to continue this unnecessary taxation upon the consumers of coffee in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If we can do no better with them than to raise the miserable quantity of coffee grown at present in Australia at a cost of&#163;30,000 a year to our people they will be of no use to us whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred to the sugar industry as though it were on all fours with the coffee industry. In view of the fact that the coffee industry produces only 100,000 lbs. of coffee annually, while we consume in the Commonwealth in the same time 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee, the comparison is ridiculous. I hope the Committee will see that it is high time we applied something like common sense to these taxation proposals. In my opinion the bonus of&#163;12,000 offered for the assistance of this industry will afford it ample protection, and I believe that the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will not tolerate this proposal to impose a burden of&#163;30,000 a year upon them for its benefit. We have extended generous treatment to this industry in the past without any good result, and it would be lunacy to carry our generosity to it any further. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that it is time the protectionist members of this Committee considered their position. It is time they recognised that the primary industries of the Commonwealth are as much entitled to protection as are other industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has told us that the coffee industry has had the advantage of a protective duty for several years, and that nothing has resulted from it. May I remind him that Mildura has enjoyed the benefit of protective duties for the past twenty years; but it is only during the last few years that that district has emerged from leading strings. . Some honorable senators do not appear to recognise that it is not a very easy thing to induce the inhabitants of a country such as Queensland to abandon pursuits in which they are engaged in favour of industries which spring from the soil. </para>

Our action would thus have a bad moral effect. We talk about taking over the Northern Territory, but unless we are going to protect tropical industries, what- are we going to do with that Territory? Apart from the fiscal aspect of this question, coffee is an article which yields a large amount of revenue in every country in the world.

He forgot, however, that the corresponding  beverage, which we all so greatly enjoy - I refer to tea - has always been regarded as one of the greatest revenue-producing articles in  free-trade  as well as in protectionist countries. We have placed tea upon the free list, and I see no reason why coffee should not be included in the same category.

                            reference to this impost as a revenue duty has cut the ground from under his own feet. If it be a revenue duty, he, as an ardent protectionist, ought to be ready to see it modified in the interests of the consumers, so long as the general Tariff, produces sufficient revenue for the necessities of the Commonwealth. Personally I regard it - as it is regarded by the Queensland representatives - as a protective duty, which is intended to encourage the production of coffee. In this connexion. I recall the fact that very recently we had before us a Bounties Bill. Parliament was asked to authorize the payment of bounties for the encouragement of a series of natural products, including coffee.

                        <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is bursting with knowledge, but I ask him to withhold it for a moment. It is a fact that we had before us a proposal to authorize the payment of a bounty for the encouragement of coffee production. That proposal was resisted upon two grounds. One of these was that a duty of 3d. per lb. was already operative upon raw coffee, and that such ah impost ought to be ample for the purpose of encouraging its production. Most free-traders, whatever their views regarding the Tariff, are willing to admit that if there is to be encouragement of local industry and natural production, it is fairer that it should be given by means of bounties, falling upon the general taxpaying community, than by means of duties falling upon the immediate consumers. One objection to that bounty was that there was no necessity for an expenditure of &#163;1,500 a year to encourage the industry, as there was a heavy duty of 3d. per lb. in the Tariff. That objection, however, did not prevail, but there was another very material objection. I do not question what has been put before us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> who is familiar with what is going on in Queensland, but this is not a product which is at all congenial to any part of Australia. That was the great objection I took to the bounty being given. I propose to remind honorable senators of the report of the experts on the subject. It is monstrous to say that we are to shell out money with both hands - to pull out the general taxpayer&#39;s pocket and empty the consumers&#39; purse also - for the purposes of an industry which is condemned by the experts who went into it. In their report they give the quantity and value of the imports of raw coffee, and state - </para>

                <para>The. records available of Australian experience in coffee growing are by no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at 9d. per lb. - which is allowed to be a fair average price - the return would not be more than &#163;10 per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. </para>

I do not know how much revenue will be taken out of the pockets of the people in that time by the duty, but the bounty will be payable as well. If we are really to be guided by reliable information placed before us in regard to possible production in these matters, we cannot with any reliance upon facts support a duty of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- It- is true that the honorable senator did then make an effort to reduce the duty upon the manufactured coffee as against the other, but he accepted - I do not know whether he did so without demur or not - the duty which remains. I propose to do that to-day. The discussion which has taken place has at any rate enabled me to locate myself with regard to the methods by which a protectionist may be defined. We have had different designations of him for many years. We have had the scientific protectionist, the discriminating one, the reasonable one, the moderate one, and the new one. I have always had great difficulty in knowing exactly where one brand of protectionist terminated and another one commenced, but to-day&#39;s discussion has brought out an entirely new brand - the geographical protectionist. I welcome his appearance, because there will never be any difficulty in determining what kind he is. If you know the particular geographical locality from which he comes, you know exactly what view he will fake. Frequently during, the discussion on the Tariff we have had protectionists contending that, quite irrespective of the present condition of an industry, a duty ought to be put on if it could be shown that there was any possibility of the industry being started in Australia. As a free-trader I altogether deny that, but it is strange that those arguments come from protectionists from those States which happen to be the consumers of the particular article which it is now proposed to tax. </para>

The prospects are that, if the industry is to be established, it will first be in Queensland; and I understand why representatives of Western Australia view this subject from the point of view of a State where, for many years, coffee is not likely to be produced. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that such is the case around Cairns. From the protectionist stand-point I do not see that any harm would be done by allowing the raw material to come in free. A large number of people are employed in drying, crushing, and preparing the coffee for market, while others are engaged in the necessary printing, packeting, and distributing. No employment would be lost in this respect by placing the commodity on the free list, but would rather be increased. We have been told that the coffee industry exists in the Northern Territory, and I should be glad to think that that is a fact. I am satisfied, however, after a visit to that part of Australia, that, although land was given free or at a very low price, and coollie labour was employed, the industry had to be abandoned. </para>

                        <para>- Because black labour was employed. There is ample evidence that there are large tracts of country which may be devoted to the sugar industry, whereas we have no evidence that every effort has not been exhausted to secure land with the peculiar qualities necessary for coffee cultivation. Statistics show a falling off in the production of coffee, and I think I am right in standing by my motion that the item be made free. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot understand the attitude of some honorable senators who declare themselves to be protectionists. When considering an item the other day I pointed out that in a particular industry there were only forty people employed, &#39;and I was at once told that protection ought to be extended, because more would be employed by-and-by. In the case of coffee it is admitted that 400 find employment, and that good coffee is produced ; indeed, to my own knowledge coffee has been grown in Queensland for twenty years. However, the Tariff did not afford sufficient protection against the product of the cheap coloured labour of other countries. I am not an out-and-out protectionist, but I believe in extending a moderate amount of encouragement to all industries; and, as I voted for a bonus on  coffee, I shall support a duty of 3d. per lb. Honorable gentlemen who all along have voted for protective duties seem prepared in this instance to throw protection to the wind. It seems to me that had coffee been grown in their States they would have supported the duty. I am prepared to vote for protection where I think it is needed, no matter what State may be benefited. I am not ready to vote for prohibition, but I shall assist in giving proper protection. It has been said that very little ground is available in Queensland for the growing of coffee; but in the Cairns district alone, hundreds of thousands of acres are suitable for coffee-growing, and in many other parts of the State there is land well adapted to the industry. I hope that the request will be negatived. </para>

                        <para>- I have not a statement from them. My information comes from one of the most reputable merchants in Australia - a gentleman whose name has been identified with the commerce of Sydney, through himself and his deceased father - for at least sixty years, and whose name may always be mentioned with respect and confidence. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R. Love. It is clear that this duty is positively needless, because the makers of chicory are selling it at a price materially less than the duty. If the duty were 3d. per lb. we should find that the selling price of 4&#189;d. would represent exactly the duty and the price of the article in London. That is a much more rational proposition than to put on a duty which in itself is in excess of the selling price of the article, to say nothing of the cost. With a duty of 6d. per lb. an article worth&#189;d. per lb. should be sold at the very least for 8d. per lb., in order to pay the expenses, but we find that it is sold at 4&#189;d. I submit that the duty is out of all proportion to the value of the article, being no less than 400 per cent. If chicory is imported in a liquid form one is paying for water as well as chicory. I suppose that the article&#39; in liquid form is not more valuable per pound &#34;in the leading market of the world - London - than the article in dry powder. I move - </para>

                        <para>- - The duty which we have just passed will apply to chicory that comes under the designation of &#34;chicory raw and kiln-dried.&#34; The duty which is now under consideration will apply to chicory and coffee known as &#34; roasted or ground; in liquid form; or mixed with milk or other substance.&#34; When the Tariff of 1902 was being framed there was circulated a table showing the duty on each item in the States prior to Federation. In Victoria there was no duty on chicory or raw .coffee, but on kiln-dried, roasted, or ground coffee, and coffee in liquid form there was a duty of 3d. per lb. It was the same in regard to chicory. There was no duty on raw chicory, but there was a duty of 3d. per lb. on kiln-dried, roasted, or ground chicory, chicory In liquid form, or chicory mixed with milk or other substance. Of course in New South Wales there was no duty on coffee or chicory in any form. In Queensland there were duties ranging from 3d. per lb. on raw coffee and chicory to 6d. per lb. on the article manufactured or put into liquid form or mixed with milk or other substance.  In South Australia also there were varying duties. &#39; In Tasmania there were, duties on different divisions of the item - 3d. per lb., 4d. per lb., and 20 <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> cent. In Western Australia there were duties ranging from 15 per cent, to 3d. per lb. That I think all goes to show that even if we had decided to admit chicory and coffee, or either of them, duty free, we would still be justified in imposing a duty on coffee or chicory in the form referred to in paragraph  b  of this item, because, in order to convert the raw coffee or chicory into a usable article some industry must necessarily be established to bring about that conversion, and some employment must be thereby given. Obviously there is a distinction between the raw and kiln-dried article, whether coffee or chicory, and the article designated in paragraph  B and that is the justification for the action of the Government in proposing a duty of 3d. per lb. on the raw product and a duty of 6d. per lb. on the finished article, whether it be chicory or coffee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has referred to the proportion which the duty bears to the price of the article.  His  statement has reference probably to raw chicory. If the chicory which is sold at 4&#189;d. per lb. comes under the designation in paragraph  B and is not raw chicory, it clearly goes to show that the duty of 6d. per lb. has not raised the price of the article to the consumer by that amount, inasmuch as it has been sold at something less. The competition from internal production is sufficient to keep the price of the article below the amount of the duty. But I am inclined to think that the price of 4&#189;d. per lb. must be charged <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> raw or kiln-dried chicory. In any case I hope that honorable senators will see that there is sufficient justification! for the differentiation in duty between the article as designated in paragraph  a  and the article as designated in paragraph  b. </para>

                <para class="block">Coffee in liquid form is an article that is used in almost all the smaller settlements of Australia. Every country storekeeper keeps coffee and chicory in bottles, to&#39; be sold to settlers and people round about who have no other way of obtaining coffee in this form. I contend that there is no occasion for increasing the duty. But there is really a combine in Melbourne, the members of which make one or two articles of this kind, and who are anxious to keep out importations. But there is no need for the dutv,because the quality of the article is very difficult to keep up, and we get a chance of obtaining a better article  if  some is imported. In any case,  if  we increase the duty to 6d. per lb., we shall inevitably increase the price, whereas  if  we leave  it at  5d., as  it  was under the old Tariff, the price will remain the same to the consumer. No reason has been given for the increase of duty, and  it  is merely proposed because  it  is in the interest of one or two small manufacturers. The larger manufacturers are not concerned with  it,  because a very small factory would be able to supply the whole needs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.-I hope the Committee will not agree to the request submitted by the honorable senator. If I understood him rightly, at the close of his remarks he said that very little of this commodity was needed to supply the market. I trust that honorable senators will see that  it  is desirable,  if  we are to affirm, as we have done, not only  in  connexion with this Tariff, but otherwise, the policy of protection to the industries of this country , to make something like the proposed difference between the two classes of goods dealt with in the item. We can fairly leave  it  to our own people to convert raw coffee and chicory into the preparations to which reference has been made in the paragraph under discussion, and our own market can easily be supplied by our own manufacturers. I therefore hope that the Committee will see the wisdom and justice of adhering to the item as it stands. One of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission was that there should be a duty of 5d. per lb. on coffee and chicory, with an exception in the case of coffee mixed with chicory &#34;or other adulterant,&#34; in respect of which the Commission recommended a duty of 6d. The Government did not think it desirable further to complicate the coffee duties by having three lines with respect of them-one of 3d., one of 5d., and one of 6d. - thinking that it would be more satisfactory to all concerned that we should only have two divisions - a duty of 3d. on raw and kiln- dried coffee, and one of 6d. on all others. </para>

                    (New South Wales) introduced, it was doubtless necessary to have the two separate paragraphs, a and c;. but now that it is proposed to have an all-round duty in respect of them, it seems to me that all these details are unnecessary. I would, therefore, suggest that before the schedule leaves the Committee, the Government should consider whether it is not advisable to&#39; embody the two lines in one.

                    <para>. - If agreed to as proposed to be amended, the paragraph would involve the catching and curing of the fish on the same ship. I think that what was originally intended was that while the boats engaged in fishing should remain at sea, a tender should go round amongst them, and the fish caught from them should be cured on the tender. As it stands, the item -would provide for that, but if altered as suggested by the Minister of Home Affairs, it would not. </para>

                        <para>-  Yes it would. As the paragraph stands, it would be possible for fish caught from a vessel that was not an Australian vessel to be admitted free if cured on an Australian vessel. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    than perhaps appears at first sight. The proposal made is that if an Australian vessel going, I presume, outside our territorial limits catches fish which are then brought to Australia, they are admitted duty free. That is certainly the desire of every one, and they should be admitted free, whether cured on the vessels or after they are landed in Australia. If that is our intention, the paragraph does not meet it. What it says is -
                </para>
                <quote>
                    <para> Fish of all kind caught from .... any Australian registered ship. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is not sufficient to secure the free entry of the fish. It must not only be caught from an Australian registered ship, but cured on an Australian registered ship. Is that wanted ? If this industry is likely to be established in Australia at all, it is very much more likely that fish caught at some distance from the shore will be brought rapidly to factories on the seaboard, and no one desires to impose a duty on such fish. I suggest that some revision of the wording is necessary. Fish of all kinds caught from Australian vessels should have free entry into Australia, whether cured at sea or not. We must all recognise the difficulty and sometimes the danger of drafting provisions in the Chamber, and I suggest that the Minister should postpone the item, or, if he prefers it, that we should let it pass as it stands, with the understanding that the difficulty will be looked into. </para>

                        <para>- No smoked New Zealand blue cod is imported. It is all smoked here. The cod is caught in New Zealand, brought here fresh, and cured here. What I propose would not injure Australian fishermen in any way, because there is no fish found around the coast of Australia that is suitable for smoking except the barracoutta. That is rather a poor fish, and visits our coast very intermittently. After being seen in our waters the barracoutta go away, and are not seen again off our coast for months. The admission of fresh New Zealand blue cod would not interfere with the smoking of barracoutta. New Zealand blue cod is in very general use in Australia at the present time, and we have no fish in our waters which can be substituted for it. My proposal would not interfere with labour in the Commonwealth in any form, since the cod is really gutted and cleaned in New Zealand, and all the labour of curing, smoking, and preparing the fish for food is done in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I am. There is a large consumption of this fish in Melbourne, and this city is also the centre of a distributing trade carried on with the other States. I have no desire to reduce the duty on smoked fish, but to give effect to a proposal which will lead to an increase in the number of persons employed in the Commonwealth. At this hour of the sitting, I do not propose to speak at length on the subject, though I might say a good deal more in support of my proposal. I should like to know if the Government are prepared to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- What I propose would not affect them, but to exclude fresh New Zealand blue cod would be to deprive our people of a desirable food. Our fishermen require not protection, but that the industry in which they are engaged should be carried on under proper conditions, and supervision. It has never yet occupied the position that it should occupy, but the remedy for that state of affairs is a matter for State regulations. To impose a duty on fresh New Zealand blue cod would not help our fishermen in any way, whilst it would be injurious to the consumers of the article in. Australia. I should like the Minister to say whether he is prepared to accept my request? </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to say that I do so in deference to the strongly expressed wish of a number of honorable senators who have public engagements to fulfil. Honorable senators are aware that our Tuesday sitting is an innovation, and, of course, it is my duty, as far as possible, to consult their convenience. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than the taking of divisions in a thin Committee. In granting this concession, however, I have asked my honorable friends to give me their assurance - which they have done - that they will endeavour to facilitate the passing of the Tariff as soon as possible. I admit that the progress which we have made during the past week has not been as satisfactory as I should have liked it to be, but upon their assurance that reasonable expedition will be observed in the future, I have pleasure in submitting this motion. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>
                    (New South Wales) &#91;4.12&#93;. - I must oppose this motion. Last week, it was specially arranged that we should meet on Tuesday next, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not know his own mind upon the matter from one week to the next, where are we? I, for one, have made my arrangements to stay in Melbourne over this week end, and to attend here on Tuesday, next. But the Vice-President of the Executive Council, after telling me to-day that he could not spare half-an-hour to enable a Bill to be passed which would grant a few small sums to widows whose husbands had been killed, or had died whilst on duty, in the Commonwealth service, now proposes to set aside the consideration of the Tariff for twenty-four hours. He was absolutely indignant at my suggestion this morning that its consideration should . be deferred for only half-an-hour. After all his declarations as to its urgency, and of his burning desire to proceed with it, to the exclusion of every other subject - without anything more than the private communications made to him - he blandly proposes an adjournment over Tuesday next. Of course, I do not know how many honorable senators have approached him, but I suppose that if next week somebody else desires an adjournment until the following Wednesday, he will grant it. If this motion be carried,, I give him notice that I desire a similar adjournment in a fortnight&#39;s time. With whom does he make these private arrangements ?

                        <para>- Because there was a general desire that honorable senators should be enabled to keep the engagements into which they had entered- without any knowledge that an additional sitting day was to be proposed. This afternoon, however, the position is entirely reversed. We specially arranged to re-assemble on Tuesday next, but that arrangement has now been departed from at the private solicitation of some honorable senators. I shall&#39; vote against the motion, because we are not by such adjournments getting -on with the business of the country and getting the Tariff out of the way in order that there may be a change in a certain direction. </para>

                    in opposing the adjournment over Tuesday.  The Government are making a serious mistake. The gentlemen whose convenience they are apparently studying are those who have taken up the whole of the week in obstructing the passage of the Tariff. We have dealt with only about twenty items this week. As those who have done most of the talking cannot be here on Tuesday next, the Government ask for an adjournment over Tuesday, so that we may have a still greater waste of time when the business is called on again. Like
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline>
                    I have made arrangements to stay here, and cancelled my berth in the train to-day, because I understood that we were to meet on Tuesday. I strongly object to this adjournment being sprung upon us at this late hour. If I had known of it yesterday, I should have been&#39; on my way to Adelaide this afternoon. Unless we get on very much faster- with the Tariff, then, instead of finishing it before the nth March, we shall not be half way through, and the session will probably last until nearly Christmas. I hope a number ot honorable senators will object to the Government playing fast and loose with the Senate in this, manner. When we reassembled the Vice-President of the Executive Council proposed that we should sit on four clays a week, in order to get through the Tariff quickly.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    asked that that should not take effect this week, because some senators might have made engagements for the Tuesday which they could not very well cancel. Now, however, when every one expected that we would meet next Tuesday, and arrangements had been made accordingly, the Government back right down to suit the convenience of one or two prominent oppositionists

                    <para>. - Whatever tactics <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> may adopt in. entering his protest against- this adjournment, I am sure that he expresses the opinion of many other senators. No doubt the adjournment will very much convenience a number. Perhaps, if we adjourned over the whole of next week it would convenience the majority of us. But we are here <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> study, not our own convenience, but the interests of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Strong complaint has been made about the uncertainty  existing through finality not being reached with regard to the Tariff, and if no greater progress is made with&#34; the schedule than has been made in the last three or four days, we shall probably be here for a considerable period. But the more frequently we meet, the greater certainty will there be of the .Tariff being completed within a reasonable time. No doubt, before the Government agreed to this adjournment, the pulse of senators was felt. I was approached and I then said that, we ought to consider, first, the interests of the Commonwealth. Arrangements have been made by certain senators to return to (heir homes this week. </para>

                        <para>- Senators from other States are also concerned, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> pointed out, the Government proposed, when we met last week, that the Senate should sit four days this week, and only agreed to forego the&#39; Tuesday on it being pointed out that some honorable senators had made business arrangements for that day. There was no reason this week, seeing that the intentions of the Government were well known, why honorable senators could not have completed their business arrangements without asking for a further adjournment, which will delay the business of the country. There has been ample time to make any necessary arrangements, and no justification can be found for an adjournment until Wednesday next. </para>

                    <para>.- With many other honorable senators, I have refrained almost entirely from speaking this week, in order to help on the. business. I am disappointed that the arrangement entered into last week has not been carried out. It would be very much better if we forewent the Tuesday sitting altogether. The time has been taken up by a few senators, some of whom have spoken at great length, while others have refrained from speaking in order that the business might be pushed on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is perfectly right. This adjournment until next Wednesday has been granted at the request of a few senators, and if a few others want an adjournment next week until the following Wednesday, they cannot fairly be refused. If a quorum can be obtained on Tuesday, the Senate should meet on that day. The country is crying for an early settlement of the&#39; Tariff question, and yet, although we have managed to deal with only eight or nine items this week, it is proposed to abandon a day. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not like to place the leader of the Senate in a dilemma, but I think he has acted rather short-sightedly in not ascertaining the feeling of honorable senators before submitting this motion. In common with several others, I have refrained from speaking in order to save time; and it is evident that because we remain silent we are to be ignored in any arrangement of this kind. I resent that sort of treatment. I have assisted the Government as far as possible; and, in my opinion, I think they have deliberately departed from a well-defined arrangement. The country expects us to make rapid progress, and yet, in our second week, we propose to shorten our sittings by one day. Certain honorable senators, I - understand, have made representations to the Government ; but I knew nothing, of the proposed adjournment over Tuesday until the motion was submitted a few moments ago. Honorable senators on all sides ought to be consulted in such matters, and one or two ought not to take upon themselves to speak for the whole. </para>

                    <para>- - Sometimes a little reasonable concession to the desires of honorable senators leads to expedition instead of delay - a fact that is well known to those who have any experience of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie suggests that there has been a breach of faith, and urges that the feeling of honorable senators ought to have been ascertained before the motion was submitted. But the honorable senator has heard his leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> point out that he was one to urge an adjournment over Tuesday in order to meet the convenience of certain honorable senators j and surely a request of an honorable senator in the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> ought to be assumed to be in accord with those who are associated with him. We can make progress only, by maintaining a friendly and kindly feeling amongst honorable senators. If honorable senators represent that they have engagements which it would be_ difficult and inconvenient for them to forego, and if they give their assurance to do whatever they can to expedite public business, it would be extremely injudicious on the part of the leader of the Senate to offer objections, and thereby, perhaps, create dissension, which would lead to more delay than is represented by an adjournment over Tuesday. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret the necessity for this discussion, and sympathize with the Vice-President of the Executive Council in&#34; the position which he finds himself. I was not aware of any compact with the honorable &#39; gentleman to adjourn over Tuesday until the- motion was submitted ; and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I resent any such treatment. We have not to consider the convenience of honorable senators, but the convenience of the people of the Commonwealth. I am not altogether in agreement with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> because, on reference to the journals, I find that honorable senator recorded as absent on several occasions during this session. Apart from that, however, I consider that every opportunity was  given to honorable senators when the motion was submitted a little time ago by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to the days of sitting. . We did not sit last Tuesday because certain honorable senators had not made arrangements to stay in Melbourne, and now we are asked to concede another day, though I do not know by whom. Any arrangement there may be was entered into without my knowledge or consent, and, so long as I am here, I shall claim a voice in such matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> suggests that an adjournment over Tuesday may be the means of expediting the business, but I do not see how that can be, for a da.y lost cannot be regained. I should much prefer to meet every Monday and Saturday ; and I shall oppose the proposed adjournment. </para>

                    <para>. - Whatever view we may take of the motion, there is no desire on the part of any one to intentionally misunderstand matters or to be unfair. I may say that it makes no difference to me personally whether or not we meet on Tuesday, because I have made arrangements to remain in Melbourne over the week ends while the Tariff is under discussion. But the fact that I have made my arrangements ought not to prevent my extending consideration to other honorable senators. It is only seven or eight da&#39;ys ago since we decided to alter the days of sitting: which have ruled ever since we have been a Senate. Those honorable senators who reside in Melbourne may say that it is an easy matter to adjust oneself to the altered arrangements in that brief time; but, as a matter of fact, the very reason which caused us to decline to meet on Tuesday last is a good reason for not meeting on Tuesday next. We did not meet on Tuesday last because there is a desire to give every honorable senator reasonable time to make such arrangements as will enable him to. attend the meetings of the Senate. The question now is whether any representations have been made that the time is not sufficient ; and I shall mention a case in point. There are certainly four, if not five, honorable senators under engagements, made prior to a week ago, to. go to Tasmania this week, and they cannot possibly return here until Wednesday next. There are other . honorable senators who have also entered into .similar engagements. Had those engagements been made since we decided to alter the date of meeting, there would be no obligation to consider the honorable senators in question ; but, under the circumstances, I -think the same reason which prevailed in regard to last Tuesday  hold good in regard to Tuesday next, lt might be said that this sort of thing could continue indefinitely ; but the whole &#39; question would be what was a reasonable time to allow honorable senators in which to make their arrangements. It has been represented that one section or one member has asked for this adjournment, but at least a dozen have expressed the opinion that it is either impossible or greatly inconvenient for- them to attend on Tuesday. In a small assembly like this, the absence of eight or nine members makes a big difference, and the absence of three or four &#39; senators from the same State places that State iri a very unfortunate position. Furthermore, if we met on Tuesday with a sparse attendance, and divisions were close, an attempt would be made later on to secure recommittals. </para>

In considering them, we shall probably in the end save time, because those who would in any case be absent on Tuesday next, would probably; if they felt displeased with the decisions then arrived at, move for recommittals. </para>

I only desire to state, in reply to the inquiries of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock, and other persons who are interested, that I re-affirm every statement I then made as to the conditions that existed during the period of which I spoke. And, in reply to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock as to why I did not report the matter, I want to say that I have spoken of it publicly in Victoria on many occasions, and if I omitted to notify the factory inspectors I might plead that at the time I was ignorant of the age limit in the Factories and Shops Act, which I thought was fourteen, and not sixteen years. At that time I was a very young man, and might be excused for my want of knowledge. The conditions I described did exist, and if those whom I have challenged are prepared to take up my challenge I am quite willing to get statutory declarations from many persons working in the factory, which will prove up to the hilt the statements I have made. </para>
