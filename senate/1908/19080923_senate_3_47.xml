            <para>- We are being supplied with very valuable statistical information by that very efficient officer the Commonwealth Statistician, and I should like to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, without notice, how that information is ultimately to be furnished to honorable senators - whether as part of the parliamentary papers or in a separate form. The reason why I ask the question is because we have not yet received the bound copies of the parliamentary papers for last session. It would be a great convenience, I am&#34; sure, if this valuable information could be supplied separately in a bound form. </para>

            <para>- I am not quite certain as to what particular publications from the Statistical Department my honorable and learned friend is referring to. But there are supplied to the members of both Houses monthly bulletins concerning trade, finance, and other matters of that kind. I know that in another place exception has been taken to the quantity of the information, but if any member of the Senate or the other House is prepared to make a suggestion as to a form in which it could be supplied with greater advantage, I am sure that it would be received and considered most favorably. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honorable senator&#39;s questions is as follows :  -  1 and  2.  No scheme for the unification of railway gauges has been submitted so far as I am aware, although several proposals for adjusting rolling-stock gear to meet the break of gauge have been mentioned. The matter is one for the consideration of the State Governments, the railways being their property. The Commonwealth Government will, of course, welcome a solution of the present obstacles to rapid intercommunication. </para>

          <para>I do not remember any measure which has received the same amount of investigation, criticism, and revision as the Bill which I am now submitting to the Senate. First of all, it was prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston,</inline> an acknowledged expert, and a man of ability and experience of the subject with which it deals. Subsequently, the draft Bill received the competent attention of the late Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Kingston, and thereafter it was introduced into this Chamber for the first time by exSenator Drake. The matters comprehended in the measure were of such a farreaching and important character that, in consonance with the expressed wishes of Parliament, the Government of the day referred the Bill to a Navigation Commission. That Commission was engaged many months investigating the provisions of the measure, and took a considerable volume of evidence affecting the many important principles embodied in it. Later, the Bill, together with the very comprehensive report of the Commission, was referred to the Imperial Shipping Conference. That Conference was held in London in May,  1907,  and was of a thoroughly representative character. It included, not only British Ministers of the Crown, but also Commonwealth Ministers of the Crown,a representative from the ship-owners, another from the seamen, a third from the engineers, and also some acknowledged official experts of great ability and experience. </para>

              <para>- As a result of the deliberations of the Imperial Conference, certain resolutions were come to, and, together with the proceedings of the Conference, they have been embodied in the blue-books placed before honorable senators for their perusal. The Government recast the Bill in the light of the investigations to which I have referred, and I had the honour, in September of last year, to introduce it and to explain its provisions in moving the second reading. Pressing business, of which honorable senators are aware, precluded our proceeding any further with the measure last session. Since that time the Bill has received further attention and consideration from the British Government and the Board of Trade. It will be my  duty a little later to deal with the criticisms and exceptions taken to the Bill by them. </para>

              <para>- We have the right to legislate for ourselves as part and parcel of the British Empire, and with due regard to Imperial interests. My chief reason for thus describing the ordeal through which the measure has passed is to remind honorable senators that the criticisms and objections to the measure apply <inline font-style="italic">to,</inline> perhaps, not more than one-tenth of the provisions of this very lengthy Bill. I trust that the fact that neither the Navigation Commission, the Imperial Conference, nor the Board of Trade have taken any objection to, roughly, nine-tenths of the provisions of the Bill, will be helpful to honorable senators in their consideration of it. These provisions, for the most part, are those under which the shipping industry has been carried on throughout the British Empire. They have proved to be beneficial and mutually advantageous to the Motherland and to her Dominions over the sea. When introducing t he Bill of last session, I dealt somewhat comprehensively with the various and important fundamental features of it. To-day I do not propose touching, to any great extent, any of the matters I then alluded to. It will, however, be necessary to make reference to the constitutional aspect of the measure, to deal very shortly, I hope, with the criticisms and objections of the British Government and the Board of Trade, to show how we have dealt with those objections, and then to touch upon a few of the leading principles of the measure. It will be noticed that in clause  2  it is provided that - </para>

          <para class="block">I frankly admit at the outset that that new provision has been inserted having regard to certain recent decisions of a majority of the High Court.

              <para>- Exactly. It may therefore be advantageous to draw attention to the corresponding sections of the American Constitution. Article 1, sub-section 3, of section 8, declares that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States. That provision follows the lines of section 51 of our own Constitution. But the American Constitution does not include, in express terms; - as does ours - the provision contained in section 98 which, as I have already .pointed out, expressly enacts that the power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping. Then subsection 18, of section 8, of the American Constitution vests Congress with power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested&#34; by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Departmentor officer thereof. The only other provision in the American Constitution bearing upon this matter is contained in Article r,. subsection 6 of section 9, which provides - </para>

              <para>- Undoubtedly. Our legislation is subject to the assent of the King, and to the power of disallowance under certain conditions by the King in Council. But we must necessarily rely upon the interpretation placed upon the American Constitution, by very high judicial authority, for a knowledge of our rights and powers under our own Constitution. I have, therefore, made a few notes of cases which, I trust, will be of assistance to honorable senators by enabling them to appreciate our legal position. Assuming for the purpose of argument, that &#39; 1 navigation and shipping&#34; are limited by the words &#34; among other countries, and among the States,&#34; I still contend that our legislative power is not &#34;confined to ships engaged in Inter-State trade and foreign commerce. It  is clear, from my reading of these cases, that we have power to make laws in regard to navigation and shipping, so far as InterState trade and commerce are affected. That is to say, our power includes jurisdiction over ships and seamen, control of the navigable waters of the Commonwealth, and of all ships which use those waters. It also incidentally covers everything necessary to the exercise of that power. I have a short note here of the case of <inline font-style="italic">Gilman</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Philadelphia,</inline> which is reported in <inline font-style="italic">3 Wallace,</inline> page 724, There it is laid down that &#34; the power to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States which are accessible from a State other than that in which they lie. For this purpose, they are the public property of the nation, and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress.&#34; As in the United States, the laws relating to navigation, shipping, and seamen, are based on the plenary powers of Congress, so in the case of the Commonwealth we claim full power to legislate on the whole subject, so far as navigation on the high seas or the navigable waters of the Commonwealth are concerned. </para>

It has been held,, moreover, in America, that the Federal law as to even the limited liability of shipowners was applicable to ships engaged inthe domestic trade of a State. Then, as regards wages, there is the important case of <inline font-style="italic">Patterson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Endora,</inline> 190- United StatesReports, page 176, where the Federal law prohibiting advances to seamen without limitations was held to be constitutional. The vessel in that case was engaged in foreign commerce, and the Court left open&#39; the&#62;question as to the applicability of the section in case of a sailor serving wholly within a State; but in view of the decisions of the Courts on analogous questions,, there can be little doubt that the section would, if the case arose, be held to apply. It will therefore appear from this, statement, and it is a fact, that in framing the navigation laws of the United States, founded upon the limited terms of its Constitution, Congress has exercised practically the same power in regard to navigation and &#39; shipping as has been exercised by theMother Country. </para>

The former section enables Colonial Legislatures to repeal any provisions of the Act with certain exceptions, but the repeal has to be confirmed and assented to by the King in Council. I do not think that in any portion of our Bill we purport to expressly repeal any provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, but section 736, which was very useful indeed before Federation, gives power to regulate the coastal trade, subject tu certain limitations. We do not rely upon the provisions of that Act at all, but upon another Imperial Statute, namely, the Charter of our Constitution.&#39; So that the official and the Minister were under a serious misapprehension in regard to our constitutional powers. </para>

It is true that if we read the resolution itself it is technically capable of the construction which has been put upon it ; but, having regard to the debates and to the other resolutions, it is conclusive that the meaning which the official seeks to attach to the resolution is not justified. It is headed :t Vessels to which Colonial conditions are applicable,&#34; and it reads as follows - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the vessels to which the conditions imposed by the law of Australia or New Zealand are applicable should be (a) vessels registered in the Colony, while trading therein and (4) vessels wherever registered while trading on the coast of the Colony. That for the purpose of this resolution a vessel shall be deemed to trade if she takes on hoard cargo or passengers at any port in the Colony to be carried to and landed or delivered at any port in the Colony. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If we have regard to the other resolutions of the Conference,, where in some cases as to British or foreign vessels it is affirmed that certain conditions shall, be made to apply, and where in other cases it is specifically stated that this particular condition shall only be made to apply to vessels registered in the Commonwealth, or vessels engaged in the coasting trade thereof, it is quite clear that no such meaning can be attached to resolution No. 9, as is sought to be attached thereto. Such a thing was never suggested at the Conference, and would not for one moment have been listened to by our representatives. To give an illustration of what I mean, I shall pick out resolution No. 4^ which refers to the accommodation for the crew - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the conditions imposed bv  Australian  or New Zealand laws, as regards accommodation, ventilation, and conveniences, should only apply to vessels registered in those Colonies, or engaged in their coasting trade. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That resolution was passed unanimously by the Conference. But my honorable friends will see that it specifically picks out certain conditions in regard to certain matters that can be made to applyto this limited class of vessels. And so, if honorable senators go through the resolutions one after the other, they will see that, by reason of their adoption, it was never contemplated that we were to be limited in our application of our own laws to our own coastal vessels, or to vessels registered within the Commonwealth. I would, moreover, point out that the Statesthemselves, prior to Federation, had power to deal with most of the various mattersthat, are referred to in the memorandum of the official of the Board of Trade. Those very things as to which he takes exception to the Commonwealth legislating, in regard to foreign-going vessels, the States themselves had power to legislate upon, and exercised that power. Is it to be suggested for one moment that theCommonwealth has less power than theStates had ? Is it to be suggested for onemoment that: we are invited to surrender any of our powers? Any such proposition! is too absurd for serious consideration.. Further, I would point out that the very powers that are objected to by the official&#39; have actually been assented to in regard to New Zealand. </para>

              <para>- There are reasons&#34; why it should not have been made public. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not understand the interjections of my honorable friend. The Prime Minister, in his despatch, states that he desires to call attention to two passages in the document which accompanied the despatches of the Secretary of State, which, he says, is phrased in ai manner &#34; absolutely without precedent in all the correspondence which has taken place between the Imperial Government and the Government of the Commonwealth.&#34; He then refers to the concluding words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Howell&#39;s memorandum. - &#34; No question can arise as to withholding assent when the measure is finally passed by the Commonwealth Parliament&#34;; or, rather, the implication contained in that phrase; and the abrupt declaration contained in the note on clause 369 - &#34; This is a limitation of the power expressly given by the Imperial Act, and cannot be agreed to.&#34; The Prime Minister goes on to say that as such passages occur in a memorandum forwarded by the Secretary of State, they are presumably indorsed by him, but that it was hoped that the fact was that they were transmitted without their being closely examined, and that the natural presumption as to their indorsement was not well founded; and he points out . that our Constitution is also an Imperial Act, as much as is the Merchant Shipping Law itself. He admits that according to the terms of our Constitution, our laws- have to be assented to by the King, and may, under certain circumstances, be disallowed; -and then he goes on to say that &#34; at the present stage Ministers do not regard it as necessary to discuss these well-accepted constitutional principles, as they trust that on reconsideration of the expressions to which exception is taken the Secretary of State will see his way to withdraw from them the official indorse ment apparently conferred by his despatch.&#39;1 I venture to say that the indiscreet phraseology which has been used has not been intentional, but is rather the result of inadvertence. But still, it is a class of phraseology to which this Dominion has not been accustomed, and to which we are not prepared to listen, when coming from an official whose remarks have evidently been overlooked by the Secretary of State. </para>

              <para>- Yes, the reply is on its way.  . It is now my duty, in accordance with the promise which I made, to explain to the Senate the objections which were taken to the Bill of last session, and also to explain how they have been dealt . with in the measure now before the Chamber. The first objection was in regard to the definition of the term &#34;freeboard.&#34; They stated that the definition in our Bill was rather that of &#34;clear side,&#34; than of &#34; freeboard &#34; ; and, on looking into the matter further, I am advised by our experts that the objection is a sound one. It has therefore been agreed to. The next objection is to our definition of &#34; desertion,&#34; or rather to the first part of that, definition, which renders a man a deserter if he has been absent without leave from his ship for a period of fortyeight hours. The objection taken to this definition is that it is contrary to many decided &#39;cases. We are aware that it is contrary to many decided cases. It was intended to be contrary, and to over-rule them. The singular feature of it is that the definition which we have adopted is the very definition, and in the exact words, which has for some years been in the New South Wales Seamans Act, Section 3. It has been in force for the last ten years. Then, in regard to clause 23, which deals with the employment of uncertificated persons as officers, the objection taken is that it is &#34;more stringent than the corresponding provisions of the Imperial Act,&#34; and it is ^ suggested that the provisions should apply oonly to ships registered in Australia, and ships engaged in the coasting trade. That suggestion we have not agreed to. We consider that it would be unfair to our ships that are registered here. In other words, it would take away a safeguard. If the suggestion were adopted, it would be competent for ships trading, say, between Australia and India, that were not registered in Australia, to carry uncertificated officers, whereas it would be necessary for ships registered in Australia to carry certificated officers. We consider that that would operate to the disadvantage of vessels registered here. In our opinion, the natural and sound view is that which requires that we should have certificated officers in our ships, because that affords some guarantee as to the competency of the persons who are placed in charge. However, there are so few vessels that are not under the control of certificated officers that there is, perhaps, not really very much in the suggestion; but we cannot see our way to concede it. The next objection is taken with regard to clause  35,  which deals with the rating of greasers and firemen. The objection is that the clause contains provisions which are not in the Imperial Acts, and that for the sake of uniformity it would be desirable that this clause should be applied only to ships registered in Australia and ships engaged in the coasting trade. This we have not done. It is thought, in regard to the engagement of seamen in Australian ports, that there should not be any difference of practice between different ships. As to clause  39,  which deals with agreements to be entered into with seamen, it is objected that it should be limited to ships registered in Australia and ships engaged in the coasting trade if the words &#34; approved by the superintendent &#34; are retained, as those words are opposed to the principle laid down in the Imperial Act that stipulations not contrary to law may be inserted in an agreement. This we have not conceded. Clause  39  of the Bill provides as to agreements to be entered into, and as to the form of those agreements, and in sub-clause  3,  paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> we say that the agreement shall be - </para>

              <para>- It is limited strictly to agreements entered into on the Australian coast. The difference of practice in ships in the same trade is what we are providing for, and we do not interfere with any agreements entered into abroad. Clause  53  of the Bill deals with the obligation as to the seaworthiness of vessels. The objection taken to that is that it does not contain the proviso given in the corresponding section of the Imperial Act, section  458 (2)  (a). It is urged that this omission might cause misunderstanding, and it is suggested that the proviso should be inserted. It is quite true that the clause does  not contain the proviso in section  58  of the Imperial Act, which reads as follows -  Nothing in this section - </para>

              <para>shall subject the owner of a ship to any liability by reason of the ship being sent to sea in an unseaworthy state when, owing to special circumstances, the sending of the ship to sea in such a state was reasonable and justifiable. </para>

          <para>We contend that it would never do to insert such a proviso in our measure. It would make the provision as to the seaworthiness of ships too elastic. We consider that the provision must be strong and not unduly wide. We say, moreover, that practically the objection is met by the provision of the Bill which limits the requirement to &#34; all reasonable means.&#34; We say. that the owner or master of a vessel has to take &#34;all reasonable means &#34; to insure the seaworthiness of his ship ; and it is considered, under the circumstances, that no other proviso is necessary. Then in regard to clause  55,  which deals with the discharges of seamen, it is &#34; presumed that the forms used under the Imperial Act will be included amongst those which are prescribed under the Australian Act.&#34; There is not the slightest intention of departing from the forms used under the Imperial Act unless some extraordinary circumstances make it necessary in a few cases to do so. We are thoroughly imbued with the necessity for uniformity in regard to our merchant shipping laws so long as they fit in with our own local conditions. The next objection is in regard to section  61,  which provides that no discharge is necessary on immediate re-engagement. It is objected that this as it stands is contrary to the provisions of section  31  of the Merchant Shipping Act  1906,  and that this should be safeguarded.. We have agreed to this by sub-clause  3  of clause  61,  which pro- vides that that section shall not apply to the case of seamen shipped in the United Kingdom. The Board of Trade&#39;s memorandum proceeds - </para>

            <para>Clause 64, which prohibits advance notes&#39; in Australia, is at variance with section .140 of the Imperial Act, and it is suggested that it should be applied only to ships registered in Australia and ships engaged in the coasting trade. </para>

          <para class="block">We have not done this, because the feeling in Australia, so far as it has been formulated, and certainly the strong recommendation of the Navigation Commission, are against the further continuance of the system of &#39; advance notes, recognising that they conduce to the nefarious practice of crimping which has .been carried on, unfortunately to too great an extent, in our ports. Moreover, we are strengthened in this view by the fact that in the United States advance notes have been abolished. </para>
          <para>Clause 65. - It is suggested that the amount which may be allotted should be limited in the same manner as under the Imperial Acts. </para>
          <para class="block">This refers to allotment notes. It is quite true that in several of the .provisions of our Bill a seaman is liable to certain deductions. We have accepted the suggestion of the Imperial authorities, and have limited the allotment to one-half. The remaining one-half, we submit, allows ample room for the deductions, if any have to be made. </para>
          <para>Clause 71 (4) provides that the Minister may disallow deductions from seamen&#39;s wages. Under the Imperial Acts (with the exception of the power given to Superintendents to decide minor cases under section 137 of the Merchants Shipping Act 1894, a power which is reproduced in clause 77 of the Bill), no such authority is given to any executive officer, and all questions as to wages which are not decided by the Superintendent are left to the Court. It is suggested that it would be desirable that a similar course should be followed in Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">We do not agree to that proposition. We consider that the Minister here practically takes the place of the Board of Trade. </para>

            <para>Clause 84, which deals with compensation for premature discharge, la not 111 accordance with the corresponding provisions of the Imperial Acts. </para>
            <para>Sub-clause 1 is not limited, as is section 162 of the Imperial Act, to cases of discharge occurring before the commencement of the voyage. It would also limit the amount of compensation obtainable for a wrongful discharge at any period of the voyage to one month&#39;s wages.  Sub-clause 2 would impose on ship-owners an obligation to repatriate discharged seamen which may in some cases be in excess of the obligation imposed by the Imperial Acts; and to that extent is at variance with resolution 9 of the Conference. It will be remembered that section 32 of the Merchants Shipping Act 1906 applies only to cases of discharge at ports out of His Majesty&#39;s Dominions. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We have adhered to the clause in its previous form, because it makes for a definite compensation of one month&#39;s pay being granted to the seaman, which in our opinion is better than having the matter left open, so far as his claim is concerned. The real objection, I think, is to a provision in our Bill, whereby the seaman is entitled to a passage to the port of discharge. </para>
          <para>Clause 96 contains provisions as to desertion, and it is not clear that this clause when read together with clauses 64 and 101 gives full effect to resolution 18 of the Navigation Conference. </para>
          <para>It will be remembered that under the Imperial Act (section 140) advance notes are allowed ; and it is important that full effect should be given to that part of resolution 18 which provides that deserters shall be placed on board British ships at the request of the captain. </para>

There is no corresponding requirement 111 the Imperial Act, and the regulation which requires candidates for Masters&#39; and Mates&#39; certificates to have a knowledge of first aid does not come in force till April, 1908.

          <para>Clause 185 - Applies Part IV. of the Bill, which deals with questions of safety to all ships, British or foreign.

          <para class="block">This suggestion we have agreed to in a modified form. In the first place, we provide that a steam-ship, in respect of which a certificate of survey has been granted by the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom, shall, whilst that survey remains in force, but subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, be exempted from survey under this Act. Subsequently, we declare that any person authorized in writing by the Minister may, at any time, inspect any British or foreign ship which is exempt from survey under this Act. The Minister may, upon such report, cancel the exemption, and upon such cancellation, the vessel shall be liable to survey. It will thus be seen that the certificate of the Board of Trade is taken to be <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> correct, but, if special circumstances arise, and the discretion of the Minister prompts the idea that a special survey of any vessel is desirable, it is competent for him to order that survey to be made - </para>

          <para>Clause 279 defines the ships which are to be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade, and exempts for the present ships ordinarily carrying mails between a port in Western Australia and any other port of Australia. The ship-owners urge that this exemption should be extended by deleting the words &#34; ordinarily carrying mails to and from the Commonwealth.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">That provision has been altogether recast, and it will be my duty to deal with it more fully a little later. But I may say that we have not conceded the objection urged. </para>
          <para>Clause 285 is intended to regulate the wages paid on a ship which has been in the coasting trade after it has left those limits. Clause 288 provides the means for enforcing this provision. It is suggested that these clauses should be deleted. </para>
          <para class="block">This clause, as originally drawn, was not intended to regulate the wages paid on a ship after she has left Australia, but it was intended to prevent the provisions of clause  283  being evaded by a subterfuge. The clause has been recast. It now provides that if, by reason of having paid an increased wage in Australia, a reduction is made outside of Australia, the increase is to be deemed not to have been paid, and it will then be competent for seamen under such circumstances to recover the money due to them on the return of the ship to our territorial waters. </para>
          <para>Clause 289 gives power to exempt foreign ships engaged in the coasting trade from the requirements as to licences. If licences are freely granted to foreign ships on condition that they comply with the same requirements as are applicable to British ships, the Board nf Trade are of opinion that it is unnecessary lo provide for any exemption, and the possibility of such exemption being granted has aroused considerable apprehension among British ship-owners. It is therefore suggested that the clause be omitted. </para>
          <para class="block">This has been done by section  289 <inline font-style="italic">(b).</inline> Under no circumstances could the Commonwealth confer an advantage upon foreign ships over British ships. Clause  290,  and the following clauses of Part VII., deal with wreck and salvage, and also with the observation of treaties. On looking into the provisions, we found that the words were somewhat too restrictive, and therefore .we provided for the proper observation of treaties by clause  414. </para>
          <para>Clause 369 prohibits the recognition of an officer&#39;s certificate which has been cancelled in Australia, and returned by the Board of Trade under section 474 of the Imperial Act. This is a limitation of a power expressly given by the Imperial Act and cannot be agreed to. </para>
          <para class="block">Our reply to that is that we have not done it, and that we, with very great respect, insist upon the provision as it stands. If, for example, the High Court, consisting of five judges, has after full deliberation seen fit to cancel an officer&#39;s certificate, we do not agree to the proposition that it should be competent for the Board of Trade - practically its President - to restore that certificate and permit the officer to come and trade upon our coast. What we say is that, whilst a ship is on our coast our laws will have to be observed, and if a certificate has been cancelled by our High Court we are not going to recognise any certificate which may have been granted by the Board of Trade. </para>

Suppose that for some reason or other his certificate was cancelled by a Court of Marine Inquiry, that an appeal took place, and that ultimately our High Court determined that his certificate should be cancelled. Suppose further that he appealed to the Board of Trade, and that it practically said that the man should have his certificate restored. When fie came back ito our shores we should not recognise that certificate granted in violence of the decision of our High Court, because to do so would be derogatory to its status.

              <para>- Yes. In pursuance of my promise to honorable senators, I have dealt in detail with, I think, every objection or exception taken by the Board of Trade. I have also indicated the reasons which have prompted the Government either to accede to or to reject the Board&#39;s suggestions, and, of course, I have drawn the attention of my honorable friends to various clauses, so that when they are reached the exact form which they shall take will be a matter for discussion. We were anxious to meet the objections of the Board of Trade whenever we could do so fairly and reasonably, and where,in our opinion, they had made out a case for alteration. But it is for us, in our discretion, to settle the form which theprovisions shall ultimately take. The only other important matter I desire to deal with is the question of the coastal trade. I admit at once that the provisions in that regard are viewed by some persons as perhaps the most important features of the Bill, and certainly they are open to the greatest amount of controversy. Our coastal trade is a valuable and ever increasing one. Speaking subject to correction, I think there are about  200,000  tons of shipping engaged in the Inter-State trade alone. The regulation of the coastal trade is dealt with in Part VI., from clauses  277  to  289.  On this subject, the Navigation Commission made three recommendations - </para>

              <para>- No. In seeking  to  protect our coastal trade, we are following the example of all the nations of the world, with perhaps the modern exception of Great Britain. There are very few nations which permit foreigners to interfere with their coastal trade, and practically in those cases some special arrangement as to treaty relations exist. Let me give some examples. In the case of the United States the coastal trade is confined to ships which carry the American flag, and which have been built in that country. It is a very extensive coastal trade, because it comprises the whole of the east coast, right round CapeHorn, the whole of the west coast, thence to Honolulu, and thence to the Philippines. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to Russia, among other countries,, to show the care which is exercised by all nations of the world, save Great Britain, to have. preserved to their own people and ships their coastal trade. In the case of Great Britain, it is true that all protection was swept away in 1854, but the position on her coast is an extraordinary one. Whilst British shipping is excluded from the coastal trade of other nations, heavily-subsidized foreign ships are competing on the British coast with British ships. </para>

He admits what I havesaid, and, in fact, that was the evidence given before the Royal Commission which  was appointed in 1902.. The evidence is that 10 per cent, at least of that trade is done by foreign ships, and that a considerable proportion&#39; of that percentage by heavilysubsidized foreign ships. He says that that position is intolerable, and urges that it should cease ; and that foreign ships should&#39; pay for the privilege of trading on thecoasts of the Mother Country. He suggests a means of protection following largely on the lines referred to in this Bill. </para>

              <para>- Yes; I can supply it; but I quoted that passage in my speech in moving the second reading of the Bill in September of last year. I admit, of course, that in our case there are Imperial considerations. We form part and parcel of the British Empire. But, at the same time, the policy of the Mother Country has been, for a great number of years past, topermit us to develop our own industries in such a way as we ourselves think proper. That is the course conceded to us in theTariffs which we have adopted, previousto Federation by the States, and sinceFederation by the Commonwealth Parliament. In addition to that, there is. I think, a further answer to resolutions &#39;9- and 10 of the Imperial Conference, as likewise to the correspondence which I have already read. Where so much is conceded to us, it is clear that we have thecomplete right to build up our coastal trade in such a way as we think proper. We hold that our industries are not able tocompete with foreign standards of wages ; that in pursuing our White Australia policy, we cannot compete with black crews, and that we cannot compete with subsidized vessels. In addition to that, as was pointed out at the Conference, the cost of the up-keep of vessels in our coasting trade is very much greater than that of deep-sea vessels. We endeavour by the provisions of this Bill to provide additional accommodation, sanitary provisions and other comforts upon vessels trading on our coasts, which will have the effect of making our seafaring life more attractive. We hope by such encouragement to build up a sturdy mercantile marine that will lay the foundation of a naval reserve which must be an important auxiliary of our naval defence. I have referred to the provisions of the Bill relating to the coasting trade. Clause  277  provides that the part of the Bill which it introduces shall, unless the contrary intention appears, apply to all ships whether British or foreign. The conditions under which a ship is deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade are set forth in clause  279,  which follows out the terms of the resolutions of the Imperial Conference. Originally this clause  279,  in obedience to a suggestion of the Navigation Commission, contained the following provision - </para>

            <para class="block">I admit frankly that certain constitutional objections could perhaps validly be taken to the clause in its original form, because of the discrimination between States and parts of States. But the new clause is hardly open to the same objection. There is no room for discrimination in it, because it says that the Governor-General may by order declare as to the carrying of passengers &#34;between ports in Australia&#34; ; which, of course, throws open all the ports of Australia, and attempts no discrimination as between one and another. Of course, I admit that that practice under this clause might be subject to abuse, but at all times it will be under the jurisdiction of Parliament itself. It is competent so far as paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is concerned, to give this concession of exemption to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, whichis under contract to carry mails to the Commonwealth at the present time </para>

But under this clause the class of ships is defined. They are ships which carry mails to andfrom the Commonwealth. So that by that means the order will have specifically to name the class of ships. </para>

          <para class="block">Western Australia and other parts of the Commonwealth, until the western State is linked with the eastern States by meansof a railway system. I have, in explaining the Bill, confined myself to matters of immediate importance. I have not attempted to deal with other fundamental portions of the Bill, which, I quite admit, will give rise to discussion in Committee. But this is essentially a Committee Bill, and one in regard to which I must acknowledge that we have derived very much enlightenment from the labours of the Navigation Commission, and from the Imperial Conference, the reports of which will aid us largely in our deliberations. In conclusion, I would impress upon honorable senators, as the session is to be a short one, that, as regards nine-tenths of the measure, no exception has been taken by the various Conferences and Commissions to which I have referred. In view of this fact, possibly honorable senators may see their way to pass those clauses with very little discussion. </para>
