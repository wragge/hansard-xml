                        <para>- I should like to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question without notice. &#39; It has reference to a statement which appeared in the press recently to the effect that the Treasurer is having prepared an analysis showing the effect upon the revenue of the Commonwealth of the Tariff now in operation. I should like to ask whether my honorable friend can expedite the preparation of- that analysis, and cause it to be laid on the table of the Senate? I assume that the analysis will, of course, show how much of the added revenue is due to the new duties, and how much to the larger importations under all items. </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the answer given by the Minister of Home Affairs, I should like to ask him whether he will draw the attention of the Public Service Commissioner to the resolution passed by the Senate disallowing the regulation, to which reference is made, and. insisting that in the cases referred to payment should be made for overtime? Will the Minister bring that resolution under the notice of the Commissioner? </para>

                            <para>- We are not directly concerned with the employment of any of the men or lads engaged in the Government Printing Office. The matter is wholly and solely within th&#39;e cognisance and control of the State Treasurer. As to the statement which I made to the Senate, and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has referred, I would remind him that I said at the time that, according to the Government Printer, the boys preferred to work at night rather than during the day. I made that statement after making inquiries from the Government Printer, and I gave my authority for it. Nothing further than what he told me was within my personal knowledge. I believe that the strike has terminated ; that arrangements have been made for the lads to return to their employment,, and further, that the State Treasurer has the matter now immediately under his attention, and has agreed in some cases to increase the wages of the lads to the extent of 3s. and 4s. per week more than the amount fixed by the Wages Board. I believe, also, that the State Treasurer is in consultation with the Wages Board on the subject. Fortunately the strike has been, I think, satisfactorily terminated. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the particular statement to. which my honorable friend refers. I have already furnished all the information that I promised. That is to say, a statement has been submitted embodying the Customs rates in force under &#34;the Tariff, of 1902, the recommendations of  both sections of the Tariff Commission, and the importations and duty payments for the year 1906. I understood that my honorable friend desired to obtain complete information up to the end of 1907, but I pointed out to him at the time that its preparation would involve an immense amount of work, and that it would not be so reliable as that for 1906. In addition to that, I have had. circulated among* t honorable senators - and I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must have  received a copy of it - an index to the Tariff which enables one to put his finger upon any particular item immediately. </para>

                            <para>- Order. Will the honorable senator resume his seat? I do not consider that that is a question which he is in order in putting to a Minister. It contains certain allegations against a deceased Sovereign - allegations which are very disorderly, and I cannot permit a question of the kind to be put. </para>

                    <para>Hobart trumpeter in no way competes with blue cod, nor does the importation of blue cod interfere in any way with the sale of trumpeter, because trumpeter is a very scarce fish, and, as a matter of fact, only a few (two to four) cwt. is imported monthly, when it realizes a very high price - from10d. to1s. 6d. per lb. fresh. It is then only used as a boiling fish, and. is never smoked. </para>
                    <para>The yearly catch of Hobart trumpeter would not supply the Victorian requirements . for one week as a smoked fish, therefore, blue cod does not hurt the sales of trumpeter. Barracouta in no way competes with blue cod, nor does blue cod interfere with the sales of barracouta, which at the best is&#39; only a cheap, coarse class of fish, and sold so much per dozen, while blue cod ls fold per lb. Barracouta is a peculiar fish, and sometimes leaves pur shores for weeks and months at a time. What, then, would the smokers be doing? The works would have to close down, whereas the blue cod and barracouta help to keep the works going. Trevalla in no way competes with blue cod, because it is principally used as a boiling, fish, and has been practically non-existent for the past three years. No one can name any other &#39; Australian fish suitable for smoking, and as we have shown that blue cod does not in any way interfere with them,- we again say that there is no fiih in Australia to take the place of blue cod for smoking. </para>
                    <para>Blue cod is sent here from New Zealand in a frozen state, gutted and cleaned only - all the labour necessary for curing and smoking is done in Melbourne, which provides employment to a number . of men, whose wages last year ran into between , &#163;2,000 and&#163;2,500 - as blue cod is forwarded from here to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, likewise Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>.- The concluding remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> show that his object is to have this fish admitted free in order that it may be smoked within the Commonwealth. But the item, as proposed by the honorable senator, goes further, seeing that no provision is made &#39;that the fish may be imported for this&#39; purpose only. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the item proposed by the honorable senator ought to provide that New Zealand cod shall be admitted free only for the purpose of being smoked under departmental bylaws. However that may be, I hope the Committee will not agree to the introduction of blue cod free of duty, whether for consumption fresh or for the purpose of being smoked for market. It is all very well to point out that blue. cod does not come into competition with Australian fish, but we must remember that, not long ago,, steps were taken, by the Government, with the consent of both Chambers, to promote the further extension of the fisheries of Australia. There is a variety of fish caught in Commonwealth waters, and some has been smoked and put on the market. </para>

                        <para>- It is desirable that we should pay increased attention to our own fisheries, and see whether we cannot, by means of the smoking process, place on the market fish quite as good and as palatable as is blue cod. Some time ago steps were taken by the Commonwealth Government to bring about a reciprocity treaty with New Zealand. The terms of the negotiations have been made public, but the New Zealand Government declined to go further; and I suggest that this matter of fish importation is one which might verv well be left over until the resumption of the negotiations to which I refer. If blue cod be admitted- free, why not other fish ? Blue cod does not stand out as strikingly superior to any other fish in the world. </para>

                        <para>- That, of course,, is a matter of opinion; . and, possibly,; some Australian people have had no opportunity, of tasting other fish of their own. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to the fact that only  870  lbs. of blue cod was brought into the Commonwealth last year. That fish, I may say, was introduced in fresh form; and I find, on reference to the, figures, that fish frozen, which includes blue cod, was in the same year introduced to the amount of  927,922  lbs. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There is already a protective, duty of id. per lb. to prevent the importation of smoked fish. The quantity of fresh fish annually coming from New Zealand appears, according to the&#39; figures read by the Minister, to be about  800  lbs. , but probably some is also imported frozen, though the  900,000  lbs. spoken of includes smoked, fish. I do not know to what extent blue cod has been smoked in Victoria. If large&#39; quantities have been smoked here, the industry does not require more protection, whereas if smoking is not done here to any considerable- extent, the smoked cod which is sent from New Zealand would seem to supply all our wants, and to be preferred by the people. There is no reason why we should allow New Zealand fresh cod to be imported free of duty, not to make it cheaper to the people - because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> says it is not eaten fresh - but to assist a Melbourne industry. What about the fish-catching industry? The Australian coastal waters teem with fish, the great difficulty being to get the fish caught. </para>

                        <para>- If the dutv of id. per lb. does not have the effect of increasing the business of the Melbourne fish-smoking establishment, there is no reason why we should give those engaged in that business fresh fish free of duty without benefit to the consumer simply to bring about the smoking here of some part of the 800 lbs. which represents the annual importation of fresh fish. To do so would be to offer a premium for the smoking of fish caught in other than Australian waters. In South Australia a. great deal of whiting and other fish is being smoked, and put on the market in excellent condition, and I am not prepared to increase the protection enjoyed by those who in Victoria devote themselves to the smoking of blue cod. </para>

We  now levy a duty of1d. a lb. on nearly 1,000,000 lbs. of imported fish, which we cannot obtain in our own waters - New Zealand blue cod, a favorite article of food with a large number of persons. </para>

                        <para>- I could understand protectionists voting for an import duty on fish to develop the local fishing industry, but I did not propose to touch upon the fiscal issue, though I am prepared to do so, if it be necessary. I agree with the remarks made as to the unsatisfactory condition of our fish supply. It must be improved, not by the alteration of the Tariff, but by an alteration of the means of distribution, giving a better system of marketing, and making/ it possible for the fishermen to sell direct to the consumers. That being so, I ask what justification is there for a duty of1d. per lb. on an article of food? I cannot see any. In my opinion, no one would be injured by the removal of the duty, and, as I believe that the less it costs to place articles on the market the more cheaply they are sold to the consumers, I shall vote for the removal of the impost. As it stands, I regard it as a revenue duty on an article of diet which is already too scarce; and which I should like to see made more available, not merely to the well-off, but to every home in the land. </para>

It would have been very inconvenient for him to look at the matter from a fiscal standpoint, but, in so far as he did venture to do so; his argument amounted to this, &#34; If we are to protect, it is better to protect the smoking of fish than the catching of fish within Australian waters.&#34; </para>

I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> object is to induce consumers in Australia to eat blue cod without having been smoked. But if the fish is to be eaten in a smoked state he has to recognise the fact that the consumer has very, little to do with the question of introducing blue cod in order that it may be smoked subsequently, and the cost of the smoking, plus the profit, added to his burden. That is exactly what is going to happen and nothing else. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cannot show that I have ever voted for a higher duty. If he is alluding to the question of preference, he is endeavouring to mislead, but he will not mislead either the Committee or myself. Finding myself in this position I shall certainly vote for this item to be free. What I regret is that the proposal is introduced in such a bad way. We are asked to make the article free in order to exalt some local smoking; industry. </para>

I am amused at having to support the proposition made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> He says - &#34;Make the item free in order to help the smoking industry,&#34; and when it is pointed out to him that there are other kinds of fish which are smoked, the answer comes to us, as we might expect - &#34; We do not smoke those kinds of fish in Victoria.&#34;&#39; </para>

                <para class="block">That, of course, is typical of many demands of protectionists. Their whole attention seems to be focussed on Victoria. If only blue cod is smoked here, we must hurry to give the Victorian smoking industry some occupation.

                    <para>I would support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> if 1 believed that it would benefit the consumer to the extent of one farthing. If blue cod is imported in a frozen state or under the cold process, it is not&#39; so good when it is smoked as is blue cod which is smoked within twenty-four hours of capture. The reason why I cannot support this proposition is because very often fish of an inferior description - that. is fish which is very nearly bad - is . salted and shoved into a smoke house and afterwards put on the market. If the article were made free it would offer a great temptation to persons to shove into a smoking room fish which otherwise would not keep half-a-dozen hours. Until people begin to eat smoked fish they do not -find out whether there is anything the matter with it. </para>

                        <para>- No; for the. most part blue cod has been imported in a smoked state. Very little blue cod has been smoked in Australia. I maintain that if the item were made free the blue cod smoked here would be . sold at exactly the same rate as the blue cod smoked in New Zealand -1s. per lb. - and the consumer would not derive any benefit at all from the local smoking of the article. If, however, I thought that he would derive a benefit, I might support the proposition. Unless we have men available to examine the fish when it is imported and to see that it is in a fit. state to be smoked and sold for human consumption, I shall oppose any proposal to remove the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen a good many small smoking stations on the coast of Australia., especially in Tasmania. Let us see how the barracouta is treated. Suppose that it is brought into port on a Tuesday. It is cleaned and put into salt during the day, and smoked on the following day. But fish which is imported from New Zealand under the cold process is treated differently. In Sydney I was poisoned through eating fish which had been frozen and was supposed to be fresh, and I was in the hands of a doctor for about a month. That fish was imported under the cold process, but until I had eaten a mouthful or two I did not know that it was unfit for human consumption. We do not want to give an opportunity for fish to be imported and, when it is on- the turning point, to be shoved into a smoking room and afterwards put on the market. If we are going to let in fish free at all, let us do that with smoked fish. But I cannot vote to put a duty of1d. per lb. on smoked fish and to let ordinary fish in free. </para>

                        <para>- It is very clear to those who wish to understand it. Of course I think that the price of an article is increased by the duty. It is so in this case. But the price of smoked cod will not be affected if we admit fresh cod free. That is the point. Some of my honorable friends sitting near me were under, the impression that the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was to free both smoked and fresh cod. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the meaning of the request now before the Chair is that, whether the cod is going to be smoked or not, it is to come in absolutely free. The people who smoke this fish and sell it will naturally include the 1d. per lb. in their price. </para>

                        <para>- If the consumer would get the benefit of the remission of duty in the case of fresh fish, t would vote for the request. But it is my belief that the people who smoke this fish will take advantage of the duty on smoked fish, and they would be fools if they did not. Therefore, by admitting the fresh fish free, we shall not reduce by one farthing the price of smoked fish to the consumer. I may be entirely wrong, but that is my belief. It is urged that the object of this request is to protect those who smoke blue cod or other fish. Of course, the result of that would be to encourage the introduction into Australia df foreign lish, although bur own seas are teeming with fish. There is not the supply of fish which there ought to be in Australia in proportion to the quantity contained in our seas. I do not say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> put it, that I want a protective duty for the benefit of those who catch fish. But what I do say is that.- if there are two. protective duties, the one which ought to be maintained, according to common sense, is the one which must largely benefit the country by encouraging the catching of our own fish: No one has yet told me, and I believe no one will tell the Committee, that we have not as good fish in the seas of Australia as the cod of New Zealand. I like New Zealand smoked cod. There are many of us whose palates it tickles. But it is a fish for the rich man&#39;s table. The price is very nearly prohibitive. It will not be reduced by carrying this request. I am not to be twitted with being a protectionist because I say that I should like to see the fisheries of our seas developed. As between two things - smoking a few blue cod in Melbourne and developing our fisheries in the Australian seas - there is no comparison whatever as to which is preferable. If it were proposed to take the duty off the smoked article, and thus reduce the price to the consumer, I should support it. </para>

We have fought valiantly sometimes when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was not with us. The honorable senator has, to some extent, brought me back to one of the. essential principles- of free-trade, namely, that food should be as free as possible. If we have in. the country siich an industry as the smoking of fish, why should we not let the raw material come in free? I think that we are trying, upon the whole, to do what is best, both for the people and the fish industry. </para>

                    <para>. -We ought to be congratulated upon this item, since it has been declared to be not only in accordance with_ the. teachings of free-trade, but also a satisfactory protective duty. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that this duty of1d. per lb. is perhaps one of the few directly enjoyed by what are known as the primary producers. It is true that it does not relate to agriculturists, horticulturists, dairymen, or pastoralists ; but fishermen are primary producers in the sense that they are the first to handle the fish. We are asked to deprive them of the modicum of protection proposed to be extended to them&#62; There is perhaps a still stronger reason why we should not encourage the introduction of frozen fish for smoking purposes. Smoked&#39; fish are tasty and desirable, but always more or less risky for the reason that the smoking process conceals in some measure a degree of staleness that might exist. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> ought to. recognise that the primary producers of fish - our own fishermen - would lose, by his proposal, the protection that is offered them. I have often argued that the primary producer gains by the duties that are imposed for the development of manufactures. That contention has to be argued and proved; but if protection is of any value, there can be no doubt that a direct protectionist duty must be beneficial to the persons in whose interests it is imposed. Unlike most of the duties we are imposing, this applies directly to primary (producers. </para>

                        <para>- It is not nonsense. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> that in the matter of fish the State of which he is a representative consumes nothing but tinned goods. The coastal waters of Western Australia are teeming with fish, but the fishing industry there has not been developed, and the people are prepared to accept fish from America and Great Britain. Although we have imposed a duty of1d. per lb. on fish coming from British Columbia, Newfoundland, and other countries, we are&#39; asked now to allow blue cod from New Zealand to come in absolutely free. </para>

                        <para>- With development we should be able to do so. Australian waters are capable of producing any fish obtainable elsewhere. We can obtain in Tasmania salmon as good as can be found in the rivers of Scotland; and our smoked cod and schnapper. are equally as good as any smoked fish from New Zealand. Senator McColl has read a circular addressed to him by those engaged in smoking New Zealand cod. &#39; Some of the men in . the industry have, been &#39;prose cuted for evading the payment of duty, and yet the honorable senator apparently is trying to help them. </para>

                        <para>- It has been reported from time to time that some persons engaged in smoking New Zealand cod were evading the Customs duties, and in certain cases severe penalties have been imposed. The policy of the Commonwealth Parliament has been to encourage the fishing industry, and we have placed on the Estimates a considerable sum to provide for the construction of a trawler to investigate our deep sea fisheries. We have plenty of fish, but fishermen, in at all events New South Wales, Victoria., and South Australia, can place their fish on the market only through middlemen. The fishermen of New Zealand are also compelled to sell their&#39; fish through the agency of the same middlemen, who are sweating the fishermen of Australia. It is absolutely impossible to place any fish upon the Australian market except through middlemen. </para>

                        <para>- It is simply a matter of taste, and sometimes of sentiment. I heard of a man who .was compelled in certain circumstances to eat fish on Fridays. He went to a certain place and inquired, &#34; Have you any shark on the menu to-day?&#34;. The waiter replied &#34; No.&#34; Then the man asked, &#34; Have you any whale? &#34; and receiving a reply in the negative, he said, &#34; That being so, my conscience is absolutely clear. I have asked for fish and cannot obtain it; let me have a rump steak.&#34; . If this request were agreed to it would be detrimental to a big Australian- industry, which has not yet been developed, and needs all the encouragement we, can give it. Instead of offering the industry that encouragement the proposal under consideration would have the effect of giving it a set-back. I believe in affording protection to this industry, which is an absolutely&#39; native one, and I . do not think that the people of Australia would suffer one whit if not a single blue cod were imported into the Commonwealth. We have fish in our own waters, and we have merely to dispense with the&#39; middleman in order to make the industry successful. It is only the middlemen in Victoria to-day who are asking for the free admission of fresh New Zealand blue cod. I regard the proposal as an attempt on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to smother an Australian industry which ought to be encouraged. </para>

                <para class="block">When the fact has been established that suitable fish for preserving purposes are to be found in Australian waters, I shall be prepared to accord this industry a reasonable measure of protection. But we ought not to impose a tax upon the public for the benefit of an industry which is undeveloped.  We have confessed that it is undeveloped, because &#39;quite recently we voted a sum of money for the construction and equipment of a trawler whose special function it will be to exploit Australian waters. I am heartily tired of endeavouring to assist the local fish industry of Western Australia. There, the industry is entirely in the hands of a few foreigners, who do just as they like with the consumer. In Fremantle it is no uncommon occurrence for boats, to come in loaded with fish which, their owners, upon finding that they cannot control the market, again &#39; dump into the ocean.. When a strike was- in progress in Western Australia on one occasion in a certain industry, I recollect that we endeavoured to introduce Englishmen who were strikers into the fish trade there, but we found that all the avenues of distribution were &#39; practically closed to them. The foreigners have formed a very strong ring through which it is impossible to break. New Zealand blue cod is a very popular food, of a special quality, and I am not prepared to tax it. When, however, any genuine Australian industry claims out attention  I shall be ready to extend to it a sufficient measure of protection to enable it &#34;to live. </para>

                    <para>I confess that there is a great attraction about any proposal to give the people cheap food. But I have a very strong objection to fish being smoked here when it is five days old and more. Consequently, I shall have to vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> proposal. It is a common thing - as has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> - for fish after being kept a day or two in New Zealand to be put in the refrigerating chamber and sent to the Commonwealth to be smoked. That practice is one which is against the interests of the consumer. Under the circumstances I shall be obliged to vote against this proposal unless smoked fish, as now proposed in the amendment, is included. </para>

                    <para>- - I have every sympathy with the view that has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> I am&#62; prepared to go as far as possible to permit of the introduction free of duty of fresh food. But, unfortunately, we cannot deal with this question upon its merits. Personally, I feel that my hands are tied bv the fact that some time ago I supported the expenditure of a large sum upon the construction and equipment of a trawler for the purpose of establishing the fishing; industry in Commonwealth waters. But for that fact I should be found voting with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> It is a pity that we should have to impose a tax upon such a fine fish as New Zealand smoked blue cod, which is one of the daintiest that can find a. place upon our tables. But I dare &#39;sa.y that many other honorable senators find themselves in the same position that I occupy myself. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> that, whilst the fishing trade of Fremantle is very much in the hands of Italians and Greeks, and whilst it is true that rings have been formed there, not only amongst the fishermen, but amongst the retailers, there are other places in Western Australia where similar conditions do not obtain. In this connexion, I might cite Mandurah, where a fish-curing factory has been established for some time past. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> has said in regard to the conditions which prevail at Fremantle is perfectly true, but there are other ports in Western Australia to which his remarks do not apply. </para>

                    <para>.- I we have in Australian waters fish suitable for smoking, it seems strange that our local fishermen have failed to discover it during all the years that they have been carrying on their operations. Had we such fish we should not require to incur the expense of importing fish from New Zealand for smoking nurposes. That fact in itself disposes of the assertion that we have fish, which might very well take the place of New Zealand blue cod. If I thought that my proposal would detrimentally affect our fishermen, I should not submit it. But. as. a matter of fact, we are not supplying our own requirements in the matter of fish. New Zealand blue cod is a fish which is smoked in Australia, and its free importation, therefore, cannot detrimentally affect our own fresh, fish supplies. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot vote for the free admission of New Zealand- cod into Australia. I am well aware of the difficulties and trials experienced by the fishermen in Victoria. Years ago I recommended them to form a limited liability company. They accepted mv advice, and- the company has proved highly successful. I realized that for years they had eked out a very miserable existence. &#39; We must recollect that they have to be out night after night in all kinds of weather, and that they have frequently to carry their lives in their hands. Consequently, I cannot vote for the free admission of fish from New&#39; Zealand, especially when I know, as the result of my own observation - and I have lived with them during the past few months - that they have constantly to release fish from their nets because they have not a market for it. </para>

                        <para>- No fish can be good when it is stale. Its quality is greatly improved if it be sold without having been placed upon ice. It deteriorates immediately it is put upon ice. It is a fact that hundreds of tons of good fish have to be returned to the sea because there is no market for it. The reason for this state of things is to be found in the high price which the consumer is charged by the middleman. The latter adds to the price of the fish the cost of his rent. Of course, he! must do that, and also increase the price to the man who hawks the fish round in his cart. </para>

The shares that it was difficult to get subscribers for ten years ago, in the company that I spoke of, are now at a very high premium. If the fish that is now thrown back into the sea were sold at a low rate in Richmond, Collingwood, and other suburbs it would find a. ready market. I also recommended the Queenscliff fishermen to take . advantage of the Bounties Act which we passed, and commence tinning. If that is done matters will be&#39; on a very different footing, I simply rose to show why I could hot vote to allow fish to come in here free. </para>

                        has urged that&#39; New Zealand blue cod should be admitted free, on the ground that &#34;that will help on the protectionist policy of the country. I take it that the duties recommended by the Tariff Commission on fish, and agreed to by the Government, are designed to give encouragement to Australian fishermen. If there is anything in protection, why should it not be extended to the fishermen, the conditions of whose calling, as
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline>
                        has pointed out, are so very precarious? The average fisherman has great difficulty, year in and year out, after doing his hazardous work, in getting sufficient money to pay for the necessaries of life. If we vote to abolish the duty on blue cod it will be highly inconsistent to approve of a duty on tinned fish. The duty is proposed on tinned fish for the same reason that it is proposed on blue cod - in order to keep out of the Australian market as much foreign fish, if I may so term it, as possible. That the duty,. does have that effect is evidenced by the circular read by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline>
                        as supplied
                        <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                        him by those interested in this industry. They state that since the imposition of the higher duty the consumption of New Zealand blue cod in Australia has fallen off by one-third. The object of the duty is to keep out New Zealand blue cod, and it is evidently having that effect-. I cannot consistently vote for the free admission of that kind of fish, unless I follow it up by voting for the free admission even of tinned fish. All that fish comes into competition more or less with Australian fishermen. Not long ago we voted ;&#163;i 0,000 or &#163;12,000 - I daresay it will be ,&#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000 before the work is finished - for the construction of a trawler, and&#39; a large sum of money in bounties for the encouragement of the Australian fish industry, and as this Tariff will probably remain unaltered for a considerable time, it is &#34; up to us.&#34; to recognise that the fishermen of Australia are entitled to that protection which in some degree is being extended to other Australian industries.

Various senators have given different interpretations&#39; of the advantages which are to be derived from the remission of this duty, but I have not heard one yet take into consideration the effect of the duty upon the consumers. The interests of the public are apparently absolutely ignored. We have had the extraordinary statement that fish is fish and that therefore everybody is to eat fish, simply because it is fish, without regard to the different varieties caught under different climatic conditions in different parts of the world.

                        <para>- They are not equal to those exported from New Zealand. It is also strongly asserted that the public cannot obtain fish in Australia because of its high (price, which is attributed to the charges of the middleman. Speaking broadly, there would be very little fish for Australian consumers if it were not in a certain measure for the middleman1. The reason why fish is not consumed in Australia to such an extent as it ought, to be arises to a great degree- from our climatic conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, but that is caused by the climate. Fish caught in the morning is not fit for sale or consumption a few hours afterwards. It is hard enough to keep meat, but fish deteriorates much more rapidly. That fact and the sparsity. of the population to which the fish has to be distributed will for many years prevent the distribution of fish to the people, of Australia at a price that would make it a favorite article of diet. The fish supply will have to be taken in hand under a system such as - that pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> by which the fishermen by cooperation or some other means can distribute the fish to the public the moment it is. caught. I intend to vote for a free breakfast table. . Every article  of food which the public require should be brought to their doors as cheaply as possible. I regard fish as an essential. It is quite equal to meat as a food. In fact, the finest race of people that I know of in the world - the Norwegians- live almost exclusively on fish. Most of them rarely see fresh meat more than once a month. It is my duty to the consumers of Australia to endeavour- so far as possible to enable them to purchase all kinds of fish as cheaply as possible. I shall vote for free fish and other free food whenever the opportunity offers. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to be almost incumbent upon every honorable senator to proclaim his faith in fish. I am not a whale on fish at any time, but I shall support the amendment &#39;moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> I cannot go so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> wishes. We depend entirely upon New Zealand for the luxury known as blue cod. It is to me a tasty morsel, and I do not want to be compelled to eat barracouta in its place. To me a piece of good barracouta tastes exactly like the sole of an old boot, although I admit that it is a question of taste. Fish is really a household necessity, and yet in Australia, great as as the quantity that is caught, and badly off as the fishermen are, no man can say that the public are getting the article at a reasonable price anywhere. </para>

                        <para>- The fishermen do dangerous work for long hours, and get very little money for it. Yet the people of Australia pay considerably higher prices for fish than, they ought to pay, considering the quantity in our waters. If I voted to retain the duty upon smoked blue cod, I should consider that I was simply placing within the reach of those people who control the fish market, now another lever to further increase the price of fish to the Australian consumer. </para>

No reasons have been advanced for any postponement, but I think they are fairly well understood. Personally, I am prepared to go to a division at once. The employers at Mildura are asking for free-trade in labour, and we ought to give them a taste of free-trade in the article they produce; and, if for no other reason, we ought to at once proceed to vote on the item. We have good reason for knowing that this industry is far from being on a satisfactory basis ; and those of us who believe in fair treatment for the workers ought to take this opportunity to teach the producers that the consumers of Australia are not going &#177;0 pay the heavy tax of 3d. per lb. on currants, and, at the same time, permit sweated labour conditions. </para>

Senator Millen has suggested that the Tariff is to be of a permanent character; and, having regard to that fact, is it not undesirable to attempt to come to a decision in the present state cf feeling in regard to the industry at Mildura? It is well known that there is considerable ill-feeling at the present moment; and, under the circumstances, a vote on the item would not be on the merits of the question, but under the coercion of the feeling which exists as between the parties concerned. </para>

                        <para>- No;. I am talking about general principles which have been laid down by some of my free-trade friends, who have said that where they can v ote for a reduction of duties they will do so. On the other hand, a number of honorable senators feel very strongly against the growers of these particular frui&#39;s at Mildura, because of their action towards their employes ; and I fear that, animated by that feeling, they may vote against any further protection. In my opinion, the Committee is not in a fit state of mind to deal temperately with this item. Under the circumstances, I urge that the consideration of . the item, should be postponed to as to enable the parties concerned, without any interference on our part, or without any injustice to the industry, to come to an arrangement, of which I understand there is &#39;some prospect. </para>

                        <para>- Justice can be done to the fruit industry only by dealing with the Tariff proposals on their merits. There are strong protectionists who have said that they will , not support- high duties unless the workers as well as the employers are to benefit, while free-trader&#39;s have stated that if they are to vote for existing rates protection must be given to those who have not hitherto benefited by the protectionist policy. </para>

                        <para>- The Factories Act does not apply to the industry. The Mildura fruit-growers formed themselves into an association to fix the prices of. their fruit, and determined that they would not pay more than9d. an hour for the labour employed to harvest it. On the other hand, the workers&#39; union at first asked for is. an hour, but, after consideration, demanded 7s. a clay for their services. </para>

                        <para>- Although, the unforeseen often eventuates, I am of opinion that it will be settled. I have been in close touch with the workers and growers of Mildura, and&#39; with others in Melbourne who are largely interested in the district, and they all have expressed a sincere desire that the trouble may be speedily ended. I know that at present strong feeling in regard to the dispute exists in the minds of members of the party to which I belong, and if the item were considered now, they might give a vote which reflection might cause them to regret. I hope that the Committee will prevent this possibility by agreeing to the postponement of the item, so that it may be dealt with fairly to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>.- One might look in vain through the record of debates for a statement like that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> since the Tariff question became a live one. A more extraordinary and deplorable statement has never been made by a Minister leading a deliberative body. He practically asks us to postpone the. consideration of this item on the ground that, because of an industrial dispute, we are not in a fit condition to deal with it. Does he speak for himself, or for the Committee? </para>

Would the postponement of an item be asked for if we were considering the duties on boots at a time when there was trouble in a Victorian boot factory? </para>

                        <para>- Under conditions which they thought justified postponement. Those who think that under the. present circumstances it w.ould be most judicious to postpone the consideration of this item are as honest as those who op pose its postponement. I know probably more about the circumstances of this case than do other members of the Committee, because I was recently in Mildura. The trouble there is due to the action of a small minority, and I should be sorry for anything to be done in connexion with the Tariff which would prejudicially affect, hot merely the people of Mildura, but all throughout Australia concerned in the growing of fruit. Although we have been chosen by the constituencies to represent them, we are nevertheless human. Those on the other side have no right to claim perfection any more than has any one on this side. I do not care who the man is, there are- times when his feelings may overcome his better judgment. At such a time we should not do anything which might seriously affect the welfare of any section of the community. It is for that reason that I would like this item to be postponed. What is the suggestion made bv honorable senators on the other side ? It is that we want to hold this item as a threat over some persons. We are animated by no such desire. We wish to act fairly and justly, and to see that no ill-advised action on the part of any one shall do an injury to any industry. Now, Mildura is not the only fruit growing place in Australia. In South Australia, Renmark, Coonawarra, and all the village settlements on the Murray would be equally affected with the fruit growers in Mildura if any unwise action were taken at the present time. I hope that the in interests of not only the workers in Mildura, but also the Producers in all parts of Australia will be safely guarded bv the Committee, and that can be done in no tetter manner than bv postponing this item until a future date. </para>

                        <para>- Is there anything unreasonable in asking for the item to be postponed until a time when it can be temperately settled? It would not be the first occasion on which an item had been postponed here. When I look along the benches on this side of the chamber, I can see one of the reasons why the free-traders are howling so much this afternoon. Half-a-dozen of them want to speak at once. It is difficult for a protectionist to get a chance to speak. To my honorable friends who differ from me, I say, &#34; When vou think you have an opportunity of laying on the whip do it mildly. It is not often that your numbers are so remarkable as they are this afternoon. We appeal to you not to force us to do a thing to-day for which you may be sorry to-morrow,&#34; or, as the old Scotchman used to say, in a toast in the Old Country, &#34; Never let your evening&#39;s enjoyments be your morning&#39;s reflections.&#34; As a true protectionist, I believe in supporting the fruit-growing and other industries. Our request for the postponement of this item is a reasonable one. Let it stand over for a short time until we can see whether the workmen, are to be treated as we should like them to be treated - without sweating. I for one believe that unless the workmen can get an advantage, a duty of 3d. per lb. is too much to expect the working classes to contribute to the revenue upon this item. It is because the duty has a protective object that I would support its imposition-. I do not want to tell the leader of the Opposition how I may act, but it. will be very embarrassing indeed if a protectionist is forced now to vote in a way which he does not like. I appeal to the honorable senator, who has always been so agreeable, to listen to reason, and to allow this item to stand over for a day or two until we get the necessary information to enable us to act wisely and well. </para>

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> asked for this item to be postponed I felt inclined to oppose his request; but having listened to the arguments of honorable senators I now feel inclined to support him. I know that he and my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> have recently paid a visit to Mildura, and. therefore are in a good position to speak with authority in reference to this industry. Another reason why I shall support a postponement of the item is because I notice that a certain amount of heat has been imported into the discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated that we are using this suggested postponement as a threat. He has asked whether we were not elected to consider items as they came before us. We were ; but I remind him that the very persons engaged in the industry with which this item deals are electors who by reason of their votes helped to elect certain senators. It would be wrong on our part to approach the consideration of the item unless we could deliberate calmly. The discussion has furnished ample proof that it would be impossible to-da.y to approach the item in that deliberate manner which is essential to securing a sound judgment. There is another reason why I shall support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> Since it was submitted I have noticed a paragraph in the Melbourne evening paper in reference to the Mildura dispute.

                        <para>- I do not wish to give any one the chance to say that the votes of either Labour senators or those who are opposed to them were irifiuenced. When I noticed the number of honorable senators who were anxious to speak on -the item this afternoon it proved to me conclusively that we could not deliberate calmly. Therefore I shall support a postponement of the item until such time as the industrial dispute has been settled, when it can be considered calmly. This is not the first time on which a request to postpone an item has been made. I dare say that before the consideration of the Tariff is completed honorable senators who are opposed to me in politics may move the postponement of some item, and probably I shall be found supporting them if they can advance logical reasons in favour of its postponement. The fact that the industrial dispute at Mildura is, if I may use the term, <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> is I think a sufficient reason why honorable senators should postpone the consideration of this item until the atmosphere is clear. </para>

Every time I cast a vote for protection it will be cast with the intention of giving equal protection to worker and employer.

The leader of the Opposition will understand that that) is my view. While other senators mav not care to express it on the floor of the chamber I feel sure that it is held by them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Mulcahy.</inline> - That is rather a painful admission to make. It is not a statesmanlike way of looking at the question. </para>

It is a statement which is in keeping with the policy of the new protection. Some senators may not say what. I have said because it is not the sort of thing that they would like to say. here. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> motion. I think he is right in submitting it.&#34; But if the Committee rejects his proposal, and I am called on to vote upon the proposed duty two considerations will weigh with my mind. One is - is this an established industry which is worthy of some protection? If that question be answered in the affirmative, the second question is - is it an industry in which the workers are earning a decent living and which if it grows will develop under conditions that will be likely always to provide a decent wage and fair conditions to those engaged in it? Those two factors will influence me in voting upon the question. </para>

                    if not with other honorable senators, that this is about the most humiliating position in which a deliberative body, and certainly the Senate, has ever been placed. I confess that I share the astonishment which has already been expressed, that the leader of the Senate should fall in with such a proposal as has -been suggested, and should tell the Committee that it is not in a fit state of mind to deal with items in this Tariff which have to be examined and dealt with from a business point of view. I say that we have something else to consider besides a dispute happening in any particular industry. We surely have to save the Senate from having a blot placed upon its reputation, and a blot upon its status. No body of men, certainly not the Senate of the Commonwealth, ought to sit clown under such an imputation as is. sought to he placed upon, us by the Vice-President of the Executive Council.

                        <para>- Not by this Senate? I deny it. I say that there is not a man whom I have heard who would not do justice. I have heard what my honorable friends of the Labour Party have said. It is pure bluff. The Minister thinks because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has said &#34;No settlement, no duty &#34; - because there is a suggestion that if these employers do not yield to the demands of their workmen this duty will be taken away - that he ought to agree to postpone it. But I have a higher opinion of my honorable friends opposite. I should be ashamed to belong to the Senate if it were actuated by such motives. I say more - that my honorable friends ought to be ashamed to belong to a party if that party sought or tried to visit these employers with punishment for what they are doing in maintaining what they consider to be their just rights, by putting oh or taking off a duty which must be imposed or remitted on a different footing altogether. Then what is the proposed course going to result in? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has imputed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others on this side of the Chamber that they say that the action proposed is going to be used as a threat - that it is intended to be a threat. Whether it is so or not its effect will te that of a threat. What will be the result? What have we had said by some of those who have spoken? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said, &#34; No settlement, no duty.&#34; That is telegraphed to these gentlemen at Mildura. You are going to hold a sword in terror over them. Whether you penalize them or. whether you do not, you are going in effect to tell them that if they do not settle this dispute as completely as you would like them to do, they are not going to have this duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question we have to deal with. That is not the reason why the postponement of this item is proposed. It is not proposed in the ordinary way. Items and clauses in Committee are frequently postponed, and if the real reason had not been given for this motion I suppose that the courtesy of honorable senators on all sides of the Chamber would have been invoked. But when the postponement is asked for in order that it may be a sword to be held over the heads of men with whom you disagree, I say that to assent to it would be a disgrace to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is never virtuous, whether it suits him or not. I have said before, and I say again, that I desire personally and expect that the workmen, shall have a fair share of the profit secured by protection. What is more, I welcomed the principle of what is called the new protection as an admission of that for which freetraders have contended as long as freetrade has been known - that the manufacturer under protection pockets all the profit and very often sweats his workmen. I welcome this new protection as an admission and an acknowledgment df the truth of that contention. If duties are raised high it is only fair that the workmen should share in - I will not say . the plunder, but the profit. </para>

I said&#34;You are casting your bread upon the waters in voting these high duties, and expect that it will return to vou in the form of new protection. But suppose it does not?&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I will not tell the honorable senator anything. I took the liberty of uttering that warning ; I am sorry if it was a liberty. I warned my honorable friends that in every line of this Tariff where . they are raising high duties they are simply casting bread upon the waters without having any assurance of the new protection that they suppose they are going to get, or whether they are going to get any that will be valid and constitutional. But they are willing to do that with every other item of the Tariff ; they have been doing it hitherto, raising the duties all round. . But when we come to this particular duty they pause. Why do they not do the same thing with regard to this - wait for the new protection? If they are going to make the duty . 3d. in the same way as they have raised other duties, let them&#39; do it ; and when the new protection comes along I have no doubt that it will be sought to apply it to this as to other industries. The question for us now is whether we shall&#34; keep this duty on or lower it. My honorable friends opposite are reasonable, and I hope that they will not think for a moment that I am going to cast any reflection upon what they have said with regard to the intention ; but I do put it to them in the most serious way that throughout the length and- breadth of Australia to-morrow it . will be seen and admitted that whatever, the intention was the effect is to hold tins rod in . terror over the employers in Mildura. That I say again, is a humiliating admission. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft,</inline> has said that he would not cast, his vote for this duty unless the dispute were settled, and settled in oneway.I do not think that my. honorable friend . did himself . justice&#39; when he made that statement. </para>

                        <para>- That is my opinion as to the effect of it. What we are telling these employers is that if they do not agree to these terms, so much the worse for them. Honorable senators opposite are in- such -a hurry, that they will not trust the promise of the Government about the new protection. They are in such a hurry as to want to introduce it on this particular item, and in a form that will establish a precedent in this Chamber that will be incalculably mischievous. I put it not merely on this ground, but from the point of view of the Senate itself. Are we to make this confession - that in consequence of, shall I say, prejudice, or prejudgment, or anything you like, the Senate is unable to deal with a business item in the Tariff in respect of what the duty ought to be, or are we going to confess to the people of Australia that when we have an opportunity, we shall use any of the items in the Tariff as a weapon to scourge&#39; those who are not giving their employ&#233;s the wages that we think they ought to have? Such a state of things would, indeed, be deplorable. It would be the greatest humiliation the Senate has suffered, and I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council - the leader of the Senate - who is in charge of the honour and dignity of the Senate, and has to guard them as well as to consider the possibility of getting his votes&#39; carried, will withdraw his support of the suggested postponement on the . ground that has been stated, and allow the item to be put. </para>

                    <para>.- It is unfortunate that we cannot discuss items in the Tariff apart from their association with other matters, but I suppose that we are not ideal people, and that outside questions will obtrude themselves. It is likewise unfortunate that this item should have come up for consideration at the present juncture, for we cannot get away from the fact that in voting either for the retention or reduction of the duty, we should be practically taking sides in an &#39;industrial dispute, and giving the victory to one party or the other. We do not desire to be partisans ; we do not wish to interfere with the dispute. That being so, are we to adopt the high ideals which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggested - and no doubt ideally he is right - and possibly do irreparable damage to a community that we wish to help? This duty is a serious matter to the community concerned. It has struggled as probably no other section of the people of Australia has struggled to make a success of a great enterprise, and has met with difficulties of which many honorable senators perhaps know nothing. The settlement was established some eighteen or nineteen years ago, &#39; and the settlers have met with disappointment after disappointment. Their pumps proved to be too small, the salt&#34; came, up in the soil, and various other difficulties arose with the result that many men grew grey in their efforts to make the settlement a success, and to show the rest of Australia that an industry of great good to the Commonwealth could be established there. The settlers are now labouring under the burden of a heavy debt, and we certainly do not desire to interfere in the present dispute. The workers are justified in endeavouring to obtain the best terms in respect of their labour, but we have to remember that the very existence of the community depends upon the decision of this Chamber if it be indorsed, by another place. If the duty be fixed at too low a rate, the settlement will go under; and there will be no revenue for the settlers and no employment for the workers.. They have at present to face the competition of  foreign labour. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> in submitting his proposal, has been actuated by any save the best of motives - an endeavour to get the dispute settled in the interests of both employers and employes. I shall support the proposal to postpone the item, believing that if we dealt with it to-night, we should, as I have said, be taking a part in the dispute that we ought not to play. The item should be postponed until the matter has been settled, when . we should be able to approach its consideration with cool heads, prepared to discuss it on its merits, apart altogether from extraneous considerations. </para>

                    <para>. - The significance of the proposition to postpone the item seems to me to be that we have already passed, with the approval of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and most honorable senators of . the Labour F&#39;arty, exceedingly high duties. Those duties have been agreed to by the Labour Party because of their belief in the policy of the new protection, and because they have accented, so far as I can understand the position, the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that that policy will materialize. If that be so, is it not surprising that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> should cry a halt at this stage? It simply means that the honorable senator, in the clearest possible manner, has intimated to the Government that so far as the wages paid in the currant industry are concerned, he will not place any reliance in their promises with respect to the new protection. Still more extraordinary is the reply of the Government, &#34; Yes, you are quite right. You must not trust us. . Do not rely on the promises of the new protection, but see that the wages in this industry are fair, reasonable, and acceptable to the people concerned.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that any industry is so peculiar as to deserve special treatment in this respect, having regard to the fact that the new protection proposals are intended to. cover every item in which the question of wages is involved. As has been suggested to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> proposition impinges very seriously upon &#39;the Government&#39;s new protection proposals, or at any rate it causes us at once to reflect as to what is to happen. Are we going to quarrel with them, and to prescribe totally different conditions with regard to every industry in the Commonwealth? In other words, are we going- to criticise in detail all the new protection proposals? We are asked to postpone this item until we have ascertained the terms and conditions agreed upon by those engaged in the currant industry. What does that mean? That we are to sit in judgment upon the whole dispute? That the question of payment of fair wages is to be taken out of the hands of the Government? Why is&#39; it to be removed from the general proposals with regard to the new protection? Is the Senate to be the sole judge of what are fair conditions in this particular industry, or are we to decide what shall be the conditions with respect to every one of them? If we are to decide the conditions with respect to all, why do we stop here? Why does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> trust the Government, which he is supporting? The situation is made ludicrous by the fact that the Government are prompting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and&#39; saying, in effect, to him, &#34; Certainly. Never mind our new protection proposals. &#39; We agree with you that this matter should be settled apart altogether from our promise to bring about new conditions of labour in all our industries.&#34; </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    on having so entirely taken charge of Government business that, like the unfortunate, poodle, Ministers have, so to speak, stuck their tails, between their hind legs and retired from active service. But that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    should have absolutely taken charge of Government business at this stage seems to me to require a little more explanation than we have had. Clearly the proposal before the Committee is not only most immoral, but dastardly and unconstitutional. If legislation in the Commonwealth Parliament is to be postponed every time a strike occurs, we shall never do anything, since there is always a strike in some part of Australia If there is not a strike affecting the whole coal mining industry of New South Wales, there is never a day but what there is a strike in one of the mines. Are we to promote industrial disputes?

                        <para>- No. I. said that the finest pepper tree that I saw during my wanderings was located at Swan Hill. I shall certainly vote against the postponement of this item, because the adoption of that course would form a bad precedent and would open the door to everlasting delays in any Tariff matter which might be brought before this Chamber. Further, it seems to me that the proposition actually involves a threat of &#34; No shilling, no duty.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to prolong this debate because I think almost all that can be said upon the question has been said. But I should like to add a little from- my point of view. I dare say that my remarks will not be received with a great deal of pleasure by honorable senators sitting upon the opposite side of the Chamber. In my judgment the Senate began its deliberations this afternoon by being more or less degraded, and in the proposal now under consideration I feel that it is being asked to consent to an additional degradation or humiliation being put upon it. </para>

                        <para>-Whatever opinion may be entertained in regard to the first incident of the day the &#39; Government are certainly now asking the Senate to consent to its humiliation and degradation. That is a course of procedure to which I will not tamely submit. If I understand the functions of this Senate, it has been appointed by the people as one of the legislative tribunals which is to give a final decision upon the most important question that can be addressed . to it, in the interests of the country. In reference to Tariff matters this Chamber is a judicial tribunal, pure and simple. We have been asked by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to postpone the consideration of this item. Why? Because of a popular clamour, with the rights or wrongs of which no one in this Chamber is familiar. I repeat that in our relations to the people in respect of Tariff matters we occupy a similar position to that occupied by a Judge. What would be thought of a Judge who stood up and said, &#34; A popular clamour has been raised outside, a dispute is in progress in relation to the matter which &#39;I have been called upon to decide, and because of that popular clamour and dispute, I refuse to exercise the powers vested in me. I shall consequently adjourn the Court&#34;? Only one of two answers could be given to such a question. Either the Judge would be corrupt or he would be weak. We occupy precisely a similar position. We have been appointed to decide Tariff matters without any intimidation, and in the full light of our knowledge and . conscience. </para>

I can very well understand the position occupied by the Government, and to some extent I can sympathize with them. The party which usually supports them has taken a very pronounced view of this question, and evidently intends to make its discussion a means to an end - an end with which this Senate has nothing whatever to do. We are here to legislate - not to interfere with the law. I sympathize with the Government because I candidly confess that then: is in this Chamber a section which is prepared to take advantage of a situation such as has arisen, this afternoon.&#39; The  fact is that the Senate is being practically invited to take a hand in the dispute in the fruit-picking industry at Mildura.

But there is no uncertainty about the policy of the Government in connexion with this Tariff.. They have given it out that they intend to go in for the new protection. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot quite understand the tremendous anxiety on the part of some honorable senators over this matter. Are they in danger of being converted to some other political faith than that which they have hitherto embraced?- I include in <inline font-style="italic">that</inline> the leader of the Senate with others who have spoken. If this item is postponed it will not have the  slightest effect upon ray vote. I will vote in exactly the same way upon it fourteen days hence as I should if a vote was taken on it in the next three minutes.- I am&#39; not at all influenced, and do not intend to be influenced, by any dispute in connexion with this industry. Still, if some honorable senators feel that they are likely to be influenced, and fear that their knees are not strong enough to hold them up, I am quite prepared to assist the weak-kneed, brethren and to vote for the postponement of the item on that account. It would be terrible to me to think that I had forced upon .the Committee by any vote of mine a decision which would weaken the already weak knees of those who have been arguing upon this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger apparently felt satisfied that he was going to injure some of us on this side of the chamber, and whip us with scorpions. To show us the heinousness of our crime, and the disrepute that we would fall into, if we postponed the item, he asked us what we should think of a Court which, in the midst of its business, adjourned a case in order to do something else. </para>

I remember only a few years ago when a big industrial dispute took place at Broken Hill, not only was the Court adjourned, but the venue was also altered, in order that the Court should be able to come to a decision. How short-lived are the memories of some men regarding the actions of tribunals that have to sit in judgment in industrial affairs ! </para>

                    <para>. - It would indeed be deplorable it the Senate were to be influenced by temporary considerations in the many weighty conclusions that it is called upon to arrive at, because we are legislating, not &#34;for today or to-morrow, or even for next year, but, we hope, for all time. It would be. calamitous if we were influenced in that work by what I might call a transient passion. Whatever happens at Mildura this week or next week will not influence my vote in the slightest. Those who say that it is the policy of the party to which I belong to vote in a certain direction in this matter are sadly mistaken, because I have determined to vote in a certain way on the item, even if there were fifty industrial conflicts in progress at Mildura or elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- The reason, which I agree with, is to allow this item to be considered in a calm, reasonable, and impartial atmosphere, uninfluenced by any consideration that may be easily got rid of by waiting for a day or two. Certain honorable senators have openly proclaimed this afternoon their intention to agree to no duty upon currants if there is no settlement of the dispute. I fully recognise that position, and admire the candour with which it was expressed, but that very attitude is the one which was taken up by the leader of the Opposition in this chamber within the last week, for, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> &#39; J. Russell, dealing with the manufacture of biscuits, was outlining the deplorable conditions that prevailed in that trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> sitting in his place as leader of the Opposition, asked. &#34;Are you going to give a duty to an industry where such conditions prevail ?&#34; Where are we going to draw the line? Will the honorable senator draw a distinction between circumstances which occurred in an industry five years ago and a concrete case which happens to-day?. I merely mention this to show that honorable senators who proclaim their intention of withholding the duty in this case until a settlement of the dispute is effected, are side by side with the leader of the Opposition, who declaimed against that very attitude this afternoon. Coming to the charge of degradation and humiliation - words which there was no warrant for using this afternoon - let us compare the attitude of the accuser and the accused. The Government were accused in unmistakable terms this afternoon of putting the Senate into a position of degradation by acquiescing in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> &#39;s proposal. The position of the Government, as it appears to me, and as it will appear to any impartial man who looks at the matter reasonably, is that they want the item postponed until such time as those honorable senators who are now influenced by temporary considerations are freed from that influence, which will be tomorrow or the day after. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I blame the Opposition. If there is any degradation, it is to be found in the conduct of the Opposition in endeavouring to take a snatch vote on a problem of this kind when men&#39;s minds are not rationally made up. When I use the word &#34; rationally &#34; in that way, I mean that the events of to-morrow or the day after may help those men to express their views more clearly and reasonably. The Government desire to postpone the item until honorable senators can make up their minds in a reasonable way, whereas the Opposition are seeking a mean advantage by taking a snatch vote on the item, because they see that the minds of certain honorable senators are justifiably, inflamed over present happenings in Mildura. I rose simply to compare the attitude of the Opposition with that of the Government, and- to examine as best I could the charges that have been hurled across the chamber. My vote will be totally uninfluenced by what happens at Mildura. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not ask that that item be postponed, and if I am beaten shall be ready to take my gruel. If the honorable senator is frightened of what may be the result of this vote, he would do well to follow my example, and&#39; take his gruel whenever he has to. 1 admit that I know nothing about the dispute at Mildura, except what I have read in an odd paragraph in the newspapers, and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said to-day. It appears that the dispute arises from the fact that the men engaged in harvesting the currants wish for is. a day extra. I understand, that a man can in a day pick about 200 lbs. of currants, though of that I am not quite certain ; but, assuming that to be the case, and that . currants lose 50 per cent, of their weight in drying, therefore, an extra duty of1d. per lb. would mean 8s. 4d. on the day&#39;s picking, as against the extra1s. paid to the picker. It must be perfectly obvious that the employers, if they are like other employers I have known, &#39; are not going to object to paying an extra shilling in wages if it means that they themselves can make an extra 8s. 4d. on each 200 lbs. of currants picked. If we postpone the consideration of this item, it seems quite clear that the employers will concede the1s. demanded, and that those who vote for the postponement will be morally bound to support the duty as it stands. Honorable senators who vote for a postponement cannot blink the fact that if there be a settlement to-night on the basis which has been mentioned, they wilt be morally bound to vote for the increased duty; otherwise we shall practically &#34;slip up &#34; the employers by having held out to them a sort of inducement to settle the dispute on certain lines, and then failing to carry out our share of the bargain in regard to fixing the duty. I do not think that honorable senators realize the great difference there is between the amount represented by the duty and the amount &#39; in dispute as, wages, or otherwise they would understand that there is&#39; no reason whatever why the item should be postponed. I indorse the opinion that we should set a bad precedent if we postpone an item simply because there happens to be a wages dispute ; and, further, I protest against any dispute of a small, paltry local character in the State of Victoria being advanced as a reason for &#34; hanging up &#34; an industry which is carried on over a large portion of Australia. If honorable senators from Western Australia or from Queensland proposed the postponement of an item simply because in one section of an industry there was a wages dispute, I should oppose it as strongly and firmly as I now do the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -1 was very surprised to hear the opinions expressed by some honorable senators in regard to the postponement of the item. We were sent here, not to pay regard to every small dispute that might arise between the various sections of the community, but to frame a Tariff which there would be no need to alter for a number of years. I, as a moderate protectionist, told my constituents that I would not support any attempt to lower duties. But from what has been said this afternoon it Would seem that those who wish to get duties reduced have only to stir up strikes. Personally, I should like the men at Mildura to get 7s. a day, and if my vote could insure their getting that wage, they would have it. But some honorable senators have threatened that if the employers do not give way, they will vote to reduce the duty- <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> currants from 3d. to 2d. per lb., a difference of 8s. 4d. per 100 lbs. of currants. Now, one man might. well be expected to pick 200 lbs. of grapes in a day, which, allowing for shrinkage and loss in the drying and other preparations necessary to.  make them marketable, would represent at least 100 lbs. of currants. Employers would be very foolish to refuse to grant their workmen another1s. a day if, by doing so, they would be certain to lose a protection of 8s. 4d. a day. But the protectionists wish to saddle the whole Commonwealth with the burden of that 8s. 4d. We have been sent here to do justice to all persons in the Commonwealth, after cool deliberation regarding all the circumstances. Would it be fair for us to determine the rate of duty on currants in accordance with out opinions regarding the Mildura dispute? If a duly of 3d. per lb. be the rate which, we ought to impose, let us vote for it, or if -the rate should be lower or higher let us vote for that. But do not let us threaten any section of the community by . saying, Unless you do so and so, we shall take certain action.&#34; A way out of a. difficulty such as that at Mildura would be for small orchardists to let out under contract the work of gathering their crops. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is not right to say that unless the strike is settled in favour of the men the duty on currants will be reduced to 2d. per lb. There are strikes in New South Wales as well as in Mildura, and if this item is to be postponed because of the Mildura strike, succeeding items might well be postponed because of other strikes. There is as much reason for adjourning to-day because of the Queensland elections, or on Friday next, because the honour of Australia will then be at stake, as there is for postponing this item. </para>

The dispute at Mildura will not affect my vote. It will be the same whether the division is taken to-night, to-morrow, or a week hence, unless good reasons are given for changing my opinion. But it will not redound to our credit for it to be known that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has asked us- to postpone the consideration of an item because he thinks that some honorable senators are unable under present conditions to give an unbiased vote on it. Those on this side of the chamber are prepared to go on with business. </para>

If he had the courage of his opinions, he would not sneak behind a motion like this, to serve party purposes. It should not go forth to the world that the Senate is ready to hang up its business because of a little trouble at Mildura; honorable senators being weak in the knees, and not knowing how to vote. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator spoke as long as it suited him, and during the afternoon a number of others spoke from that side of the chamber. After great exertions he has secured another follower, and, no doubt, when the Government think that they have a sufficient number of &#34; wobblers &#34; on their side, they will go on with the business. I hope that a similar position will not occur in Australian politics again. </para>

                    <para>.- When I entered the chamber this afternoon, I did not know that there was a difference between the masters and men at Mildura. We were elected to give our  best consideration to the Tariff, and should deal with it on purely business lines. &#39; But the Government have allowed themselves to be influenced and dominated by the Labour Party. Does any one really believe that the Government are such nincompoops as to fall into a trap of this kind unless they feel that they must yield to the force behind them? For the first time in its history the Senate is being asked to engage in party politics. &#39; I am pleased to say that the members of my party are taking every step which they think is necessary to defend the principles on &#39; which they were elected. The members of the Senate were elected as trustees for the people of Australia, and not as trustees for a small section of the people of Victoria even if it be the settlers at Mildura. There is a great principle involved in the issue before the Chamber this evening, and it is whether we who were returned to carry on the business of Australia shall allow ourselves to be made puppets in a party move in order to enable a certain section to gain political kudos. In other words the question is whether or not the growers in Mildura shall be compelled to pay certain wages to their employes. I will not say whether the wages now paid are fair and reasonable. Looking at the position in all its surroundings. it appears to me that they are not fair, but that is not the question at stake. The real question is whether this small dispute is to be made a means by which the business of the country is to be impeded. Do honorable senators realize the kind of precedent which they are asked to create to-day ? At the present time 700 men are affected by a strike in the timber trade in New South Wales. Suppose that the Government succeed in establishing this bad precedent, will the consideration of the timber duties be postponed until that strike is settled? Will the Senate be asked to bring pressure to bear upon the masters? Will they be told that if they do not give way to the demands of the men the duties on timber will be altered in accordance with the desires of the Labour Party ? No one can interpret the conduct of the Government on the present occasion except as an attempt to influence the fruit-growers to give way to the demand of their men. It is idle for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to ask us on this side to believe that their motive in moving for a postponement is to procure an unbiased consideration of the item. We may be fools but I do not think, that we are so foolish as to fall in with that view. We can read between the lines and realize that the postponement of the item was asked for in order that the fruit-growers could be informed by wire, either to-day or tomorrow, that if they did hot give way to the demand of the workmen there was in the Senate a party who were determined that they should not get the duty which the Government in their wisdom a short time ago believed was fair and necessary in the interests of the whole of Australia. Tomorrow the people of Australia are to be told that upon the success or otherwise of that demand will depend the rate of duty which is to be levied on imported fruits. </para>

                        <para>- I shall vote for as low a duty as is consistent with my principles. I believe that if they were left alone the Government would do what they deemed to be right. But they are simply moved by party considerations. If the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> be carried it will create a bad precedent and one which will be felt throughout the Commonwealth. I do not know what public opinion is in the other States, but certainly in New South Wales the Federal Parliament has not gained in popular estimation. It has not come up to the high ideals which many of us had formed. In New South Wales its legislation has not realized the expectations of those who did their best to bring about the establishment of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    spoke of a number of other places, but those places do not grow enough currants to make up the buns for a Sunday-school picnic. There is a wages dispute at one of the two currant districts, and legislation in respect of the Tariff is to be hung up until that is settled. How is it going to be settled? If the extra is. a day is not paid, we are told plainly that an attempt will be made to reduce the duty proposed by the Government by 331/3 per cent.

                        <para>- Then what is the object of the desired postponement? If the duty on currants is to be reduced to 2d. per lb. because of the quarrel at Mildura, the fruit-growers at Renmark are to be punished because somebody at Mildura did not pay1s. a day extra. We know perfectly well that the decision of this matter by the people of Mildura does not mean that every one is going to vote in the same way. It will be settled by the majority who may be a few more than, those oh the other side. We will find therefore that all the growers at Renmark and nearly half the growers at Mildura are to be penalized by the vote of certain members of the Senate, because rather more than a moiety of the growers at Mildura do not care to pay an extra1s. a day to their men. . There is a beautiful proposition in wise, honorable and statesmanlike legislation ! If public affairs are to be conducted in that way, I think that my honorable friends had better hunt- for a more decent excuse than the one which has been submitted - the Mildura dispute. Why not add to the motion these words, &#34; until the completion of the Senate election now pending in South Australia&#34;? </para>

                        <para>- There is a chance of my honorable friend finishing himself before the Tariff is disposed of. because he is exerting himself body and mind in a most unnecessary manner under a pretence or make-believe that he really wants to get this Tariff out of the way ; whereas we all know that the Government do not want to get the Tariff out of the way at all. We know perfectly well that as long as they go on collecting the duties as fixed by another place, so long will they be quite satisfied, more particularly in view of the awful threats that have been recently made against them by a . very distinguished member of the Labour Party, namely, that as soon as the Tariff is out of the way it will be necessary to fit out an exploring expedition to find the whereabouts of the Deakin &#39;Government. That  threat having been officially pronounced by a distinguished member of the Labour Party, I can quite understand that the Government are absolutely shaking in their shoes, and clutching at any excuse for postponement that will stave off the awful calamity that lies before them. </para>

                        <para>- That Is so profound an observation that if I were the honorable senator I would&#39; supply myself with a phonograph to take down such gems of wit and imaginary humour, so that they might be preserved. It is a pity that -they should be lost on an ungrateful world, because the existing generation can not comprehend in the slightest decree where either the wit or the common-sense comes in. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>I take it that the meaning of those two provisions taken together is that an amendment to a motion for postponement must be for the purpose of postponing a clause or clauses until after certain other clauses have been disposed of. Obviously, the South Australian election is not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill before the Committee. Therefore I do not think that I can accept the amendment. </para>

                            does not want the item to be deferred so long. He wishes it. to be dealt with after item  105.  Before we take a division I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council will tell us what is the information he expects to receive,; what he intends to inquire into, and why he wants the item postponed.

                        <para>- I admit that. It would require a great deal of persuasion for the Government to get my vote, though I do not say I am not open to conviction. The Government &#39; ought to be clear and frank with us, just as some honorable senators have been remarkably clear, frank, and fearless in regard to their position. Some singularly candid declarations have been made by supporters of the Government as to why they want a postponement. I therefore take the opportunity of submitting these explicit questions to which I desire clear and explicit answers. If a senator from any other State were to request the hanging up of part of the Tariff I am certain that he would be charged with gross  provincialism. Yet the Tariff has been hung up since 4 o&#39;clock this afternoon over this postponement matter. Who is it that is hanging up the debate now ? </para>

                        <para>- I have a distinct opinion about that also. Of course the Government are to be excused in one sense for the position in which they find themselves. Hut I am not going to obey the crack of the whip. If this request for postponement had been made by a representative of Queensland or New South Wales we should have had the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the whole protectionist press of Australia holding us up as subjects for just derision. What would that oracle, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which is behind the Government, say in such circumstances? I do not -wish to speak disrespectfully of the <inline font-style="italic">Agc,</inline> or of any other newspaper, for I recognise that the press has a right to attempt to influence in a legitimate way the opinions of Parliament as well as of the people outside. I take this seasonable opportunity, however, to point out that whereas Victorians are constantly asserting that they possess the true Federal spirit, the protectionist organs here would declare that we were gross tyrants if we attempted to do what the Government now propose, and would assert that we were seeking to strangle Federation. I would ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council why he desires a postponement&#34;; what he seeks to find out, and presuming that he finds it out, what position will the Government take up in regard to it? If he does not give explicit answers to these questions he will occupy the position of a witness in the box who, having had addressed to him strong, adverse questions, says, &#34;I refuse to answer.&#34; In such circumstances the jury can form only one conclusion. </para>

                        <para>- No; I think that it is a very painful and ugly reality. Supposing that instead of the additional is. per day being granted or refused, the people split the difference, and agree to an increase of 6d. per day, will the Government propose to split the difference between 2d. and 3d. per lb. in respect of the duty? If an additional 6d. per day be given, what is to be done by those who are clamouring for a postponement in order to see if the1s. per clay is to be granted or refused? </para>

We admit now that this postponement is desired in order that we may know what arrangement has been made between the employers and. employes in the Mildura, fruit-growing industry. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that neither he nor any one of us can have any guarantee that an arrangement arrived at to-morrow, whereby the employes receive the additional is. per day; will be permanent. The employers&#39; might say to the workers, &#34; We will give you the extra1s. per&#39; day,&#34; and then, having got what they wanted - a high duty - there would be nothing to prevent their reverting a month hence to the old rate of pay. I merely suggest that possibility. </para>

                        <para>- It occurs to me that I need not have apologized for proposing to trespass on the time of honorable senators; they appear to have plenty to spare, and I might have taken up their time as a matter of right, and not as a matter of courtesy.. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in moving the second reading of the Bill, made an appeal for its expeditious treatment. Responding to that appeal, I took the opportunity to point out that Governments frequently clamoured for divisions when the numbers were right, and manoeuvred for delays when&#39; the numbers were wrong. In the consumption of time over this matter to-day, the Govern- &#39; ment have given us abundant evidence of the correctness of my statement, and they must take the whole responsibility for the waste of time that has occurred. </para>

                        <para>- A duty of  2S.  per cental is rather less than &#188;d. per lb., and consequently the new duty of&#189;d. per lb. represents an increase of more than 100 per cent. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended an impost of&#189;d. per lb. upon. &#39;this class of fruits, but the free-trade section of that body recommended only 20 per cent. I. think that we ought to have some information before us to justify us in making the enormous increase proposed. There is really no necessity for a duty upon citrus fruits, because Australia is the home of them. The finest oranges in the world are produced in the. Commonwealth, and yet it is stated that 41,422 centals of citrus fruits were imported in 1906. I take it that these  figures  refer chiefly to the importation of lemons. This year the growth&#34; of lemons has been so extraordinary that they were a. drug on the market in South Australia. They were practically given away. </para>

                    <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has pointed out, the duty which is now proposed, represents an increase of 100 per cent, upon the old rate of 2s. per cental, inasmuch as it works out at  45.  2d. per cental. The A section of- the Tariff Commission recommended an impost of &#189;d. per lb. upon citrus fruits, but made a special exception in the case of summer fruits, upon which they recommended a duty of1d. per lb. The Government have not gone so far as that in their proposal, but they ask for an all-round duty of id. per lb. on citrus fruits. . The information which has been circulated amongst honorable senators shows that, during 1906, 41,422 centals of citrus fruits were imported into the Commonwealth. These consisted of oranges and lemons. The importations of other citrus fruits are not recorded. That our imports &#39; under this heading are increasing is evidenced by  the fact that in 1903 we imported 33,537 centals; in 1904, 31,792 centals; in 1905, 30,548 centals; and in 1906, 41,422 centals. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The recommendation of the A Section of the Tariff Commission  was  that a duty of 20 per cent, should be levied. That, of course, would work out at varying amounts. We propose an all-round duty of id. per lb. It certainly represents a trifle more than double the old rate, but I  do  not think that we are asking  too  much, especially in view  of  the fact that one section  of  the Commission recommended an even higher impost upon summer fruits. The recommendation  of  the protectionist section  of  the Commission will be found upon page  36 of  their fortieth report. It reads - </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    indicates, it is rather a case of a State being hoist with its own petard, because South Australia, was the first of the Australian States to bar the introduction of fruit from other States. There has been such an embargo in South Australia for at least twenty-one years, to my certain knowledge. As Royal Commissioner for New South Wales at the Adelaide Exhibition of  1887,  I had the greatest difficulty to secure the admission of some ferns from the scrub lands on the coast district of New South Wales for the decoration of the New South Wales courts. I had to make I cannot tell how many solemn declarations that they had not come out of a vineyard, but when it came to the introduction of fruits, that was simply an impossibility. I know that there is a great deal in the trouble that is spoken of in regard to Inter-State trade in fruit. No doubt the Inter-State barriers that are set up lead to the introduction of foreign lemons, because the climates of Australia are so varied that, although we cannot perhaps grow lemons for every month in the year, we could certainly grow them for a great many of the months in the year if we had free . interchange. But if South Australia is limited to its own market, it very soon chokes. If New South Wales is limited to its own market the same thing happens, as it only produces for a small portion of the year. I take it that that is one of the reasons why we find so large an introduction of lemons. Break down these Inter-State barriers that are unfortunately specifically provided for in the Federal Constitution in respect of inspection charges and heaven knows what besides, and I feel sure that the fine citrus fruits of Australia would be able to hold their own even without a duty, and less of the foreign article would come into the market. I hope that, whatever sins of foul vineyards may exist, whatever offences are committed by or in any State in this regard, so serious an effort will be made to secure freedom from insect and vegetable pests throughout the orchards of Australia that we shall be able to do away with all Inter-State difficulties of the kind indicated, and then whether the duty be &#188;d. or&#189;d. it will matter very little, as we shall supply our own needs.

                        <para>- I saw them growing ripe on the trees at Toowoomba when I. was there last - about Christmas. They were late oranges. The early oranges begin away north at Cardwell, and you find oranges right down south until you get to Toowoomba. My experience is that there are oranges ripening in some portion of Australia all the year round. If so, why encourage importations from Italy and elsewhere? </para>

I understand that under the Tariff of .1962 there was a duty of 1&#189;d. a lb. on preserved ginger, and a duty of 2d. per lb. on green ginger. It was shown that the green ginger preserved in the Commonwealth necessitated the use of sugar on which dufy had been paid, and in order that there might be a differentiation between green ginger, &#39;which could be preserved in Australia, and the manufactured article, the Tariff Commission recommended a reduction of the duty from 2d. to id. </para>

                    <para>. - Tt is quite true that no evidence was laid before the Tariff Commission in regard to this item ; and the recommendations which have been read by the Minister of Home Affairs were made simply in order to correct anomalies in the Tariff of 1902.- The idea was to make a distinction between green ginger and ginger in a more advanced stage of manufacture. We cannot call green ginger a raw material in, the same sense as -other commodities are so called; and I believe it can, and probably will, in time be grown in Australia, when people devote their attention more particularly to what may be called .gardening, as distinguished from farming. It was for that reason that we of the Tariff Commission did not desire to remit the duty altogether, but rather to give some encouragement for the production of- ginger here.- Some honorable senators seem always to be referring to industries as Chinese industries. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;9.26&#93;. - I do not intend to be influenced in my vote by any considerations as to whether this is or is not a Chinese industry. - I can quite understand, however, from the value of the importations, that this industry must be prosecuted either by Chinese or by some very inferior set of white people. According to the statistics, the value of this ginger is rather under 2d. per lb., and, although for six years there was a duty of 2d., or 100 per cent., the general opinion is that not one ounce was grown in the Commonwealth for commercial purposes in that time. If that be the case, either we are doing a grave injustice in reducing the duty, or the industry is not congenial to the people of Australia, and, therefore, protection is not necessary. It appears to me to be rather like the rice root production which was spoken of the other day - an industry not worth encouraging. The Government seem to have adopted a rule of thumb method of halving the duty; and the result can only be to add to the price of the commodity, most of which I see is imported from Hong Kong. We have been told that the preserving of this green ginger necessitates the consumption of Australian sugar, but apart from that protectionist view, this appears to be a revenue duty of really very small consequence.

                    <para>Only one of the fruit merchants who appeared before your Commissioners gave any information concerning this article. He said that the jam and candy peel manufacturers imported, very large quantities of peel in brine from Sicily. They contended that it was better for their&#39; purpose than the local product, although the latter could be purchased at a lower rate. Tt was thought that this was due to the fact that some element was extracted&#39; by the Italians, who thus rendered their peel more pliable. The preference shown for the imported peel was not due to damaged local lemons being turned into peel in brine. It was impossible to turn a damaged lemon into peel, it was only fit for pulp. An extra duty would impose a handicap upon manufacturers. </para>

A very large quantity of local lemons go bad, not&#39; because they &#39; might not be used, but because the Sicilian peel is found more suitable than the local peel.&#34; In Sicily the inside of the lemons is removed and the pulp crushed for the juice it contains. The essential oils are extracted from the skins, and what is practically the refuse, remaining is thrown, into brine and sent out here to be made into candied peel. By using this peel our manufacturers can place an article on the market at  2d.  per lb. less than they would have to charge for candied peel made from local lemons. They say that candied peel made from local lemons would be worth from  2d.  to  4d.  per lb. more, because of its greater value for cooking purposes, since it would contain the essential oils, which are extracted from the </para>

Five years ago I asked the Senate not to impose a duty on the brine in which the peel was imported, and I then pointed out that a great quantity of this peel has only to undergo certain inexpensive processes to make it candied peel.

                        <para>- The extraction of the essential oils makes the peel indigestible and everything else that is nasty. In various parts of Australia there is, at some portions of the year, a very large surplus of lemons which cannot be disposed of. I know of places where men have had lately to grub up lemon trees because they could not find a market for their produce. When we know that a large quantity of lemons inferior in quality to Australian lemons is imported, we should, I contend, do everything we can to encourage the production and use of lemons. This is one instance in which, owing to information I have received since the Tariff Commission arrived at its recommendation, I intend to alter my vote. I have found in South Australia that even in this year no market could be found for tons of lemons. </para>

The protectionist section- of the Tariff Commission has not recommended a duty of 2d. per lb. I know nothing about the industry, and I think it is a significant fact that the jam manufacturers have not asked for an additional impost. The fact that neither the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission nor the Government has proposed a duty of 2d. per lb. is, I think, a very strong reason why we should retain the duty at1 d. It seems that the Italians have a. method of preserving the peel in such a way that it is made fairly cheap to our manufacturers.

                <para class="block">Of course, I. know that I shall be charged with making an onslaught on one of the most promising industries of Queensland. I had that charge thrown at . me pretty often five years ago when I was seeking to reduce the duty then proposed. But had I known at the time what I learned shortly afterwards, I would have been able to make a much more effective fight than I did. Immediately the Tariff was out of the way, like the prophet Jonah, I took shipping and went up to the banana districts of Queensland. I found that the great banana industry of that State, so far as the export of fruit was concerned, was almost exclusively in Chinese hands. I know, of course, that bananas are grown to some small extent in the State from which I come. They are grown very largely by Chinese growers in Queensland for the purpose of exportation to other States, and I believe that there are some grown by white growers for consumption in Brisbane or thereabouts. I have here a few figures which show a most extraordinary reduction in the production of the article. Clearly this is not the flourishing industry which some persons would have us believe, and does not afford us very much hope of being able to cope with the demand of Australia for this particular kind of fruit. On the figures I have, I shall submit that Australia would be very badly off for its popular banana if it were restricted to the limits of the Commonwealth. I would like to see the figures reversed, but we are dealing with facts, and not with what we perhaps would appreciate. I find that there has been a serious reduction in the acreage under bananas in Queensland. In 1903 the acreage was 6,577 acres; in 1904, 6,680 acres; in 1905, 6,198 acres; and in 1906, 5,163 acres. I do not rely wholly upon the acreage. Let me quote the values for the years I have mentioned. In 1903 the value in round figures was &#163;73,000; in 1904, &#163;89,000; in 1905, &#163;154,000; and in 1906, &#163;74,000. Between 1905 and 1906 there was a fall of &#163;80,000 in the value. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend will, I am sure, bear with a foreigner to Queensland. I know, a great deal about that State, and visit it pretty well every year. I think that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> if lie will use his memory, .will be able to assure the Committee that not only was there a reduction in production through storms, but also a material reduction by reason of Chinamen giving up the game about Cairns, and many hundreds of acres being put under sugar. Our chief imports come from Fiji. If there is any life and reality in the proposition that the Commonwealth is at some future time to dominate the Pacific-and if it does not have some such influence as that it will be a very poor look-out for Australia in the future--! think that instead of setting up barriers against the Islands which we wish to come under the sway of Australia dr into politi cai and social partnership with her, we should rather seek to encourage the enduring bonds of commerce and monetary exchange. We should avoid setting up a barrier that will, instead of enhancing friendship, set us further asunder. I particularly draw attention to this fact : that the bananas grown in Fiji, which is a British Possession, find their way into New Zealand - the New Dominion - duty free; and the introduction of a large volume of fruit from Fiji produces a corresponding interchange of goods of New Zealand production. Consequently, the bonds&#39; are strengthening between New Zealand and Fiji, while to some material extent they have been weakened between Fiji and the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the public, have been very well pleased with the Fiji cricketers, to whom my honorable friend refers. I have here a list of imports of bananas during 1906. I will take the values, as being the simpler method of dealing with them. From Fiji we imported .&#163;36,891 ; &#39;from the Straits Settlements, ^57 ; from Java, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70</inline> ; and from the New Hebrides, &#163;29. Clearly the British Possession of Fiji is the only country from which any material quantity of bananas comes to Australia, and is, as I have pointed out, a country with which we should seek to cultivate the friendly, relations that invariably follow useful commerce. We need not, therefore, trouble ourselves about the minute handful of bananas that come from either the Straits </para>

            <para class="block">Settlements, Java, or the New Hebrides. I wish also to draw attention to the fact that this item of bananas slipped through in the other Chamber without much consideration. I do not think it was debated at all. But I have some references to the banana duty when it was debated in another place five years ago, while the first Commonwealth Tariff was under review. It will perhaps be remembered . that the original duty proposed was 2s. per cental. This item was criticised by Opposition members, and in replying, the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, said - <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 7886 - </para>
            <quote>
                <para>We have to consider our own Commonwealth, and it naturally follows that if we admit bananas free we must extend the same concession on other articles of produce from these islands. , I am aware that 2s. per cental is a pretty high duty, and I am prepared. to reduce the amount to is., if the Opposition will agree to it. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">Now, I beg to point out that the argument that if we made bananas free we should have to extend the same treatment to the other products of countries which send their bananas to us, is open to this criticism : First of all, there are very few countries that send us bananas, and the other products are already provided for. We have provided for one of the only products that is likely to come, namely, coffee. We have provided for that in &#39; a double-barrelled sense, for we have imposed a pretty stiff duty, and have also granted a bounty to encourage local produce. Consequently we need not trouble about the tribulation that would follow in respect of other produce. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan moved an amendment to make bananas free. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> said that a duty of is. meant about one-eighth of a penny per lb. or an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of about 40 per cent. So that taking the opinion of the first Customs Minister of the Commonwealth we find that a is. duty now again proposed amounts to no less than 40 per cent, upon the value, which is extraordinarily high in view of the fact that bananas are necessarily a perishable fruit and a good many times in the course of a year banana&#39; shipments arrive damaged arid are a source of loss to the importers. So that, at the least, we have an extraordinarily heavy impost against the one fruit which perhaps more than any other is consumed by the general body of the people in Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I admit that up to a certain point it appeared so; but we know that honorable members of another place last year were working against time, to get through before Christmas, with the promise of a three months&#39; holiday if they did so, or the penalty of not seeing their families for some time if they did not. A good many items were scrambled through, and the long list of amendments which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has tabled shows with what extraordinary rapidity a very large number of items were dealt with. In the Senate in 1902 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> moved, a request that bananas be free, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> said that the adoption of such a request would lead to. the market being swamped with Fijian bananas. We have seen that a duty of is. per cental, if it has saved the market from being swamped, has not fulfilled the hopes of those who thought that it would extend the local production of bananas sufficiently to supply at all events the requirements of Australia. I find that on that occasion I moved a request that the duty be reduced to 6d. per cental. That proposition was negatived, and now, falling in with the wish expressed by a number of honorable senators on this side, when I rose to move the same request, I am submitting a proposal that bananas be free. If I am defeated that will not prevent a request in the direction of 6d. per cental. Let me compare the figures I have already used. In 1906 there was a material increase in the imports from Fiji which helped to make up to some extent the Queensland deficiency. There was a rise of from &#163;2,736 in 1905 to &#163;36,891 in 1906 in the value of the imports from Fiji, whilst ,&#39;there had been fi fall of &#163;80,518 in the value of Queensland&#39;s exportations - a drop from &#163;154,712 in 1905 to&#39; &#163;74,i94 in 1906. There are one or two points that I beg to submit for the Committee&#39;s consideration, and I shall state &#34;them Very briefly. One reason why we should not have a duty that could be in any way regarded as prohibitive is that the banana-growing districts of Queensland, like those of other parts of the world, are liable at fortunately fairly distant intervals, but still at most uncertain times, to hurricane attacks, when the whole crop is so seriously damaged that if we were to restrict ourselves to the product of one country Australia might be without a banana for a couple of years. </para>

            <para class="block">Queensland relates chiefly to that of the Cairns district and thereabouts. There, from what. I could gather, and certainly so far as my observations went, the growers are exclusively Chinese. The export is so large in the season that it is quite common for one steamer per diem to leave for the south; every week six steamers will . leave Cairns all carrying large cargoes of bananas and frequently of pineapples. This trade, whilst valuable I suppose to the Chinese growers, is certainly of value to the Queens- land railways and to the wharf labourers. I have not infrequently travelled by a steamer that was loaded by two gangs - the first not being able to complete the task the second had to go on in order to get the shipment aboard. The trade is of importance to a very large number of white men connected with the shipping trade of our coast. It is a valuable trade, even if it is in the first instance chiefly carried on by Chinese. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend, who asks what is a very fair and proper question, will recognise that, having regard to the uncertainty of the crop - the immensely heavy fall of from&#34;  55  per cent, to  60  per cent, in the production of bananas in Queensland in one year -and the increase of I cannot say how many hundred per cent, in the imports from Fiji during the same period, there must necessarily be such fluctuations that, duty or no duty, we should not do very much more than maintain a fair average in price all the year round. The abolition of the duty ought to reduce the price just as the imposition of a duty almost invariably raises the price. Beyond the broad principle I certainly cannot discuss the conditions appertaining to the banana trade in the different cities. It is there that the information <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seeks would be more easily obtained than could be hoped for in the growing fields. </para>

                    <para>- We all know that there is a . very simple way of testing the matter. The common practice is to sell all bananas as Fijian. It is apparent therefore that they have the call in popular esteem. Of course, it may be urged that the bananas grown in Fiji are the product of coloured labour. That is the view taken by some extremists, who conveniently forget that the tea and coffee which they consume are also the product of coloured labour. I am, however, assured on the best of authority that the majority of the banana-growers in Fiji are of Australian birth. I would further&#39; emphasize the fact that bananas are to be found very much more in the homes of those whose means do not permit the consumption of luxuries than they are upon the tables of the rich. I cannot close my . observations without! summing&#39; up the principal points which I desire honorable senators to consider. In the first place, bananas are consumed by the great mass of the community, and not by the &#34;upper&#34; class, secondly it is desirable that we as a Commonwealth should seek to cultivate friendly trade relations with the islands of the Pacific in respect of which we anticipate exercising a large influence in the near future, and thirdly we should not do anything which would tend to throw into the neighbouring country of New Zealand a trade which more intimately concerns us than it does the New Dominion. I would further remind honorable . senators that a few months ago Fiji proved a very Valuable stand-by, when there was a heavy decline in the production of Queensland bananas. Lastly,I would point out that the Queensland production is more likely to decrease than to increase. I trust that I have submitted valid reasons for my proposal that the House of Representatives be requested to make the item free. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to traverse one or two of the arguments which have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in connexion with this item. He held that the banana was the fruit of the masses, and not of the classes. But during the course of his earlier remarks, in reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> he frankly confessed that he was unable to say that the remission of the duty would cause the price of bananas to be affected. A little later, however, he declared that the price of this fruit would be regulated by the generosity of the crop rather than by., any fiscal arrangement. He also urged that bananas were the product of the islands of the Pacific, with which it was desirable that the Commonwealth should be brought into closer friendly trade relations. I can only answer that argument by adopting the reply which was given to it by the Treasurer and Minister of Trade and Customs in a previous Government some four or five years ago. That reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> himself has quoted. If we are to admit bananas free, there is equal reason why we should admit free even&#39; other commodity produced by the islands in question. Concerning the honorable senator&#39;s statement that Fiji came to the rescue of Australia in 1906, when there was a shortage of the banana crop in Queensland, I would remind him of his own contention that the price of bananas is regulated by the generosity of the crop, and not by the duty imposed upon them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is quite right. From Fiji 145,706 centals were imported, of a declared value of &#163;36,891. Worked out, that approximates to 5s. a cental. From the Straits Settlements, 302 centals of the value of &#163;98 were imported, which gives an average&#39; of over 6s. per cental.- The figures which. I  am  quoting are for 1906. From Java 97 centals of the value of &#163;29 were imported. That is an average value of moVe than 6s., so that there was a variation in value. Evidently the cheapest line came from the New Hebrides, consisting of 145 centals of a declared value of &#163;29, which works out at exactly 4s. a cental. A. duty of is. per cental on that would be 25 per cent., but the average price per cental of bananas imported into the Commonwealth, dividing the total importation into the value assigned, was about 5s. 6&#189;d. </para>

                        <para>- From the figures before us, the lowest price of bananas that came -into the Commonwealth was 4s. a cental. The value ranged up to and over 6s., and the average was 5s. 6&#189;d. I hope that the Committee will see the wisdom of adhering to the duty which has been in force, since. 1902. The matter was debated in the House of Representatives, and also in the Senate, as far back as 1902. When the duty was reduced from 2s. to is. in another place it was understood that the reason  for so doing was that the weight of the stalk was to be counted under the lower rate of duty, whereas it was allowed for under the higher duty. Honorable senators will see that the reasons advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> for interfering with the duty have no relation to normal or general conditions, but apply to exceptional cases such as he referred to. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know about Victoria, but the Tariff Commission gathered evidence - and it is notorious without that evidence - that the Chinese middlemen in Sydney undoubtedly control the whole trade. The banana enters more largely into the ordinary food of the people than almost any other article, but in some parts of Australia., notably Western Australia, bananas are almost unpurchasable at a reasonable price. Why should we tax the food of the people to give an advantage to a few Chinamen in the northern parts of Queensland ? It is so ridiculous to do so that I am sure the Committee will take the opportunity of removing the duty. The &#34;best banana grown is cultivated in the Fiji Islands. If I thought that the Pacific Islanders were going to be brought into competition in this trade with any white labour in Australia, I should be the last to advocate the removal of the duty, but there is no element of that kind in this question. The trade in Australia is wholly controlled by Chinamen, and, from what I have seen, and the evidence which has been placed before us, I cannot do otherwise than support the removal of the duty. One section of the Commission recommended that course, no doubt after consideration of the evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that, but this matter is quite outside the question of protection. Any duty that we impose will be simply a revenue one. To call it a protectionist duty is simply to bring the principle of protection into ridicule. Notwithstanding the heavy duty that has been placed upon bananas, white men have not taken up their cultivation in Australia.. A duty of1s. per cental may look small, but when it is remembered that the weight of the stalks is included, and all duty paid upon the gross weight, it becomes a very heavy duty. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has corrected himself so many times that it is almost impossible to follow him. In the year 1905, the total output of bananas in Queensland, measured by bunches, had doubled since 1901, having risen from 1,160,000 to  8,509,900  bunches. Next year there was a. falling off ; but the honorable senator did not show that imports in . 1905 were only one-fourth of what they were in 1903. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly prepared to quote the figures at length, only I do not wish to detain the Committee. However, the imports fell off up to 1905, and only . in 1906, when there was a decrease in the production in Queensland, did the imports from Fiji increase, further, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> quoted from . an official report which contains a statement to the effect that the falling off was due to the heavy cyclone in the early part of 1906.It will thus be seen that the decrease in production and the increase in imports, have a. clear and definite, cause, and that there is nothing to justify the statement that this is a declining industry. </para>
