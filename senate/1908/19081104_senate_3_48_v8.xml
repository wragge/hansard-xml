                    <para>. - When this question was last before the Senate and the debate was interrupted, I was addressing myself to it. I desire now to offer a few more remarks as to why . I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should not be restrained from referring to the question of land nationalization and its bearing upon the very important subject of the selection of the Capital site. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in the course of his remarks referred incidentally 4o the opinions of some honorable senators, who favour some other site than Dalgety because, as he alleged, those other sites do not offer such facilities for carrying out a policy of land nationalization. I respectfully submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> argument was a very proper one. I believe that there is a consensus of opinion in the Commonwealth Parliament that in any territory owned by the Commonwealth, such as the Capital site, the land should belong to the Commonwealth, and that the fee-simple of any portion of it should not be parted with. I am justified in putting that forward as the opinion of the Commonwealth Parliament, seeing that it has already affirmed the same principle in relation to Papua. </para>

                    <para>- Order ! The question is whether the ruling given by me is correct&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> if I understood him, was pointing out that a certain policy was part of the policy of the Commonwealth. Such an argument cannot, _ in my opinion, be pertinent to the question now before the Senate. The standing order dealing with matters of this kind is phrased in general terms, and it indicates that a senator cannot address the Senate upon the subject-matter of any question under discussion so as to anticipate debate upon any question which appears upon the notice-paper. The question now is simply one of agreement or disagreement with my ruling as to the applicability of certain remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and I ask honorable senators to address themselves as closely as they can to it. </para>

                        <para>- I was pointing out respectfully that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was addressing a certain argument to the Senate which, in mv opinion, was pertinent to the question under discussion. He was justified in assuming that as Parliament had already affirmed a certain principle the same principle should be applied to the Federal Capital. The question arises whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had a right to refer to facilities for carrying out such &#38; policy in connexion with any of the various Capital sites that may be submitted when the ballot that is contemplated under the principal motion is taken. I contend that he was entitled to do so, and- if that were not to be allowed, a very important phase of the question might escape discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in my opinion, ought to have the right to canvass the advantages and disadvantages of every site under consideration. I hope that the Senate will uphold that right, and will not .take any action that would unduly restrict debate upon the question. Our desire is to arrive at a decision that will be beneficial to the Commonwealth ; and, from that point of &#62;view, argument from all sides ought to be brought to bear upon it. </para>

                        <para>- If any great principle were involved, it would be fair and reasonable for honorable senators to appeal against a decision with which they did not agree. But in the present case what is to be gained by such an appeal ? The  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees should have our complete confidence, and I am sure that we all recognise that they endeavour, as far as possible, impartially to permit all honorable senators the fullest freedom of speech on any question which is before the Chair. In this case, the  President  arrived at an opinion - and it is a mere expression of his own view - that the debate should be kept within narrower limits than were at the time being observed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Technically, no doubt it is a ruling. But, after all, is it not a mere expression of opinion on the part of the  President.  Surely the presiding officer must be given some discrimination in a matter of this kind? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will acknowledge that he was given great latitude in the discussion of the question. The  President  has been anxious to extend to every honorable senator his right to the fullest and freest expression of his views on the question of the Capital site. I strongly urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that this is hardly a case in which the ruling of the  President  should be dissented from. Having regard to the great office held by the  President,  and to the fact that no fundamental principle is involved in this matter, I urge the honorable senator to withdraw his motion. I am quite sure that if he does so he can rely upon it that the  President  will exercise a generous discretion in controlling the debate. I hope that the honorable senator will not disregard the observations I have made, and that if he can see his way to do so he will withdraw his motion. By doing so the honorable senator will do justice to the Senate and to the </para>

                    <para>- Before I commence the discussion on this matter I should like to submit what I take to be a proper inquiry to the  President  as to our standing order. If I am wrong, I hope that he will correct me. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> gave notice of his intention to dispute your ruling, but that, having resumed his seat, he is not now permitted under our Standing Orders to debate this question any further. </para>

It is as well that every honorable senator should remember the position, so that if such circumstances happen again we may all be aware that if an honorable senator disputes your ruling and resumes his seat he will not be allowed, when the question of the disputed ruling comes up for consideration by the Senate, to debate the matter, except by way of reply or by permission of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- If it was a mere expression of opinion, it seems to me that we are now engaged in beating the air, and that we are also under a misapprehension as to the attitude which was taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in regard to it. I must confess that I do not like the way in which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has asked the Senate to deal with this motion. He appealed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to withdraw it upon the ground that you, sir, hold a very high and distinguished office - a fact which we all recognise. Apparently he desires it to be inferred that no honorable senator - no matter how courteously he may act - ought to persist in disagreeing with any ruling which you may give. That, I venture to say, is quite a wrong attitude to take up. Upon more than one occasion I have disagreed with your rulings, but I am perfectly sure that no honorable senator ever takes that course of action without considerable hesitation, and that whenever he does take it, he exhibits the greatest courtesy and deference to the Chair. I am quite sure that these feelings animate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and consequently, I think that we ought to approach this matter from the simple point of view of whether your ruling would unduly restrict debate and prevent that honorable senator from dealing with matters which he might deem to be pertinent to the question under consideration. My perplexity arises from the fact that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has declared that the motion to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was addressing himself when his remarks were ruled out of order is in form simply one for determining the method to be adopted in arriving at the opinion of the Senate upon the Federal Capital site question. But, in discussing that motion, we are, so far as I can gather, dealing with the merits of the eligible Capital sites. I understand that the proposal is that when the debate upon that motion has concluded, we shall proceed to select by ballot, and without debate, a site for the permanent Seat of Government. When, therefore, are we to be at liberty to discuss the question of which is the most suitable site if not now? When I heard the Vice-President of the Executive Council quote the terms of his motion as an answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> contention, I felt perplexed, because the limitation of the discussion to those terms would preclude any honorable senator from debating the merits of the  respective sites, the area of the territory to be acquired, and the desirableness of preventing the sale of land within that area. Upon the last-named matter, my views are entirely in accord with those expressed by the Labour Party. But, from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate, I am a little doubtful of the position which was being taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> when the  President  interposed. It seems to me that my honorable friend was led away by an interjection, and that he became a little heated, because he referred to the &#34; preconceived notions of our friends of the Anti-Sosh Party.&#34; </para>

I do not want to use too strong adjectives, but it seems to me that it was a very poor compliment to yourself for him to practically direct attention to your office and ignore any reference to the merits of the disputed ruling. He made an appeal to the Senate - one which did credit to his good heart - to be sparing in any criticism in regard to your ruling, because of your office. But I do not think that that is the proper way in which to approach the subject, nor do I think that the Minister was very well-advised when he afterwards made an appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to do justice, first to the  President,  and then to the Senate, by withdrawing his motion - the implication being, of course, that if he went on with the motion, conscientiously believing that he was right, he would be doing something like an act of injustice to the  President  and the Senate. I consider that such remarks were very ill-advised, and certainly they were not relevant to the point under discussion. May I point out, sir, that, although your ruling dealt with the question of the opinions of any party on land speculation, yet, in one statement, according to the printed report, you said - </para>

                        <para>- But how much in order would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> have been ? A statement of that kind seems to throw considerable doubt on what the ruling would have been if it had turned simply on the question of land nationalization, and that question had been introduced without any of the prefatory remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> made, and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has alluded. I must therefore assume that what the Senate is called upon to decide - and I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that this ought to be brushed aside as a matter of no importance -is whether any reference to the policy of land nationalization is relevant to the motion, and of course at what length it is relevant. A comparison is not necessarily satisfactory in order to arrive at such a conclusion. But let me point out that during the debate the most extreme latitude has been allowed to honorable senators in discussing all sorts of questions which, in a certain sense are, to my mind, on the same footing as land nationalization. Let me take for instance, the question of water. In speaking of the matter of the site, various honorable senators have dealt with the use of water for irrigation and electric power purposes, and human consumption. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely, but in doing so, surely it would have been in order for an honorable senator, who held strong views, to have diverted his remarks to the importance of irrigation, and if he had liked, to the great value of water for motive power. The question of the soil of the various sites has been debated at very great length. I think that an honorable senator could have pointed out very properly the great advantages from a scientific point of view - and he might have given the Senate the benefit of his scientific knowledge - of various soils, not only for building, but also for cultivation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might have gone further. He might have given some valuable information on soils as a factor in enabling the Senate to determine upon a site. He surely could have done that without merely limiting himself to the institution of a comparison of different soils, and if he had I venture to say that he would have been quite in order. Whatever my views on the subject of land nationalization may be, I confess that there seems to be scarcely a more pertinent subject to deal with in debating which is the proper site to select. I cannot help thinking, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would have been perfectly in order in not merely comparing the value of one site with the value of another for the purpose of land nationalization, but also in pointing out what in his opinion the merits of that policy were. If he was prevented from pointing out any merits in land nationalization, why institute a comparison? If the thing is no good, or even if the honorable senator is prevented from pointing out its merits, a mere comparison would have been an idle waste of time. I mean to imply that, granted that he was in order, it surely ought to follow that a discussion on the thing compared must necessarily be in order. Under the circumstances, sir, I. feel inclined - and I ha&#62;ve quite as much respect for your ruling as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> wishes to show - to express by my vote the opinion that on this motion a debate on land nationalization is in order, and certainly it ought to be in order if we can use a comparison, seeing the latitude which has been allowed to every honorable senator to bring in other matters, which in my opinion are in no way more relevant to the question of the site than is the subject of land nationalization. </para>

                    <para>. - At all times I have been prepared to pay every respect to the rulings of the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees, but I cannot see that on this occa-sion  I should be showing any disrespect to your position in differing from your ruling. I was not here when this difficulty arose,  and  probably I may not be able to speak with the same authority, or even with the same knowledge, as those who were. But after having had passages read to me from the report of the proceedings, I came to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was absolutely in order in discussing the question of land nationalization, or anything else with respect to land, in relation to the eligibility of any site which was under consideration. I consider that the possibilities in land taxation or land nationalization have just as much to do with the proposal of the Government as has the supply of water, or of building material, or climate, or anything else: </para>

Perhaps in the heat of the moment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> may have been led to make some uncomplimentary references to our anti-socialistic friends. But, so far as 1 can understand the position, he was dealing with the relative values of the different sites in respect of land nationalization, or something of that kind. I consider that he had a perfect right to do so. I do not think that he occupied an undue length of time, seeing how much time was occupied in debating the point of order. Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> commenced by referring to land nationalization in respect of the Capital site. Then an interjection was made, and he went slightly off the track to describe the attitude of what he considered to be the opponents of land nationalization in any circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had been called to order while he was speaking disrespectfully of the anti-socialistic section, there might have been something in the contention. Even if he was led off the track there was a certain amount of justification for the divergence. If a  speaker  is talking about land nationalization in any circumstances, and an adverse interjection is made, I think that he is quite within his right in referring to the attitude of those who may have been continually opposed to. that policy. I do not think that it was any disrespect to you, sir, which&#34; led <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to make that reference  ; and seeing that he quickly got back into the right track, I think that it would have been a wise  thing if you had withdrawn your ruling and allowed him to proceed. I hope that the motion will not be pressed to a division. I should prefer you, sir, to withdraw your ruling, and to allow the debate on the question of the Capital site to be continued. </para>

                <para>That was the ruling which was given, but the motion implies that the ruling curtailed discussion on the question of land nationalization. If the ruling did so curtail discussion, I think it was erroneous. I consider that a ruling that would curtail discussion on the suitability of Dalgety or any other site for the adoption of an experiment in land nationalization would not be a proper one. </para>

                <para class="block">I have not attempted to interfere with the debate so far, although it appears to me that honorable senators are permitting other issues to be brought in which are not properly before the Senate. If I am asked to consider the advantage of withdrawing the ruling which I gave on Friday, I must reply that I cannot do so. I refer to the ruling that appears upon the notice-paper, namely, that it was not in order to debate the opinions of any party on the question of land speculation. Of course, if honorable senators choose to say that that was a wrong ruling, I shall accept their decision. I was not anxious to say anything more with regard to the matter, but I really wish honorable senators to remember that when the  President  is listening to a debate, it is not his desire to pull up an honorable senator, especially when the matter under consideration is one as to which there may be a very wide range of opinion. It will also be observed that it is hardly&#34; possible for the  President  to stop an honorable senator at the exact point at which the words considered to be out of order were uttered. The  President  has to consider in what direction the remarks to which he thinks exception might be made are tending.

                    <para>My ruling was that the honorable senator is not in order in attempting to debate the opinions. of any party upon land speculation in connexion with the present question. At the time I interrupted him he was debating the opinions of the Anti-Socialist Party, and he had declared that that party were in favour of securing an opportunity to make money by means of land speculation. That was the substance of his remarks in that connexion. If he desires to point out that one site is better than another for the purpose of enabling an experiment in land nationalization to be undertaken he will be at liberty to do so, though not at great length. </para>

                <para class="block">If honorable senators treat this matter - as. I am sure they desire to do - fairly, they will see that I distinctly and definitely ruled in the terms embodied in the motion now before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> accepted that as a statement of what I ruled. It is hardly in order, therefore to discuss side issues as to land nationalization, the value of water supply, and other features of proposed Federal Capital sites. It is quite sufficient, if honorable senators will permit me to say so, to take exception to the ruling that was definitely given. I do not think it is fair for honorable senators to attempt to introduce side issues, and to give a vote upon what was really not the substance of my ruling. Assuming that a motion, such as is now before the Senate, is carried, the  President  is instructed that during the present debate - because the motion can only apply to this debate; it is not a matter of principle, but only of the application of the standing order dealing with irrelevance in debate - it will be in order to debate the opinions of any party In connexion with land speculation. Where such a decision is to lead to I do not know. Of course, if the motion is passed, it will be the Senate&#39;s determination, and, as I have always recognised, the Senate has itself the ultimate decision in matters of this character. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to do so. The motion, if we adopt it, expresses dissent from the ruling on the ground that such ruling &#34; prevents any reference to the question of land nationalization in the Federal Territory.&#34; Now, I say that the ruling does no such thing. It merely prevents a continuance of the discussion as to what is or is not the opinion of the Anti.Sosh Party. That is all that the ruling does. I have no hesitation in saying that I had not carefully observed the form in which the ruling was presented. I am now perfectly clear that if we carry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> motion, we shall say in effect that to prevent an honorable senator discussing the opinion of any party, is subversive of liberty in relation to the discussion of land nationalization. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to speak to the motion because I was present when the ruling was given from, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has dissented. I intend to uphold the ruling, though perhaps for a reason other than those which have been stated by other honorable senators. If a ruling by the  President  intended to prevent an honorable senator from insulting other honorable senators is not upheld, this Chamber will become a bear garden. I was sitting behind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> on Friday last while he was speaking, and his remarks induced honorable senators on  this side to call out in protest. I say that if honorable senators on this side abused honorable senators opposite in the same  way,  though no member of the Senate called attention to the fact, it would be the duty of the  President  to prevent the continuance of remarks that were known to be objectionable. It may be that the President was not strictly correct in his ruling, so far as it dealt with the discussion of the question of land nationalization, but his interference was justified, because if he had permitted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to continue in the strain he had adopted, it would very likely have led to disorder. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the honorable senator got away from that part of his speech after he was first called to order. I say that it is the duty of the  President  to see that no honorable senator is permitted to make a bear garden of this Chamber. We know that the remarks to which I have referred are only so much tall talk. The intention is to get certain statements into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and there is nothing serious in them so far as honorable senators are concerned, because they afterwards meet each other in quite a friendly way. But the use of such remarks leads at the moment to disorder, and the  President  was quite right in interfering to prevent anything of that description. If we now decide that any senator is at liberty to continue to use such objectionable remarks, we shall have plenty of this tall talk on both sides, and we shall all regret it. </para>

It is quite true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had been referring to the Anti-Sosh  Party. He connected his references to that party with their supposed views on land nationalization, and it was after he referred to the question of land nationalization that he was called to order. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was called to order, there can be no doubt whatever that he was referring  to the question of land nationalization. Later, I find that the  President  also questioned the right of the honorable senator in a way which would restrict the debate! very much more than has been suggested this afternoon. If this was not part and parcel of the President&#39;s ruling, it is at least an indication as to how he would&#39; rule in certain circumstances. The  President  said - </para>

                    <para>. - I would urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to withdraw his motion of dissent. If the honorable senator reads the report of what occurred as I have done, he will see that he is by no means prevented by the ruling of the  President  from discussing the question of land nationalization so far as it may be affected by the choice of different Capital sites. The motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council reads - </para>

                <para>On that the  President  has ruled that we cannot discuss the views of parties upon a certain question. Let me put this to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I hold very strong views, for instance, on the subject of the tobacco monopoly. I might put it to the Senate that I hoped to see the tobacco industry nationalized at one of these particular sites. In that connexion, I should be at perfect liberty to point out that Dalgety was a superior site to Canberra, and the  President  would not rule me out of order for so doing. But, if I proceeded to dwell upon the opinion&#39;s entertained by honorable senators opposite upon the question of the nationalization of the tobacco industry, clearly I should be out of order. That is the position which the  President  has taken up. &#39;He has said that, whilst he will allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to debate the question of land nationalization as it affects the relative merits of the different sites, he will not allow him to discuss party opinions upon it. That, I think, is a reasonable ruling. An  attempt.;  has been made to make capital out of the remark of the  President  that he would not allow honorable senators to discuss the question of land nationalization at great length. That, however, was a mere slip of the tongue. I am sure the  President  would not desire to maintain that position.  His  ruling practically means that honorable senators are at liberty to discuss the question of land nationalization so far as they may make their remarks in that connexion relevant to the main motion. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> disagreed with the ruling of the  President  upon a misunderstanding, because he believed that that ruling would prevent him from dealing with the question of land nationalization) altogether. However, it has been made clear that that is not intended. I hope that he will not press his motion to a division. If he does so, I cannot see that we have any alternative but to uphold the ruling of the  President.  Under the circumstances, I ask him to withdraw the motion. </para>

But, until the  President  made his. explanation this afternoon, I felt very earnest in my intention to vote against his ruling. In view of his explanation, however, it is reasonable to assume that we are quite at liberty to discuss the position which was likely to be opened up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> when he was interrupted on Friday last - a position which many honorable senators desire to bring under the notice of this Chamber. Seeing that the  President  is prepared to permit us to discuss that position at very limited length - such length to be left entirely to his judgment - we may safely allow his ruling to stand, with the full assurance that we shall not be unduly restricted in debate. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with very great attention to the remarks made by those honorable senators who have addressed themselves to this motion. I can assure them that I have never taken any action in this Senate with less pleasure than I experienced when I submitted this motion. I recognise frankly that, unless order is maintained, and honorable senators are kept strictly to the question at issue, our debates may roam over a very wide area. But I also recognise that there is something which is probably of even greater importance than the keeping of honorable senators strictly to the point at issue. We must always recollect that we are not a mere village debating society, whose deliberations result in nothing. We are an assembly charged with the duty of transacting the business of the country in an intelligent fashion, and with a full sense of the responsibility which attaches to  out  position. That being so, when a matter of public importance is brought before the Senate, I think that every honorable senator should be permitted, within reasonable limits, to discuss any question which may, even remotely, affect it. It was in the interests of breadth of discussion that I disagreed with your ruling, sir. The debate which has ensued, and the explanation which you have made, have confirmed me in the impression that I was right in so acting. There is one sentence in your last deliverance upon the subject, which was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie,&#39; and to which sufficient attention has not been paid.

When you, sir, gave utterance to them, you were clearly of opinion that tiny reference to the question of land nationalization within the Federal Territory would be out of order, and that was the impression which was conveyed to my mind when you called me to order after I had referred to that question. There is another aspect of this matter to which I sea reel v think sufficient attention has been directed.

                        <para>- I have not imputed motives. Only a minute ago the honorable senator said that I was turning the Senate into a bear garden. Now, I am sure that if any person were to enter this chamber whilst the honorable senator was speaking, and also whilst I was speaking, he would be forced to conclude that the one was a lion, whereas the other was a lamb. The honorable senator roars like the bulls of Bashan. I whisper my little thoughts like zephyrs. The whole situation seems to me to be a peculiar one, and one which demands that a great deal of latitude shall be extended to honorable senators. Under the terms of the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, we are asked to vote upon certain sites after they have been nominated, without debate. That being so, I think that, before we reach that stage, the lines upon which the discussion should proceed ought to be definitely laid down. On Friday last, I was attempting to deal with what I conceived to be one of the reasons why the deliberate decision of this Parliament was sought to be put into the melting pot. We have already agreed upon the Federal Capital, and have fixed the  area of the Federal Territory at not less than 900 square miles. We have also provided for access to the sea, and, if my memory serves me accurately, there was some talk about making an experiment in land nationalization within the Federal Territory. </para>

                        <para>-I have tried to find it, but, unfortunately, have not been able to do so. But I know that such a resolution was adopted by Parliament. When I spoke upon Friday last, I believed - and I still believe - that one of the reasons why this Parliament is being asked to reconsider its decision in respect of the Federal Capital is because of the large area provided for in the Seat of Government Act, and because of our expressed determination that no land within the Federal Territory shall be alienated. Of course, my assumption may be wrong, but surely I was not wrong in referring to a certain party, which, I hope, is not ashamed of its name and of its principles, which is very strongly represented in this Chamber, and which does believe in land alienation. As a matter of fact, the foundation plank of its platform is land alienation, whereas the foundation plank of the platform of the Socialist Party is that the land shall belong to the people. I do not think that there is anything wrong in making a statement of that kind, either about one party or the other, because each believes in the policy which it professes. Each believes that its way of managing the affairs of the country is the better. Consequently, with all due deference to you, sir, I think that my remarks were strictly in order. Probably I painted the picture in rather loud colours. Had I used milder terms, probably you would not have been induced to call me to order. I do not wish to drag out the debate. I suppose that honorable senators have made up their minds as to how they intend to vote. </para>

                    </talker>
                    <para>. - When I was interrupted in my remarks on this motion a few days ago I was attempting to adduce reasons why honorable senators who believe in a certain system of government ought to adhere to the choice of a Capital site made by the Parliament in  1904.  I expressed the opinion that a certain influence was brought to bear in opposition to the Dalgety site, because of its large area, and because of a resolution of this Parliament that there should be no land alienation within that area. What I intended to convey by that reference was that when we have something in hand it is well to be a little conservative if we are satisfied with it, and keep it rather than give it away with the risk that we may possibly have to substitute something very much worse for it. I was endeavouring to point out, more especially to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, that if the Seat of Government Act - which gives us an area of  900  square miles, with access to the sea, and provides for a Federal port, and complete Federal Territory, and regarding which there is a resolution on the records of the Parliament that there shall be no land alienation - if that Act and that resolution are rescinded, as they must be if this motion is carried, the whole thing will be exposed to the dangers of reconsideration. I do not intend to say anything about the advantages or disadvantages of land nationalization. On that point we are split into two well-defined camps here. There is one party which frankly believes that the private owner ought, and indeed is entitled, to secure all the community-created increment, and another party which holds that the land should be the property of the people, that it ought not to be alienated, and that the community-created value should pass, not into the pockets of private individuals, but into the public Treasury. If the Federation has a territory of  900  square miles it would have an opportunity to make an experiment - a small one, I admit, because a territory  30  miles by  30  miles cannot be said to be very large. It is not nearly of such an area as many of the sheep stations in Australia, but small as it is, it would be possible to show such an example of the benefits of land nationalization that the people of Australia might be persuaded to adopt that principle, or on the other hand, it might show the evils of land nationalization, and in that event then the Socialist Party, of which I am a member, would be compelled by the force of facts to abandon a policy which had proved itself unsuccessful. As I have said, some small experiment in that direction could be made on an area of  30  miles by  30  miles. But if the Federation is limited to an area of from  100  to  200  square miles, of. what value could any experiment possibly be? The Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> has stated distinctly that that State is not inclined to give a larger area than that which I have named namely, from  100  to  200  square miles. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> in an article which was published last week, and which I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell to read, stated distinctly that in the area proposed to be given by the New South Wales Government, there would be no opportunity for mad socialistic experiments. I think that that ought to be sufficient for any honorable gentleman who believes, as I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell does believe, in Socialism. </para>

                        <para>- I advise the honorable senator to look  U,&#39;p  the article, and if he does he will find that I have given him the sense of it. Therefore, apparently, one of the reasons why certain persons in New South Wales desire the question of the Federal Territory to be again considered is that they are dissatisfied with the lines already laid down by this Parliament. I do not wish to pursue that matter. But again I would urge that while profitable experiments might be marie in a territory such as is fixed by the Seat of Government Act  1904,  if the area is less, any experiment in &#39;that direction would be practically useless, and the whole thing would be a burlesque. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell and those who think with him to stick to Dalgety - to keep what they have obtained. T would also point out that the Federal Capital is a place where in the future we hope to have established an ammunition factory, a small-arms factory, in fact a regular arsenal, and probably factories in which a great number of articles used &#39;by the Commonwealth Government can be made. For that purpose there must be power of some kind or other available, and all the authorities agree that water power is the cheapest that can be obtained. The development of electricity by water gives power at a lower rate than any other method that can be devised. We all know the extent of the water power at Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, 1 think it is undisputed that in the Southern Monaro site there are facilities for developing water power unequalled in any possible Capital site. I again ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell to give his attention to that point. It is also probable that in time the Federal Government will establish factories in which the uniforms and the boots of its vast armies of workmen will be manufactured. I know thai all this is very unpleasing to certain honorable senators. I will not name the party to which they belong; but we all know what party it is. They want the Federal Territory to be so &#34; cribb&#39;d, cabin&#39;d and confin&#39;d &#34; that the Parliament will not be able to do a single thing within its jurisdiction except to hold its sessions. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly that is quite right, and I wish honorable senators to understand that I have nothing whatever to say against private enterprise except that when the people see their way to substitute public enterprise for private enterprise, they Have the right to do so. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has typewriting machines in his office. I suppose that thirty or forty years ago, when he commenced the practice of his profession, all his writing had to be done with the quill. Then came the steel pen. Now there is the typewriter. The honorable senator is sufficiently advanced in regard to his own business to adopt labour-saving devices. The community is entitled to do exactly the same. If the community finds that it can profitably dispense with the private capitalist, and substitute the public capitalist for him, surely no wrong is done. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that they would go to Dalgety, where they would be able to enjoy the most magnificent scenery in Australia, to feast their eyes on the Snowy, and to take exercise on Kosciusko. Possibly on some occasions the Government might provide them with a trip to the top of the mountain and supply them with snow shoes. </para>

                        <para>- I have attempted to give what I believe to be the strongest reasons why any one who believes in the extension of the principle of collectivism should vote for Dalgety rather than for any other site that has been mentioned. The water power available there is, I confess, to my mind, the greatest of the attractions. I can foresee that fifty or a hundred, years from now, the Federal Government will be employing a huge army&#39; of officials, and probably will be manufacturing a large number of articles for their consumption. Probably it will own the railways in various portions of Australia. It &#39; is extremely desirable that engine shops and other workshops should be established at the Seat of Government. There is ample water power in the Snowy to run all the machinery that would be required within the next hundred years for the development of the country. For that one reason alone, if there were no other, I should ask honorable senators who believe as I do in collectivism, to vote for Dalgety, rather than for any other site that has been discussed. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to enter into the merits of either of the sites which have been prominently brought forward. It appears to me that the Senate has become, to some extent, tied to two sites in favour of which two contending parties are struggling. We have one party in favour of Dalgety, and another in favour of Yass-Canberra. But I do not know why those are the only two sites that should be considered. It appears to me that if I desire to propose a third site, I ought to be able to do so without requiring two other honorable senators to support my nomination. I am aware that under the motion as submitted I am at liberty to nominate another site if two honorable senators will support me, but in my view that is distinctly wrong. Therefore, I propose to submit an amendment, and I will ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to be good enough to with draw his amendment temporarily to enable mine to be put. I shall ask the Senate to strike out of paragraph  2  of the motion all the words after the word &#34;senators.&#34; The effect of that will be to enable any honorable senator to propose any site. We have gone back upon an Act of Parliament passed after due deliberation with as little unconcern as the average boy has in going back upon the unwritten rules relating to kicking a tin-can along the street. </para>

                        <para>- Jervis Bay has been dragged in, but I have some doubts as to whether the offer made in respect to it is genuine or not. Should this turn out to be another repudiation by the Sydney influence that has been at work ever since we met here some seven or eight years ago, I can promise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and the Sydney influence that, if I have the honour of a place in this Chamber, the question will be re-opened again and again, until a satisfactory settlement is arrived at. I believe that I know what is the opinion of Australia on this question. We know, at all events, the opinion of Parliament. Parliament deliberately made a choice, and put that choice in an Act. Parliament stated definitely that the site of the Federal Capital should be in Southern Monaro. No good reason has been given why that decision should be altered. But we learn that Sydney is not satisfied. Sydney has not been satisfied from the beginning. Sydney did not know its own mind in the matter. I recollect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> and other representatives of New South Wales, when Dalgety was first referred to in this Chamber, pointed out the unfairness of its not being included amongst the sites of Southern Monaro with its magnificent river, which is unequalled in Australia. The Snowy offers us the only river in Australia that is snow fed. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot think so. I do not see how the River Tumut can be mentioned in comparison with the Snowy River, and certainly the Gilmore Creek, which is the source of supply for Gadara and Batlow, cannot be mentioned in the same breath with the Snowy. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and some others have forgotten what they saw of the magnificent Snowy River when they visited </para>

                <para class="block">Southern Monaro. I believe that if a referendum of the people of Australia were taken on this question, Dalgety would be chosen. Does any one mean to say that the people would vote for State reasons on a matter of this kind? I am sure that they would not. I can understand the feeling in the northern State in favour of Armidale, an excellent site, that has not received the amount of approval that it deserved. But I am quite sure, from &#34;the way in which public opinion has been expressed on this question, that a referendum, would disclose the fact that the people of Australia by a very great majority would vote in favour of Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- We saw much that we had a right to see. We saw many sites that were quite unfit for the establishment of a great  city.  Something may be urged against Southern Monaro on the score that its climate is somewhat harsh in winter, but really <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell knows no more of the climate of SouthernMonaro than I do. We should both require to reside there very much longer than we have done to be able to give a valuable opinion on the subject. No one, however, can deny that the soil is very fair, that there is excellent building material in the immediate neighbourhood, and that the water supply cannot be equalled in any part of New South Wales. There is also a very good port, within easy distance of the site. I have nothing to say against Jervis Bay. I believe that it is even a better port than Twofold Bay ; but that is not the point. Jervis Bay is within the prohibited area, but if that difficulty could be overcome, and we were assured that Jervis Bay would be given to the Commonwealth, there might be some reason to consider the claims of Canberra. I have already said, however, that should any attempt be again made by the exercise of Sydney influence to trip up this Parliament by an offer of Jervis Bay with an intention to humbug it in the matter of the area to be granted for the Federal Territory or the means of access to Canberra, I can promise those who might attempt to make use of the Federal Parliament in that way that the question will be far from being settled by the result of the ballot now proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - The present is rather a trying time for me. Honorable senators on one side say, &#34; Russell, see whom you are going to vote with.&#34; It does not frighten me to see even the high priests of conservatism prepared to vote on the same side as myself on this question. I have made up my mind as to the course which I intend to pursue. I have inspected certain proposed sites, and if I should, on this occasion, vote against those with whom I am in the habit of voting, I shall do so as the result of conscientious convictions. I have to follow the remarks, amongst others, of two of my colleagues from South Australia, Senators Guthrie and McGregor who seem to think that this matter of the Federal Capital was a burning question at the last election. I was scarcely asked a question on the subject at any meeting I addressed. </para>

                        <para>- If it was settled, what are we doing to-day ? In common with others, I had read of the various picnics by Federal members in the inspection of sites ; but I said that, so far as I was concerned, I should commit myself to no site. I said that if the opportunity offered, I should go and see for myself and judge accordingly. I gave a pledge to my constituents to that effect; but I pledged myself to no site whatever. I believe that New South Wales is entitled to be considered in this matter, and that the question is one which should be settled as soon as possible. I believe that there is, and always has been, an honorable understanding in the matter, just as there was an honorable understanding with Western Australia in regard to a certain measure. I supported compliance with the honorable understanding in the one case, and I intend to support it in the other. I do not propose to take any party view of this question. My object is to have the question settled; because I believe that New South Wales has a right to be considered, and an end should be put to all the bickering and jealousy of which we have heard so much. I was really sorry to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> references to the people of New South Wales, to the Premier of that State, and to the &#34; crowd &#34; he charged with using political influence. No man in New South Wales has ever approached me to ask me how I should vote on this question. If other honorable senators can say the same, why raise this bogy of New South Wales influence? There is nothing in it. Some honorable senators, who differ from me, have attributed to others certain reasons for their advocacy of Yass-Canberra. I shall give a few reasons why I think some honorable senators support the selection of Dalgety. In my opinion, one reason is that they are content to remain where they are. That is their policy in the matter. </para>

Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is an honorable exception. On this question I do not care whether my colleagues sit on this side or on the other. I can decide it for myself.

                        <para>- I confess that the honorable senator is sometimes a bit extreme. On any question of industrial legislation, I should consult my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> but when it comes to a question of land, let me say that I was sixty-six years of age on the 20th of last month, and I have been on the land for fifty-three years. I visited these particular parts of New South Wales with my eyes open, and I judged for myself. In the circumstances, I ask my colleagues from South Australia to consider that my opinion on such a matter is equal to, if not better than, theirs. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> had been present, I should have been inclined to include him in my list of experts, and to say that if I wished for advice on the question of corsets, I should naturally consult him. I have no wish to kill time, or to quote what has been quoted before. But I must let honorable senators know that I visited Canberra and Dalgety. I formed a certain impression of Dalgety from what I had heard from Senators McGregor and </para>

During nearly the whole of that time I have worked upon farms in South Australia and Scotland, and nobody will, I think, dispute for a moment that I mean what I say.

I recognise that the land at Canberra is particularly rich - so rich that in some parts it may be difficult to obtain a good foundation. Near the church which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> alleges has had to be bolted together - the report says that that is not so - the soil is almost good enough to grow lucerne. </para>

                        <para>- And it may be necessary to dig one at some time or other. When I visited Canberra I inquired how the land was held, and who held it, and, if I have not been misinformed, one or two individuals each hold more than  40,000  acres. It would be far better for the Commonwealth to pay the increased price that would be demanded for soil of such superior quality than to purchase inferior land. If we select Canberra, the land which is not required for building purposes can be readily cut up into ordinary-sized farms. By that means it could be made to carry a large population. But when I reached Cooma on my way to Dalgety, what a terrible scene presented itself ! There was practically nothing to be seen upon which sheep or anything else could live. I could see at a glance that the land there was quite unsuitable for the purposes of a Federal Capital. Then what a time we had in keeping our hats upon our heads in driving to Dalgety, some  30  or  40  miles away ! </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator possessed a flock of a thousand sheep he would not want to see them die, even if a large number of rabbits perished with them. It is true that at Dalgety there is a magnificent stream of water. But what is beyond it? On the hills the outcrops of rock and stone are so numerous that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> would find it difficult to get through them. Some persons say that the land is suitable for a Federal Capital site, but I venture to affirm that a lot of clearing would be necessary before any steps could be taken in that direction. I do not say that the site is not a suitable one for building purposes. It might pay to clear the rocks, but certainly they would not be fit for building purposes. My own opinion is that the land in the vicinity of Dalgety is of very poor quality indeed. If honorable senators cannot take the view which I do - I know that at heart they are the farmers&#39; friends - they might remember&#34; that we require land for blockers as well as for farmers, and that the land at Dalgety is unsuitable for this purpose. </para>

                    <para>The climate is said to be very healthy, but in winter the cold is very severe; frosts occur at most unexpected times, and frequently cause great loss to the settlers. English fruits are said to grow to great perfection, but, owing to the frosts sometimes occurring when the trees are in bloom, the crops are very uncertain. Very large yields of potatoes are sometimes obtained, but these also, owing to frosts, are uncertain. </para>

                        <para>- Any honorable senator who has travelled north of Adelaide for a couple of hundred miles knows that some of that land is about the best to be found in South Australia, but rain seldom falls. I lived there, and know all about the matter. Now and then good crops are obtained, but that may occur only once in ten seasons. Referring to the disastrous effect which frosts have on a crop, I may mention that I saw a wheat field looking as if it would yield at least twelve bushels per acre. But a frost came along when the plant was at a certain stage, and the crop was practically gone. </para>

                    <para>My father, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Reid,</inline> was the first man who occupied a station on the Monaro Plains. That was in 1828, and the middle of the run was where the town of Cooma now stands. He occupied stations comprising the larger portion of Lower Monaro until the year 1840. That particular part was then considered the very best portion of Monaro Plains. The distance from the boundary of our country to Bombala was 40 miles. It is fearfully cold country in winter, but where we were was much better country than Bombala country. Bombala is subject to exceedingly cold piercing winds. From my own knowledge I say no person in his senses would choose such a place as that for the Federal Capital. My experience was that the stock suffered more from disease, especially catarrh, there than anywhere else. I know neighbours of ours (Macfarlane Brothers) lost 10,000 sheep in a fortnight. </para>

They are seldom what could be called really fat ; nothing more than good moderate store cattle. I have had experience of putting in a crop of wheat and having it blown away by the heavy winds, which was all the easier from the sandy nature of the loam. It is not good country for agriculture. Spots here and there are good, but as a whole it is unsuitable, and would not support a large population. On the eastern side from the top of the mountain to the sea you get fair timber, but on the main portion the timber is useless except for fuel. The soil generally is shallow and very stony except in spots. It has never to my knowledge brought forward any produce of consequence. Through the dryness of the country and its being unsuitable for agriculture and bad for stock I found, after my father died, I could do no good ; so left there in 1840, the property having been in our possession for twelve years. I went to the north-west of Victoria, and have been there and on the Murray ever since. </para>

                    There are not likely to be any manufacturing interests in the close vicinity of Barren Jack to absorb the power which will be running to waste. This immense body of water will be passing down to the Lower Murrumbidgee, and will remain unutilized unless the Commonwealth Government comes along with some proposal for its absorption. But, as the honorable member for Lang reminds me, this scheme is merely a supplementary one. The engineers state that sufficient power for all purposes can be generated within the area which will be Federal territory.

                    No, we shall require a larger area than that. From the stand-point of a domestic water supply there is sufficient available in the near vicinity of Canberra to provide by means of gravitation for a population of many times larger than that which will need to be provided for According to my estimate, within 30 miles of Canberra a sufficient supply is available to meet the requirements of nearly 2,000,000 people.

                    Yes, and to supply that number by means of gravitation and not by pumping. These facts dispose of the suggestion that a domestic supply cannot be obtained.

                    The supply mentioned in their estimate is sufficient for approximately 2,000,000 persons. If during the first twenty years of its existence we have a population of 50,000 at the Federal Capital, I think it will be going ahead just as rapidly as most of us anticipate. When we realize that the Cotter River catchment is sufficient to provide for 250,000 inhabitants we can cast aside all the other schemes except on the&#39; ground of expense. I merely wish to show the ample supply of water that is available if we choose to tap all these various sources. Another feature which has been alluded to as of all importance in connexion with this question is that of climate. I do not contend that the climate of Dalgety is likely to be an unhealthy one. Probably it might have a bad effect upon delicate persons, but upon persons of ordinarily robust constitutions I do not think that it would be objectionable, except from the stand-point of comfort. My opinion is that a city at the elevation of Dalgety site, having regard to its exposed position, is bound to suffer severely from bitter winds in the winter.

                        I am always on the alert when the Minister of Trade and Customs makes a statement, because it is safe to assume that he has something concealed. Within 5 miles of Canberra, on the Queanbeyan side, there is exceedingly poor land. I am not to be &#34; got at &#34; by a suggestion of that sort. I am speaking of the quality of the land within the respective sites themselves and within a reasonable distance of them. The good land upon the Canberra site commences about 5 miles out of Queanbeyan, and continues for 40 miles to Yass. The site itself is upon good soil - in fact, I think that some of it is too good to build upon.

It is not so at Dalgety, and that fact alone is sufficient to make new members of the Senate, who are not committed to what has been done in the past, doubtful as to whether a sound decision was arrived at. On this occasion I have to fight with ray colleagues. I regret having to do so. They have been fighting me hard, and have received assistance from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> They endeavoured to convert me.

                        <para>- It was mentioned by me. I dwelt upon the subject, and told my supporters that I would use my own judgment. They sent me here to do so. Is my judgment, then, to be guided entirely by the views of those with  whom I usually vote? I am sorry to differ from them. I am aware that some people in South Australia who have read the speeches of my colleagues have rather taken me to task on account of my attitude. They consider that I am on the wrong track. But I have said to them, &#34;Dome the honour of reading my speech in my own defence, and my advocacy of the site which I shall support.&#34; Is not that a fair attitude? I have had fifty-five years&#39; experience on the land. Still, I do not claim to be an expert. Other members of the Senate may know more about land than I do. But my experience must have taught me something, and it has satisfied me from observation that the land at &#39;Canberra is far superior and more suitable in every respect than that at Dalgety. While there I imagined myself in the position of the holder of a block of land in the locality, if it were possible to get it from the land monopolists. I made inquiry of the local miller as to the cost per bushel of sending a truck load of wheat from Queanbeyan to Sydney. The miller was, of course, an advocate of the Canberra site. He referred me to the railway stationmaster. He gave me two samples of wheat grown there, which I have still in my possession, but which I need not produce, because no one will deny that wheat can be grown in the district. The railway is only some eight miles from the proposed site at Canberra, and I knew from the <inline font-style="italic">Railway Guide</inline> how far it was from Sydney. The stationmaster told me that it would cost only 4|d. per bushel to send a truckload of wheat from Queanbeyan to Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- I think that he said it was  20  bushels per acre. But I may be wrong. I remind honorable senators that in such a matter a miller might have an axe to grind, and so might exaggerate the yield. The fact that a great deal of the land had been under cultivation at one time and had ceased to be cultivated did not support his statement. However, I know that the land is suitable for wheat, and if it became the property of the Commonwealth, settlers with their families from many parts of the Commonwealth could be accommodated with land there. I apologize to honorable senators for taking up so much of their time. I have no axe to grind. South Australia has given me a free hand in this matter. I have heard many electors of South Australia say, &#34; VVhy not leave the Federal Parliament in Melbourne?&#34; But my reply has been, &#34; We have an honorable understanding, and as an honorable man, and your representative, I intend to do all T possibly can to see that that understanding is honorably and fairly carried out.&#34; I cannot overlook the fact that it is not nice for me to have to vote against my colleagues in the Labour Party. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it would be just as well to correct some of the closing remarks of the last  speaker,  who seems to be under the impression that this question is to be decided from a party point of view. Personally, I hope to view the matter entirely apart from the party with whom I am associated. In discussing the subject, I am at a serious disadvantage in not having visited the proposed Capital sites, and in having to rely, in a great measure, upon the opinions expressed by honorable senators who have visited them, and by experts who have dealt with the question. In view of the very emphatic, and it would seem very satisfactory, way in which it was settled some four years ago, I regret that the matter is now to be reopened. We know that influence is often brought to bear to reopen a question which has been settled in  5,  certain way, and it would seem that like other questions, that of the selection of the Capital site is to be resurrected, with a view to its settlement in a different way. I am supporting the selection of Dalgety, and I hope that site will be adopted by the Senate. I trust it will not be assumed that I have any desire to run counter to the interests of the State in which the Federal </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Capital must be located. It would seem to be the opinion, held in certain quarters, that a member of. this Parliament who shows any disinclination to favour Yass-Canberra, is necessarily opposed to the opinions and wishes of the people of New South Wales, as expressed through their public men. I do not wish to be included in the list of those &#39;who are suffering from that misrepresentation at the present time. I wish to see the question settled, and settled quickly. When I had an opportunity to refer to the matter before those who sent me to this Parliament, I expressed the view that the best thing that could happen would be the settlement of this question without any unnecessary delay, and that to continue to have the Seat of Government in this over-grown city of Melbourne, or to transfer it to Sydney, would be the most foolish course which Parliament could follow. The opinion is frequently expressed that so long as the Seat of Government is in Melbourne, our legislation is affected by Victorian State influence. I do not say that the opinion is well founded, but if the Federal Parliament were to meet in any of the other State capitals, the opinion would still obtain that Federal legislation was, to some extent, affected by State influence. That should be accepted as a substantial reason for taking action as soon as possible to remove the Federal Parliament &#39;from the influence of either Melbourne or Sydney, to our own Federal Territory. The first difficulty with which we are met in discussing the question is, that we have the wishes of New South Wales to consider. New South Wales has expressed so many wishes on this question, or rather, has expressed its wish so differently at different times, that it is difficult to know what it is. We had, for instance, one expression of opinion in the earlier years of Federation, through the then Premier of New South Wales, that the Federal Parliament was free to accept one of three sites. That is on record, and in order that it may not be lost sight of, I propose to quote what was the feeling in New South Wales in 1901, when the question of the Federal Capital was first mentioned. The first movement towards a settlement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund,</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice,</inline> Barton, who, as Prime Minister, referred the question to the Government of New South Wales, through the Premier of that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. See.</inline> On the 17th April, 1901, the Premier of </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with regard to the site for the Federal Capital of the Commonwealth, I have the honour to submit to your Government the choice of the three sites mentioned in the report of the Royal Commission which was appointed to collect evidence with reference to the suitability of the sites for the purpose. </para>
                    <para>A copy of that report is now forwarded herewith, and from the appendices attached thereto all particulars as to area, position, water supply, ite, can be obtained. </para>
                    <para>I desire also to state that if any other site in New South Wales be considered by your Government to be more suitable for the purpose of the Federal Capital than those recommended in the report, I shall be glad to receive any further representations from you, and will endeavour, as far as possible, to meet your views. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The point to which I wish to direct attention is the feeling which existed in New South Wales at the time these three sites were offered to the Commonwealth Government. Surely, if we are going to be influenced by the feeling which is exhibited there to-day, we should also pay heed to that which prevailed there seven years ago. &#62;I,f honorable senators have any curiosity upon the subject, may I call their attention to the fact that seven years ago the leading public men of New South Wales regarded clause 87 of the Constitution, which was then known as the &#34; Braddon blot,&#34; as its most serious blemish. </para>

                        <para>- For some reason or other the opinion which was held in New South Wales seven or eight years ago upon the question of the Federal Capital is not held to-day. Similarly, the opinion which was entertained by that State of the Braddon blot nine years ago is not now entertained. On the contrary, that provision is regarded as the financial salvation of the small States, and as providing their only safeguard against encroachments on the part of the Federal Treasurer. In view of the change of feeling which has taken place in New South Wales upon the Federal Capital question, what warrant have we for believing that it will not again swing round to the view which was held in 1901 ? To-day, the public men of that State who profess to voice the feeling of the electors declare that the opinion which was held seven years ago was the wrong one. In view of the whimsical character of the opinion of New South Wales- </para>

                        <para>- I have no intention of doing so. The feeling of the people of New South Wales is being put forward as the main reason why this Parliament should revoke its former decision upon the Capital site question. Why? In order that we may comply with the wishes, not of the entire people of New South Wales, but of a mere section which is located in Sydney. I hold that we are not entitled to undo the work of the past in view of the very variable feeling upon this question which has obtained in New South Wales. Seven years ago, the Premier of that State gave this Parliament the choice of three sites, including that of Southern Monaro. He also went further, and invited this Parliament - if it were not satisfied with any of those sites - to nominate another site, promising that if it did so, his Government would consider its choice. So that seven years ago the Government of New South Wales were much more accommodating than are the present Government of that Stale. In dealing with this question, we have been asked to rely upon  the opinions of experts. Now, when experts are called upon to give us the best advice at their command, it is only right that they should put that advice in a form which is not open to challenge. In Parliamentary Paper, No. 9, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Engineer of Water Supply in New South Wales, shows that at Canberra there is a water supply capable of meeting the requirements of 250,000 inhabitants. He says - </para>

                <para class="block">But in another report which is contained in Parliamentary Paper, No. 137, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh, who is apparently a lieutenant of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade&#39;s</inline> - at the time of which I speak he was acting engineer of rivers and drainage - commits himself to an entirely different opinion regarding the capacity of the Cotter River.

                    <para>The catchment above this dam site is no square miles, and the average daily flow of the river amounts to 59,000,000 gallons, or twelve times the 5,000,000 required for the city supply. </para>

                <para class="block">In his calculation, he allows 100 gallons per unit of the population per diem, so that for a city of 50,000 inhabitants, he would require a supply of 5,000,000 gallons daily. These figures indicate that the catchment area of no square miles would supply sufficient water to meet the requirements of 600,000 inhabitants. There is thus a serious discrepancy between the recorded opinions of two experts. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the honorable senator will be guided by these experts in arriving at a conclusion. In the same paper <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh states that the total catchment area of the Cotter River to its junction with the Murrumbidgee is 160 square miles, and yet on the next page he asserts that the catchment area above the dam is no square miles, and that the average daily flow of the river amounts to 59,000,000 gallons. Those two measurements give a total catchment area of 270 square miles, but in the first part of his report he says that the total catchment area of the Cotter River to its junction with the Murrumbidgee River is only 165 square miles. In the same document we find a discrepancy of 105 square miles in regard to the catchment area alone. Honorable senators may think that it is a small matter, but I submit that when an expert officer of high standing in the Public Works Department of New South Wales is asked to make a report for our guidance we are entitled to expect that he will be correct, that his deduction will be sound, and, above all, that his figures will be beyond challenge. But here, in regard to the catchment area alone, a difference of 105 square miles is disclosed. That is a very serious error in a report which was compiled for our guidance. I have already shown that as regards the capacity of the Cotter River, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh differ to the extent of a supply equal to the requirements of 350,000 persons. Honorable senators will be quite justified, I submit, in refusing to allow their reports to influence their decision on this question. Next we have the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. I am not suggesting that I respect his opinion so far as hydraulic engineering is concerned. He visited the Canberra site, and embodied certain particulars in a report. He represented that the maximum supply of the Cotter River is 5,000,000 gallons per day. We shall be quite safe if we allow a large discount from even his calculations. There is a marvellous difference between a daily supply of 5,000,000 gallons, which would serve only 50,000 persons, and . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh&#39;s calculation, that the Cotter River would supply a population of 600,000 persons. </para>

It sets forth that he took notice of the flow of the Cotter River, and came to the conclusion that it was about 5,000^00 gallons per day.&#34; It might, or it might not, increase in a wet season, but he also stated that that quantity could not be depended upon. </para>

                        <para>- I mentioned the Micalong Creek. I have been favoured by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> Newspaper Company with a pictorial souvenir showing the junction of the Cotter Creek, as it is called, with the Murrumbidgee River. I ask every honorable senator to seriously ponder over the picture and ask himself how, by any stretch of the imagination, a small wet place of that kind could supply the requirements of the Capital of the Commonwealth. Apparently the alleged river is about  8  feet wide, and very ordinary stones are to be seen sticking through its bed. The Murrumbidgee River is shown immediately to the left. I feel certain that if any honorable senator will carefully study this photograph, which conveys very vividly the position of the Cotter River where it junctions with the Murrumbidgee River, he will ponder deeply before he votes for a site with that kind of water supply. </para>

                        <para>- The photograph was taken on the spot, and is, I believe, a true representation of the locality where the Cotter Creek junctions with the MumimbidgeeRiver. The cost of getting a water supply to the Federal Capital is a most important point. Of course, we have to rely upon the advice of men who up to the present time have not made any actual test of the capacity of the Cotter River. Its flow has never been measured, and consequently the engineers in the Public Works Department of New South Wales had to resort toguesswork. </para>

                        <para>- We have not had the advantage of an exhaustive report upon the capacity of the Cotter River. So far as gauging is concerned, the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh is quite valueless, because it was based upon data which evidently was derived from the flow of the Murray River on the other side of the range. I consider that honorable senators are not entitled to take into serious consideration a report which is shown to be full of inaccuracies in regard to the matter of water supply. On the question of cost we have to rely upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh. He shows that a gravitation scheme for the Federal Capital would cost about &#163;853,000. </para>

                        <para>- We have also, as evidence, this&#39; dotted map of several sites scattered over an area of 50 miles by about 35 ; and if the suggested supply from the Cotter is extended further afield, it will mean an additional cost for water supply above the &#163;833,000 mentioned. Supposing that it is extended so far as to be brought down to Yass itself, a distance of about 45 miles, the cost of additional piping, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh, would amount to &#163;706,000. So that if the town of Yass is to be supplied from the Cotter, it will mean nothing less than an expenditure of &#163;1,659,000. Of course, I recognise that another scheme has been put forward. We have the scheme of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seaver,</inline> who reported to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver.</inline> He, however, plainly acknowledges that if the town of Yass be selected as the Capital site, there will be no earthly hope of getting a supply from the Goodradigbee Creek. The only supply which, in his opinion, is worthy of consideration is that from the Micalong Creek ; and that source, according to his authority, is only sufficient to supply 50,000 persons. </para>

                        <para>-  With the permission of the Senate, I should like, before the sitting is suspended, to ask the Minister a question. It is understood that a number of honorable senators wish to speak. It does not seem to be possible that we can close the debate to-night. That being so, would the Minister agree to the suggestion that the debate be closed tomorrow, and that the ballot take place on Friday morning instead of to-morrow? If the Minister could see his way to assent to that proposal, every honorable senator would know that he had to be present on Friday. </para>

                        <para>- That site is mentioned as the possible rival to Dalgety, and is the only site, it would seem, that pleases the people of Sydney, who take it upon themselves to speak for New South Wales. The only means we have of arriving, at a conclusion as to whether or not a suitable water supply can be obtained for Yass, is by reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver&#39;s</inline> report. On page 63 of that document, we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seaver,</inline> an officer of the New South Wales Public Works Department, when sent on a. mission to discover a suitable water supply for Yass, found that there were only two places at which a supply could be obtained, one of which he discarded instantly, on account of its insufficiency. The creek upon which he depended is named the Micalong. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sea\,er</inline> discarded the Goodradigbee Creek, because he thought it was inadequate for the requirements of a capital city. He said, &#34; I satisfied myself that such a scheme was out of the question.&#34; He was driven back upon the possibility of finding a suitable supply from the Micalong, and that, as the plan shows, is the only possible source from which Yass could be supplied. The summing up of this officer is not very favorable to the Micalong Creek. He found that the watershed of the creek has an area of  44  square miles, on which are a few settlers, but no agricultural land. There are a few miners washing gold. To judge of the amount of water likely to be furnished from a watershed of  44  square miles, we can compare the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Engineer for Water Supply, New South Wales, that a catchment of no&#39; square miles would supply enough water for  250,000  people. Upon that basis, we can calculate that the Micalong Creek could supply  100,000.  Consequently, we are faced with the position that the only possible supply for the site of Yass, apart from Canberra, is from the Micalong Creek, with a watershed of  44  square miles, capable of supplying  100,000  people. That, I say, is hopelessly inadequate. Of course, it would take some time for the Capital to attain to such a population. That will be in the &#34; sweet, by-and-by.&#34; But we are laying the foundations of a city that we hope is to endure for all time, and we ought to make better provision than for a population of  100,000. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. If the honorable senator thinks that we are never to have .in the Federal city a larger population than  100,000,  what becomes of the anxiety that he sometimes displays on behalf of an immigration policy? If he thinks that the Federal Capital will never have a larger population than that, his expectations are very limited. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator quotes <inline font-style="italic">zn</inline> expert whom I do not regard as accurate. There are at least three inaccuracies in his report. But he is quite a good enough authority to quote in favour of a losing cause. The other alternative in regard to Yass is the supply from the Cotter River, but to bring water from the Cotter, as shown on the plan, means taking it an extra distance of  45  miles, and, calculating on the basis of a  27-in.  pipe, as shown by that more or less unreliable authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh, the cost would be about  ,&#163;400,000.  These facts should encourage us to dismiss from our minds, once and for all, the possibility of Yass and its neighbourhood becoming the site of the Federal Capital. These matters have been thrashed out before, and the arguments are almost threadbare. But it would seem that something still has to be said in the hope of assuring those who have not had an opportunity of visiting the several sites that there are special features marking out Dalgety as the superior one. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver&#39;s</inline> report shows that the motive power to be obtained from the water supply at Dalgety, gives it advantages which no other piece of country in the Commonwealth can equal. From the report it is clear that there is there a great volume of water-power flowing to the sea unused. Referring to a report on the subject by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pridham,</inline> he says - </para>

                    <para>It will be seen from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pridham&#39;s</inline> report that the Snowy River, at a distance of about 15 miles from the proposed city site at Lord&#39;s Hill, affords a supply obtainable by pumping, equal to the requirements of a population of 500,000. But that is not all, for the same river at a point near the junction of the McLaughlan, gives a fall of no less than 200 feet in 3&#188; miles, thus affording sufficient water power, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pridham,</inline> not only for pumping all the water required and for electric lighting and tram traction, but also for operating the proposed railways from Cooma to Delegate and from Bombala to Eden by electricity, the transmission lines for the current being very much shorter than many now in use in the United States. The power thus obtainable from the Snowy River he estimates at 20,000 horse-power, and this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pridham</inline> distributes as follows :  - </para>
                    <para>For electric lighting - 600 horse-power. </para>

                    <para>For operating trains four each way on two lines, equal to sixteen trains per day, at, say, 1,000 horse-power each - 16,000 horse-power. </para>
                    <para>Total, say - 20,000 horse-power. </para>
                    <para>In addition to this, 20,000 horse-power, at a fall of 300 feet lower down the same river, at about 30 miles from the city site, 68,000 additional horse-power could, if required, be obtained, and the same economical power could be used for the Gippsland railway extension, from Orbost to the border, for the Snowy River is described by those who know the country it passes through as being almost one prolonged series of rapids within a few miles of Orbost. At the time of my inquiry this most munificent natural gift of power was never brought under my notice.  1 have been asked what are the special qualifications of Dalgety. That is certainly one which honorable senators should not ignore in selecting the site of the Federal Capital. The possession of a stream affording  68,000  horse power is a qualification which is not held by any other portion of the Commonwealth. If the Capital site were located in the Yass-Canberra district, it would be impossible to obtain by gravitation even one donkey power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has declared himself on this question, but, I am inclined to think, only in a tentative way.

                        <para>- I come next to the strong objection to Dalgety, that the climate there is cold. This discovery has apparently just been made. It was not known eighteen months ago, and only became known when Premier Wade, of New South Wales, told certain people to make the discovery. Although the Commonwealth lies largely within tropical and sub-tropical latitudes, I challenge honorable senators to deny that the evidence of all history goes to show that the hardiest of the white races are those who come from the colder climates. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has urged an objection, based upon what he thinks will be the centre of population in the Commonwealth. According to the honorable senator&#39;s strange theory, it would seem that London ought to be shifted, because as the capital of England, it is situated far too much to the south. In the same way, Washington is situated too much to the east, and Paris too much to the north, if there is anything in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> theory. However, I do not think that the honorable senator advanced his real reason for objecting to Dalgety. I think that he had other substantial reasons which he did not disclose to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I have mentioned one or two countries, the capitals of which ought to be removed from their present situation, if there is anything in the honorable senator&#39;s theory. Touching the frigidity of Dalgety, which has so recently caused some politicians to shiver. I find that the lowest temperature recorded for Dalgety is  11  degrees above freezing point, whilst the winter temperature of Ottawa is 4 degrees below freezing point. I am now dealing with one of the stock objections urged against Dalgety, namely, its low temperature. The lowest temperatures ever recorded in the various capitals of the world are as follow :  - Ottawa,  31  degrees below zero; London, 4 degrees below zero; Berlin, 9 degrees below zero; Madrid,  10  degrees above zero; Paris,10 degrees below zero ; St. Petersburg, 10 decrees below zero; and Washington, 15 degrees below zero. It is apparent, therefore, that the temperature of Dalgety, which has been declared&#39; to resemble that of an iceberg, is not so low as that of any of these cities. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the lowest temperature ever recorded at Hobart was 27 degrees, as against 11 degrees recorded at Dalgety. The latter place is much warmer than are the capitals of the most important countries in the world, and is, therefore, not entitled to receive scant consideration at the hands of honorable senators upon the ground of its coldness. I am not so much astonished at this sudden discovery of the frigidity of the lower Monaro strip of country as I am at the inexplicable change of attitude on the part of certain honorable senators. When this question was under consideration four years ago, some honorable senators opposite were loud in their praises of Dalgety. They declared that no other site in New South Wales possessed the same merits. But for some -unknown reason they are now opposing the selection of that site. </para>

                    <para>I was in favour of a Southern Monaro site, but if it is to be a question between Dalgety and Bombala, I am not competent to settle it. I recollect that when I visited Dalgety I thought the scenery was magnificent, and I preferred it to the scenery of the Bombala site. The Snowy River runs right through the township, and to have that river running through the Federal Capital would be a very great advantage indeed. I was exceedingly pleased, also, with the Bombala site, with the rivers there, and the undulating, well-grassed country. With respect to all these matters, I think I shall have done my duty if I indicate by my voice the locality in which I think the Federal Capital site should be situated, and it should be left for surveyors, engineers, and other experts to decide as between Dalgety and Bombala, the precise site for the capital. I am, therefore, in favour of the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that it would be better to include in the Bill a refer.ence to Southern Monaro, which will include both Bombala and Dalgety, as they are practically in the same locality. That the question is not now ripe for settlement is shown by the arguments we have heard from Senators Symon, Pearce, and other honorable senators. ... I say that the question is not ripe for settlement, and, therefore, we ought not to pass this Bill in the form in which it is before us. I am satisfied that the Southern Monaro site is a suitable one in which to locate the Federal Capital. </para>

From his interjections during this debate, I gather that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is very pronounced in his opposition to Dalgety.

                <para>No; he has said that he was not long enough there to be able to speak definitely with respect to the climate. Last season we had before us a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maiden,</inline> the Curator of the Botanical Gardens at Sydney, and that gentleman is of opinion that all plants, shrubs,  and flowers, usually grown in temperate climates, can be grown easily and profitably at Bombala or Dalgety. </para>
                <para class="block">I contend that it would not be wise for this Parliament to locate the permanent Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in a place where it will ultimately become a mere suburb of the city of Sydney. It would be a bad thing for the national Legislature to lend itself to an act which would conduce to the expansion of our existing cities. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> Sydney possessed in 1871 only 27 per cent, of the population of New South Wales, whereas in  1903  it possessed 35 per cent, of that population. In other words, during eight years, it had attracted within its boundaries an increase of 8 per cent, of the total population of New South Wales. Similarly in 1871 Melbourne possessed 28 per cent, of the population of Victoria, but in 1903 it possessed 41 per cent, of that population. Nearly half the population of Victoria is thus centred in this city. Brisbane in j 87 1 contained 12 per cent, of the population of Queensland, as against 23 per cent, of that population in  1903.  Adelaide in 1871 contained 23 per cent, of the population of South Australia, but in  1903  it possessed 4,5 per cent, of that population. The only city in Australia the population of which has declined is that of Perth. In Western Australia the population is more evenly distributed over the whole State than is that in the other States of the Commonwealth. In 187  1  Perth contained 20.6 of the population of the young and thriving State of Western Australia, while in 1903 it had 20.4. In 187 1 Wellington contained 3 per cent, of the population of New Zealand, and 6 per cent, in 1903. I believe that one of the contributing causes of the steady prosperity of the Dominion has been the even distribution of its population throughout the country districts and the cities. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that I have shown the processes which have been at work, and to which honorable senators cannot afford to shut their eyes. No matter what method is advocated, we should always give our steady support to a movement which would insure a more even distribution of the people in this island continent, especially in the rural districts. If we choose the Canberra site it will simply promote the commercial aggrandizement of Sydney. It will increase still further the value of land in the State, and make the Federal Capital not what it ought to be,, and what was intended by the framers of the Constitution  - a model city to stand out for all time - but simply a country suburb of Sydney, and that I strongly object to. If New South Wales is wise in its generation, and will only, adopt the opinion which was expressed by&#93; Premier See in 1901, and to which no objection was taken - that Dalgety was a suitable site - I venture to say that it will not only help Sydney, but also assist the State very materially. lt will create in the Southern Monaro district, which up to the present time has Been neglected, a new province. </para>

                        <para>- I  am sufficiently aware of the meaning of that word not to hazard the experiment of placing the Federal Capital where it would be a mere appendage of Sydney. Whilst  I  am anxious to see this vexed question settled as soon as possible, at the same time  I  cannot consent to vote for a site which  I  believe would not be in the best interests of the future requirements of the Commonwealth and the millions of persons who have yet to come.  I  do not desire to see the Federal Capital erected in a place which would not do credit to our country and would hamper the administration of Federal affairs. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so.  I  am pleased to recognise that Newcastle is an independent place, and  I  hope that it will continue to progress.  I  desire to carry out to the very letter, and as soon as possible, the bargain which was made with New South Wales. But if we are to be guided by precedent, Sydney was hardly entitled to the stipulation which was made in her favour so readily by the representatives of other States. The United States had a &#34; ma,&#34; or parent State, but it made no such stipulation as did New South Wales when the Federal Constitution was being framed. There were several contending States, and not&#39; only did they not offer any obstacles to the selection of a site for the Federal Capital, but they went out of their way on several occasions, and by different means, to offer every advantage for the purpose of selecting the best site, and, if need be, for financing the erection of the capital. The trend of feeling in the United States at the time is brought out in <inline font-style="italic">Studies in Historical and Political Science,</inline> by John Addison Porter in a paper on &#34; The City of Washington.&#34; At page 6 he says - </para>

                    <para>The list of a score or more places which were &#34; named for the honour &#34; (some of them in the merely complimentary sense in which &#34; favorite sons &#34; of States are nowadays named for the Presidency) is chiefly remarkable for the number of insignificant names which it contains. New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were indeed there. But there were others then unknown to fame, and which it is now not easy to find upon the map. </para>

                <para>Apparently some insignificant places such as Yass and Canberra were proposed for selection as a site, which, after all, did not find favour with Congress. </para>
                <para>Whatever  errors Congress committed, the patriotic reader may be profoundly thankful for some things which they did <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> do in the location of a capital. </para>
                <para>During the seven years when the subject was under serious discussion, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> between 1783 and 1790, the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia. Maryland, and New Jersey were actively represented in the competition. Memorials were received from the Legislatures of New Jersey and Pennsylvania favoring some position on the banks of the Delaware. Afterwards the Susquehanna was hotly urged in place of the Potomac, named at an early date by the Virginians. Trenton and Annapolis, which had been tried and liked by the Continental Congress, were formally offered, and as quickly refused. Maryland in 1778, and Virginia in 1779, generously agreed, through their representatives in Congress, to cede <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> district 10 square miles within their borders which Congress might desire to occupy as the permanent seat of Government. Virginia asked the co-operation of Maryland in inducing Congress to accept the grant, and pledged herself to furnish a sum not to exceed $120,000 for the public buildings, provided Maryland would raise at least two-fifths of the total amount. Through the early debates of Congress on this subject there was an evident concurrence that the state or city which received the capital should do <inline font-style="italic">something</inline> to promote its prosperity. </para>
                <para>I  want honorable senators to note the feeling which distinguished the States which comprised the young Republic in this matter of selecting a site for its Capital. </para>

                    <para>The attractive country near Philadelphia seemed to fulfil these requirements. On the 27th September, 1789, a motion to place the Capital in a district 10 miles square, at Germantown, Pennsylvania, passed both Houses of Congress, and was finally lost only because the Senate adjourned before having time to consider a slight amendment which the Representatives had offered to the original Bill. At the busy session in the spring of the following year, at New- York, the complexion and temper of both Houses were considerably altered, and the choice, which the Pennsylvanians had reason to expect, was lost to them for ever. </para>

We have heard the site denounced as a blizzard-swept plain, and an uninhabitable barren region. There was the exact counterpart of such a party in the United States 100 years ago.

                <para class="block">That is sufficient to show that there were difficulties attending the selection of the Capital in America, although there was not there any particular Mother State which considered that it had claims to have the Capital situated within its borders. What do we find on the site of that &#34; howling malarious wilderness &#39; &#39; to-day ? In the early part of 1800 - only 108 years ago - there were only a few Dutch settlers to be found there. To-day there is a population of 278,000 people. When the Washington site was agreed upon, there were fewer than 5,000,000 people in the United States. In the meantime, the population has increased to 80,000,000. Is that not a reasonable ground for asking honorable senators to listen to my humble appeal when I point out to them that the utmost water supply that can be obtained for a Capital city at Yass-Canberra would only be sufficient, according to one authority, for 100,000 people, and according to another for 158,000. I have noticed that the water supply possibilities of Yass-Canberra have grown almost like Jack&#39;s beanstalk. We now have it stated that there is a water supply sufficient for 250,000 people, or even for 850,000. I, however, am not prepared to support a proposal that means planting the Federal Capital at a place which, according to the best evidence, has not water supply possibilities which would enable the city to grow. I appeal to honorable senators to recollect that there is an </para>
                <para class="block">Act of Parliament on the statute-book already declaring Dalgety as the selected site. If this question is again reopened, it may lead to an indefinite postponement of a. settlement. I ask honorable senators to remember that if Yass-Canberra is selected there may be no appeal from that decision, unless perhaps with the utmost difficulty and by mere chance. The whole question may be determined by the present decision. This is no mere experiment. We can afford to experiment in regard to other legislation. But we are now laying the foundations of a Capital city for this young nation. It becomes us to be circumspect, and not to allow a Legislature which represents 4,000,000 people to bow to the dictation of one element in one State, which has been the means of reversing a decision universally favoured by the rest of Australia. We are asked to reverse this decision in favour of a place that has all the disqualifications and drawbacks that a site for a Capital city could possibly possess, as far as I can judge. We are building for all time. We are building, not in the interests of a particular locality, or for a particular State, but for a continent. I particularly appeal to the New South Wales senators, and ask them to remember that if the Capital is situated at Dalgety, it will be in a cool region, where we can rear the best type of manhood, and where at the same time we shall be the means of opening up a new province for the State. I feel confident that the selection of Dalgety would conduce to a much greater advance for New South Wales than would the selection of a site in what I must regard as a mere suburb of Sydney. I ask those honorable senators who have not so far addressed themselves to this question, and especially those who in the past looked with a friendly eye on Dalgety, to remember their former attitude, and once more to cast a vote in favour of the most suitable site. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> with a great deal of interest. He has made a very strong appeal in favour of  Dalgety,  a site which he admits he has never seen. I do not know how he could work up so much enthusiasm for a place of which he has no knowledge. Now, I visited Dalgety, and I must acknowledge that I went there with the intention of finding evidence in its favour. From what I had read in the various newspapers, and especially in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> I was prepared to vote for it. When I left Melbourne, I thought that I should see a place that would be something beyond the common. To my great surprise I found that it was indeed a place beyond the common, although I cannot use that term in a favorable sense. Various other honorable senators and members of the other Chamber were members of the party of which I formed one, and some of them made in my hearing remarks which will cause me to watch with a great deal of interest how they vote. I shall not mention any names, but I may say, though acknowledging that every honorable senator has a perfect right to vote as he thinks fit, that every man who was there and who expressed an opinion, was against Dalgety, and acknowledged that it was an impossible place for the Capital. I came to the conclusion that we could hardly select a more unfitting site. I have also visited Canberra and Tooma. Of the three places that I have seen, Canberra in my opinion is the best. If I had my way, however, I should try to place the Capital further north. I should like to see it at Armidale or Glen Innes, or on the tableland country. Tumut is also a suitable place, I believe, though I have not seen it, and cannot therefore speak in its praise. I do not intend to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> example and praise a place unless I have seen it. Much has been said with regard to climate. Well, I visited Dalgety in the month of August last year, and I must say that the climate is one which I do not wish to have &#39;experience of again. I believe that every person who was there was only ibo glad to get away. We were told when we complained of the wind, &#34;Oh, you should have been here last week; the coach was blown over then &#34; ! </para>

                        <para>- I was talking to people who had experienced what they described. As to the soil of Dalgety, we were shown the proposed site of the Capital, and saw there a mass of granite rock with 6 or 8 inches of soil on the top of it in parts. There was not a blade of grass to be seen upon it. There is a forest some distance away, but there is not a tree with a straight limb in it. Further west they have planted  some trees of the pine species to guard the town from the blizzards, and these trees all stand at  an angle of 45 degrees. At an hotel where we stayed there is a little bit of garden upon which an attempt was made to grow a few shrubs ; but the wind had blown them out by the roots, and had also blown away the little bit of soil, leaving the granite bare. ,If ever the soil around Dalgety is broken, by putting a plough into it, I am satisfied that the 6 or 8 inches of soil &#39;on the top will all be blown away. In one part of the country we found that a new rabbit-proof fence had been put up. It was . perfectly new when we first saw it. But when we came back, a wind storm had shifted the leaves and sand until they were actually level with the top of the fence, and the tracks of the rabbits were to be seen on the top. This is the place that we are told is a splendid site for the Federal Capital ! We are assured by gentlemen who have never seen it that it is the best place in Australia ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> quotes <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and other authorities when it suits his purpose; but I am sure that if it did not suit his purpose he would not accept what they have said. A place with a climate like that of Dalgety is certainly not suitable, and we should not go there if we want to rear a hardy race of people. If honorable senators would like to see a piece of country where a hardy race could be- brought up I refer them to the tableland in Central Queensland. Young men from that part of the Commonwealth go to Great Britain to play football, and Rugby football at that. Eventually I believe the bulk of the population of Australia will be settled in the country between Central Queensland and tire northern half of New South Wales. At present more than half of the population of Australia is to be found in the two States named. If we select Dalgety for the Seat of Government . we shall find that within twenty-five years the people will say, &#34; We do not desire the . Seat of Government to remain in such a place. We do not wish to have to send our middle-aged people to die there. We ought to select a place, which has not such extremes of heat and cold.&#34; I have some figures dealing with the two sites which I might quote. For instance, I find that the mean annual rainfall for twelve years of Dalgety is 19 inches, and of Yass-Canberra &#62;8 inches. Honorable senators will notice the great difference. </para>

                        <para>- It is here in print. We should select a place with a good rainfall and a mild climate. I admit that in winter the temperature of Yass-Canberra is not more than four or five degrees higher than that of Dalgety, but from a health point of view that is an important difference. A very great deal has been said about the Snowy River, and I do not hesitate to admit that it is a splendid river. We have been told to-night that rocks can be seen in the Cotter River, but rocks can also be seen in the Snowy River, and perhaps in every river in Australia, with the exception of the inland streams that run over sandy beds. Let me quote something concerning the water supply of the Yass-Canberra district from a parliamentary paper dealing with that subject - </para>

                <para class="block">I take that from a report issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh, and dated 9th October, 1908. I have other reports here by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and others, but that from which I have quoted is the latest, and, in view of the position which he holds, we may accept the opinion of the writer with confidence. I have visited the Canberra site. It has been suggested by some honorable senators that it is a  suburb of Sydney. It is 204 miles from Sydney, and honorable senators might just as well say that Manchester is a suburb of London. I have no wish that the Federal Parliament should meet in Sydney any more than in Melbourne. I believe Canberra to be an ideal site. There is a small plain there of good land, suitable for gardens, a lagoon which might be enlarged to any extent, low ridges all round for building sites, and the place is within 8 miles of the Murrumbidgee River. Honorable senators will not say that there is not in that river  water enough to supply the requirements of a_ large population. In the town in North Queensland from which I come we have a&#34; river which at certain seasons of the&#39; year is nothing but a sand bed, but the Water Board of the town, by the expenditure of &#163;10,000 in the construction of a weir  were able to conserve sufficient water to supply a population of 25,000 people for five years. The water is used for crushing mills, and all other city purposes, and by the Railway Department. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. What is there to prevent the erection of dams at two or three places on the Cotter River or the construction of a weir on that river? We are told that the water-shed of that river covers a large area of something like 170 square miles, and&#39; that its head waters come from hills and mountains that are covered with snow for the greater part of the year. If we could secure that area, and I understand that the Government of New South Wales have promised to give it, it would be possible with a comparatively small expenditure to provide a never-ending supply of pure; water, much of which could be conveyed to Canberra by gravitation. I visited the district in the month of August, and though the grass did not look too green, I saw sheep there in fair condition, whilst at Dalgety I saw neither feed nor sheep. I should really like to know why some honorable senators are so strongly in favour of the selection of Dalgety. I certainly cannot be charged with suffering from the Sydney microbe. If the agreement made had been that the Capital should be located in Victoria, and not in New South Wales, I should have been just as ready to see that not merely its letter, but also its spirit, were observed. I was an elector of Queensland when the Constitution Bill was submitted to a referendum in that State, and I can inform honorable senators that it was Northern Queensland that carried Federation in that State.. Without any question of exact legal phraseology, it was thoroughly understood in Northern Queensland that the Federal Capital was to be established as nearly as possible within 100 miles of &#39;Sydney. It was also understood that&#39; the people of New South Wales accepted that condition for the sake of peace, and in order to bring about Federation. We were outside the zone of feeling in the matter. find could view it impartially. I visited Dalgety, intending, if possible, to vote for the selection of that site, but having seen the place, I am unable to do so, in the interests of my own State. Queensland will later on send to the Federal </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament a great many more members than she now sends, and in my opinion it would be inhuman to ask men born and reared in Queensland to attend Parliament in a place like Dalgety. Honorable senators frequently complain very bitterly of the cold in Melbourne in winter. They suffer from influenza and colds here, but in the matter of climate Melbourne is heaven compared with Dalgety. We have been told what took place, in connexion with the selection of the Capital of the United States, and something of the temperature of the capitals of various countries. It is true that the climate of London may be colder than the climate of Dalgety, but honorable senators should not forget that London is one of the warmest places in the United Kingdom. People going from the north of Scotland, or from the west coast of Ireland to London, enjoy a very much milder climate than that in which they have been accustomed to live. As I have already said, it is on. record that the mean annual rainfall at Dalgety for twelve years is 19 inches, and of Yass-Canberra 38 inches. Canberra is 1,500 feet above the sea level, with a milder climate than that of Dalgety. Whilst the whole of the Yass-Canberra district is suitable for farming, most of the settlers in the Southern Monaro district are sheep-farmers on comparatively large areas of country. The land in that district is poor, and fit only for sheep farming. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has made reference to the importance of giving effect to a policy of land nationalization in the Federal Territory, but if the honorable) senator and those with whom he is associated wish to make that policy a success they should select good land for the Federal Territory. We know that it is possible that if poor land such as that in the Southern Monaro district is selected, and the policy of land nationalization does not turn out as successful as some honorable senators hope, the answer will be, &#34; Yes, but see the kind of country in which the attempt to carry it out was made.&#34; If honorable senators desired to discredit that policy they might best do so by selecting such a district as Southern Monaro in which to put it into practice. I am not opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> suggestion that an experiment should be made in land nationalization. But I say that that experiment should be made upon the best country that we can secure - not upon the most barren. In the vicinity of Buckley&#39;s Crossing, at Dalgety, one cannot see anything but granite boulders, and for 30 miles distant .even pine trees will nor grow, except at an angle of 45 degrees. To the representatives of Queensland, Canberra would be much more accessible than Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. But we know that there is not the remotest chance of Armidale being selected. Further, Canberra can be linked up at a very small expenditure with a main line of railway. But if Dalgety be selected, a railway will have to be constructed which will cost an immense sum because of the very rough country which it will traverse. Outside of Cooma, the country is very sparsely populated, and there is practically no sign of cultivation. I am given to understand that if the Seat of Government be established at Dalgety, the railway from Goulburn to Cooma will practically have to be rebuilt.  Although it is true that the lowest temperature ever recorded at Dalgety was 11 degrees as against 16 degrees at Canberra, it is a fact that low temperatures are more continuously maintained at the former place than at . the latter. We have been asked to heal the differences which exist between New South Wales and Victoria by approaching the consideration of this question in a Federal spirit. But have we approached it in that spirit? I say, unhesitatingly, that we have not. Accusations have been levelled against the people of Sydney which are altogether without warrant. Instead of endeavouring to settle this question, some honorable senators evidently desire to defer its determination as long as possible. If we decided upon the Seat of Government to-morrow, fully ten years would elapse before this Parliament could meet there. Plans would have to be prepared, surveys made, and all sorts of negotiations entered into. If for no other reason than that it is desirable to put an end to the ill feeling which exists between the two largest States of the Commonwealth, I maintain that we should endeavour to meet the people of New South Wales in a perfectly reasonable spirit. I have been assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> that the Government of New South Wales are prepared - if this Parliament should select the Yass-Canberra site - to meet it in a most generous manner in regard to the area of the Federal Territory, and also to grant it access to the sea. </para>

                        <para>- Having at one time been a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> has a much better knowledge of the feeling of that State upon this question than I have. He did not attempt to mislead me in any way, because, before he made the statement to which I have referred, he was aware that I intended to vote for the Yass-Canberra site. I appeal to honorable senators to rise to the occasion, and to sweep away all provincial feeling by deciding upon a site which will be acceptable to the people of New South Wales. I am thoroughly satisfied that so long as we refuse to finally determine this question, the jealousies between New South Wales and Victoria will continue. It is quite true that Dalgety possesses a noble river; but that is all which can be urged in its favour. There are only two ways in which this question can be settled - an honorable and* an honest way, and a dishonorable and dishonest way. </para>

I have heard a member of the other House declare that although the Constitution stipulates that the Seat of Government shall be in New South Wales, it does. not say when it shall be established there. I do not regard that as an honorable way of dealing with this question. Of course, we all know that the Melbourne newspapers have been shrieking over this matter.

                <para class="block">Victoria who dared to vote for Yass-Canberra were branded by one of the leading newspapers here as unpatriotic. I do not believe for a moment that those gentlemen will suffer for their action ; but they would certainly do so if the particular journal in question had its way. I have been informed that it is a common thing for the representatives of Victoria, on retiring each night, to pray that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> next day will not say anything against them. When they awake each morning, I am assured that they thank God if that journal has not said anything against them. If these statements be true, the Victorian representatives must experience a very uneasy time. </para>

                        <para>- I do not vouch for the accuracy of these rumours. Before we are called upon to ballot for the site which we favour, I assume that a number of sites will be nominated. But in the end, our choice will probably lie between Canberra and Dalgety. Now, if a proper ballot is not to be taken upon this question, I would rather that we had no ballot at all. I certainly do not consider that we are called upon to ballot for the site of our choice if every honorable senator is to be obliged to sign his ballot paper, so that everybody else may know exactly how he voted. I am speaking in the interests of those honorable senators who fear the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> But, unfortunately a ballot is proposed. Why should we not go to a division, and do without a ballot? I should prefer to vote openly, but in the interests of those who are afraid of the &#34;thunderer,&#34; I am willing to allow the matter to be decided by ballot. My only reason for agreeing to that course being taken is that the names of honorable senators will not be known. </para>

He has fought very hard against me at every election, and in the interests of the Labour Party. But on the 31st October he addressed this letter to me from Nowra - </para>

                        <para>- I have seen Canberra, but not Tumut. I should like to see Tumut before I was called upon to vote, but, judging from what I have heard, I am prepared to vote for Tumut if it is to be the selected site. I have quoted this letter for what it is worth. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 28th September gives in cubic feet the volume of water discharged per second in the Cotter River, namely, in February, 34; in March, 24 ; in April, 55 ; in May, 68 ; in June, no; in July, 228; in August, 356; and in September, 645, up to the 16th. If any man tells me that a river which discharges a volume like that for eight months of the year cannot supply more than 50,000 persons, his statement is absurd on its very face. It will provide a supply sufficient for more than 500,000 persons. These figures bear out my statement that the daily flow of the river is 85,000,000 gallons. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is. If two men are sent into the bush with a certain instruction, they are sure to disagree, and it is the same with experts when they are called upon to supply any reports. I take all these reports with a grain of salt. I do not think that there is any comparison between Canberra and Dalgety. I visited the latter site with a fairly large party, but I did not hear one of them advocate it as a site. On the contrary, I heard a number of them say that it was impossible as a site. They are entitled to change their minds if they have received further information since then. I have heard honorable senators on this side told that they have no right to vote for Canberra because four years ago they voted for Dalgety. I believe that the former site was not heard of then. When another site is proposed, and it is urged that it will be a more suitable one in the interests of the Commonwealth, those honorable senators are entitled to reconsider the matter. How do they compare with those who made a visit only last August, and expressed themselves as being opposed to Dalgety on the ground that it was too inhospitable, and quite impossible as a site, but who now declare that they intend to vote for Dalgety as against Canberra? I do not blame any honorable senator for changing his mind if he sees fit, but I do not think that he should cast stones at other honorable senators because they have changed their minds after the lapse of four years. In one case the senators had <inline font-style="italic">seen</inline> both Dalgety and Canberra, but in the other case the senators had not seen Canberra, as it had not been mentioned when the claims of Dalgety were urged four years ago. I went to Canberra with the intention of supporting Dalgety from what I had read, but when I saw Canberra, I altered my mind. I suppose that if I had not seen Canberra, I might be induced now to vote for the selection of Dalgety, but having seen it, I cannot do so. I hope that we shall select a site which will prove to be the best for the whole of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that Yass-Canberra will be chosen, and that by that means the difficulties existing between the two large States will be settled. I consider that in making the selection we shall be discharging a Federal duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has often asked us to approach this question in a Federal spirit, but he is approaching it in an un-Federal spirit. He knows that by voting for Dalgety he will hang up the matter for years to come. </para>

                        <para>- The leading newspaper in this State has said with regard to those Victorian members who voted against Dalgety, that they were unpatriotic Victorians. I want to know whether that is not an evidence of soreness between two States. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> does not put himself up above the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper as an interpreter of the public opinion of this State. I hope that he will read and ponder the leading articles of that journal. The ill-feeling to which I have referred is extending. If we can settle the Capital site question, I believe that the breach will be healed. The Yass-Canberra site would be acceptable to the people of New South Wales. I have an assurance that if the choice of the House of Representatives is indorsed by the Senate the New South Wales Government will deal with us in an open and liberal manner in reference to the area to be granted to us. If we do not like the site after we have chosen it, we can change the selection. </para>

                        <para>- That would be a very good place to go to. The climate is unequalled in Australia, and we breed the best men in the Commonwealth there. If a vote of mine could conduce to the selection of Charters Towers, there is no doubt as to what my decision would be. I can only again appeal to honorable senators to take this opportunity of settling the question once and for all. </para>

                    <para>.- A matter has come to my knowledge which is, I think, of great importance from the point of view of the Federal Government and Parliament, as well as to the people of Australia as a whole. It has been recognised that there is a probability of unsettled industrial conditions in a portion of New South Wales. I refer to Broken Hill. I believe that the difficulty has been aggravated to some extent by the action of the New South Wales Government in sending detachments of police to that city. But there is something worse than that, although the information does not appear to have been obtained by the press. I am informed that the New South Wales Government have sent a quantity of arms and ammunition through Victoria and South Australia to Broken Hill, to be used by somebody. </para>

I have risen for the purpose of asking the Government whether they have any knowledge of the facts that I have stated. I also desire to inquire whether the Government have any opinion as to whether it is not a violation of the Constitution for any State to keep armed forces for intimidation or for any other purpose. I wish to know whether the Government will make inquiries as to the purposes for which these arms and ammunition are to be used. Are they to be used to intimidate the mine-owners of Broken Hill? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, whatever they may be ; or are they to be used for the purpose of coercing the miners to comply with the reasonable or unreasonable demands of the mine-owners? Personally, I do not believe that- the mine-owners or mine managers at Broken Hill, and the members of the A.M. A., are not capable of adjusting their differences amicably. Unless some substantial reason can be given, or some person or persons can furnish a satisfactory explanation, as to why arms and ammunition, which ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth, have been despatched from New South Wales through two other States of the Commonwealth to Broken Hill, I wish to know why the Commonwealth should not take action in the matter. I believe that what has been done will tend to create greater friction in Broken Hill than could have happened if the people were allowed to settle their own differences. I desire the Minister of Home Affairs to lay the position before the Government, which I trust will see that inquiries are made with the object of finding out on what authority the New South Wales Government have done anything of the kind. I have no desire to belabour this question or to create a scene here. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Senate has reason to be grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> for bringing this important matter to our notice at this juncture. It has been stated in the press, and I believe the statement is true, that a force of fifty armed police has been sent from New South Wales, through Victoria and South Australia, to Broken Hill. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has very properly pointed out, the movement of armed forces through the States is a matter of Commonwealth, rather than of State concern. Whilst the States Governments are charged with the management of their own local police forces, and the regulation of their movements within each State for State purposes, the movement of a large body of fifty armed police through two or more Stares of the Commonwealth becomes a matter of Federal concern, and one of which the Commonwealth Government should take cognisance. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of all the details. I am aware only that it is a matter of current news that police, arms, and ammunition have been sent to Broken Hill in the way I have described. Let me point out further that the beginning, or what might be the beginning, of an industrial dispute whose ramifications, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> word, might extend throughout the Commonwealth, is also a matter of Commonwealth concern. Another statement has appeared in the press, which I think will bear out the view I intend to put before the Senate. We are told that the  chairman  of directors of one of the Broken Hill mining companies has made the significant statement that he did not think it would pay the mine-owners at the present time to force on a struggle. I need not elaborate that statement. </para>

                        <para>- Just so; to take any action which would be likely to force on a struggle. It is clear that the  chairman  of directors referred to knew at the time he made the statement that it was contemplated by other mine-owners at Broken Hill to take some such action. The action of the New South Wales Government is also a clear indication of the fact that the mine-owners of Broken Hill had applied to the State Government to send along a police force, in anticipation of the struggle which they intended to force on. That is a plain reading of the facts, so far as we have any knowledge of them. The Commonwealth is charged with the duty of dealing with industrial disputes that spread from one State to another; but it is also charged with the duty of preventing such disputes. That is distinctly provided for in our Constitution. I say that at the very beginning of such an industrial trouble, which might spread throughout the Commonwealth, it is the bounden duty of the Commonwealth Government to take .cognisance of what is going on, and to strive, by every means in their power, to prevent any action likely to precipitate a disastrous struggle of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- Such a struggle would be a calamity at this juncture. &#34; It is a specific duty cast upon the Commonwealth Government for the preservation of peace, order and good government, to prevent, by every means in their power, any action which would precipitate such a disaster. I maintain,, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> that the movement of such a large armed force - evidently at the instigation of the mine-owners who desire to provoke such a struggle, and before any such struggle has been contemplated by the men, who have so far peacefully arranged their troubles with the mine-owners - is an action calculated to precipitate disaster and calamity upon the Commonwealth, and the Federal Government is in duty bound to take cognisance pf it, and to endeavour to prevent it. What are the Commonwealth Government going to do? If - they permit the New South Wales Government to move fifty armed&#39; police through Victoria and South Australia to Broken Hill, they might just as. well permit that Government to call up a. volunteer force, of  5,000.  men, aim therewith rifles and bayonets, and send them along in the same way. I say that the- Commonwealth Government will betray their trust and be false to their duty to the Commonwealth if they fail to take such action as will prevent anything of the kind being- done. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Minister of Home Affairs &#91;10.2&#93;. - With regard to the remarks made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I may say that personally, I know very little of the circumstances to which the honorable senator referred. When he first addressed himself to the motion, I was almost at a loss to imagine to what particular circumstances he was referring; but as he developed his remarks, I noticed that they had reference to recent occurrences at Broken Hill, in New South Wales, and to some action taken by the Government of that State in order to- preserve peace and good order within the State. 1 am not in a position to say what actually has been done of the character referred to by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                    or to speak as to the constitutionality of the action which he asks the Government to look into. Speaking offhand, I can only say that there is a provision in the Constitution which makes it impossible for any State to raise a naval or military force. This prohibition goes no further than that, and there is no inhibition upon any State maintaining any organization for the preservation of peace and order within its boundaries, consistent with its obligations under the Constitution.

                    <para>- Whether anything further has been done, I am not in a position to say. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> dealing with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has urged upon the Government the desirableness of including in any inquiry into the constitutionality of the State Government&#39;s action, an investigation of remarks said to have been made by a certain private individual at Broken Hill. I point out to the honorable senator that that must necessarily be a matter confined to the State. As a matter of fact, we are bound,  under the Constitution, to preserve any State from invasion, and we are also bound to aid any State, upon the application of the Executive Government of that State, in the maintenance of peace and order within its borders. That clearly goes to show that so far as the State is concerned, its responsibility in that regard in not entirely surrendered to the Commonwealth, because the application must come directly from the State to the Commonwealth before the Commonwealth can. intervene within the borders of the State for the maintenance of peace and good order. I can only say, in reply to the remarks made by honorable senators who have addressed themselves to the motion, that I shall see that my honorable colleagues have the representations made put fully before them. I can also assure honorable senators generally, whatever views they may hold, that &#34;the Government, while fully recognising, and respecting, the obligations and responsibilities of the States Governments in regard to the maintenance of good order within their own territories, will not be unmindful of its own duty with regard to the maintenance of peace and good order within the constitutional limits of the Commonwealth. </para>
