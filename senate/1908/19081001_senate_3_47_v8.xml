I have questioned the Vice-President of the Executive Council more than once, and the main point on which I desired information was as to how much money, if any, had been retained from the States during July and August under the Surplus Revenue Act. In his reply he very courteously asked me to postpone the inquiry until after the Treasurer had delivered his Budget Statement in the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. If my limited experience teaches me anything, in his Budget speech the Treasurer will deal with the history of last year to the 30th. June, and with general principles and Estimates for the current year. But an inquiry as to how much money, if any, has been retained by the Commonwealth from the States during July and August appears to me to involve purely a matter of fact, not a matter of principle or policy. If the Minister could assure me that it involves a matter of policy, then his answer would apparently be a satisfactory one. But I should have to he convinced first that it does involve a matter of policy before I could accept that evasive reply. There is another reason why the Minister should reply to the inquiry. The State Treasurers - and I can speak with knowledge of one Treasurer - have been trying to ascertain what their position is likely to be. They have put practically the same question to the Government as I have; but they cannot get a reply. When they are endeavouring to frame their Estimates for the year they naturally want all the information they can get. They cannot ask, any more than I can seek, that the Government should disclose their policy before the proper time. But their inquiries relate to pure questions of fact. Presumably the Treasury books are written up to date&#39;. I asked what certain balances in the books were, and the Minister replied, &#34; That is a matter For the Budget speech, and when it is delivered honorable senators will be able to get the information which they are now seeking.&#34; I am not singular in this respect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> asked a similar question the other day and received a similar reply. I submit that it is not our business to wait upon the other place until we can get replies to questions on matters of fact. We are entitled to know at any time what funds the Government have in hand, and how they are invested, or where they are, though not necessarily to know what the Government propose to do at some future time. What I am asking is simply that the Government shall tell us what they have done during July and August in connexion with particular moneys. I have taken this method of drawing the attention of Ministers to the fact that they are not treating the members of the Senate with due courtesy when they refuse to reply to questions relating to matters of fact. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council can assure me that no money has been kept back from the States, it would have been a very simple thing for him to have said so. I know that he cannot tell me what trust funds the money has been put to, because I notice that, according to the Surplus Revenue Act, it cannot be placed to trust funds until it has been appropriated by Parliament. If any money has been held back it is only reasonable that we should be informed of the fact when a definite question is put to the Government. If they have kept back no money, why does not the Minister say so, and have done with the matter ? I urge very strongly that the Senate should, by its vote, express an opinion that when any honorable senators - I do not care on which side they sit - nsk questions which involve matters of fact they should get a courteous, and the earliest possible, reply which the Minister is capable of giving. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think my honorable friend was quite fair when he suggested that the Government were endeavouring to keep back from the Senate information on questions of fact. I repeat what I said here before, that on no occasion have I been a party to withholding from the Senate any information or any figures or particulars of any kind that were immediately available. But as the Budget speech is soon to be delivered, I have a right to ask my honorable friend to extend the acknowledged courtesy of Parliament to the Treasurer, and not seek to get him to disclose his Budget by dribs and drabs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> when he asked a question upon the same subject, acknowledged the claim I then made, and did not further press his question. Let me point out what would necessarily follow if I gave the information sought for by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> Every member of the Senate could not only ask a further question in connexion with Budget matters, but might ask twenty or more questions with regard to them, and endeavour to elicit information in reference to other matters that the Treasurer was working out for the purpose of his Budget. The Budget is a statement that is looked forward to by members of Parliament, and which has to be, and is, comprehensive. Any information required or any doubt which exists in connexion with any matter in the Budget, may be the subject of subsequent inquiry, and information is of course always readily granted. For instance, if my honorable friend had asked his question after the delivery of the Budget, I should have said, &#34; Certainly ; he is entitled to get the information, and I shall be only too glad to procure it.&#34; When I put a reasonable request to him to wait for a fortnight, when he will . get a full and complete statement, am I asking anything unparliamentary, anything unusual, or beyond the ordinary courtesy extended by members of Parliament to a Minister? </para>

It is . a matter of public property throughout the. Commonwealth, that in pursuance of that.  measure there was appropriated for that purpose up to the 30th June, 1908, &#163;193,000. </para>

                        <para>- It is the duty of the Treasurer during the year to apply monthly a certain sum to that particular fund. It would be quite misleading for my honorable friend to be furnished at present with mere book returns. What he asks for would not supply accurate information to the Senate. The Treasurer has to work out and fix the figures whereby he will make sure of the appropriation of the sum required for old-age pensions during the year. He has to see to it that he appropriates a fair and reasonable proportion month by month to insure that the amount which is required for old-age pensions shall be paid. If we were to adopt a system of hastily paying away everything we get, we should of course come to grief at the end of the year. The terms of the Constitution are that we are to be at liberty to appropriate a sum not exceeding one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. I tell my honorable friend frankly that at this juncture the Treasurer has not finally fixed his figures. He floes that at the last moment, having regard to all sorts of considerations which I cannot attempt to detail at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- The position is, therefore, that Parliament has deliberately appropriated a sum of ,&#163;750,000 towards old-age pensions. It is known throughout the Commonwealth that &#163;193,000 has been appropriated up to the 30th June, 1908. It is the responsibility of the Treasurer to fix a sum to be retained month by month. A statement of the monthly transactions would not be a fair and reasonable criterion. My honorable friend will see that it could not be, because section 87 of the Act contemplates an annual adjustment at the end of the year. In the ^circumstances, the position I take up is this : First, as a matter of courtesy, I urge that my honorable friend should. not press his question; and, secondly, I say that if he were furnished with the figures that&#39; he asks for, they would, in all probability, be misleading. Is it not a fair thing, then, to suggest to him the propriety of -waiting for the full statement that will be made in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget speech ? I do not suggest for a moment, and never have hinted, that the Senate is not entitled to every  considera  tion, but I do suggest that the Treasurer is entitled to that courtesy that is  always  extended to Ministers under such circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. - I venture to say that, if the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> a few days ago, had made the statement to which we have just listened, relative to the impossibility  of giving reliable figures, this motion would never have been submitted. But the honorable senator has completely changed the attitude that he took up yesterday and on previous occasions. He now states as one reason why it is impossible to give the information required, that any figures which he could supply would be merely approximate and, probably, misleading. That may be a reasonable and sound ground for the Minister declining to give definite information. But the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not take up that attitude in replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> question at an earlier period- What he did lay down was an utterly new and imaginary doctrine - the doctrine that the Senate is not entitled to any information upon, any matter which may be directly or incidentally referred to in the Budget speech. A more preposterous proposition was never put forward. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has only just made the remarks to which I am referring, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of it is not available. It was, the honorable senator said, an established courtesy that information which was to be covered by the comprehensive Budget speech should not be disclosed, in reply to questions, by dribs and drabs. What is the position ? It seems to me that it is simplicity itself*. There are certain receipts paid into the public Treasury, and certain disbursements have or have not been made from the public &#39;funds. A member of the Senate in the discharge of his public duty asks what amounts have been received or paid, and he is practically told that the Government refuse to give him the information for which he asks until the Budget speech is delivered. , Suppose that on this occasion, as has happened on previous occasions, the delivery of the Budget speech is delayed11 that it is not delivered for some months - are we to be told that we shall not be given any information with&#34; respect to transactions in the Treasury until it is delivered? Does the Vice-President of the Executive Council mean to say that for all time, so long as the Treasurer withholds the Budget speech, our mouths are to be closed, and the Government are to shelter themselves behind this new-found doctrine and decline to give any information at all? I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that amongst other things he said that if an answer were given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> &#39;s questions, any other member of the Senate might come forward and submit twenty questions. Of course he might, and similarly, following the doctrine which, has been laid down, the Government might refuse to give any information in reply to those questions, on the ground that directly or indirectly they would be touched upon in the Budget speech. The suggestion is that anything which may be covered by a comprehensive Budget speech is a subject so sacred that no inquiry should be made -concerning it. </para>

                        <para>- How would that affect the question if the Budget speech were delayed? It was an old practice in New South Wales for the Treasurer in his Budget speech to review the whole industrial position of the State. Following the doctrine suggested by the Vice-President of . the Executive Council, if that course were adopted here we should not be at liberty to ask a question upon any industrial matter. We should be told that we were anticipating a matter with which the Treasurer would deal in his Budget speech. We have simply asked what has happened in connexion with certain Treasury transactions. There is nothing secret or sacred about them&#39; ; or there ought not to be. We have already been given some information by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who, in giving it, has violated his own doctrine that we must not anticipate the Budget speech. The world already knows that ,&#163;193,000 was paid into the Old-age Pensions Fund up to the 30th June last, and how, therefore, can it be iniquitous for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> to ask information as to the amounts hypothecated in the same way in the following two montEs ? </para>

                        <para>- I have said that I have no doubt that if the answer given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council had been that the figures would only be so approximate as to be misleading, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> would have been satisfied. But the Minister has given no such answer. He has himself told us the amount paid to the Old-age Pensions Fund up to 30th June, but apparently it is high treason for , any one to ask what is the amount paid up to the 30th July. The thing is too absurd for a moment&#39;s serious consideration. Let me remind honorable senators that monthly or quarterly abstracts of revenue and expenditure are published. I admit at once that I never study those documents, because I have long since come to the conclusion that the intention of their publication is to mislead. If we have officials in the Public Service possessing greater skill at hiding things than those whose duty it is to prepare the abstracts I refer to, I am not aware of it. For this reason I do not waste time in reading the abstracts. But there &#39;is no doubt whatever  that the publication of the abstracts does anticipate the Budget speech. They contain particulars of revenue received and expended, and I expect that the Minister will now turn round and prohibit their publication because they anticipate the Budget speech. A request has been made for information upon a simple matter of fact concerning funds paid into or out of the Treasury. I remember distinctly an occasion on which while the Tariff was being actually considered a request was made for information as to the amounts being collected under the Tariff. There can be no doubt that that information anticipated the Budget, but no Minister ventured to say that it was information which should not be furnished. It was furnished straight away for the good and sufficient reason that, as representatives of the people called upon to legislate for them, honorable senators were entitled to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has drawn a very distinct line between matters of fact and matters of policy. </para>

                        <para>- Willingly. I have no wish to detain the House by reading all that the honorable senator has said. Let me say first of all that the Minister laid down the doctrine that it was not usual to give information in connexion with the Budget by dribs and drabs. He has defended this doctrine by a reason which, however flattering it may be to the vanity &#39; of the Treasurer, should not be permitted to influence the procedure of the Senate. The reason the honorable senator gave for withholding the information wast that if such information were given in anticipation of the Budget, interest in the Budget speech would necessarily fail. This information was to be denied the Senate merely in order that interest in the Budget might be worked up to fever-heat, and that when he delivered it <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne might stand beneath the limelight of public excitement. </para>

                <para class="block">The Vice-President of the Executive Council does not put that forward as the reason why he refused to give the information. It is just a reminder in passing of the position of affairs. The real reason submitted in the speech which he asked me to read was that the Government refused to give the Senate information in order that nothing should be permitted to detract from an all important occasion, and that the eyes of Australia might te riveted upon his colleague when he delivered his comprehensive Budget speech. I remind honorable senators that this is not a matter in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> is solely concerned. I should not have risen if it had been. The matter is one which affects the Senate as a co-ordinate branch of this Parliament. This House, as a branch of the Federal Parliament, has a right to all information which can te supplied upon matters of fact connected with the administration of public affairs. If honorable senators are prepared to adopt the doctrine of the Minister that the Senate is to be denied information merely that interest in the speech of the Minister may be maintained;, I venture to say that they will be neglectful of the duty intrusted to them, and, to some extent, of the dignity of this Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council are only so much bluff, and beating of the air. For seven years or more it has been the practice of the Treasurer at the end of every month to pay over to the .States certain sums of money,&#39; to which they are entitled under the Constitution. In the month of June a certain Bill was passed, when certain moneys were retained. We know what was kept back for that month. The Treasurer is perfectly aware of the amount of money which would have been handed over to the States if the change I have referred to had not taken place. What we wish to know is what is the difference between the amount of money handed over and the amount which would have been handed over but for the change. To attempt to. bluff us with this talk about the Budget is to insult our- intelligence. The Vice-President of the Executive Council must be well aware that the . delivery of the Budget has nothing whatever to do with this matter. I am afraid that I shall have to vary somewhat my views of the honorable gentleman&#39;s, willingness to afford information to the Senate. I recollect that towards the end of last session <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> upon two or three occasions, sought information concerning a certain despatch to London, and received replies which were not quite accurate, seeing &#34;that we have since learned that the despatch in question, instead of being transmitted -last session, was only forwarded from Melbourne on 15th June of the present year. Under the circumstances, I unhesitatingly assert that there is no reason why the various States should not know how much money they would have received if the Surplus Revenue Bill had not been passed, and how the funds which have been withheld have been allocated. For the Vice-President of the Executive Council to tell us that this information ought not to have been asked for is an insult to our common sense. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with very great interest to the reply of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and I could not help comparing it with his utterance of yesterday. No doubt he then made it quite clear to himself that any figures which he might give at the present juncture regarding the allocation of money which has been withheld from the States to various Trust Funds, would be misleading. But this is the first occasion upon which I have encountered a Minister who was not prepared to answer a question put by , a member of the Opposition for fear that he might mislead that unfortunate member. The Vice-President of the Executive Council knows that it is my business to take care that he does not mislead me, and I think that I am fairly successful in that connexion. It was quite possible for the honorable gentleman to have supplied the desired-information, and to have added that the figures were liable to adjustment at a later stage. But, instead of doing so, he informed us that we shall obtain a full statement of the position when the Treasurer delivers his Budget. May I point out that the figures for which I asked cover only two months of the current financial year.

                        <para>- That reply does not dispose of the fact that I asked for certain information which might have been supplied. May I remind the honorable gentleman that not long ago a return was submitted to the Senate setting forth &#34;the increased expenditure which took place in Melbourne, by reason of the temporary Seat of Government being located in this city. It showed that that expenditure amounted to ,&#163;250,000 annually. But one Minister very properly pointed out that such&#34; a return was most misleading, .because it included, for example, all allowances made to members of this Parliament - allowances which, . as a matter of fact, are paid here, but most of which are probably spent in the other States. The Vice-President of the Executive Council did not object to the compilation of that return on the ground  that it  was misleading. As a member of the Opposition, it is my business, when Ministers supply me with information, to take care that I am not misled - that I do not use it until I have ascertained exactly what it is worth. Nothing that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said will convince me that I was not quite justified in asking for the information which I sought, or that the Senate was treated by him with that courtesy to which it is entitled. When I first put my question lo him, a week ago, I was asked to postpone it for four or five days. Accordingly, I deferred it for the best portion of a week. I then put it again, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council asked me to postpone it until the Budget was delivered. When I asked upon what date the Budget would be delivered, I. was told that it would be within fourteen days. In other words, I was not to receive the information until nineteen days after I had first asked for it. But there is no certainty that the delivery of the Budget will not be delayed, or even that the Treasurer will deal with this matter in his Budget. </para>

                        <para>.- Recognising the very comprehensive nature of this measure, and that it teems with technicalities, I do not intend to-day to discuss very many of its details. I did hope that the Senate would have been favoured with the opinions of those who possess a more practical and technical knowledge of the - measure than I. do, but we may be favoured with that information before a division is taken. One of Australia&#39;s proudest boasts is that it is foremost in industrial legislation: in other words, that the legislation of the States in relation to factories, workshops, and mines, though not vet nearly perfect, is ahead of that of other countries. The reason why we occupy that position is because we, as a young nation, have learned lessons from the bitter experience of older countries. So far we cannot claim to have given any great consideration to the men who &#34; go down to the sea in ships.&#34; Hitherto&#39; each State has made and controlled its own navigation laws, but I think that it would be a very great stretch of the imagination to say that the men who are engaged in the industry, have received the consideration and just treatment which their arduous and dangerous avocation particularly calls for. The opportunity is now afforded to this Parliament by virtue of the Constitution to, as it were, consolidate, and at the same time improve, the navigation laws of the States. It is well known that we as Britishers have an inherent love of the sea. It has made our race famous in the annals of history, and I see no reason why Australians should forfeit the heritage which has been bestowed upon them. The difficulty that faces the shipping world of to-day is not of the same nature as that which obtained in earlier years. To-day we are troubled not so much with the dangers of wind and weather, as with the difficulties of handling those huge instruments of commerce which trade across our seas. It will be evident to honorable senators that, owing to the great increase in traffic, and the complex nature of the modern steam-ship, there is all the more necessity for the skilful handling of such vessels, so as to avoid risk to the lives of crew and passengers. It is very interesting to read the history of the progress and development of British shipping, or of shipping the wide world over during the past fifty or sixty years. A Royal Commission which was appointed in Great Britain in 1836 said that the loss of life was due to bad classification, incompetency of masters and officers, systems of insurance, drunkenness, &#38;c. So far as it is possible for human ingenuity to try to avoid those dangers, this Bill is, I think, a step in that direction. As regards the provisions for the coastal trade, the representatives of Western Australia have been criticised severely for desiring to secure an exemption in favour of that State. We. are not blacklegging on any principle. We simply want a suspension of the provisions until such time as Western Australia has been linked up with other portions of the Commonwealth by means of a trans-continental railway. </para>

                            <para>- With this difference, that only a portion of Queensland is affected, because the rest of that State is already connected by railway with the eastern States. No part of Western Australia, however, is connected by that means with any portion of the eastern States. We have no desire to endanger the position of the men who are engaged on the coastal vessels. We have no desire to endanger their wages. This Bill does not touch that subject. There is another tribunal which will deal with a condition of that kind. Those who think that the granting of an exemption in favour of Western Australia would in any way handicap the Australian coastal companies are, I think, labouring under a very false impression. A perusal of their share lists will prove, that, financially speaking, those companies are in a very sound condition indeed. </para>

                            <para>- Personally, I have not the slightest objection to making art exemption in that direction with white crews. A great deal has been said about the coastal companies, and the manner in which they equip their boats. I can say, from personal observation as a traveller, that they are well equipped, so far as passengers are concerned. It is all very well for a passenger who has travelled first or second class to speak in that manner. He wants to go into the stoke-hole to discover how the companies treat their employes. To-day, those companies for whom such solicitude is expressed, are not treating their employes in the manner in which Australian seamen should be treated. The conditions under which the men work in the stoke-hold and live are not in any way desirable. I have  seen those men, even on the most up-to-date Australian liners, without the means of getting a bath. Certainly, a cold water tap of some kind was provided, but there was no provision made for taking a shower-bath. &#39;I have seen the men herded in a very small compartment, after coming off their shift, and sleeping in the very place in which their working clothes were being aired or dried. If that is considered proper treatment of Australian seamen, it has not my approval. I am in entire agreement with one or two phases of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> address, particularly with his reference to the abnormal powers which are given to the Minister. That is a continuation of a very bad phase of Australian legislation. When such great powers are given to the Governor-General in Council, which means the Minister, there is always the danger that influences may be brought to bear at some time or other which may entirely defeat the intention of Parliament. In Committee I shall endeavour to remedy the defect in the Bill whereby such vast powers are given to the Minister. With reference to the committee proposed to be appointed, I hold that we should either make it am effective body or not appoint it at all. That is another phase of the Bill in which I find myself in entire agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Other honorable senators who addressed themselves to the question yesterday urged that it was not right to consider the Bill until we had received the final despatch from the Board of Trade. In my opinion, that is not an argument that should have weight in a deliberative chamber vested with such powers as we possess. I fail to see why the Board of Trade should come as it were with a pistol at our heads, and say, &#34; If you do certain things we will not agree to them.&#34; Having read the whole of the correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Secretary fox State for the Colonies, I think that we have gone as far as we could, consistent with our dignity as a national Parliament endowed with autonomous powers, in the direction of meeting the criticisms and objections of the Board of Trade. I should have regretted it very much had the Government held their hand until they received a further reply from that authority. I wish to make a reference to the question whether we can or cannot legislate in the direction indicated in the Bill so far as concerns ships not upon the Australian register. I have before me an appendix to the report of the Royal Commission, signed by a gentleman whose authority on constitutional matters will not be questioned. Reference is made to this authority in the correspondence between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Prime Minister. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> whose memorandum I have read with&#39; considerable interest. Dealing with section 736 of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act 1894 upon Colonial legislative powers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> says - </para>

                    <para>From the tenuis in which sections 163 and 32S of the Act of 1S53 were repealed by the Act of 1S69, it appears that the main object of the new substantive provision was to enable the Colonics to legislate directly as to the vessels in which their coasting trade should be carried on. It was clearly intended to be an enabling, not a restrictive clause ; to grant to the Colonies (subject to conditions) certain new powers of legislation, but not to take away any existing powers. At the same time, it is not easy to see what new powers it conferred. Even before 1S69, a Colony, in virtue of its general legislative power, could make laws to &#34; regulate its coasting trade,&#34; provided that such laws were not repugnant to any Imperial Act extending to the Colony. The repeal of section 163 of the Act of 1853 extended the powers of Colonial Legislatures by removing a direct statutory prohibition. But how does the substantive enactment extend their powers? It can hardly be contended that it enables a Colony to pass laws repugnant to an Imperial Act extending to the Colony. </para>

                        <para>As to Part n, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cunliffe</inline> draws from section 264 an inference in derogation of Colonial legislative powers, which appears to me quite untenable. He says in effect that section 264 empowers the Legislature of a British Possession to apply to British ships trading with or being- at any port in the Possession any provisions of Part 11 (only) which do not otherwise so apply; and he suggests that the section impliedly limits the powers of Colonial Legislatures to exercising the powers specified, or at least that it is &#34; a restricting rather than an enabling power.&#34; But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cunliffe</inline> . does not quite accurately state the purport of the section. lt does not empower Colonial Legislatures to legislate in the direction mentioned, but declares that if such legislature_ does so, the law shall have effect throughout the British Dominions as if enacted in the Imperial Act. This is obviously an enabling provision ; it enables a Colonial Legislature in effect to pass an Imperial law. No inference whatever can be drawn to restrict its power to pass Colonial laws; and apart altogether from these considerations, it is submitted that the Legislatives&#39; powers of self-governing Colonies cannot be whittled away, as suggested, by vague &#34;inferences&#34; and &#34;implications.&#34; That is a stale of affairs which was ended once and for all by the Colonial Laws Validity Act. </para>

I do not altogether agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cunliffe</inline> if he means that, where the provisions of the Part extend to a Colony, the Colonial Legislature cannot impose upon the owners of British ships any further statutory obligations in addition to the obligations imposed by the Imperial Act. It cannot impose any inconsistent obligations, but that is a very different proposition. </para>

                    <para>I hold that without waiting for further despatches we shall be quite within the powers vested in us by the Constitution if we pass this Bill. I was very glad to notice that from the inception of the debate until last evening there was an entire absence of party spirit. I could have wished that happy mood to be continued. But I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McColl thought  fit to introduce something in the nature of pa inspirit into the debate when he referred to the socialistic trend of our legislation. I do not think that there was any necessity to do so. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> went further, and practically accused honorable senators who for the moment do not agree with  him as to the consideration that we should&#39; mete out to British ship-owners of beingdisloyal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> addressed himself to the treatment which British! ship-owners extend to Australian people, and condemned them; but at the same time he condemned the treatment by Australian ship-owners of Australian people. Yet we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> practically accusing us of being disloyal Britishers. </para>

I do not . think that it is fair to Australia to say that the country cannot be developed in the matter of shipping, commerce, and internal trade without British capital . There is any amount of money available in Australia&#34; to-day for the development of our natural resources. In the Australian banks, at the end of 1907, there was locked up&#163;112,697,969. </para>

                            <para>- I take the statistics from the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book.</inline> I do not say that some of that is not British capital. But it is not correct to say that we must always depend upon British capital. Another question to which I must refer is the absence from the Bill of any provision relating to wireless telegraphy. I am glad to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has circulated an amendment to clause 215, which deals with life-saving appliances, in which he desires to insert a provision to the effect that all vessels engaged in our trade shall be equipped with a wireless telegraph system. It is patent to all of us of what great advantage such an equipment would be to&#39; the commerce of Australia. It would also prevent much loss of life. There have been instances of accidents happening to the machinery of vessels, which have resulted in their drifting for days, and sometimes weeks, around the Australian coast. If ships were equipped with wireless telegraphy, a great deal of worry would be savecf, and sometimes human life would be spared. </para>

I agree that we should not insist upon other people putting their house in order until we do the same. But we are legislating. for the future, and want to make this Bill as perfect as it is possible for human minds to make it. Although we have not yet decided upon a system of wireless telegraphy, that is no reason why we should not put in the Bill a provision compelling ships to insta.l a system, when we. have erected stations. </para>

                        <para>. - I have heard it said that a Bill of this character is not one on which second-reading speeches need be made. But it is of very far-reaching importance, and I think we should be given some idea of its object and scope before we decide even to let it go into Committee. I con- fess that it deals with a subject of which I have a very limited knowledge. I am indebted to the speeches which have so far been made for a good deal of information. The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, -who was, I believe, a member of the Navigation Commission, was very informative. I am quite sure that when he disclosed the horrors of crimping at Newcastle, honorable senators were stirred to righteous indignation, and were agreed that that kind of thing should be stamped out. I think with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that those who&#34; go down to the sea in ships &#39; &#39; have as much right to consideration as those who work on shore, and, in view of the very perilous nature of their occupation, perhaps a little more. We do take every care of our workers on land. The States Parliaments have all passed industrial legislation for their benefit. We have Factories Acts providing for inspection, sanitation, and the protection of machinery to prevent any unnecessary sacrifice of life or limb. It is quite right that all this care should be taken in the interests of the workers ashore, and it is my desire that equal justice shall be done to the workers at sea. There is one aspect of the measure to which I expected the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have referred in moving the second reading. The honorable senator&#39;s speech dealt mainly with the differences between this Bill and the Bill formerly introduced. He did not inform the Senate as to how this measure would affect our coastal shipping. I have had placed in my hands a certain statement, and I presume that other honorable senators have received copies of the same document. </para>

The statement is made by a reputable body, and I have no right to question it. I recognise, however, that one side of a story is good until the other side is told, and I am anxious to hear both sides of this question, that, in casting my vote, I may be able to hold the scales of justice impartially between all the parties concerned. I wish to make some further reference to the document I have received, because it contains a number of statements which seem to me to be of serious importance, and . we ought to know whether they can be substantiated or refuted. For instance, the ship-owners complain that this is not a complete measure. </para>

                            <para>- They say that a number of provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act should have been included in this Bill, in order to make it a complete measure, dealing with the subject of navigation. They are anxious that those provisions should yet be included in the Bill. They say that provisions covering lifesaving appliances, dangerous goods, applicants for examination, and similar matters should not be left to regulations, but should be included in schedules to the Bill. The principal complaint by many honorable  senators who have already spoken on the motion for the second reading has, I think, been that, in this measure, too much is left to the Governor-General in Council, who, we know, in practice, is the Minister. I think that honorable senators generally are agreed that the Bill places a great deal too much power in the hands of the Minister in connexion with matters which ought to have been definitely set out in the measure itself. The ship-owners complain, further, that the penalties inflicted under the Bill are very much higher, and, in some cases, 100 per cent, higher than those provided for in the Merchant Shipping Act in similar cases. </para>

                        <para>The provisions of the Bill will press very heavily on ship-owners, inasmuch as it will mean a very material decrease in the earning capacity of vessels built after the commencement of this Act. In the case of a small vessel, to carry, say, 2/300 tons dead weight, she would have to provide about 75 tons of space for the officers and crew. In the case of large vessels having a big crew list, the matter of providing separate mess-rooms would be very serious. For instance, a vessel of the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra&#39;s</inline> type would require to provide a mess-room for eighty-seven of a crew. This means a loss of about 145 tons of space, which represents an annual loss of, say, , &#163;3,500 in one vessel. </para>

                        <para>If the provisions of the Bill in this connexion are passed, it will mean very serious inconvenience, and great loss to ship-owners. For instance, if a vessel in the Queensland trade was unable to secure a dock at the hour required, in order to undergo her survey, she might miss her time-table arrangements, and would, therefore, have to be laid up for three weeks until her running date came round again. </para>
                        <para>It is difficult to assess the amount this would mean to ship-owners.

                    <para>I think it has also been admitted that a Committee should be appointed to decide the manning scale that should be adopted upon each vessel, because it is impossible to lay down any hard-and-fast rule. It is further urged, in the memorandum from which I am quoting, that under this Bill the number of hands employed upon ships trading in Australian waters would require to be very considerably increased. It is stated that an arrangement has already been arrived at between the ship-owners and the Federated Seamen&#39;s Union and Institute of Marine Engineers, with which the members of those bodies are fairly well satisfied. Yesterday, in discussing the second schedule of the Bill, which refers to the employment of firemen and trimmers, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> frankly admitted that the conditions upon vessels differ so much that it is impossible to lay down any hard-and-fast rule which can be made applicable to all ships. If a Committee be appointed for the purpose of deciding upon its merits the question of the manning of each vessel trading in our waters, I think that it ought to be vested with authority to enforce its orders, subject, of course, to a right ot appeal, so as to prevent injustice. The memorandum further states that if the Bill be passed in its present form, it will necessitate a total increase of 138 in the number of firemen and trimmers employed. The document sets out exactly where increases and decreases&#34; would take place. But where increases would have to be made, past experience has shown that they &#39;are not necessary, and where decreases would take place, they could not be made, because the full complement already carried is required. The memorandum proceeds - </para>

As the men&#39;s representatives are satisfied with a complement of twenty-four,  why  increase the manning to thirty-three? </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I think that the Committee -should be empowered to decide fairly between the parties concerned. But, to my mind, the serious feature is that it is claimed that the increased expenditure entailed upon shipowners under this Bill may be set down as follows: - Manning, &#163;31,000; load-line, &#163;35,000; six months&#39; survey, &#163;21,000, making a total of &#163;87,000 per annum - </para>

                        <para>Under the heading of manning, there would also require to be added the cost of provisioning the extra seamen. The loss of freight Bv providing extra accommodation for the whole of the crews would also have to be considered, and it can safely be stated that the total increase in the expenditure of ship-owners would not be less than ^100,000 per annum. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the foregoing statement be true, who is going to pay the piper? Not the shipowners, I am sure, especially if we are going to preserve the whole of the coastal trade to them free from competition. The\ will pass this extra charge on to the general public, with 10 per cent, added, so that the latter will probably be called upon to pay an additional sum of, approximately, &#163;110,000 per annum. </para>

If it be a fact that the increased expenditure to which ship-owners would be liable under the Bill would be somewhere in the neighbourhood  of &#163;100,000, I maintain that, inasmuch as our coastal steamers &#34;are chiefly engaged in carrying produce from one State to another, the producers will eventually ha,ve to find this money. The bulk of it will certainly be contributed by our primary producers, and it would constitute a burden which they ought not to be called upon to bear. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to follow the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and to confine my remarks to a criticism of some of the general features of this Bill. I acknowledge freely that a large portion of the measure is of a highly technical character, and we occupy a fortunate position, in that some honorable senators will be able to afford us valuable assistance in dealing with its technicalities. As has been pointed out by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it is the policy of Australia to encourage the shipping industry in every possible way. He prided himself upon the fact that if we adopt the principles embodied in this measure,_ we shall place some very advanced shipping legislation upon our statute-book. But I wish to point out that our oversea trade already amounts to the enormous sum of nearly &#163;140,000,000 annually, and that, <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> with the exception of New Zealand, our output of wealth is the greatest in the world. It seems almost superfluous to emphasize that our prosperity is, however, absolutely dependent upon that splendid production. It therefore follows that the means of carriage to and fro of the main sources of our wealth is one of the most important matters which can claim our attention. Even the Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot deny that anything which will seriously prejudice the development of our oversea trade will strike a blow at the progress of Australia. Whilst members of the Opposition concede that our ships should be adequately manned, and that proper accommodation should be provided upon them- </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that. We are bound to give sympathetic consideration to the question of providing our seamen with adequate accommodation. But on the other hand, we are equally bound to see that the vast interests of our primary producers are not unduly hampered. I doubt very much whether the adoption of a restrictive policy will result in the building up of a mercantile marine even upon our own coast, quite apart from the question of whether it will conduce to the expansion of our oversea trade. Great Britain has been very much disparaged on account of her shipping policy ; but there is no more glorious achievement to which we can point than the development of British shipping within the past forty or fifty years. The key-note of that policy has been absolute freedom to the shipping of the world. The figures are indisputable. In the whole world, there is no record of success to equal the record of the achievements of British shipping. </para>

                            <para>-  I was referring to the magnificent achievements of a policy which certainly the Government are not going to carry out. In i860 the total tonnage of Great Britain amounted to 4,186,000 tons. In 1870 it had risen to 13,341,000 tons, and in 1890 it had increased to 75,347,000 tons. Those figures I have taken from the official records of the Merchant Shipping Conference in England. No country in the world can show such enormous additions to its mercantile marine in each year since that era of freedom as can Great Britain. In i860 she added 168,420 tons in sail and 92,590 tons in steam. The additions steadily rose until in 1890 the tonnage in sail added to the mercantile marine that year was 109,189 tons, while in steam&#39; the tonnage increased by 858,480 tons. In 1901 the additions totalled 30,118 tons in sail and 1,123,180 tons in steam, and during the subsequent five or six years the increase has been maintained at the same rate. We may agree or disagree about the principle of restriction of freedom in regard to shipping, but there can be no getting away from this fact, that the policy of allowing ships and trading in ships to be as free as possible is one which has materially benefited Great Britain. It may be said that the ship-owners as representing the moneyed classes have benefited from that freedom at the expense of the seamen. But on looking into the tables I was very pleased to find that as regards their wages the seamen have benefited to some extent in keeping with the benefit which the British shipowners and British trade have enjoyed. In some cases there have been decreases, but it is very pleasing to note that in the vast majority of cases 1&#39;here has been a gradual and steady improvement in the wages of many of the classes of men engaged in the shipping trade. The table I hold in my hand shows the monthly wages paid to first mates, second mates, third mates, boatswains, and engineers on various kinds of vessels. And on the whole there has been a steady and gratifying increase in the rates paid to them during those years. If it is desired to build up a mercantile marine I do not see how we can hope by a policy of restriction to achieve anything like the results which have been achieved under the policy of Great Britain.. In the past her policy has been to remove restrictions from shipping, and not to impose them ; and these figures prove beyond question that it has been remarkably successful. One great example which has inspired this legislation is that of America. In. moving the second reading of the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> pointed out that Australia was going to proceed on the lines laid down by that country. He said that, so far as it was possible consistently with our position as a subordinate portion of the Empire, our policy would be to follow in every respect the policy of the United States, and evidently the Bill bears that impression from start to finish, One of the reasons which prompted the Navigation Commission to recommend a measure of this kind was that in the near future we should require to build up a naval marine for our defence. It was pointed out that the effect of their suggested draft for a Bill and their recommendations would be to build up a great naval marine for Australia.. But in their report they supplied information which would lead to an opposite conclusion, because it goes to show that notwithstanding that for fifty yearsAmerica had followed out a &#34;restrictive policy, it was not within anything like sight of the resources of Great Britain for the fitting out of a naval marine. On page 67 of the smaller edition of their report, they say - </para>

                        <para>In the report of the Committee of Congressappointed in 1904 in connexion with questions affecting the marine of the United States of America it is stated that had America, in her war with Spain, met with a single reverse necessitating further drafts of seamen, none were available for the purpose. Practically the whole of her sailors and fishermen had been absorbed, and to man the fleet recourse must have been had to landsmen. Just what this means is shown by the experience of the ill-starred Baltic Fleet of Russia. America is now, with feverish haste, building a fleet of up-to-date battle-ships, and&#34; this her colossal resources will enable her speedily to accomplish, but the task of manning, these leviathans as soon as completed with trained seamen is likely to prove beyond even her power. </para>

                    <para class="block">According to the admission of the Navigation Commission the United States instituted a very strongly conservative and&#39; restrictive policy in regard to shipping, but at the end of fifty years when confronted with the necessity of building up the navy it was almost unable to do so. Therefore the aspiration which is put forward in another portion of the report by the Commission, that by a measure framed&#39;  on the same lines, we can build up in Australia a naval marine, is a contradiction which at present is not intelligible to my mind. I regret that at the moment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is not in his place. In Committee we shall have to rely greatly upon him, and other honorable senators who are familiar with the conditions of vessels, their equipments, and requirements.

There is another matter to which I should like to draw attention. It is denied by the Government that their Bill will interfere with British shipping. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out good reasons why we cannot accept that assertion. One only needs to have a slight knowledge of what foreign treaties mean to doubt very much whether the Government are not aiming a blow at British shipping, and giving a preference to foreign ships. </para>

                        <para>There are methods by which the Colonies, or some of them, could give a very direct impetus to British shipping if they desired to do so - if for instance they were to relax some of their restrictions upon British ships which desire to enter into the coasting business in Australia more especially. As a matter of fact, in the last few years those conditions have been made very onerous; so onerous that they will drive British ships out of the Australian trade altogether. </para>

                            GEORGE.  Well, we have done that ourselves, and are in advance of every country in the world in that respect. If you superimpose absolutely fresh conditions in Australia the result will be that our own conditions will be quite nugatory, and ships which can enter and do trade in every other part of the world except Russia and the United States of America will not be allowed to enter the Australian coastwise trade. In fact, Australia will hit us harder than even France in that respect. If Australia wants to help British shipping- far and away the most effective way would be to treat us a little more generously in. the matter of merchant shipping legislation. I am Bound to say that, because the resolution comes from Australia.

                            <para>- It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, that the New Zealand Parliament had refused to adopt some of the restrictions which appeared in the New Zealand Bill. We must remember that the welfare of the British carrying trade  affects  us, because we are largely dependent upon British ships for taking away our produce. If it is the policy of the Government to help Australian shipping, they will not find any hindrances from honorable senators on this side of the Chamber. But I wish to draw attention to clause 279 of the Bill. When the second reading was moved last session, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was asked a question as to whether he was satisfied that the measure was constitutional in that respect. But he appeared to be satisfied. </para>

                            <para>- After the Vice-President of the Executive Council was brought up against a constitutional snag,.  he took the matter rather airily. But the warning given has evidently been of some service, and the Bill has been altered. I venture to say, however, that the lion is still there, although it is trying to hide itself in sheep&#39;s clothing. I observe that the Government propose to get over the constitutional difficulty if they can, by transferring the responsibility of granting exemptions to the Governor-General. It is a most unsatisfactory and dangerous method. It means trying to do indirectly what the Government are not game to do directly. By reason of our warnings, they learnt that they had not the power to put an express provision in the Bill. As the clause now stands, it is intended to provide for the case of ships travelling between Melbourne, Adelaide, and Fremantle. Charged by our leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> with practically pleading that Western Australia should be allowed to &#34; black leg &#34; in the matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> attempted to justify the position. So far as I can gather, the Government, and most honorable senators opposite, rather apologize for what has been done. They see that the position is not a very nice one. They cannot defend it logically. The more it is apologized for. the more the unblushing injustice of the proposal becomes evident. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Why should any restrictions whatever be placed upon these British-India boats? The reason for this clause, of course, is that a special concession may be made in favour of Western Australia, because that State has not railway communication with the eastern States. But I remind honorable senators that the Northern Territory is in exactly the same position. The natural outlet for the trade of that Territory must always be <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Queensland coast. We are certain to have established a very useful line of steamers trading along the north coast of Australia and down the coast of Queensland. I wish to know whether, under this clause, there is likely to be trie slightest restriction imposed upon vessels engaged in that trade, whether carrying passengers or cargo, between the various ports of the same State or from ports in one State to ports in another? </para>

                            <para>- I believe that is exactly what the clause means, and I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> for putting it so tersely. If, however, it means something else, it is highly desirable that we should be given some further light on the subject. The Government profess to be extremely anxious for the development of the Northern Territory, and it will surely be admitted that a line of steamers trading from the East, and ha.ving Port Darwin as a port of call, would be of material assistance in the development of that Territory. It is of extreme importance to Queensland that no restrictions whatever should be placed upon the communication between port and port on her very long coast-line. It is of great importance to that State to maintain frequent communication with the Old&#34; Country, because, <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> Queensland is the great exporting State of the Commonwealth. It is further absolutely necessary that there should be the freest possible intercourse between the Northern Territory and Queensland, and now that the State Government has completed arrangements for a service with the British-India Company, I wish to know whether, under this Bill, any restrictions are likely to be imposed on the operations of those vessels. Many years ago we had steamers of the same company trading to Queensland ports <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Torres Straits, and there is no doubt whatever that the service then established was a powerful factor in opening up the trade of the ports of Northern Queensland, and in connecting them with the southern ports of the State and with the other States of Australia. For many reasons, chiefly, I believe, financial reasons, the subsidy formely paid to the company was withdrawn, and the service discontinued. It is now recognised that, in view of the increasing volume of Queensland exports, there should be frequent communication between that State, and the Old Country. The necessity for the pursuance of an immigration policy is also recognised. One of the objects of the new contract entered into with the British-India Company is to provide for the introduction of immigrants to Queensland. In the circumstances, I wish to know what will be the exact position under this&#39; Bill of the steamers engaged in this service. I point out that, under the previous contract with the British-India Company, the steamers were under no disability whatever in trading between port and port. The vessels of local companies engaged in the coasting trade had to face the competition of tne British-India boats, whether they liked it or not. I have said that the original British-India service to Queensland ports was a considerable factor in promoting the development of the northern part of the State. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will understand why I desire to know what is likely to be the position of the boats of this company engaged in the new contract under the provisions of this Bill. I am aware that honorable senators are anxious that we should get into Committee as soon as possible, and I shall not, therefore, detain the Senate longer. I hope that in Committee we shall be given explicit information on some of the points I have mentioned. </para>

                        of this measure, so far as its effect upon Queensland interests is concerned. I listened with great attention to all the speeches that have teen made, and with particular interest to those of the honorable senators opposite, and I must say that I did not hear one from the other side that was not restrictive in its character, and did not disclose a. willingness to discriminate against the Mother Country. We may, I think, claim that the people of Australia are the happiest people on the face of the earth, and when we consider that the development which has taken place during over 100 years of peaceful progress has been in a great measure due to the protection afforded by the Mother Country, we have the more reason to be astonished that the provisions of the Bill now before us should, so far from being generous in their application to the trading interests of the Old Country, impose restrictions, the tendency of which must be to drive British ships out of the Australian trade.

                            <para>- I shall not enter into an argument with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> as to what is an Australian ship. If he does not know by this time what an Australian ship is, he ought not to be a member of the Senate. I have risen, not to offer  a  general criticism of the Bill, as that task has been performed by other honorable senators better qualified to undertake it. I have risen particularly to direct attention to a consideration that in my opinion is of paramount importance. Honorable senators will look in vain to the provisions of this Bill for any indication of concern for the development of the producing interests of Australia. In the shipping industry we have at present a condition of affairs in Australia which no doubt meets with the complete approbation of honorable senators of the Labour Party. It will probably be remembered that when in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and ex-Senator Dawson stated that they looked forward to the day when there would be only two parties in the industrial life of Australia - a union of workmen and a union of employers - I made the remark that the public would be crushed between them. The condition of affairs looked forward to by members of the Labour Party at that time is, to some extent, realized in the shipping industry of Australia at the present time. Australian shipping engaged in the coastal trade has formed  a  combine. Personally, I have no objection to a combine which conducts its business efficiently and equitably. I believe that so far the Shipping Combine has clone so, but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> cannot shut my eyes to the danger that confronts us in a possible agreement between the Labour Party and the Shipping Combine. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be very pleased to explain myself in this way : Companies engaged in the Australian coasting trade have made arrangements by which they have established a shipping combine. This has been brought about to a great extent, if not altogether, as the result of the legislation pressed forward by honorable senators opposite. I say that the Shipping Combine as at present established is in a position to do serious injury to the producing interests of Australia. That it has not done so, is because it is very wisely administered, but the danger that it may do so remains. </para>

Consequently, if, in a Bill relating to navigation, we do not legislate for difficulties and dangers which may arise, we shall fail in an important part of our duty. Some provision ought to be made to meet these contingencies. I desire to enter my protest against the restrictive policy which it is proposed (o embody in this Bill. I do not intend to occupy the time of the Senate at any further&#39; length. I trust that when it finally leaves this Chamber, the Bill will confer a benefit upon the whole of Australia. </para>

The first objection with which I shall deal is one of a somewhat strange character - an objection which was urged by the leader of the Opposition, and which has been re-echoed by several honorable senators, namely, that the Bill is prematurely before this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that for something like five years this Bill has been before Parliament or its representative Committee. It has undergone an investigation of a most searching character at the hands of the Navigation Commission, and it has also been the subject of an Imperial Conference, consisting qf most representative men. With a view to proving that the measure is prematurely before us emphasis has been laid upon the fact that a despatch from the Mother Country dealing with a comparatively few trifling matters is not yet to hand. It is a most amusing argument. Upon the one hand, the Government are blamed by a section of the Senate because they have given way too much to the suggestions of the Board of Trade, and on the other they are censured because they have not given way sufficiently. I will admit at once that, so far as the Government thought it consistent with Australian interests to accede to the suggestions of the Board of Trade, they have done so. The result is that there are not more than half-a-dozen matters of more than passing importance upon which agreement has not been arrived at. No reason whatever exists why, in regard to matters which are solely within the discretion of this Parliament, we should defer action until the reply to which reference has been made is forthcoming. The matters with which it will deal are not of serious import, and are very limited in number. </para>

                            <para>- At the present moment that circumstance has no bearing whatever upon the question at issue. In December last certain despatches from the Imperial authorities reached us, and in order that they might receive a thorough revision, we took our own time to reply to them. We did reply to them in June last. With one or two exceptions the despatches of the Board of Trade took the form of suggestions for our consideration, because that body recognised that the questions involved are essentially questions for this Parliament to determine, having a due regard to our position as a component part of the Empire. I am perfectly sure that the same confidence which has hitherto been reposed in this Parliament will continue to be reposed in it. There is no reason why - especially in view of the shortness of the present session - we should await the despatch to which reference has been made before dealing with this Bill, because that despatch relates to .matters of no great importance, and matters which arc solely within our discretion. In dealing with the criticism of my honorable friends. I think I may confine my remarks to three fundamental objections which they have urged. Of course, various clauses of the Bill have been criticised, and with the more important of these criticisms I propose to deal. I may perhaps be pardoned for not replying to the others at the present stage, because they are matters which can be better dealt with in Committee. In the first place, we have been told that the Government have not given effect to the resolutions of the Navigation Conference. </para>

                            <para>- Never at any time have the Government stated that the measure would not be &#39;proceeded with. The three fundamental objections are, first, that we have not carried out the resolutions of the Conference; secondly, that the Bill in its terms is anti-British, and thirdly, that in various provisions it shows a preference for the foreigner rather than for the Britisher. There is no foundation for those fundamental objections; they are purely imaginary. As regards the first, I ask my honorable friends if they are content to confine our legislation on navigation and shipping to ships registered in Australia and ships trading on our coast? In their protest against the Bill that was the attitude which they took up. I have given to my honorable friends an assurance from our representatives - some of whom I have consulted - that as regards resolution 9, which refers to the conditions to be imposed as to ships registered in Australia and ships trading on our coast, it was not at any moment suggested that our legislation should be confined to those classes of ships. I have told them that such -an idea never entered our minds. Moreover, I have made the reasonable suggestion, that we should read all the resolutions together.

                            <para>- My honorable friends are blaming the Government in that they have not surrendered our rights in the framing of the Bill because, among other things, we say that we shall not permit any ships, British or foreign, to leave our shores if they are in an unseaworthy condition as to machinery, equipment, number, and competency of crew. Such a thing is unheard of, and will not, of course, be sanctioned by this or the other Chamber. The next fundamental objection that is urged against the Bill is that it is anti-  British. That is about the most amusing criticism that we could have heard. Hearing it so frequently from the other side, it reminds us of the time when the Immigration Restriction Bill was introduced. In those days we heard of the selfishness of certain politicians in Australia in disregarding the interests of the Empire, and doing something essentially in our own interests. We were described as an unpatriotic body of men who were engaged in doing everything we could to thwart British interests in Australian territory. Recently we have had a repetition of that sort of talk. </para>

                            <para>- I am alluding to the talk from that side of the House in those days, and pointing out that we are still hearing the same thing from that quarter. It is quite true that there is a stil  1  small voice crying in the wilderness in the person of our esteemed friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> whom, I would call not, a lone fisherman, but. a lone anti- White Australian. We still hear from my honorable friend the same complaint that in passing that measure we were unpatriotic. That was the character of the criticism which we had from the other side. But what do we find now? A few short years have passed, with the result that some of my honorable friends opposite are tumbling over each other in their anxiety to declare their admiration of the wisdom of the White Australia policy. In the .same way, the anti-patriotic criticism which we now hear will have vanished within a very short time, and it will be admitted, &#39; even from the other side, that in exercising our power to do what was right to Australia, without doing injustice to the Mother Country, we assisted in the &#34;building up of the Empire as a whole. The foundation of this criticism is that, according to  mv  honorable friend, there is a possibility of confining the exemption referred to in clause 279 to ships manned by white crews. In passing. I would simply say that on the face of the measure it is not capable of that interpretation, but I shall be fair to my honorable friends, and say that it will be possible, by an Order in Council, to confine that exemption to certain ships which do&#39; carry white crews. </para>

Practically there is none. Apart from the merits &#60;.f a White Ocean policy, but discussing the abstract principle only, I ask if it is admitted that there is nothing unpatriotic in our Immigration Restriction Act, is it not absurd to suggest, because of section 279, this Bill is anti-British ? </para>

I  approved of the legislation which separated the white and coloured races in Australia. Then I said that it is our. duty, having done so much, 1.0 avoid any legislation which is insulting to coloured races. I make a wide and absolute distinction between residence in Australia and anything approaching a White Ocean policy. I shall be glad if that is recognised. </para>

                            <para>- I never suspected the honorable senator of any other view. The third fundamental feature to which I have to refer is that which was mentioned by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and re-echoed by several other senators. It was said that we were differentiating to the disadvantage of British ships; that, in other words, we were giving a preference to foreigners in Part II. of the Bill, and were most ungenerously taking advantage of our power of legislation to do an injustice to the Mother Country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> usually gives thoughtful consideration to these matters; but I am certain that he cannot have favoured us with the result of his mature thought in this instance. I invite him to look at British legislation in regard to matters of internal management such as are mentioned in Part II. of the Bill ; that is, matters relating to the superintendent, officers, supplying seamen, apprentices, the rating of seamen, the crew, the agreement, discharge of seamen, seamen&#39;s wages, seamen&#39;s money orders, discipline, provisions, health, accommodation, protection of seamen, property of deceased seamen, relief to seamen&#39;s families, distressed seamen, the master, the log, and inquests. Those are all more or less matters of internal management and administration. We have, in dealing, with these subjects, first of all to take a glance at the policy of British legislation. While the Imperial Parliament legislates as it thinks proper, and while all the Imperial legislation affecting the oversea Dominions applies throughout the whole Empire, it has never at any time attempted to deal with foreign ships in regard to these subjects. The Imperial Parliament legislates for the shores and territorial waters of Great Britain ; but does not attempt to deal with foreign ships, with their discipline or agreements or contracts between foreign owners and crews. </para>

                            <para>- No; but that matter is not dealt with in these provisions, which relate to internal management. There is. of course, power under the  1906  Act to enforce conditions as to load-lines, overloading, undermanning, and a number of similar matters. Those are applicable to foreign ships within British territorial waters, and there is power to detain such ships under section  462,  as amended by the Act of  1897,  and further modified by the Act of  1906.  I have drawn attention to the general policy of British legislation in that regard. I am then asked why it is that we confine Part II. of the Bill to British ships. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to evade that question. First of all, it will be obvious to honorable senators that we cannot deal with foreigners as to these particular classes of matters ; because, if we attempted to do so, it would involve international complications. Great Britain would not see her way to consent to our measure, or would more probably disallow it. Consequently, we must start out from the position that we have no power to apply clauses of the kind to foreign ships. Then it is asked, &#34;Why should we seek to apply them to British ships?&#34; </para>

Such a suggestion has never been made by the Board of Trade itself or by the British Government. </para>

                            <para>- Their criticisms were founded on the Bill introduced in the Senate in 1907, which dealt with the very matter that my honorable friend has referred to. What he probably has in mind is a Bill that was never under the direct consideration of the Imperial Conference at all, although it was incidentally referred to there. What was under their direct notice was the report of our Navigation Commission. It was only in so far as that report suggested alterations of the Bill of 1904 that it was incidentally referred to. I should like my honorable friends opposite to be seized of that. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that presently if my honorable friend will permit me. I asked the honorable senator what were the burdens to which he&#34; referred, and he gave me one or two instances. Let me say, first of all, that the point I have been making is that Part II. of the Bill does not impose any burdens at all. What we are doing is in accordance with the policy of the Merchant Shipping Act itself. The second point I make is that these are not burdens on British ships, and that all that is attempted are restrictions which make for liberty - efforts to interpose between master and man for the purpose of securing more satisfactory discipline, and matters of that character. The clauses referred to deal with matters of adjustment, in regard to which we have, of course, the widest discretion. When I asked what were the particular burdens to which the honorable senator referred, he practically rested his whole case on clause 23. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator asks an extraordinary question. First of all, there was the clause appearing in the Bill of 1907. Certain objections were made to it by the British Government and the Board of Trade. We subsequently took into consideration the suggestions and representations then made, and we altered the clause in such a way as I venture to think renders it entirely unobjectionable.

I have shown that, as a matter of fact, it is the same as the British legislation. </para>

After looking into the matter, and consulting with those present at the Conference, I have no doubt that what was feared was that the clause would permit  of some prying -or inquiry into Board of Trade certificates. That, of course, was not intended, and, in deference to their representations, we altered the clause to read as it now stands - </para>

                        <para>By putting it in that form it is believed that the objection of the Board of Trade will be met. If this qualification had appeared in the clause as originally submitted, it is probable there would never have been any criticism of the provision at all. So much for this clause 23, about which so much fuss has been made by the other side as imposing a burden upon British shipping. First of all, it is British legislation. Secondly, there is the modification, and then I draw attention to the fact that no exception was taken to Part II. of the Bill, because it was thought we imposed burdens. I have denied altogether that it does impose burdens on British shipping which are not imposed on foreign shipping. If honorable senators will look at the various objections which the Board of Trade have made to Part II., they will see that they simply draw our attention to certain things, make suggestions in regard to others, but never for a moment dispute our right to legislate in regard to them. They do not challenge our right to make any alteration. </para>

                            <para>- That is consistent with mv contention from the beginning that we are honestly carrying out the resolutions of the Conference. In the various objections taken, no protest has been made against the provisions of the Bill as representing burdens. They are regarded as in pursuance of the&#39; policy of the Merchant Shipping Act, and we are permitted to deal with these matters in our own way. All that the Imperial authorities have attempted to do is to submit suggestions for our consideration, and in some cases to ask us to accept certain views which they urge. We have done so in many cases. I submit that that indicates conclusively enough that it was never in the minds of the British Government, British ship-owners, or the Board of Trade, that we were imposing conditions and burdens on British shipping that we did not impose upon foreigners, and were thus taking advantage of our position in order to prefer the foreigner to the British ship-owner. It is worth the while of honorable senators to look at these objections in order to verify the statement I have made about them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not at all assent to the suggestion of Lord Elgin. We deny it altogether. In only one instance, speaking subject to correction, did the British Government or the Board of Trade suggest that bv reason of a certain clause the foreign ship-owner might be preferred to the British, and in that instance we made the alteration requested so as to put it beyond all doubt that such a contingency could not arise. More than that, we gave the Imperial authorities the assurance - which I now gladly repeat - that if any clearer language were necessary to establish the proposition that under no circumstances would the foreign ship-owner be preferred to the British, that language would be inserted: I now come to the next point dealt with by the leader of the Opposition - the manning scale. I did not understand him to say that he objected to the scale provided in this Bill. However, he will have an opportunity of dealing with that question subsequently. What I wish to point out is that the manning scale embodied in this measure is not the outcome of any new suggestion. As a matter of fact, that is the result of a suggestion by a body of experts representative of the whole Commonwealth. </para>

Knowing our own coastal shipping as we do-having an intimate acquaintance with the manning requisite upon the different vessels engaged in the trade - we provide a general scale. But we recognise that ships are differently constructed, and therefore that scale has not been made a cast-iron one. Instead, we have provided a scale which will accommodate itself to any class of vessel, so as to obviate the possibility of hardship or injustice. In order to prevent hasty action, provision has been made in sub-clause 2 of clause 416 for the appointment of a representative committee of experts to advise the Minister upon this all-important matter.

Whether a vessel has a full complement on board is a matter which will at once be apparent to the trained official eye. Our officers have to be satisfied upon this point in just the same way as the British expert officers have to be satisfied that a ship is manned by a competent crew. </para>

Clause  133  of this Bill provides for certain accommodation for officers, and that, if I remember rightly, is the same as British legislation. Clause  1.34  deals with the sleeping accommodation, and, subject to an alteration, it is practically in the same terms as British legislation. It provides that - </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is referring to certain representations which were brought under our notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> my information is that they are quite exaggerated. They are apparently made on the basis that the Bill provides that the mess-room which is to be provided is to accommodate practically the whole of the crew. When the clauses are reached they will require analysis, and we shall ascertain what is the exact position. The point is that unless a ship is insanitary - and no one will protest against alterations being made in that case - these conditions will only apply to ships to be built hereafter. My. honorable friend made a point in regard to clause 201. We specifically provide there that the certificates of the British Board of Trade are to be accepted, but my honorable friend objected to sub-clause 2, which reads - </para>

                    <para>My honorable friend is under a misapprehension. He will see that the first portion of the clause deals with that class of ships which are provided with a British Board of Trade certificate- We say that except in cases of emergency such certificates are to be accepted. But sub-clause 2 deals practically with British ships which do not possess such certificates - that is with British ships which are registered in other Colonies, and to which, of course, British law applies. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly it does. I now come to clause 279, concerning which a great deal has been said. I have to give special attention to this provision, because of the extraordinary criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, which could only have been made without a reading of the clause. He put to me the case of the British India Company&#39;s steam-ships trading on the north-east coast of Queensland, and asked whether they would be exempted as regards passengers and cargo. The clause is most specific. The ships have to carry mails, and the provision is to apply to passengers only, and not to cargo. </para>

It can only live with the consent of a majority in Parliament, and whatever a Ministry may do under this measure will be done pursuant to the will of Parliament. It is perfectly obvious that this clause was made to apply to all the ports of Australia. It is equally obvious that it- can only apply to passengers, and not to cargo. </para>

                            <para>- It is very difficult for me to deal with everything that has been mentioned ; but I wish to refer now to certain objections by the Steam-ship Owners Association. In the first place, they urge that Parts I. and VIII. of the Merchant Shipping Act should be included in this measure. Part I. of the Act refers to a certain registry of ships, and Part VIII.,. I think, fixes the liability of owners of ships. That is the law in the Commonwealth at the present day, and neither directly nor indirectly do we attempt to interfere with it. What, in those circumstances, have the steam-ship owners to object to? </para>

                            <para>- In that case, we are accommodating the law immediately to our own circumstances, but no reason has been  suggested why we should encumber this Bill with any provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act. I next come to the objection with regard to regulations. Honorable senators will see, as we come to the clauses one by one, that regulations are the only proper and effective means of dealing with the various matters. I have shown how useful it is, and how satisfactory it must be, to have an elastic means of regulating the manning scale to particular classes of ships that come to our shores from time to time. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and by regulation. Then, with regard to lights and such matters, I have to say that the terms of the British Act have nothing to do with us. Why on earth British regulations should, be made applicable to us I do not know. We shall deal with our lighthouses by a separate Act of Parliament. But 1 am at present speaking on the subject of regulations; and I say that it will be found in regard to many of the features of the Bill that it would be dangerous and improper, and would work great hardships, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> fix, by means of the cast-iron sections of an Act of Parliament, certain conditions which in many cases may be right, but which in other cases may be quite useless, and would, therefore, involve the use of all the heavy machinery entailed in altering the law. If, however, in SUCh matters, regulations can be made suitable to the conditions that arise, it will be a source of advantage to all concerned. </para>

                    <para class="block">I dare say that honorable senators are aware that, under the conditions observed in Commonwealth contracts to-day, whether for buildings or for providing material, there is a provision that the contractors shall observe the wages and labour conditions of the district in which contracts are carried out. But no machinery is provided by which due recognition is given to the principle embodied in a resolution carried in both Houses of the Parliament some years ago, and was also included in the Post and Telegraph Act. In some of the States there are bodies established by law, such as Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards, which lay down schedules of wages. For instance, in the building trades there is a schedule, and in the clothing trades there is a &#34; log.&#34; Of course, in the States where such conditions prevail, provision is made for the observance of them. We have, in the Commonwealth, carried out this principle of the appointment of inspectors regarding the quality, of material supplied and of work done. In some cases our work is carried out by the Public Works Departments of the States. For instance, in Western Australia it is carried out by the State Public Works Department, whose inspectors supervize the quality of work done for the Commonwealth, just as they do for the State. In New South Wales and Victoria the work is done by the Commonwealth Public Works Department directly, which has inspectors for the same purposes. As regards the labour conditions, in Western Australia the building trades work under an award of the Arbitration Court. But under the law in Western Australia there is no statutory provision for the supervision of the work, so as to insure that the proper wages are paid. The employes have to police the Act. In the building trades experience shows that the wages conditions are properly observed. I know of no instances in which the labour conditions affecting the building trades in Western Australia are disregarded. </para>

                            <para>- I think not, although it has been alleged that in one or two cases the law has been evaded. But I have no personal knowledge to that effect, and, therefore, make no statement of my own concerning it. But there are other States in which no such statutory provision is made for setting up a standard of wages, and where our Public Works Department would have to fall back either upon the recognised standard of the trade, or would have to make  a  standard of its own, and announce that to be the standard under which works are to be tendered for. In connexion with the clothing trade - again referring to my own State - matters are by no means so satisfactory. The clothing trade in Western Australia has obtained.,- I suppose, about the best award under which the clothing trade in any part of the Commonwealth is conducted. I venture to say that the conditions of the award regarding apprentices form a model for other States. We have practically adopted the recommendations contained in a report by the Commission appointed in Victoria to inquire into the subject. But when I was in Western Australia during the recess numerous complaints were made to me by members of the union, and by women workers particularly, that they found very great difficulty in enforcing the award. Honorable senators are aware that women are largely engaged in the clothing trade, and they have a diffidence about reporting cases where the wages conditions are not observed. Many of them have no knowledge of the conditions. They may be outside the union, and, not being fully aware of the terms under which they ought to be working, and accept what the employers  choose to give them. In other States, as 1 will show the Senate presently - in one State, at any rate - the clothing contracts of the Commonwealth have been carried out under what can only be described as shameful conditions, and in disregard of the terms specified in our tender forms. It will be obvious, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that if we lay down certain conditions, and call for tenders under them, and if a tender is accepted, and the contractor does not observe the conditions, he is simply guilty of fraud ; and I am sure that no- honorable senator would have the least sympathy or consideration for a man who tendered&#39; under conditions pledging him to observe standard rates of wages, and who, having obtained a contract in competition with other contractors, defeated what was aimed, at by the Legislature. I have just pointed out the method by which the building contracts for the Commonwealth are carried out. I now wish to show the conditions under which clothing contracts are conducted. Here a most unsatisfactory system obtains. I have no fault to find with the manner in which the postal contracts are managed, and the departmental control exercised. But I do find fault with the manner in which the contracts for the Defence Department are observed. Again I speak for my own State, but I believe that the rule obtains throughout the Commonwealth. Instead of the military commandant, or even the staff officers, having control of the military contracts, each regimental commanding officer calls for tenders for the supply of uniforms for his particular unit of the Defence Force. Many of these regimental officers are hardworking business men. The whole of their time in business hours is taken up with their private concerns. They merely devote their leisure to the drilling and affairs of their regiments. Yet they are expected to call for tenders, to accept a tender, to allot it, and generally to supervise the. carrying out of the contract. I believe that by arrangement with the State Government in Western Australia these officers have the assistance of the State Tender Board. But that is simply a departmental Board, consisting of a certain number of officers - three or five - who have the tenders brought before them, and recommend which should be accepted. My information is that whilst there is an inspector - a State officer - who inspects the material and the made-up garments in order to see that the work is of proper quality, there is absolutely no inspection and control whatever of the method in which the work is carried out for the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- In Western Australia there is a State Factories Act and an Arbitration Act, but I am pointing out that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, although State officers acting for the Defence Department supervises the material and workmanship, that is the only supervision that is exercised, apart from that given in some States by legislation such as Factories or Arbitration Acts. The point I wish to make is that in States where no such legislation exists the only supervision, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, is as to quality of material and workmanship. Where there is no statutory regulation of labour conditions there is no supervision of those conditions. I have said that in the clothing trade in Western Australia - and other honorable senators from that State have had the same complaint made to them - there is no supervision of the labour conditions, particularly in connexion with the supply of postal and military uniforms. </para>

                            <para>- I am not complaining that there are no such statutory provisions in Western Australia. There are such provisions, but there is no one charged with the duty on behalf of the Commonwealth of seeing that the statutory conditions are observed. Under the Western Australian Arbitration Act, it is left to the trade union concerned to see that the statutory conditions are observed. There are many engaged in the manufacture of clothing who do not belong to a trade union, and there is some subletting of these contracts. I shall give an example of what occurs in Tasmania, where the workers have no statutory protection. One can easily imagine that if the statutory conditions are evaded in a State in which they have been laid down by legislation, good conditions are not likely to be observed in a State which has made no statutory provision. </para>

                    <para>SenatorPEARCE. - This has nothing to do with wages conditions and hours of labour, which are fixed by the Arbitration Court. In South Australia the whole matter is covered by one Statute - the Factories Act - but in Western Australia there are two Statutes dealing with these matters. I have here the evidence given before the Royal Commission on wages and wage-earners, appointed by the State Government of Tasmania in  1906.  I shall read a few extracts from the evidence to show what has actually taken place in that State in connexion with contracts for the supply of military and postal uniforms. I may say that, I believe by order of the Government of Tasmania, in this publication the names of witnesses and of business firms are omitted. I believe that the object was to protect certain witnesses, who thought they might be injured if their names were published. </para>

                    <para>So far as the military and postal uniforms are concerned, it is scarcely necessary for me to point out that they are of a uniform character, and it is quite probable that a man holding these ideas would pay a woman less - for performing the same class of work - than a man. Another tailor who had been employed upon piece work during the preceding twelve months, was asked -  12622. What wages can you earn, working the ordinary hours, 8 till 6, on piece-work, at 15s. 6d. a coat? - If I were kept fully employed I could make &#163;3 to , &#163;3 5s. 12623. There are times that you are not kept fully employed? - Yes; about nine months of the year. Sometimes only one job a week ; then, perhaps, none for a week. This is our Best time that is just before us. 12624. For nine months of the year you would be slack? - Yes. 12625. What would your average earnings for a year be ? - It would not come to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;110s.</inline> Some weeks I get nothing, and sometimes it is13s. and 14s. a week. 12626. Can you give us any idea why you are not employed here regularly? - Yes; because the women are taking our places and doing the work. 12627. On coats? - Yes. They import them from Melbourne and Sydney. 12628. <inline font-style="italic">By the</inline> President.  - What do they import? - Tailors and tailoresses. 12629. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Long.</inline> - Is there really any necessity to import those people ? - Certainly not. <inline font-style="italic">12630.</inline> Am I to understand that people are imported from the other States despite the fact that the&#39; labour is here ? - Yes. 12631. Do they get them at the ruling rate? - I do not say what they get them at. 12632. The tendency is to supplant men labour with women labour ? - Yes; there is no doubt about it. 12633. Would that be characteristic of the trade generally? - Yes. We feel we have a grievance. They bring the men and women over here to do our work, and they take <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30</inline> or &#163;40 in a season, while we stay here and pay our taxes. We consider it very unfair to us, the fathers of families, who stop here all the year round. </para>
                    <para class="block">That evil would be quickly cured if employers were compelled to pay women the same wages - for the same class of work - that they are required to pay men. Under the award in Western Australia a woman is paid the same rate as a man for the same class of work. </para>

Upon page 261 of the same report, a tailoress is examined as follows - 13885. You reside at High-street? - Yes. 13886. You undertake piece-work in this line of business? - Yes. 13887. For different firms? - Yes. 13888. For- ?- Yes. 13896. Do you do any contract work? - Yes. </para>

You complete those trousers, with the exception of cutting out? - Yes. They find everything- thread, <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c.</inline> 13899. For cadets? - Ninepence for those: they find everything. I finish them right off ready for wearing. </para>
                    <para>There is a, clear case of subletting, which is distinctly forbidden under the conditions of contract. The examination of the same witness is thus continued -  13911. Taking week for week, what do you earn on the average at those prices? - I may earn ten shillings on that. 13912. Would ten shillings be a fair average if you were constantly employed ? - Yes ; I dare say it would if I were kept going. 13917. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Long.</inline> - In earning that ten shillings you would have to work different hours ? - Yes ; I work all hours. I might not be working in the afternoon, but I might at night. I do the work as I can get time to do it. 13918. Is your husband alive? - Yes. 13919. Have you any family? - One child. 13920. From whom do you receive this work? 13924. These cadet trousers - whom do you get that work from? - cuts them out; pays me. </para>
                    <para class="block">I dare say that the gentleman who paid the witness was an individual who had previously given evidence before this Commission, which seems to have been in the habit of first taking the evidence of an employer, and afterwards of listening to the testimony of his employ&#233;s. According to the testimony of the last witness, a distinct breach of the contract conditions was committed in subletting to her the making of cadet uniforms. Evidently, there is no recognised scale for the payment of women engaged in this line in Tasmania. I quite recognise that the services of an inspector in this connexion would be useless unless  a scale was first laid down, and he was instructed to secure its observance. I brought this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General more than twelve months ago, and he informed me that it was his intention to instruct his officers in Hobart to draw up a scale of wages, submit it to employers and employ&#233;s, take their evidence in regard to it, and, if that scale were mutually satisfactory, to adopt it in all postal contracts. Evidently very low prices have been paid in Tasmania for work of this kind - especially women&#39;s work. </para>

                            <para>- Probably some of these young women, had worked in factories in Melbourne and elsewhere, and their , parents having removed to Tasmania, they were content to accept similar employment there. But my point is that if the Postmaster-General has fulfilled his promise, there is now a recognised scale of wages in Hobart. But even, if that Be so, there is nobody in that city to enforce its observance.&#34; If this Parliament  is in favour of the observance of wages conditions, it should insist upon the same supervision being exercised over them that it insists upon, so far as the quality of the material supplied by contractors is concerned. I believe that in every capital city in Australia there is sufficient Commonwealth work being carried on to keep an inspector fully employed, and it might be portion of his function to see that proper wages conditions are observed. It would be a simple matter for the Minister of Home Affairs to establish a wages standard  in  connexion with every building that is being erected by the Commonwealth, and to insist upon its being posted by the contractor in a conspicuous place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> informs me that when he was a Minister in Victoria he enforced that practice. - Every contractor should be compelled to post on his contract the log which he is observing. An occasional visit by an inspector would afford the employes an opportunity of complaining if the wages conditions were not being fulfilled. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that the judge will be the Minister. If he says to certain persons, &#34; I want you to contract for the making of so many coats, and to undertake to pay the standard rate, and this log is the standard rate which I recognise,&#34; every tenderer will know what he will have to pay. And having contracted with his eyes open, a contractor will not be able to complain when he is asked by the inspector to observe the conditions under which he tendered. It seems to me that in this matter Ministers have shown great laxity. Although these conditions have been embodied in all contracts, still I have not noticed any determined effort to enforce them. </para>

If a certain statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> has been made with authority from the Government, I have some reason to think that there has been something wrong in connexion with  the tenders. I am anxious to bring out what wrong there has been. In Monday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> the following statement appears - </para>

                <para>Tenders were called for the six first-named stations, and tenders from five of the leading companies were received. Not one of these tenders, however, provided for the erection and installation of the wireless system. All that the companies cared to do was to sell to the Government the necessary equipment, leaving to the Postal Department the responsibility of installation. In these circumstances none of the tenders have been accepted. </para>
                <para class="block">In different parts of Australia, and in Tasmania, a great deal of interest has been ta,ken in the question of wireless telegraphy, and the deplorable catastrophe which happened quite recently on the Tasmanian coast is a further illustration of the necessity of establishing some communication with our outlying islands. The public want to know what the Government intend to do - whether they are acting in accordance with what they promised some time ago, or why the establishment of this service, which is so keenly desired, and which is so absolutely necessary for the safety of the sea-going public in Bass Strait and round the coast of Australia generally, should unnecessarily be delayed. I have information that tenders were submitted which did provide for erection and complete installation, and taking full responsibility for the success of the work. If that . be so, the statement? made in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> must have been absolutely incorrect. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able to embody a contradiction of that statement in the return which will be made to the order of the Senate.

                    <para>Wireless telegraphy was usable for the requirements of Australia, but not commercially justifiable. There would be no proper return for the outlay.

                <para>If any official in the employ of the Department might be presumed to know anything about the matter, one would think that the Chief Electrical Engineer would. Here he is reported distinctly as having asserted that these tenders were called for simply with the idea of enabling the Department to find out what would be the cost of establishing this installation. I need not say that such a course would be exceedingly undesirable; indeed, exceedingly wrong. I should think that if it is true it would give the firms who tendered a just claim against the Government as regards the cost to which they have been put. I cannot help but think that the Government will have some reply to make to this statement. </para>

                    <para>. -  It appears to me that the term &#34;public ships&#34; used in this clause means either men-of-war clr ships belonging to States Governments. I do not think that the Committee intends to exempt the latter class of vessels. The State of Victoria, for instance, has a fleet of ships. There are pilot vessels., boats to attend to light houses, dredges, and barges. They would all be &#34; public ships &#34; under this clause. A &#34;ship&#34; is any vessel not propelled by oars, and &#34; public &#34; means anything belonging to the public. I quite agree that we have no right to interfere with ships of war, whether. British or foreign. In New South Wales, however, the State Government has vessels which are used for commercial purposes. They should comply with the conditions prescribed as to manning, provisioning, and so forth. I think that the word &#34;public&#34; should be struck out, and that we should simply use the term &#34; ships of war.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the clause should remain as it stands. The term &#34; public ships &#34; is intended to refer not only to ships of war, but to such vessels as the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Lady Loch.</inline> It is hardly reasonable to say that such ships are engaged for commercial purposes. They are kept to do the ordinary public work of the States. The <inline font-style="italic">Lady Loch</inline> supplies stores to the lighthouses. The States employ ships in connexion with their harbors and for various other purposes. They, are not used in competition with private owners, and those engaged upon them are not employed under sweating conditions. It is the best class of employment. I consider that the small exemption granted to the States under this clause need not be taken exception to. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council said this afternoon with some emphasis that it was desirable to adhere as far as possible to the wording of the British Merchant Shipping Act. He also said that where the terms of that Act were departed from, there was a liability to give ground for points of law. I find in the Merchant Shipping Act this exceedingly simple section: - </para>

I raised the point under discussion with a view of making the Bill as free from ambiguity as possible. I still feel that the term &#34;public ship&#34; is open to challenge. It is hardly definite enough. We speak of &#34;public buildings,&#34; but the term covers a wide range. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has mentioned the <inline font-style="italic">Lady Lock.,</inline> That vessel is using important waterways, where there is a large amount of traffic. Do we mean to say that we shall exempt a ship like the <inline font-style="italic">Lady Loch</inline> from&#39; carrying a certificated master, a. certificated engineer, or certificated officers ? It is quite possible for men to be put into vessels of that class who are not thoroughly competent if we do not insist upon their being certificated; and in such a case disaster may be caused, not only to the vessel in question, but to other ships with which she may come in contact. A grave mistake wilt be made in exempting them. In the case of ships of war we have the assurance that the officers in charge are men who have passed naval examinations before reaching the positions they occupy. But it may be possible for men to be put on board ships, owned by a State, to take charge of machinery, or the vessels themselves, although they do not hold certificates. </para>

                        <para>- We have often seen men pitchforked into positions which they were not capable of filling. I am not speaking of the <inline font-style="italic">Lady Loch,</inline> but I know of ships, on board which men have been put although they had not the necessary qualifications for the positions for which they were appointed. The same thing may happen again. I believe that the New South Wales Government have steamers which are used for commercial purposes. This clause would exempt them from carrying certificated officers. Again, the question of survey is important. A State department that was cutting down expenditure, might, instead of having a survey made once in six months, have one not oftener than three or four years. If it is considered that these conditions are necessary, they should apply to all vessels except ships of war. Again, as to manning; surely if we are going to impose a manning law for other ships, vessels of the same tonnage belonging to a State should be in the -same position. </para>

We have heard of explosions in Government ships, and of the explosion of locomotive boilers, which would probably have been prevented if they had been subject to proper survey. We are making provision under this Bill for surveys, and are appointing surveyors, and what I suggest should, I think, be agreed to in the interests, not only of the Government ships, but of those employed ih them. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is unnecessarily concerned about those who are engaged in public ships belonging to the several States Governments or to the Commonwealth. The honorable senator&#39;s argument presupposes considerable laxity on the part of public Departments. In Western Australia we have a Steam Boilers&#39; Inspection Act, but it is not applied to the inspection of the boilers of locomotives used on the Government railways, for the reason that it is assumed that they are the subject of strict departmental supervision and inspection. I feel that the same principle might well be applied to public ships. I am satisfied that the ships belonging to the several States Governments are under a form of departmental surveillance sufficiently rigid to make the occurrence of any accident due to defective machinery very unlikely. </para>

                    <para>. - The only case in which I imagine there might be some reason for applying the provisions of this Bill to public ships would be where for some reason they are leased to private companies. I think we have very little danger to fear where the ships are to remain under the control of the Government of a State or of the- Commonwealth. Some witnesses who appeared before the Navigation Commission referred to this matter, and I think it was generally admitted that the danger against which it was sought to provide was very unlikely to arise. I think we are justified in assuming that ordinarily public ships will be under complete supervision, and there will be very little chance of anything going wrong. I cannot believe that&#39; any Minister would tolerate the leasing of a public ship to private individuals on the understanding that it would be exempt from, the provisions of this Bill. I take the most extraordinary case that could be imagined - that of a Labour Government using Government ships to trade on the coast, and&#39; giving them an advantage over those owned&#39; by private individuals. I am quite sure, from the way in which labour men generally look at these things, that they would see that competent men were placed in charge of the ships, and would require compliance with labour conditions of a very high standard. If we take the case of a Government opposed to the nationalization of the shipping industry, we might depend upon them to take very good care that a public ship would not be given any advantage over one running in the interests of private enterprise. I do not anticipate that any danger is likely to arise under the clause. </para>

I believe I am correct when I say that even if we so desired, we could not apply the provisions of this Bill to foreign ships of war. By international law, foreign ships &#39;of war have certain rights everywhere. It will be found that section 41 of the Merchant Shipping Act simply exempts ships belonging to  His  Majesty. Why should we go beyond that? Why should we assume to have any power to deal with foreign ships of war? I move - </para>

I ask honorable senators to consider the clause, and say whether it does not include everything mentioned in the Merchant Shipping Act. We are trying to express what we wish to do. First of all, we say that this Act shall not apply to public ships belonging to the King. If we wished to differentiate very nicely, public ships belonging to the King would not include a private yacht belonging to  His  Majesty.

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to show why the clause should be permitted to remain as it stands. Recent decisions of the High Court, amongst other things, should induce us to refrain from amending it in the way suggested. Apart from that, I am satisfied that the States Governments have a high regard for their public servants, and we may confidently assume that they will treat them properlv. As regards the amendment, I should hope that we will not make any attempt to interfere with foreign ships of war ; but I say that the direction appearing on the face of the Bill that they are not to be interfered with may operate as a useful instruction to our officers. Of what use is it to quarrel over small matters of this kind ? </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council evidently desires to belittle the importance of this matter. The words which I wish to delete deal . with foreign ships of war - the representatives of the maritime power of foreign nations. The more I think over the matter the more certain I am fh&#39;af we ought not to assume that we have power to legislate in respect of those vessels. Great Britain would not arrogate to herself a power which she does not possess, and certainly we ought not to do so. I am quite sure that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is not justified in ridiculing my amendment, which I trust will commend&#34; itself to the good sense of the Committee. The Minister should feel indebted to any honorable senator who suggests a way in which this measure can be improved, and I hold that my amendment if adopted would certainly have that effect. </para>

                    <para>. - To some extent I dealt with this matter in moving the second reading of the Bill. The view of the Government, which is founded upon leading cases on the subject is that the Commonwealth has control over all navigable waters which can be used by ships - trading from one State to another. There is, however, a certain class of waters - lakes, for instance - which can be approached only from the State in which they are situated. These are &#34; inland waters.&#34; Perhaps it is advisable that I should read, for the information of honorable senators, two or three extracts from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Constitutional Law,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark, in which he deals with the principles that I have already laid down. Upon page 104 of that work,&#39; in- discussing the Federal control of the rivers of the Commonwealth, he says - </para>

                <para>It has been repeatedly decided in the United States that the navigable character of a river, by virtue of which it is subject to the power of Congress in relation to trade and commerce, does not depend upon the instruments or methods of navigation by which commerce may be conducted upon it.

                        <para>- Yes. They ultimately flow into the Murray. That is the law upon the subject. 1 dealt with this matter pretty fully in my second-reading speech, and I pointed out that the object of reserving inland waters in the manner proposed in this Bill is to avoid any onslaught being made upon the constitutionality of the measure. Honorable senators will see that those waters which are not navigable in ships coming from other States cannot be interfered with, and are exempted from the provision of this Bill. I&#39; have discussed the matter very fully with the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, and after careful consideration <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> has advised the adoption of this form of words. </para>

                        <para>- Only a portion of the way. Each of these tributaries .becomes smaller, but they are nevertheless portions of a stream which runs from one State to another. It seems to me that the Government might with advantage have employed words in this clause, similar to those used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark. Instead of doing that they attempt to define the water, not by its geographical surroundings, not by its internal position, but by the measure of ships employed on some other water. Surely it is possible to design a better provision than that. I commend to my honorable friend even now the very happy words which he quoted, and which speak of the water as being accessible or not accessible from another State. A little time ago I inquired as to the class of ships for which the power of proclamation was sought, but evidently he has overlooked the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - That provision is intended to apply to, say, a telegraph-repairing ship, or to a ship which is engaged on a marine survey. It is an elastic provision to meet any contingency which may arise. It is difficult at this stage to say exactly what classes of ships it will include. But it is very desirable that there shall be power to exempt ships such as I have indicated. For instance, on our coast for some years past a ship has been engaged on a marine survey. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite true that in this Bill we have not included that part of the previous Bill which related to the delivery of goods and bills of lading. It is .thought that as the Parliament has power to deal with such matters it should do so in one comprehensive measure. In this Bill we deal with navigation and shipping pure and simple. In the meantime the States have their own laws in regard to the delivery of goods and bills of lading, some of them being of a complicated character. Those subjects would require to be dealt with in a far more comprehensive way than they could be dealt with in this measure. It is desired to deal at the present time only with navigation and shipping, and to take another opportunity of dealing with the all-important subject of the delivery of goods, which, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with navigation and shipping. </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to the definition of &#34; vessel,&#34; I desire to draw the attention of the Committee to a few words which I think are mischievous. I refer to the words &#34; for any purpose on the sea or.&#34; I do not attach very much importance to the matter, but I just mention the fact that they are not included in the definition of &#34; vessel &#34; in the Merchant Shipping Act. The objection I have to their retention in this clause is that they would bring under the definition of &#34; vessel &#34; a hulk or lighthouse boat. Surely it is not desired to do that ! What we mean by a vessel is, I take it, a vessel of any description which is used in navigation. It seems to me that the definition is altogether too wide. </para>

                    <para>. - If these words were intended, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has suggested, to include hulks, I think that there is something to be gained by their retention. I know that condemned ships are turned into hulks for the purpose of being towed from port to port with cargo. For instance, they are largely used by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for carrying flux along the coast to P.ort Pirie. I do not think that they would be brought under the provisions of the Bill so far as manning and other things are concerned, because they are termed here vessels, not ships. They are used for navigable purposes, as they are towed from place to place. Even in the port of Melbourne hulks are towed out to the bay and back again. They are used for long tows at sea, and with men on board. A few years ago a hulk was towed under the water, and three or four men who were on board her were drowned. I think that we ought to have some jurisdiction over hulks, although, probably, they would not come under the clauses of the Bill, as they would do if termed ships. Possibly that is why the words have been inserted in the. definition. I hope that after this explanation <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will see&#39; the advantage of retaining them. </para>

I am informed that the word &#34; ship &#34; is used throughout the Bill, and that the word &#34; vessel &#34; is not used, except in a few cases. In these circumstances,  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will see that it is desirable to retain the words. </para>

But I am quite prepared to ask leave to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that, if later on I should find any clause which would render a modification of this interpretation necessary, he will facilitate a reconsideration of the matter.

What is really meant is a ship going from a single place in Australia to any place outside, say from Sydney to Auckland. The word &#34; places &#34; is , a little misleading. </para>

Our trade with New Zealand is very important, and is growing every day. It will grow to great proportions in years to come. New Zealand is closer to us thant are many ports in Australia itself.

We should include New Zealand and the Pacific Islands in the definition of &#34; Australian trading ship.&#34; There is a precedent in the Merchant Shipping Act, in which Great Britain declared that she included the Continent of Europe, between the River Elbe and Brest, in her Home trade. I ask the Minister to consider the point, because there is a great deal in it. </para>

Many of the clauses in it are highly technical, and one cannot foresee for the moment how an amendment will affect other clause&#39;s. If I have time to look into amendments I shall be able to do greater justice to them, and to accept some to which I should not otherwise be justified in agreeing. </para>
