I suggest that the asking of a question does not come within the standing order relating to the anticipation of motions. If that standing order applied to questions, it would be impossible for an honorable senator to obtain information in regard to matters which might come within the scope of a Bill which, like the Navigation Bill, might be practically a parliamentary derelict. </para>

                            <para>- I would suggest, in answer to that fresh statement, that the answering of questions is not a matter that involves argument. Such a proposition as has been put forward would most effectually bar the obtaining of information from Ministers on a very large number of subjects, provided that they put notices on the paper, or introduced Bills and did not proceed with them, as in the case of the Navigation Bill, which has been on the paper for, I think, over a  year. It would be entirely beyond the intention of the Standing &#39;Orders to bar the asking of questions regarding matters which might come within the scope of the discussion on a parliamentary derelict measure. </para>

                    <para class="block">This matter of the putting &#39; of questions has been in my mind for some time, but I have had no desire to draw the line so strictly as to interfere with the desire of honorable senators to get the fullest possible information within reason. The question now in dispute is not the only one which might strictly and technically be ruled to go beyond the rights possessed by honorable senators in asking questions, for I have frequently noticed in questions submitted to Ministers, not only upon- notice, but more particularly without notice, requests made for information on matters of policy and matters of opinion, and not purely on matters of fact. The Senate has seen fit to assent to that practice being followed, and, therefore, I have not felt myself justified in - interfering&#34; \vsth it. But the strict reading of our Standing Orders, and the strict interpretation of the practice regarding questions, are often transgressed in this Chamber. In addition to standing order  94,  quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Pearce,</inline> there is standing order  93,  which says- </para>

                        <para>The purpose of a question is to obtain information, and nOt to supply it to the House. A question may not contain statements of facts, unless they be necessary to make the question intelligible, and can bc authenticated, nor should a question contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, or controversial or ironical expressions. . . . The expression of an opinion cannot be sought for by a question, nor the solution of an abstract &#34; legal case, or of a hypothetical proposition. &#39; </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I regard those rules as being fairly applicable to our own position. Whilst it is perfectly true that it is within the province of the  President  to direct the  Clerk  to alter any question into conformity with the standing order, still it has not been the  practice in this Chamber to draw the line too strictly, or many of the questions which are put would be disallowed or materially altered. It is, of course, within the competency of the Minister, when replying, to say : &#34; This involves a matter of opinion, or presents a hypothetical case, and is not a question that I should be expected to reply to.1&#39; Therefore, if such a question passes in the first instance the  President  and the  Clerk,  it becomes perfectly within the province of the Minister to give reasons why he should not reply to it. It is true that certain questions submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and other honorable senators have been reviewed in the past, but in those cases the rule has been much more strongly violated than it has been in this instance by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> I think, with the honorable senators who have taken .exception to the questions now before the Chair, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has exceeded the power strictly conferred upon him by the Standing Orders, and the practice of Parliament, in asking question No.- 5. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> takes exception to the amendment, because he contends that it involves the. continued severance of paragraphs  band c, and, moreover, will necessitate a request later on to reduce the duty on silk from 20 and 15 per cent, to 15 and 10 per cent. The reason I propose the insertion of the words, as I explained last night, is that&#39; . the dividing line between the two paragraphs is, otherwise, not quite clear. For instance, if. piece goods were imported which were mainly woollen, but contained a slight amount of silk thread, it might, and could well, be argued that they came under paragraph  b ;  and so in the event of goods mainly silk, but containing some woollen, it could be argued that they came under paragraph c. Objection was raised to this by the mercantile community, who urged that owing to the rather ambiguous wording, much trouble would arise; and I therefore propose, the request which is now before the Committee, and which, it will be admitted, puts an end to the ambiguity, and meets the objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> and others. But then . we are met by the rather more serious and important aspect. I admit frankly that, so far as paragraph c is concerned, it is intended as a revenue duty, recognising, as other honorable senators must, that silk has at all times been regarded as a legitimate subject for taxation. The question, therefore, that honorable senators have to consider is whether they are prepared to make a very serious sacrifice of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- It is for honorable senators to determine whether they are prepared to make the very serious sacrifice of revenue involved. The imports of silk from countries, other than the United Kingdom, are represented by&#163;600,000, and the imports from the United Kingdom by &#163;100,000. At 15 per cent., the&#163;600,000 worth would produce a revenue of&#163;90,000, while the , &#163;100,000 worth from the United Kingdom would produce&#163;10,000. I am, of course, arguing on the basis  of  the importations of 1906, being assured, as I firmly believe, that if the new duties be imposed there will be no diminution of the importations. </para>

                        <para>- I am so assured by. the departmental officers. If the duty provided for in the schedule is maintained, namely, 20 and 15 per cent., there will be produced from the ,&#163;600,000 worth of importations - I am talking in&#34; round figures - &#163;120,000, and from (the importation from the United Kingdom there will be produced .&#163;15,000. In other words, the revenue from a duty at 20 and 15 per cent, will be &#163;135,000, whereas, at the lower rate suggested, there will be only  &#163;100,000, showing a loss of revenue to the extent of &#163;35,000. And I point out to honorable senators that this is only one item in the schedule.  </para>

                        <para>- I am arguing in favour of a revenue from this particular item, which I regard as a legitimate subject for taxation. The loss of &#163;35&#62;000 is sul?&#34; stantial enough; but I point out that it does not stand alone. The goods embraced in paragraph  dare practically on all-fours with those in paragraph- c, and if the lower duty of 15 and 10 per cent, be accepted in regard to the latter, then I prophesy a, similar reduction will be moved in regard to the former. If that be so, there will be a further loss of revenue of .&#163;29,000 or &#163;30^00. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. With regard to paragraph  b  of item 123, our original proposal was to impose a duty of 35 and 30 per cent., and consequently without any qualms of conscience, I can consent to the increase of that duty to 20- and 15 per cent, as suggested. What I am pointing out to my honorable friend is. that paragraph c is practically on all-fours with paragraph  d.  It is inevitable that if the honorable senator does not move a reduction of the latter duty, such a reduction will be moved. We cannot, with equanimity, look upon such a serious loss as is involved, particularly when we bear in mind that the revenue from item 123 alone has already been reduced by over &#163;150,000. </para>

                        <para>- This Tariff, which is protective in its incidence, will result, I hope, in a very substantial reduction in importations, and, consequently, in revenue. In- other words, it will not be effective unless that result occurs. I point out that on paragraph r the duty has been reduced from 25 and 20 per cent, to 10 and 5 per cent. Honorable senators will see that in regard to item 123, which covers so many legitimate objects of revenue taxation, there have been very large and serious reductions made. And in the circumstances the Committee would be ill-advised if it accepted the proposal of my honorable friend to reduce the duty on silk goods from 20 and 15 per cent, to 15 and 10 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot follow the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> that in connexion with this item of silk goods there will be a loss of &#163;35,000. If he is arguing that a preferential rate -will throw a larger proportion of the silk trade into the hands of the United Kingdom, and therefore increase the loss of ,&#163;5,000, which I mentioned last night, I must agree with him. But I take it that the object of the preference is to give an increase of trade to the United Kingdom. Last year we imported from the United Kingdom &#163;506,000 worth of silk, but of that quantity only ,&#163;100,000 worth was manufactured there. Every one knows that the Continental manufacturers of silk are really the manufacturers for the world. By a 5 per cent, preferential duty we may be able to shut out a small percentage of the Continental trade in silk, but we cannot get from the United Kingdom anything like all the silk we want. Therefore, while the preference will operate to some extent, it will operate to a very small extent indeed. We shall not get Japanese silk from Great Britain, but from Japan, where it &#39;is made, so that in that respect the preference will not operate at all. Why has the Minister increased the duty on a revenue item from 15 to 20 per cent. ? With what justification has it been done? </para>

                        <para>- Does .the honorable senator say distinctly that it was nut on for revenue purposes? If that is his answer to my inquiry, he can very well do without the duty inasmuch as the estimate of revenue has already been exceeded largely. I can state with some authority that silk is not worn exclusively by rich persons. Suppose that at a cost of &#163;4 or &#163;5 a lady should imitate the twenty-five guinea silk dress of a lady of fashion. On the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> principle the latter will pay rive times the amount of duty that the former will. I have already explained that a piece of silk trimming is as necessary for the dress of the humblest worker as it is for the dress of the richest woman. These goods are closely associated with the item with which we are now dealing, and the object of the request is to eliminate from this item goods which have a little thread of silk. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see that done, but there are not such strong reasons for doing that as I am able to give iri support of this request. Silk is an absolute necessity for a trimming, and in many cases for that little . pardonable luxury which even the poorest man likes to afford if he can in the dressing of his wife and children. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> yesterday pointed out that silk can be bought at 2s. per yard, but it can also be bought at 7s. 6d. per yard. &#187; It is possible to get dress materials other- than silk at 2S. per yard, . but whilst it would take only . 7 yards of such material to make a dress, it would take from 14 to 18 yards of silk to make a dress, because silk materials are manufactured in narrow widths. Allowing for all these things, a duty of 15&#39; per cent, under the general Tariff, and, as I intend to move later on, of 10 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom, would fairly adjust the incidence of this taxation. A very great deal of trouble would be saved in the passing of Customs entries for these goods and articles. The revenue would not amount&#34; to anything like what has been suggested. The leader of the Senate, who is naturally at a disadvantage in dealing with technical items, seems to be under the impression that the inclusion of the words he has moved would remove all possibility of trouble . with the Customs officers. </para>

                        <para>-If the words proposed were included what would happen would probably be that some enterprising firm in Great Britain, finding that silk mixed materials had become valuable, would make an imitation of them with! mercerized cotton or a preparation of a worsted material, and new trouble and difficulty would arise with the warehousemen in Australia- attempting to pass entries on these goods. An increase of the duty to  20  per cent, would not result in the increased&#39; revenue claimed for it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> but would cause ladies who wear silk dresses either to put up with the same dress for a greater length of time, or to go in for cheaper kinds of silk than they now wear. </para>

                        <para>- It is sufficient for my purpose to know that the protectionist section of the Commission recommended a duty of  15  per&#39; cent, on this item. The Government are not satisfied with that, and propose to go  5  per cent, better, and, as &#39; a protectionist Government, the only reason they give for the proposed increase is that we require revenue. Some honorable senators no doubt&#39; will say. as has already been said, that1, as silk is a luxury, it should be subject to taxation, but I see no reason why bv the imposition of unnecessary taxation we should remove further and further from the working classes the opportunity to derive some enjoyment from the use of the luxuries which people of their own class produce. Tt must be remembered that silk is the raw material- used bv many industries established in different parts of the Commonwealth. The higher the duty on this raw material the more difficult it will be for manufacturers who use it to compete with the manufactures of similar goods in other parts of the world. Preference to Great&#39; Britain in respect of silk goods need not seriously be considered, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has said, the major portion of these goods come from the continent of Europe. </para>

One of the most important duties of Parliament in framing a Tariff is to see that its administration is made as simple as possible. We know that there are stacks of departmental decisions on matters relating to the importation of textiles, such as are covered by this item. It would simplify the administration of the Tariff exceedingly if we decided to include all dress fabric&#39;s and trimming materials included in paragraphs  b, c,  and  d,  under one heading. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly it would. If that . suggestion were adopted there would be no need for Customs officials to examine a cotton or a woollen shirt, to see whether the button-holes were not worked with silk thread. The division of these items hitherto adopted has led to endless confusion, and to the compilation of a volume of departmental decisions which it would require an expert to analyze. Paragraphs  b, c,  and  d,  cover dress materials for the making up of wearing apparel or trimmings used in the making up&#39; of apparel, and they should all be included under one head, and be made subject to the same duty. The. question would then arise: &#34;What duty should be imposed?&#34; The Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out that unless we retain the duty here submitted, and make the distinction between the items covered by the paragraphs referred to, we shall loose something like &#163;35,000 a year in revenue. I should not be concerned if the loss were &#163;50,000 or ,&#163;60,000 a year, because, in my view, every argument used in favour of an increase in revenue under these items is an argument against the duties proposed. I have no wish to raise revenue through the Customs. I am prepared to vote for the highest protective duty I can secure upon goods we can manufacture in Australia, but the duty we impose on goods which we do not produce, and are not likely in the near future to produce in Australia, should be as low as possible. I respectfully suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that, in order to simplify the administration of the Tariff, it would be well to put the goods, covered by paragraphs  b, c,  and  d,  under one heading, at a moderate rate of duty. He should be satisfied with a nominal duty rather than a duty which is calculated to extract more revenue out of the taxpayers of the country than they had to pay under the previous Tariff, particularly as the item has no protective incidence. It would immensely simplify matters if we put paragraphs  b,  c, and  d  together. </para>

That duty is just about as high as the Minister can persuade me to go.. We ought to make an endeavour to simplify the Tariff, and to make it more comprehensible to people who will have to carry on business under it. and to the departmental officers who will have to administer it. </para>

I will tell him. He cannot go further than I would if I had ray way in reference to them. I would go absolutely to the bottom, and make those items upon which revenue duties are imposed, free. We have had to listen during this debate to many arguments in favour of high protective duties, especially from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> but this is the second time, as far as I know, when- we have been seriously asked to vote for revenue duties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has urged the argument - fallacious, I think, in the present case - that these goods represent in some way or other a kind of luxury, and that we ought to get revenue out of them. Now, if I have any ambition with regard to this Tariff, it is that I should like to bring some of the luxuries of the rich within easy grasp of the poorer classes of the community. That argument with regard to luxuries can be pursued altogether too far. If it were pursued throughout, it would lead to depriving the poor man or woman of practically everything ,except proved necessities. I have absolutely jio sympathy with that attitude. </para>

As far as is reasonably possible, we should put it within the power of every  mpi  to buy as many goods as he can afford, even though some of them do not Cone under the heading of bare necessities of life. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> could see his way to adopt the classification which I have suggested, and let the Committee fight out the duty. _ To do so would be to carry out everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> wants, and would, I believe, meet with the unanimous approval of the Committee. But I suppose that if an attempt were made in that direction, there would be a lot of fighting, not on the merits of the case, but through fear that by altering the existing classification we should not get a satisfactory duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I find myself in &#39;agreement both with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> on &#39;this matter. In the first place, I have never in discussing Tariffs considered that we should put high duties on silks. I have never looked upon them as the perquisites of the rich,, but as commodities that everyone may legitimately use. I fail to see why the mistress should wear silk without the maid having- an opportunity of getting a little for herself. That is the view which I have always taken- with regard to these commodities. Tn addition to that, silk is the raw material of the tie makers, the umbrella makers, and the manufacturers of other articles. We should endeavour to let them get their raw material as easily as possible. Therefore, I wish to make the rate of duty reasonable.  I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I think it is one of the most sensible suggestions which we have had during the Tariff debate that paragraphs b, c, and d should be considered together. There is very little essential difference between them. We have another object than to impose duties, and that is to make the Tariff as simple as possible, that &#34;he who runs may. read.&#34; It is practically immaterial to the importers whether we impose a. duty of 10 per cent., 15 per cent, or 20 per cent. ; they simply pay the duty, and a.dd to the total cost a sum sufficient to yield a profit of 20 per cent. or. 30 per cent, as the case may be. But the matter is of great importance to those who use these goods The multiplication of Tariff classifications ought to be avoided as much as possible. &#39; We have an army of- experts who cannot even agree amongst themselves. Instances have been brought under, my notice where in respect of the same articles different decisions have been given by the Customs officials in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. The Tariff should be so simple that there should be no difficulty in securing uniform decisions. I do not agree with the request proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> but shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> proposition, that the three paragraphs be grouped and made liable to the one rate of duty. If the Government are afraid that such a rearrangement may lead to a loss of revenue, I shall be prepared to support the duties being raised to 12^ per cent, and 17 &#163; per cent. I do not think, however, that any loss would result if we subjected the goods coming within the three paragraphs to duties of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. The increased importations would make up for any immediate loss that might result. </para>

                    <para>. - The request proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will remove the ambiguity of the item as it stands, but it certainly will not get rid of the grievance under which merchants labour. Their complaint is that if they import a woollen fabric containing even a thread of silk, difficulty at once arises,&#39; and a wide field of investigation is opened up. With all due deference to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the officers advising him, I do not think that his request would remove the difficulties which have been pointed out again and again by representatives of the mercantile community. The trouble would, however, be removed if. we imposed uniform duties in respect of paragraphs  b, c  and  d. </para>

                        <para>- A number of honorable senators share my view, that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has been taking away the inducement to support an increased duty by declaring the item to be exclusively revenue producing. I contend that it is not. At &#34;the present time we are manufacturing in Australia some of the fabrics covered by paragraph  b,  and, having regard to the possibilities of improved machinery, there is no reason why the industry should not expand. Because silk has never been manufactured in Australia, some honorable senators seem to think that it is &#39; impossible to make it here. I hold a different view. If Canada and Great Britain, where the possibilities of silk culture .are nothing .like so great  as  they are in Australia, can manufacture silk, why should we not be able to do so? </para>

                        <para>- That, to a very great extent, destroys the possibility of our securing, in &#39;respect of these paragraphs, a uniform duty at a higher rate. On several occasions whilst travelling in Australia, I have met representatives of Canadian silk manufacturers, who have always expressed surprise that the Commonwealth had not long since entered upon the production of silk. Be that as it may, I am not going to fight very strenuously in either one direction or the other, so far as this item is concerned. My main desire is that uniformity shall be secured. That is what was demanded bv the merchants who appeared before the Tariff Commission in almost every State capital. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will bear out mv statement that nearly every one of them urged us to make an effort to secure uniformity, saying, &#34;Do not have so many classifications. Goods which as a rule are packed in the same cases should be subject to the same rate of duty.&#34; I hope that we shall request another place to make liable to the same rate of duty all goods used for similar purposes. </para>

The question that we are really dealing with is a request moved by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    to introduce the words &#34; not containing silk or having silk worked thereon &#39; &#39; in item  123,  paragraph  a.  My honorable friend suggested that the amendment was necessary to. get rid of ambiguity. The only ambiguity that can possibly arise in connexion with either paragraph  b  or paragraph c must relate to the words &#34; woollen or containing wool.&#34; The moment we introduce such a classification, the complexity and want of uniformity to which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    has referred immediately crop up. It is impossible to specify the degree in which the material other than wool shall not be introduced in fabrics coming under this paragraph, and, therefore, the words &#34;containing wool,&#34; lead us into a sea of investigation and complexitv. And so also with the words &#34; silk or containing silk.&#34; What proportion of silk would shut out a woollen fabric from paragraph  b?

                        <para>-I should be prepared to go a long way with the Vice-President of the Executive Council in an effort to get rid of complexity, and to secure freedom from controversy in connexion with entries at the Customs House. But, instead of removing the existing complexities, it seems to me that the honorable senator&#39;s request would intensify them. As an honorable senator said a moment ago, woollen piece goods containing a thread of silk would be subject to a duty different from that imposed on goods consisting entirely of wool. That is extremely undesirable. </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> very properly points out, one would immediately land himself in a controversy with the Customs officials as to whether the goods contained silk threads or not.  We all know that nowadays fabrics are so prepared that a thread ot cotton, or of some other material, may look uncommonly like silk. But the whole position in regard to the passing of entries through the Customs is made to depend upon whether they contain a single thread of silk. I shall vote against this request in the interests of the simplicity of the Tariff, and for other reasons, which have been advanced by honorable senators. The question as to what rate of duty should be imposed upon the goods enumerated in paragraphs  b,  c, and  d,  when it is made uniform, is another matter which deserves our earnest consideration. Personally, I am prepared to support the lowest duty that will recommend itself to the Committee. I would point out that, in respect of paragraph  b,  the duty originally proposed under the general Tariff was  35  per cent., and that under the Tariff for the United Kingdom  30  per cent. The House of Representatives reduced these duties to  15  per cent, and  10  per cent, respectively. Upon paragraph c, which relates to silk, the duties originally fixed were  20  per cent, under the general Tariff, and  15  per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. These were retained by the other Chamber, so that the articles in this paragraph are at present dutiable at a higher rate than those covered by paragraph  b.  It seems to me that- the original intention was that the duties, in respect to paragraph  b,  should be higher than those imposed upon the goods enumerated in paragraph c. When we come to &#39;consider what the uniform duty shall be, I hold that silk, according to the principle underlying this Tariff, ought not to be dutiable at  15  per cent, under the general Tariff, and  10  per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom, but. at lower rates. </para>

                <para>SenatorBE ST (Victoria- Vice-President of the Executive Council) &#91;12.29&#93;. - I hope that the Committee will not agree to the request. Our object is to give fair and reasonable protection to local manufacturers, without, imposing a heavy duty on goods which, jf made here, cannot be freely manufactured in Australia. Various methods of discrimination have been suggested, but the best we know of - it has been adopted by other countries - is the application of the weight standard. I have the assurance of the departmental . experts that women and children&#39;s dress goods are, generally speaking, well known, and easily recognised as such, and that if the words proposed to be left out are not retained, certain light-weight goods intended for men&#39;s use will come in under paragraph  b. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> amendment, if adopted, would at least result in simplification, whatever other effect it might have. If the words which he wishes to leave out are retained, it will be for the Customs official to say whether piece goods are or are not women&#39;s or children&#39;s dress goods, which means the continuation of that uncertainty in Customs Administration from which the Commonwealth has suffered for years, and without the removal of which the Tariff cannot be improved. It would be unreasonable to say that it shall be absolutely impossible for material for the use of men, no matter what its weight, to be imported under paragraph  b.  The question to decide is whether the weight standard proposed is not sufficient to discriminate between the goods which properly come under paragraph  b  and those which ought to come under paragraph  a. </para>

                        <para>- I am not pitting my knowledge against that of the Customs; Department, but after hearing most voluminous evidence on the subject before the Tariff Commission, I ought to know something about it. If I did not, I could not have been attending to my duty. It is conceivable that the Customs authorities may be mistaken in this .matter, hut whether that is so or not it is not desirable, in the interests of the whole community, quite apart from any fiscal or revenue question, that the sole power to decide whether a particular piece of material may or may not be used for men&#39;s clothing should rest with the Customs Department. The decision of that question should be  removed  from the administration of the Act by putting the item in a far simpler form, so that the only question for the Department to decide will be as to the weight of the material. What weight should be fixed is a matter for the subsequent consideration of the Committee, and does not concern <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> amendment. I cannot understand the Vice-President of the Executive Council opposing that amendment. He will lose nothing by it if it is carried. None of his protectionist fortresses will be knocked over. No great revenue tax that he wishes to preserve will be taken away. On the other hand, he will gain simplicity. No matter who proposes it, he should accept any amendment the object of which is to promote simplicity in the Tariff. At any rate, nothing can. be lost, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> point of view, whether he wants protection or, as we shrewdly think, revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - I thoroughly understand and appreciate the difficulty felt by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If he were assured that the weight would not be increased I believe that he would not raise so much&#39; objection to the request. It would certainly remove difficulties if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> request were agreed to. and a great deal of misconception would be&#39; prevented if the reference to women and children&#39;s dress goods were left out, and simply the. weight specified. No matter what the weight of a fabric., it is difficult for a Customs officer, or any one else, to tell whether it is to be worn by men,  women, or children. I have seen children clothed in the heaviest tweeds. Their garments are- often made from their fathers&#39; old pants or coats. Are the Customs authorities going to trace a piece of material from father to son in that manner ? I had hoped that honorable senators opposite would give some assurance that they would not move to increase the weight limit. If they did, I should be inclined to support the elimination of these words. But, if after this alteration is made, the weight is to be indefinitely raised, the woollen industry in the Commonwealth will be seriously jeopardised. If the amendment is agreed to, I shall not vote to increase the weight. If the weight remains as if now stands, I quite agree that the amendment will greatly simplify the item, because, when the weight of the fabric is under 5 ounces it does not matter much whether it is to be worn by women or men, as it will still be subject to duties of 15 per cent, and io per cent. Those rates will be incidentally protective, until it is possible, with the proper machinery to manufacture the whole of the goods we require in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, but for that very reason the question of the weight ought not to affect the elimination or retention of these words, which complicate the Tariff, and are really an absurdity. There is no earthly reason why the woollen material which is to be admitted at the lower rate of duty should be restricted in its use to women and children. The determining factor is not its use by women or children, or. its non-use by men. It  is absurd, when providing for the admission of woollen goods of a particular weight per square yard at a particular rate of duty, to superimpose the restriction that they shall be used only by one particular class of the community.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> - A restriction which cannot be carried out. </para>

Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> nor any other honorable senator is called upon at this stage to say how he will vote when the question of weight comes to be considered. The question is whether it is necessary to retain these words. If it is not, let us leave them out. Surely the Committee can trust itself to determine afterwards the question of weight. </para>

                    <para>. There has been an attempt to ridicule the idea . of prohibiting the use of this light material for other than women and children&#39;s apparel. In view of its history, it is not open to ridicule from that standpoint. The first proposal was to put a duty upon woollens without any restriction. It was then urged that in the case of women and children&#39;s dress material, which was of a very light character, not made here, and not likely to be made here for some time, a concession might be made. This departure from the protectionist principle, was made in deference to the plea that this particular kind of woollen material was used very largely for women and children&#39;s dresses - articles of clothing which are an important consideration in every household. . That was the only reason for making the concession. Then it was felt that inroads might&#39; be made upon the &#39; protectionist principle by women and children&#39;s dress material being brought in of such a character as could be made into men&#39;s clothes. As a kind of. safeguard, therefore, it &#39;was provided that this lower duty should apply only to women and children&#39;s dress material not above a certain weight.  The underlying principle of the concession was (0 free certain material for women and children&#39;s clothing from some of the duties imposed upon material for men&#39;s clothing. </para>

                    <para>. - T&#34;e rea-l object of this provision  is to admit at &#39; a lower rate of duty particular textile fabrics that we cannot make here. There is scarcely a fabric imported, woollen, silk, or cotton, that cannot and does not from time to time, whatever the weight may be, form part of man&#39;s attire. Even stuff under 5 ounces can be made up for men, or for little boys&#39; knickerbockers, if it is so desired, although it is not generally done. The real question is the fixing of a fair standard for the weight, and we are now anticipating the debate on that question. Whatever standard the Committee subsequently fix, we should first simplify the wording of this paragraph. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated, on the authority of his Customs officers, who, no doubt, advised him in all good faith, that even if these words are left in- there will be no difficulty, because women and children&#39;s dress materials are we&#39;ll known- and easily identifiable. </para>

                        <para>- But such difficulties occur every day. Take, for instance, the well-known woollen fabric, alpaca - a common article for both men and women to&#39; wear. Light alpaca is really a women&#39;s dress material. It is imported for women&#39;s dresses, but it is also cut into men&#39;s summer coats, in black and other colours. The importer who honestly imports it to sell as ladies&#39; dress material may be confronted by a Customs&#39; officer with a demand for higher duty, because it can be used for men&#39;s clothing. The officials could just as legitimately demand a higher duty on any material that comes in under the 5-oz. provision. We should simplify this line in the schedule first, and then determine the fair standard of weight, and a fair measure of protection for goods of this class. </para>

I do not blame any Customs official for irving to get the higher rate of duty where he thinks he is right, but he is not infallible.

                        <para>- And executioner, that we place him in a position he can usefully and rightfully occupy. We have been told that the Customs Department cannot distinguish between starch and corn flour, and yet it is said that the officials can absolutely determine the use to which a piece of cloth is to be put. What stupendous folly ! It is tiresome to hear statements so utterly opposed to common sense. How can any man tell to what purpose a piece of cloth will be put? We know  that many of the cloths imported for men&#39;s wear are used for women&#39;s wear - that tweeds intended for men&#39;s clothing are used for women&#39;s overcoats - :and, . as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> said when he cited the case of alpaca, cloth intended for women&#39;s clothing is also used, for that of men. I have here a sample of very light serge, no doubt intended for women&#39;s wear; but it would make a very convenient suit for a man in such weather as we have been having lately. I am at present wearing a worsted suit which I dare say is much lighter than is half of the materials imported for the use of women ; I have no reason to believe .that it weighs 5 ounces per yard. It is impossible to determine by the appearance of a material, or its value, and weight, for what purpose it will be applied ; and the present proposal of the Government must lead to eternal conflicts between importers and the Customs officials. A very large addition to the staff of the Customs Department will be required if they have to determine the destination of goods. Has the Customs Department to follow each piece of cloth into the warehouse? There will be so much uncertainty that in the majority of cases the wrong duty will be applied - too high in one case, or too low in the other. That being so - this is no question of high duty or low duty - I shall vote, in this instance, not against the Government, but in favour of the simplification of a Tariff difficulty. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a good deal more to be considered than the mere simplification of a Tariff difficulty. At the first blush, I felt&#39; very much inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> request. There might be no harm if we were going to retain the weight at 5 ounces, but if, as is probable, the weight may be. raised, we are getting perilously close to a danger to our own mills. There is much force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel Neild</inline> has said - that  we are placing a great deal of power in the hands of Customs House officers, who will probably give contradictory decisions, the . matter being left to the exercise of their own sweet will. But I am inclined to run that risk, .rather than permit the importation of fabrics, which will compete, alt a duty much lower than the ordinary rate, with the products of our own mills. At the same time, I am rather in favour of increasing the weight somewhat&#34;, because I can see that, by keeping the weight so low, we are really penalizing the poor. If the weight is to remain as at present, there is no harm in the request. But if the weight be raised to  6  ounces or <inline font-style="italic">6\</inline> ounces, then I feel that, in adopting the request, we shall be taking a very dangerous course. I should like women&#39;s goods to be specified, because it is dangerous to leave this to the discretion of the officers. On the other hand, if we allow the Tariff to remain as it is, we shall not run the risk of the introduction of mater i als to compete with the product of our own mills. But we are not always going to import women&#39;s dress materia). Up to the present, in Australia, there have been manufactured only tweeds for men&#39;s clothes,, but we ought to encourage manufacturers to undertake the production of women&#39;s tweeds, which are very much worn now. I have been informed that, with&#39; a reasonable duty, .it is the intention of some of the manufacturers to undertake this class of production. </para>

                    <para>. - The matter, seems to be to some extent complicated by the expression of opinion which has been given as to the way in which it is advisable to reach the goal towards which apparently every one is striving. Certain honorable senators seem . to want to reach the goal by one road,&#39; while others prefer to take another road. The difficulty, in my mind, is as to which road is likely to prove the more satisfactory. So far as I can see, either the adoption of the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> or the alteration of the weight per vard, or a combination of the two might bring about the desired result. The difficulty I am faced with is to decide how to vote, on the request, until it is known what decision the Committee may arrive at with regard to the weight. Personally, I should prefer the retention of these words if there was a possibility of increasing the weight somewhat. But I do not know what decision the Committee may arrive, at in regard to the weight. Consequently, I am faced with the alternative of voting for a request which does not altogether appeal to me, because if I were to vote against it I might lose both that and one which I desire to see adopted. For that reason I am forced somewhat against my will to vote for the request as it now stands. </para>

                        <para>- That was recognised as the effect of the vote which was taken on the request to omit certain words. I ask the Committee to adhere strictly to the weight of  5  ounces to the square yard. We have already decided that the duty on the piece goods embraced in paragraph  a  - woollen or containing wool, n.e.i. - is to be  30  and  35  per cent. If the limit as regards the weight be raised, it will mean that that item is going to be whittled away most seriously. Personally, I cared very little about the last division, except in connexion with the limit of the weight per square yard. If I had an assurance that it was going to remain at the  5  ounces, there would be very little opposition so far as I am concerned. But if the weight be increased, it will mean a substantial increase in the volume of importations. In all these circumstances, I ask honorable senators to permit the  5-oz.  standard. to remain. </para>

                    <para>.- I followed the Minister&#39;s words very closely, but I must admit that I am not able to accept his deductions. In framing the Tariff, the Government recognised the wisdom of taking out of paragraph  a  a certain class of goods which it was assumed were not being made here, and put the limit in regard to such goods at  5  ounces to the square yard. The question as to the duty was quite immaterial to them when they were making that subdivision. The question which must have then engaged their attention was: Can the goods be made here, or are they being made here? Evidently they thought that goods up to . 5 ounces per square yard were not being made here, because they decided not to bring them under paragraph  a,  imposing the heavier duty. The request for the omission of the words &#34; women and children&#39;s dress goods &#34; in no sense affected that argument or principle. I accept the Government&#39;s classification, and the only doubt in my mind is as to whether 5 ounces per square yard is a proper arbitrary limit to fix. It does not involve a matter of principle. The Minister says that he will take a limit of 5 ounces to the square yard, but the question is whether that is a proper one to fix. </para>

                        <para>- When the Ministry put the limit at 5 ounces per square yard it was done because they thought that cloth of that weight was not being made here, and that, therefore, it might be admitted at a lower duty without detriment to local industries. That is a position which I also am prepared to take up. The only point for us to determine is whether 5 ounces makes a proper limit. If &#39;it does, there is no more to be said against it. On the other hand,- if it does not, we may reasonably raise the standard to 6 or 7 ounces, or carry it to such a point as will admit the materials which we do not make. </para>

                        <para>- I will show my honorable friend why we cannot raise the limit to 12 ounces. The principle which ought to guide us is the letting in of those things which are not being made here, at the same time imposing a- higher duty on these goods which are made here. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> suggests that the weight should be 12 oz., the answer is that that would cover fabrics which probably are made here, whilst 5 oz&#34;. would not cover the whole of the goods which might be admitted at a low rate of duty without injury to local manufacturers. Whether the weight fixed should . be 6, 7, or 8 oz. is a matter of opinion. The Minister will admit that I am right in saying that, within the last two or three days, on the advice of the Customs&#39; officials, he was quite prepared to admit that the weight of these materials might be increased without detriment to any one. </para>

                        <para>- When the Minister denies that the determination with respect to the weight was arrived at, I tell him plainly that the Committee was informed that the Customs Department had no objection to this weight being increased to 5&#189; or 6 oz. per square yard. The honorable senator who intimated his intention of moving in that direction, explained that he proposed to do so after consultation with the Customs officials, and with the assurance that there would be no Ministerial objection to his proposal. That was the official view which the Minister was prepared &#39;to indorse, and impress upon the Committee only a day or two ago. lt would appear that in the meantime some of the manufacturers, following their usual practice, have obtained the private ear of the Customs officials or Ministers, and have told them something which has led to this change of front. It is only reasonable that the Committee should be given the reasons for this change, and informed of the facts which have led to it, and which might enable honorable senators generally to revise their judgment. In the circumstances I shall welcome any information on the subject which the Vice-President of the Executive Council chooses to give the Committee. I had intended &#39; to move that the weight should be 8 oz. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has laid great stress upon the argument that 5 oz. per square yard is generally admitted to be below the weight of the materials which we can make in the Commonwealth, but the honorable senator is not correct in his contention that that is the reason why that standard of weight was adopted. It was adopted in connexion with materials used in the manufacture of apparel for women and children, and, as I pointed out earlier to-day, that was a concession made, not against the protectionist principle, but on behalf of women and children, representing a very large body of consumers to be found in every household. The concession was made, not because we could not make these goods, but because we admitted that we were not making them in such quantities, and could not make them with such facility as the heavier qualities of tweed. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the history of this particular item, and pointing out that the reason for it is not that presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> It was not that we could not make materials weighing 5 ounces, or under, to the square yard, but as a concession to a strong feeling, to which expression was given, that materials used in the manufacture of apparel for women and children should be admitted at a lower duty than materials used for other purposes. Wisely or unwisely, we have struck out the qualification limiting this item to dress materials for women and children, and we now have no other protection but the weight standard. I say that protectionists should be very careful about raising the standard of weight, because to do so is to enlarge the area of importation of woollen goods at the low duty attaching to this item. If we were assured that we could not make materials weighing as low as 5 oz. to the square yard, it might be wise to admit such materials duty free, but we know that we can and are making 5-oz. material. </para>

                        <para>- I know what the history of this particular item is, as I know the history of quite a number of other items in the Tariff, and I say that I have described it accurately, when I say that we never agreed to admit 5-oz. material at a low duty because it could not be made here, but merely because it was understood that it would cover only women and children&#39;s dress materials. We1 have decided that that limitation shall be removed, and the only protection left being the weight standard, I contend that from a protectionist point of view, it is wise that it should be as low as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I .know what my feeling on the subject is, and I have an advantage over some honorable senators, since I know what class of goods are at present manufactured in Australia in the way of dress tweeds. That is what we must act upon, and not upon what might be manufactured at some future time. I throw out this challenge now : I defy any honorable senator to produce a yard of dress fabric, made in Australia, weighing 5 oz. to the square yard.  </para>

                        <para>- I heard the honorable senator do so. I hope that I will be permitted to say what I wish to say, and that honorable senators will not by interjections endeavour to make me say what I do not wish to say. I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to produce a single yard of dress stuff made in Australia that weighs only 5 oz. to the square yard. I have made inquiries on the subject, and I find that the lightest cloth used here in the manufacture of clothing . weighs 9 J- <inline font-style="italic">oz.</inline> to the square yard. If we desire to protect the manufacture of woollen piece goods, we should act upon the understanding that 9^ oz. per square yard is the lightest woollen material from which men and boys&#39; clothing is made. At the same time, as I have already pointed out, other materials are constantly being imported which could be used for the purpose. . As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out, a woman might take her husband&#39;s left-off clothing and cut it down for her children, and if the material were thick enough she might cut down a woollen dress of her own to make a boy&#39;s suit. On the question of weight of material, I have here a number of samples of common material. </para>

We have neither the market nor the machinery for making such goods. We have only 4,000,000 people to cater for, and this is only one small item in an infinite  number  of articles of dress material which &#93;&#62;eople want, and will have. </para>

                    yard. I do not say that it is a  good  material, but it is as good as many people can afford to buy, and it is the  best  material for the purpose for which they want it. For a season it will have the appearance of a material two or three times its price. Next&#39; season there will probably be a change of fashion, and the working people whose interests we are so fond of protecting, like a change of fashion just as much as do others who can better afford to buy new dresses. The  Government  are actually proposing to impose a duty of 25 per cent, upon that stuff, whilst at the same, time they .are going to  allow  finer textiles - French goods, such as Amazon cloths, weighing under 5 ozs. - to come in at 10 per cent. Is that justice?

If he says so, I tell him flatly that he is talking in ignorance, and when I say so, I make a statement which I can prove. Plenty of shoddy material is made here,, and it is a good job that it is so. It is a better material- of its kind than that which is imported. The shopkeepers require it because their customers want it, and the mills have to make it. </para>

                        <para>- Let the honorable senator go to certain mills and merchants who make a particular line in dealing with the materials from which shoddy is made. There are merchants here who are kept busy supplying the mills with the necessary material. I know that the honorable senator is quite honest in his ignorance, but, nevertheless, he is ignorant of the subject if he will allow me to say so without any offence. There are French serges and French Amazon cloths which are under 5 ozs. They are manufactured not in England, but on the Continent. We are actually going to throw into the hands of foreign producers, whose speciality is the production of dress materials, because they make a finer class of dress fabrics than the British people do, the opportunity of doing their trade on easier terms than the manufacturers of goods consumed by our poor people. </para>

                        <para>- I have four fabrics before me. One is a fabric of British manufacture, known as Amazon cloth. Except in regard <inline font-style="italic">1o</inline> its weight, it is identical with four other fabrics which I have here, and which are of French make. The article of foreign manufacture is of finer texture. The Amazons made in France are finer and lighter, just as French dress series are finer and. lighter than British goods of the same kind. Under this proposal Amazon cloths from foreign markets will come in- at 10 per cent., while British Amazons, which are identical, except- that they are a little heavier, will pay 25 per cent. The cheaper stuffs that we should try to enable the poorer classes to buy cheaply will also pay 25 per cent. Surely that is not just. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with attention to the argument in regard to the 5-oz. as against the 6j-oz.&#34; weight limit. I was under the impression that the Treasurer had promised the Sydney Chamber of Commerce that he would accept the 6^-oz. limit. In a communication I had from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce that fact was stated. We were also informed in a sort of semi-secret way the other clay that the Government were prepared to accept the.6j-oz. standard. The Minister cannot attempt to deny that. </para>

                        <para>- I have it from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the Government said they were prepared to adopt the 6|-oz. standard. I . believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> saw the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the subject. We on this side of the chamber were prepared to assist to get the Tariff through. We met frequently to determine amongst ourselves as to &#39; the items upon which we were able to agree. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> informed the Vice-President of the Executive Council of what we were doing. But since then things have altered, so that we do not think it necessary to meet. We get no help whatever from the Government, who alter their proposals day by day, so that we really do not know where we stand. What&#39; I understand the gist of the present controversy to be is that lighter fabrics made on the continent of Europe will be admitted at a low rate of duty, though they are worn by the wealthier classes of the people, whilst other fabrics that are made in Great Britain, and that are slightly heavier, will pay a heavier rate, although they are worn by the poorer classes of the people. Surely that is not a proposition to which we ought to agree. These fabrics, as I understand it, cannot be made in Australia. The craze for them lasts only a little while, and it would not pay a manufacturer to invest his money in the making of them, because there would be no demand for them after a short period. The supporters of the Government actually propose that dress materials costing 2s. 6d., 3s., or 3s. 6d. a yard shall come in at a low duty, whilst those sold at is. or is. 3d. per yard, and which are used by those who do not enjoy a great amount of wealth are fo be taxed at 25 per cent. I have heard honorable senators opposite say frequently that they would not support revenue duties. But here we are dealing with a purely revenue duty, because the goods in question cannot be made in Australia. Surely there is not much consistency in the attitude of honorable senators opposite. They are going to support a duty of 25 per cent, on the apparel of the poorer classes of people, whilst the wealthier classes who can afford to buy high priced material will pay 15 per cent. less. I cannot see why the Government so obstinately stick to their proposal. They claim to be protectionists, and not revenue tariffists,  and yet on this item they turn round and let in the fabrics of the wealthy classes at a cheap rate, whilst making the poor man pay twice as much. Having regard to all the bearings of the matter, I think that the best plan would be to increase the weight from 5 oz. to <inline font-style="italic">6h,</inline> as the Government at first proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- Previous to the luncheon adjournment, I said that I was willing  10  support an increase of the weight to 6&#38; ounces. But the position has been absolutely changed. I quite agree that the poorer classes of people would be penalized if no change were made. But if the alteration now supported by the Opposition were made, the effect would be to prevent the manufacture in this country of the lighter tweeds which we certainly ought to manufacture in view of our climatic conditions. The making of such materials in this country would be absolutely thrown back. By passing the item as we are now asked to pass it, we should practically be vitiating paragraph  a  to a considerable extent. I am entirely in sympathy with the  case, presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy-</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator spoilt his case by submitting a new proposal. While the requested amendment might be of some value to the people, it would seriously injure the woollen industry of Australia. &#39;l am pledged to support the imposition of a fair duty for the protection of our woollen mills, and I think that a great mistake was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> in proposing a request that these&#39; words .should be omitted. The whole incidence of the item has been altered, and, if I were not to vote against the request, I should be false to the promise which I made at the last general election to favour the imposition of a fair duty for the encouragement of the woollen industry. </para>

                    <para>.- Last night I indicated my intention of moving in the direction suggested by Senator Mulcahy, who desired that the weight of these goods should be increased from  5  ounces to  6^  ounces per square yard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has pointed out, however, that the deletion of certain words in the paragraph has changed the whole incidence of the item. I voted for the request that the words should be omitted, believing that it would tend, in a measure, to simplify the Tariff. I am not influenced by the consideration of whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> &#39;s contention is correct, but before I undertook to submit the request I desired the assurance of the departmental officials, and, in a measure, of the Government, that it would meet with their approval, and that Ministers, whilst not speaking in favour of it, would refrain from offering any strong opposition. </para>

Before the Senate went into Committee this morning, however, a representative of the woollen mills of New South Wales interviewed me, and stated emphatically that  5-oz.  materials were at present being manufactured in that State. </para>

                    <para>. - There is one aspect of this question which may have been overlooked, and to which I desire to direct the special attention of honorable senators opposite, who seem to think that by voting against a request for an increased weight they will b=: encouraging the woollen industry of Australia. I am inclined to think that they will not ; that they would do better by supporting a proposal that the weight should be increased. At the present time, speaking practically and generally,&#39; Australia is not producing goods of. this description of the weight of  5  ounces per square yard. I suppose we shall be told that they may be made here. My answer to that is that if the manufacturers do succeed in bringing down the weight of these materials to  5  ounces it will be by an admixture of cotton. It any honorable senator desires - to encourage the woollen industry of Australia, he should object to so low a level as this being fixed in the Tariff. These are not idle remarks ; they are based first of all on evidence of a very decisive character given before the Tariff Commission, and, secondly, on the official statistics of imports. The facts in regard to the so-called woollen industry of Australia are very singular. Most, if not the whole of our importations of raw cotton are consumed by our so-called woollen factories. It may or may not be desirable, but if honorable senators wish to compel local woollen mills to reduce the weight of their material to  5  ounces per square yard that reduction will be secured by the admixture of cotton. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. It is remarkable that such a question should bc put by an honorable senator who professes to be familiar with every detail of the Tariff. In  1906, 1,141,133  lbs. of raw cotton were imported into Australia. T have not at hand the statistics for Victoria, but I know that by far the largest proportion- of this cotton which was imported to be converted into piece goods was used in Victoria. It was for that reason that I interjected whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was speaking, that I was sorry to learn that the woollen mills of New South Wales had entered upon the production of  5-oz.  material. </para>

                        <para>- And which the Tariff. Commission extracted under circumstances of considerable difficulty, very clearly showed that the vast proportion of the imports of raw cotton into the Commonwealth was used in Victorian factories for mixing purposes in the manufacture. of so-called woollen piece goods. I do not wish to enter into the controversy with regard to cotton in- flannel ; the facts are bad enough, and will come out at the proper time, but if honorable senators opposite are imbued with an honest desire to encourage in Australia the making of woollen goods - that is to say, goods which do. not masquerade as woollens - they will hesitate to vote against the request that this weight be increased. If the weight of goods coming under the paragraph were increased, manufacturers would be encouraged to increase the proportion of wool used in their manufacture; it would dissuade them from using cotton as an adulterant. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose briefly to confirm the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> with regard to the importation of raw cotton. The irresistible conclusion to be drawn from the evidence given before the Tariff Commission is that cotton is imported for the purposes of adulteration. In the report of the free-trade &#39;section of the Commission, it is stated that according to the <inline font-style="italic">YearBook</inline> of  1903,  in  1900, 178,332  lbs. of raw cotton were used in the Victorian woollen Mills; in  1901, 250,184  lbs.;- in  1902, 273,335  lbs. ; and in  1903, 368,749  lbs. It must be seen from these figures that raw cotton is being imported in considerable quantities, and I&#39; cannot think of any industry, save the woollen trade of Victoria, and perhaps of other parts of Australia, which requires it. The conclusion is irresistible&#39; that it is used for the purpose&#39; of adulterating so-called woollen goods, which receive the benefit of this duty. </para>

These goods all contain more or less wool. Honorable senators will recognise that they are used by ladies, and belong to a class of which we know very little. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maloney</inline> proposed, in the first place, that the limitation should be  4  ounces per square yard, but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne at once said that he would agree to it being fixed at  5  ounces. He was pledged ultimately to agree to the weight being fixed, as in the Canadian Tariff, at 6 ounces, but being anxious to complete the consideration of the Tariff, the House of Representatives agreed to substitute  &#34;5  ozs. per square yard &#34; for <inline font-style="italic">&#34;6</inline> ozs.,&#34; which would otherwise have been carried.

                <para class="block">I hope it will be recognised that  10  per cent, is a stiff revenue duty. Of course, I am assuming that. the same rate will be adopted- in regard to the two subsequent paragraphs. I cannot help thinking that, as the result of being accustomed so long to duties ranging from  25  per cent, to  40  per cent., the Committee are prone to regard  10  per cent, as a mild&#39; impost. Personally, I think it is a very heavy tax to levy upon a man&#39;s capital or income. Translated into terms, either of land or income, it is equivalent to a tax of  2s.  in the&#163;1 &#39; If we were required to pay land tax at that rate we should think it was a very stiff impost. </para>

The real effect of the last division was practically to remove from this paragraph four-fifths of the materials worn by the poorer classes of the  community, and to make them dutiable at 25 per cent. What we are now asked to do by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is to still further enlarge the anomaly that has been created. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> presses his proposal to a division I shall have to vote against it. In the earlier portion of the discussion there was a general expression of opinion that the duties levied upon the goods enumerated in paragraphs b, c and d should be made uniform. I desire to see that amalgamation brought about. Whilst I should be prepared to&#39; support such an amalgamation there is only one way of getting a still lower rate than that appearing in the schedule, and that is by agreeing to a 15 per cent, duty under the general Tariff, and to a 10 percent, rate under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. I would further point out that this is one of those items upon which it is possible for honorable senators, without doing violence to their fiscal opinions, to arrive at an agreement. That result, however, can be achieved only by a little give &#39; and take. I gather that there is a disposition on the part of the Committee to agree to uniform rates of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. If, however, we accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; &#39;</inline> Clemons&#39; proposal, there will be no chance whatever of uniform rates being adopted. So far as I can judge from the statements made by gentlemen who possess some knowledge of the trade, it will be better to obtain the amalgamation of these duties at slightly higher rates, than to secure lower duties in one paragraph without that amalgamation. I have, therefore, to choose between two evils, and under these circumstances I am bound to choose the lesser. </para>

                    resemble the attempt to establish a difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. He has pointed out that if we reduce the duty  in respect of this paragraph, to 10 per cent, under the general Tariff, an amalgamation in respect of the two subsequent paragraphs may be prevented. But we have . to remember that the rate proposed under the Tariff for the- United Kingdom is 10 per cent. We all recognise that nearly the whole of our importation of woollen goods comes from Great Britain.

The same reasoning applies in regard to paragraphs c and d, which it is proposed to amalgamate with paragraph b, except that a larger proportion of the goods coming under them, such as silks, is imported&#39; from foreign countries. Even when brought here from England, these goods have generally been manufactured abroad, and merely passed through that country to be distributed. I hope that the proposed amalgamation will be made for the sake of simplicity ; but I do not think that much is to be gained by reducing the general rate to 10 per cent., since it affects only .&#163;100,000 worth of imports. We can deal with the rate on silks when we are considering paragraph c. </para>

I- gather that women and children&#39;s dress goods have been separated from the main body of woollen imports because they are not, or cannot be, largely made in Australia. If that be so, rates of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent, are too heavy to impose upon them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The duty on the articles covered by paragraphs c and  d  is wholly a revenue duty. It is proposed for the sake of simplicity to amalgamate paragraphs c and  d  with paragraph  b.  Paragraph  b  covers goods some of which there is a faint chance of making in Australia, though I do not think that any honorable senator thinks their manufacture here likely. But the probability is that the same rates will be applied to the goods coming under paragraphs  b,  c, and  d. </para>

If it is not, there is no such thing as a revenue duty in the Tariff. The question is complicated by the fact that there is a preferential rate of 10 per cent, on importations from Great Britain. I wish to make the 10 per cent, rate general. In regard to paragraphs c and  d,  a preference is wholly illusory. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that in regard to silks it will hardly operate at all. Of velveteens we imported <inline font-style="italic">&#163;576,</inline> 86f&#62; worth, of which only ,&#163;234,577 worth came from Great Britain. Therefore, in the one case the lower rate would apply to only one-seventh of1 the importations, and in the other to only 40 per cent. When I first proposed a general duty of  to  per cent., I indicated that I should be. glad to vote for a lower rate. I think that 10 per cent, is quite high enough for a revenue duty, which the duty on paragraphs  b, c,  and  d  would certainly be. 15 per cent, is too high. I have given ample proof, that I dislike revenue duties. </para>

                        <para>- It is certainly not up to the degree of protective dutv that I should like, but it is the only possible duty in the circumstances, and, in fact, is largely protective, as is proved by the fact that we have now in the Chamber a considerable number of samples of Australian make of the kind of goods that it covers. If there were a possibility of succeeding, I should willingly join <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in making the duty 30 per cent. But we are dealing with things as they are presented to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> very properly said that he was opposed to all revenue duties unless they were incidentally protective.&#34; This duty is incidentally protective to a considerable extent, although not to the extent that protectionists like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart, Senator Givens,</inline> myself, and many others would like to see it. But because a duty is not as completely effective as we should like, that is no reason why we should wipe it out altogether, and leave our people to be assailed without restriction by the competition of countries abroad. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> put forward the extraordinary argument that it was no use giving a preference on this item, because at present the United Kingdom hardly sends us any of the material, the bulk of which comes from the Continent. But clearly the argument for giving preference is that we may induce the importation of those goods from Great Britain. If we were importing nearly all the stuff from Great Britain, it might properly be argued that it was of no use to give preference, as we could not take any more from Great Britain than we took already. But if we take, say, &#163;600,000 worth of silk goods from Germany, France, and other European nations, clearly there is a large margin upon which to work in the interests of the United Kingdom. A great deal of silk goods are imported here manufactured. I refer to such things as silk ties and other articles, which in the aggregate amount to a large importation. Some of them are manufactured in England from German silk, French silk, or silk from other countries. This preference would be a larger inducement- </para>

Every preference that we give to the United Kingdom will have the effect, if it serves the purpose which we design it to serve, not of keeping at their present figure England&#39;s exports to us of such things as we must import, but of increasing those exports, and decreasing the exports from other parts of the world. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                    addressed with great eloquence yesterday, the Prime Minister made reference to the statement that in England the people, even the Tariff reformers, were shocked at the Australian Tariff. He stated that the Government had had letters from the Tariff reformers in England to quite the contrary effect, and asserting that this Tariff would be a magnificent weapon for the next elections in England. That is an ingenuous admission - that the only benefit gained by putting these figures in the preference column of this schedule is to put a weapon into the hands of the Tory Party iri England, in order to turn out a Liberal Government and so secure high protection against the interests of the working classes of England.

I have never, directly or indirectly indicated that paragraph  b  of item 123 is a revenue duty. So far as the question of revenue is concerned, I have directed my attention to other paragraphs. Paragraph  b  is by no means in the form that I should like to see it in. The Government view was that it should bear duties of 35 and 30 per cent., and we should gladly have supported them, but we had to give way in another place, and waive our protectionist anxieties. Against our wish, the duties were reduced from 35 per cent, to 15 per cent. (General Tariff), and from 30 per cent, to 10 per cent. (United Kingdom). </para>

                        <para>- No. It is impossible to give that information, but the statistics show that under paragraphs  a  and  b,  which are grouped together, the imports for 1906 from the United Kingdom were of the value of &#163;1,590,000, and from other countries &#163;349,000. So far as I am able to judge the feeling of the Committee, we can secure a general Tariff duty of only 15 per cent, on this paragraph. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> when he interjected, that, as the Committee had determined to group paragraphs  b, c  and  d  together, I should gladly support him if he would propose duties of 20 per cent. (General Tariff) and 15 per cent. (United Kingdom). I felt that those were the rates which should be attached to this paragraph. But, so- far as I can judge, the majority of the Committee have &#39;determined that the rates&#39; are to be 15 and 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I quite indorse that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was evidently under the impression that this was a revenue duty only. We regard it in no sense as such. We admit that it is not an adequately protective duty, and that there is not a large quantity of goods under the 5-oz. standard made in Australia at present, although there are goods made here at 5 ounces and a little over. Still we think that, with duties of 1.5 and 10 per cent., there is a prospect of some encouragement being given to our manufacturers to secure the necessary plant in order . to make the whole of the goods we require under the 5-oz. standard, as well as above it. I, therefore, urge that as Ave cannot get all we desire we should at least make sure that the duty, is no lower -than 15 and 10 per cent.,, a rate which I now know- the majority of the Committee are prepared to grant. </para>

                        <para>- It will not be as effective as I should like, but it is a start ; and there is a reasonable prospect . and probability of goods under 5 ounces being manufactured in conjunction &#39;with goods above that standard. . Although at this juncture I feel loath to talk about preference, I cannot help saying that there is substantial room for preference, particularly in regard to paragraph  d,  the importations under which amount to &#163;577,000 consisting of . &#163;235,000 worth from the United Kingdom, and &#163;342,000 worth from other countries. </para>

However, I do not desire to deal with preference at the present time, but simply to urge that this is essentially a protective duty to start with, and will in conjunction with the other duties have a protective effect. </para>

                    <para>. - My impression is that the duty of 15 and 10 per cent, will, under the circumstances, be effective. If we add to the 15 per cent, the interest, freight and exchange, usually calculated at 10 per cent., and add 5 per cent, for wharfage and so forth, we have protection to the extent of 28 or 30 per cent. I should like to see the duty less, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil</inline> len that that is not possible; and, under the circumstances, I think the duty proposed is acceptable to the majority as one which will not only be effective from the protectionist point of view, but will also satisfy the legitimate demands&#39; of the Treasurer, and prove reasonable all round. </para>

                <para class="block">In the hurry and bustle of passing the Tariff in another place, the important words I propose to add were omitted. It will be observed that we Have already passed paragraph  a,  &#34; woollen or containing wool n.e.i.,&#34; at a duty of 30 and 25 per cent. ; but &#34; silk, or containing silk or having silk worked thereon &#34; will not come under that paragraph ; and it is in order to make the position perfectly clear that I desire the addition of the words. Honorable senators will realize that in piece goods of &#34; woollen or containing wool n.e.i.,&#34; it is possible there may be included goods containing 80 or 90 per cent, of wool, with -some silk ; and under the present verbiage it is possible, and probable, that even if there be only 1 per cent, of silk the goods may come under a duty of 20 and 15 per cent. The request I have moved is, from a protective stand-point, of vital importance, and is essential to give due and proper effect to paragraph  a.  I hope honorable- senators will see the fairness of the proposal, and accept the request as formal. </para>

                    <para>. - The idea of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is to make the position absolutely certain in regard to what goods shall be included under paragraph  a.  Goods known as silk-mixed tweeds might, as the schedule now stands, be claimed by the importer to properly come under paragraph c ; and, as a matter of fact, such claims have arisen, whereas, properly speaking, the goods, being woollen tweeds of good quality, and the very stuff on which we desire to impose a duty of  25  per cent., should come under paragraph  a.  The effect of the amendment will be, as I say. to make the position absolutely clear : indeed, I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that in the Customs Act it is provided that the Minister, where an article is capable of a double interpretation, may place it in the item which carries the higher rate. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> desires to clear up an ambiguity, but I have an honest doubt as to whether he is doing so by the request- he proposes. We have been debating all day practically the position arising from the conjunction of paragraphs  b  and c, and we have said that possibly certain . goods containing a very small quantity of silk may come in, and under the existing Tariff be dutiable at the higher rate. We have indicated a general desire to remove the possibility of blunder and simplify the Tariff. Material might be imported consisting of  99  per cent, of wool and  1  per cent, of silk, and it would be absurd in such circumstances to impose a different rate. We have all agreed that in such cases the duty shall be the- same. But suppose that there is a fabric containing  99  per cent, of silk and  1  per cent, of wool, or  90  per cent, of silk and  10  per cent, of wool. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> say ? He says that although we are going to reduce the duty on silk goods that fabric is to be dutiable as if it were made entirely of wool. </para>

I opposed the request which was moved in regard to paragraph  b,  because I did not think it was necessary. We should be very careful to remove the possibility of any misunderstanding arising between the Customs officers and the importers.&#39; Under paragraph c piece goods of silk, or containing silk or having silk work thereon, are to be admitted at one-half of the rate which is charged on piece goods of wool or containing wool n.e.i. in paragraph  a.  In order to defeat the object of paragraph  a  all that a&#39; manufacturer in England or elsewhere would need to do would be to see. that his woollen piece goods contained some silk, or had silk worked thereon, when they would come in St the lower duty provided in paragraph c: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> wants to make it absolutely clear that if they are; really woollen piece goods weighing over 5 ounces per square yard, then, even although they do contain a thread or two of silk, or have a little silk worked thereon, they shall not be admitted under the lower duty provided in paragraph c. </para>

                        <para>- They contain much more than 90 per cent, of wool. Irish poplin will probably be introduced and admitted as silk; but it is really immaterial whether it pays 10 or 25 per cent. I would sooner see it pay 25 per cent., though as a matter of fact it will scarcely be imported. What is desired is to prevent the possibility of confusion as to the duty chargeable on a piece of tweed which is to all intents and purposes a piece of woollen material, because it contains probably 98 per cent, of wool and not 2 per cent, of silk, the latter being used merely to produce a design. </para>

                        <para>- These paragraphs apply to very nearly the same classes of material, and a desire was expressed by some honorable senators to group them together in order to prevent confusion and contradictory decisions at &#39; the Customs House. For instance, a shirt containing i per cent, of .silk has been classed as silk goods. Articles containing wool have been treated differently from articles containing linen or cotton. There has been nothing but constant friction at the Customs House. An army of officials has been required to make adjustments. A volume of departmental decisions with regard to these articles has been published, and many of the decisions are wholly contradictory. </para>

                        <para>- I should be quite willing to make the items embraced in the three paragraphs free, but that question was threshed out very fully this morning. I suggested that the three paragraphs should be grouped together, and when I cannot get all I want I intend to stand by the honorable agreement which was arrived at this morning. I intend to adhere to the compromise and to vote for the request which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> intends, to move to fix the duty at 15 per cent., and for. a similar request in- regard to paragraph  d. </para>

If an arrangement was come to I was no party to it, and what is more I am not going to be bound by it. I came here as a protectionist, not as a revenue tariffist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in his strong desire that the three paragraphs should be grouped together and subjected to a duty of 15 per cent., cannot contend that this is anything more than a revenue duty. </para>

They ought to be, but they are not; and if we impose duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on silk and on velvets and velveteens, and such . goods, they must be regarded as purely revenue duties, because no one anticipates that within any period which we need contemplate these goods will be manufactured in Australia. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to stick to his guns, and not to abandon his position as a protectionist, and an opponent ot revenue duties. </para>

The duties here proposed are distinctly revenue duties, and a number of honorable senators who are supporting them are pledged to direct taxation as opposed to indirect taxation, and believe that the raising of revenue through the Customs is iniquitous. </para>

But they did so on the understanding that later on reductions would be made in the duties imposed. Since that we have decided that the duties on dress materials shall remain, and if we agree now to any alteration, except &#39; that mentioned and agreed to this morning,  we shall be, to some extent, breaking faith with the Minister. </para>

If the duty were reduced to 15 per cent, we should get a revenue of &#163;75,000. No one can pretend that these duties are protectionist duties in their effect or in their incidence. They are purely revenue duties. I am therefore opposed to them, and I move - </para>

I think that the majority of the Committee is in favour of granting a preference to Great Britain, which supplies us with the greater portion of our imports of cotton, linen, and similar piece goods. I must also express my regret that another place thought fit to remove the duty that was formerly attached to this paragraph, because the goods are really a legitimate subject for taxation. </para>

                        <para>- We have sacrificed the greater part of that revenue. A duty of 5 per cent, is a legitimate impost on foreign goods. It may be thought that there is not a tendency for foreign countries to send us cotton goods, but that is not correct. My experience in the warehouses for the last few years shows me that there has been a gradually increasing quantity of American and Continental cotton goods finding their way into this country. Often, singularly enough, they come to us through British markets. We can see from the returns what a vast quantity of foreign-made stuff comes through British markets to Australia. As a matter of fact, certain lines of so-called Manchester goods which are imported are &#39;made in Holland and America. </para>

I am informed that if they are plain blue they come in at 5 per cent, or free according to whether they are of foreign or British make, but that if they have a stripe or check, as is the base frequently with denims used for children&#39;s clothing, they are dutiable at 30 . per cent, as if they were cloth.

Those who import it can have it without a teased surface if they want it for such purposes. . But if this request were carried it would open the door to allowing flannelette, which has a teased surface on only one side, to come in easily. It lias been stated that this material ought to be allowed to come in because only poorer people use it.I have the utmost sympathy for the poor people who are compelled to use fraudulent articles of this kind, and think that some- . thing should be done to deter their wholesale importation. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot be since it is nothing but cotton. It is almost as inflammable as is gunpowder, and is very dangerous for children&#39;s wear since if it takes fire it is almost impossible to put out the flame. Doctors also admit that it is absolutely essential that people residing&#39; in a climate such as ours should wear woollen garments next to the skin. During the hot weather one perspires freely, and flannel is necessary to absorb the perspiration. Those who wear flannelette next to the skin are exposed to any change of the weather and are liable to catch a chill. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is under a misapprehension. It is not intended to exclude flannelette from this item. There are considerable importations of articles such as pocketings and linings having a raised surface on one side, and there has always been considerable trouble in dealing with them. The proposal is to remove such good&#39;s from paragraph  f,  under which they are liable to duties of  10  per cent, and  5  per cent., and to bring them under paragraph  e,  under which imports coming from the United Kingdom are free, whilst those  coming from foreign countries are dutiable at  5  per cent. The alteration is proposed, for departmental reasons and also to facilitate trade operations. </para>

                        has made a statement that is absolutely correct. I would point out, however, that if the duties on flannelette are to remain at  10  per cent, and  5  per cent. the adoption of this request will mean that au infinite variety of cotton and linen goods will come in absolutely free, whilst one small line, flannelette, will be dutiable at  5  per cent, and  10  per cent -I wish flannelette to be dutiable at  5  per cent, in the case of imports from foreign countries and to be free when imported from the United Kingdom. I also desire to disabuse
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline>
                        mind with regard to the dangers arising from the use of flannelette and the suggestion that people are taken in or deceived by it. As a matter of fact it is one of the most useful of cotton fabrics, more particularly in the poor&#39;man&#39;s family. It has been demonstrated by actual experiments that it is not more Inflammable than ordinary dry cotton goods which have not a. raised surface. If we place paragraph  f  on the same, plane as paragraph  e  we shall remove an anomaly which I think ought not to exist, and any diminution of revenue that may result will benefit the poorer class of the community in a more marked degree than has any other reduction we have yet requested.

                        <para>- In the case of rubbered waterproof cloth, woollen or containing wool, my request provides for duties of 35 per cent, and 30 per cent, as against 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., or an increase of 5 per cent.. Then I propose that rubberized waterproof cloth, silk or containing silk, shall be dutiable at the rate . already appearing in the schedule ; and that the duties on rubberized cotton cloth shall be reduced by 10 per cent. For the information of honorable senators who were not present yesterday when I dealt with this question, I may briefly summarize what would be the position if this request were agreed to. The schedule provides for -duties of <inline font-style="italic">30</inline> per cent, and 25 per cent, on all waterproof goods in their raw state. If this request be agreed to, woollen materials before proofing will be dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., but when proofed will be dutiable at 35 per cent, and 30 per cent. Silks before being proofed will be dutiable at 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., and when proofed they will be dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. Cottons under paragraph e will be dutiable at 5 per cent, in the case of imports from foreign countries, and free when imported from the United Kingdom before proofing. But when proofed, they will be dutiable at 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., as against the existing duty of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but we need not discuss that matter at this stage. The main point is that as we produce wool . in Australia, we should have the highest form of protection in respect of woollen waterproof cloth. I take it that as the Committee agreed yesterday to a request for the deletion of the words &#34; rubbered waterproof cloth of any material &#34; from paragraph a, they are practically in favour of the request that I now submit. </para>

                        <para>- I think that prices are largely affected by the duties we impose. The honorable senator proposes that a duty of 35 per cent, shall be imposed on certain rubberized goods, arid I say that that duty will be added to the price of the imported goods. I suppose that the honorable senator will agree with me on that point. Will he  also  agree with me that the duty will be added to the cost of the goods manufactured here? Does he think that the manufacturers will, so to speak, live up to the duty, or that they will npt do so? I shall take his answer either way. Let us assume that the honorable senator thinks that the manufacturers will live up to it. Is it desirable that they should take full advantage of the duty, and make the consumers pay accordingly, although no duty has been paid on the material they sell ? The only other answer he can give is that they will not live up to it. What is the value of that? Will .the manufacturer live up to the duty on the woollen goods which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> says constitute his raw material, and pay 25 per cent, on them? If he does live up to. that, what is the use of the protection? What is the position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has put before us in the clearest possible way ? When he argued in favour of duties of 30 and 25 per cent, upon woollen piece goods, he declared that their effect would be to check importations so that our own woollen mills would be able to supply the consumer with those goods at a cheaper rate. If that be so, the man who will rubberized woollen piece goods will get them cheaper than he would if no duty were operative. Why, then, does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> wish to impose duties of 35 and 30 per cent, upon rubberized woollen goods? He can only require such a duty if the local manufacturer of woollen piece goods lives up to the 30 and 25 per cent, protective duties which he . has been granted. Otherwise, &#39; where is the basis of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> demand for any increased duty upon rubberized goods? </para>

                        <para>- When I say that the local manufacturer lives up to the full amount of the protective duty, I mean that he charges an infinitesimal amount less than that at which the imported article can be purchased. We had an apt illustration of that supplied to us the other day in. the case of matches. It was conclusively proved that certain match manufacturers in the Commonwealth lived up to the duty levied upon that article, less a small margin to enable them to sell their goods. </para>

                <para class="block">The proposal of the Government was that a rebate of three-fourths of the duty should be made in respect of the waterproof cloth which was purchased for. the purpose of being rubberized- But the House of Representatives struck out that proviso and agreed to the item in the form in which it appears in the . schedule. As it stands the item fails to recognise one particular industry - the rubbering industry. In this connexion honorable senators must recollect that there are three stages of manufacture, and they must also remember the attempt which has been made to extend protection to those  engaged in each of them. In the first place, there is the woollen cloth which we attempt to protect by imposing a duty of 30 per cent, under the general Tariff and 25 per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain. The second stage relates to the proofing of woollen cloth and the third stage to the manufacture of that cloth into apparel such as waterproof overcoats. Whilst we have protected the woollen industry so far as the manufacture of cloth is concerned, we have practically extended no protection to those engaged in the proofing of that cloth. That is the anomaly which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> seeks to remedy. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt they will. It has been found by experience, however, that the use of certain imported cloths is necessary in this industry, and if the Government had had their way a rebate would have been granted upon these. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is now attempting to cure the anomaly that has been cre&#39;ated by reason of the provision relating to the payment of the rebate having been eliminated. The item in its original form provided that all rubberized waterproof material should be dutiable at 30 per cent, under the general Tariff and at 25 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. It further stipulated that rubbered cotton material when made into apparel should be dutiable at 35 per cent, under the general Tariff and 30 per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain. As the bulk of our importations of waterproof material come from the United Kingdom, and as our manufacturers of rubberized goods will have to pay 30 per cent, upon their raw material, they practically have no protection. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but there are certain cloths which must be imported tor rubberizing purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> ignores the conditions surrounding the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> proposes that where rubber waterproof cloth consists of wool or contains wool it shall be dutiable at 35 per cent, under the general Tariff and 30 ner cent, under the Tariff- for Great Britain. In other words, he asks for a protection&#39; of 5 per cent. Where the rubber waterproof cloth is made, out of silk or contains silk, he desires it to be made dutiable at 30 per cent, under the general Tariff and 25 per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain as at present. In regard to rubberized waterproof cloth made out of cotton, he proposes a substantial reduction to 20 per cent, under the general Tariff and 15 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. In other words, where waterproof cloth is made out of wool or contains wool, he desires to extend to those engaged in the industry a protection of 5 per cent., where it is made out of silk or contains silk he wishes to give them a protection of 15 per cent., and where it is made out of cotton he also aims at giving them a protection of 15 per cent. As we are attempting in this particular item to protect the individuals engaged in the three stages of manufacture to which I have referred,I think . that his proposal is a reasonable one, and I hope that the Committee will agree to it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care what any newspaper has dubbed me. When I was discussing the weight of certain woollen fabrics this afternoon I expressed a doubt whether they could be made in the Commonwealth. I was at once assailed by my extreme protectionist friends with the statement that those fabrics can be made locally. Now if there be one fabric more than another which can be produced in the Commonwealth it is the material that is required for waterproofing. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> wish to do? He desires to provide indirectly for the admission of an outside article, which, upon other occasions, he seeks to exclude. If we require good waterproof coats we can get them manufactured in the Commonwealth of Australian material. If effect is given to the honorable senator&#39;s proposal, the result will be, not the encouragement of Australian manufacture, but an increase of importation, while the extra protection conferred by the new paragraph will be hardly worthy of the consideration of those who are to receive it. There are a number of materials which could be made locally which are suitable for rubberizing. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the Committee does not quite understand what it is doing. It is now proposed to make the duty on certain kinds of silk  30  and  25  per cent., although we have fixed the rate on ordinary silk piece goods at  15  and  10  per cent. Why should we make this distinction? I move - </para>

                        <para>- We are now entering upon the consideration . of slops, because this item covers the whole ground. I suppose that votes with regard to protection on this item will be guided to some extent by the proportion of the wages to the total cost of the article. If not, protection is getting into a worse condition than it was ever in. If it is to be lavishly handed out without regard to the wages paid, it is hopeless for us to oppose anything. I hope that the question of wages will have an effect upon honorable senators when voting high protection. The manufacturer told us that the material in that suit of clothes was bought by him for 9s. from a firm in Flinders-lane. The distributors in that locality make vastly more out of protection than they ever did out of free-trade. They now want, not free-trade, but the profit they make out of &#39;distributing articles made in . Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- The manufacturer would not te.ll me. I will obtain the book containing the evidence presently, and quote it. There was an . additional item of 3s., which covered all the cost of trimmings, buttons, &#38;c. The total cost of the suit, including the profit of the manufacturer the man whom this item proposes to protect-was 17s. 6d. It would have been very interesting, if I could have obtained it in the sworn evidence, to know what the consumer paid for that suit. The manufacturer absolutely refused to tell me. I ascertained in other directions that I might on the average assume that such suits were sold in Melbourne to the consumer at 30s.. </para>

In view of the fact that 17s. 6d. paid all the cost of the material, all the wages, and all the manufacturer&#39;s profit, to what extent shall we be looking after the interests of the consumer in giving the big protection now proposed?

                        <para>- I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell&#39;s</inline> statement. I expect the suit he refers to was made by the very man who made the one I have been discussing. These manufacturers ask for protection because, I suppose, they do not make sufficient profit. My main contention is that the consumer is being fleeced because of the enormous profit made in the process of distribution. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but what is the cost of labour in proportion to the retail price of the article? I do not suppose that the manufacturer makes less than a profit of is. on the cost of the labour, and that leaves only 4s. 6d. paid in wages. If the cost&#39; of the distribution of imported goods were twice as much, is it any credit to Australia that the cost of distributing a suit of clothes from one part of Melbourne to another should be represented by the difference between 17s. 6d. and 27s. 6d. ? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> sees the point ; but what is- my reply ? More protection is demanded because the manufacturer cannot control the middleman. Is that a fair reason for asking the consumer -to suffer ? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> propose to say to the consumer, &#34; The cost of distribution is so enormous that we desire you to pay a higher duty ?&#34; Is that a reason for demanding a higher duty? </para>

To the best of my belief it was an ordinary suit of clothes - I believe the word &#34; ordinary &#34; was used. Under the circumstances I think, that this is an iniquitous duty, and serves no purpose that ought to appeal to the heart of a protectionist. The duty merely adds largely to the profits of either the man in Flinders-lane, or the man in the retail shop. </para>

                    <para>. - I have hitherto taken no active part in the discussion, but, as I have been dragged into it, I should like to say a word or two. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> desires to assume a position which is altogether incorrect. I deplore the fact, but it is quite true that a suit to order may be obtained for 27 s. 6d. ; and I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that the very middlemen, whom he denounces, have an importing monopoly right throughout Australia, while they also control the manufacturing industry. If Flinders-lane is able to thus squeeze the manufacturers, what would it not be able to do in the event of the closing of the local factories? I venture to say that now Flinders-lane controls nineteen-twentieths of the clothing manufactures of Melbourne. If it is able to do such terrible things under protection, God help Australia if free-trade ever again places our manufacturers, and consumers at its mercy. </para>

                    <para>.- I suggest that what was done with item 123, paragraphs  b, c,  and  d  should also be done with items 106 and 107, and for exactly the same reasons. It &#39;is almost impossible to discuss any one of these items without discussing the others. Take, for instance, item 106, &#34;Apparel and Attire,&#34; on which the duty is 40 and 35 percent., and item 107, &#34; Apparel and Attire n.e.i.,&#34; on which the duty is 35 and 30 per cent. Suppose that a shirt made of cotton or linen or wool, or a combination of those materials, were imported. There would be a lot of . bother if the buttonholes had been worked with silk, as they are very often. Again, in the case of a coat or vest, the use of a mere thread of silk to create a pattern, or. a stripe, or the use of silk-twist or ordinary silk thread in working a buttonhole would bring the article under a different item. We should have intense  friction and innumerable and contradictory decisions at the Customs House. Importers . would be at their wits&#39; end to know the classification under which an article should be brought in. They would be continually striving to pass articles at the lower rate of duty, while, of course, the Department would be always trying to charge the higher rates. The only difference between&#39; item 106 and item 107 is a paltry 5 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I am entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in his desire to bring- these two items together, but when I come to think of the ingenuity which marked the means by which it is suggested that should be done, &#34;I am bound to part company with him. He asks us to accept his proposal because of the advantages which would accrue from the amalgamation of the two items, but he wants us to agree to his terms. If he had proposed to meet us half way there would have been something in his proposal. A more illogical and selfish proposal I have not heard. That he should secure the advantages at the sacrifice of our principles is something to which I am not prepared to consent. If, in his opinion, 5 per cent, is paltry, surely he can agree to waive it. </para>

At the present time the raw material, which would come into competition with item 107 - apparel and attire n.e.i. - is admitted free, and the duty on that item is 35 and 30 per cent. That is the measure of protection which the makers of articles which would come into competition with item 107 are getting. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is not satisfied. He wants to increase that protection by 5 per cent., arid so fix the duty at 40 and 35 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather a novel experience for the Committee to see the Minister pointing out the anomalies in his own1 Tariff. He is drawing attention to the fact that those who make up woollen goods, are getting only 10 per cent, protection - the difference between the duty on the piece goods and the duty on the madeup article, but that in the case of cotton goods they are getting a difference of 35 and 30 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Now we are told that Australian tweed, because it does not pay duty, is going to be lower in price than imported tweed. But I have understood, not once, but several times, that the manufacturers of piece goods told the Tariff Commission distinctly that the effect of an increased duty &#39;would be higher prices to the manufacturers of apparel, because, whilst asking for a higher duty for themselves, they said that a higher duty must be imposed on the imported apparel. Why should they have done that if the makers of apparel were going to get cheaper locally-made woollens? It is time that we ceased to hear the contention that the imposition of a duty is going to lower the price of an article. No protectionist manufacturer ever ventured to tell the Tariff Commission that he would get cheaper raw material because of the imposition of a duty. When I was interrupted I was dealing with the wish of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to make the duties on items 106 and 107 the same. He might equalize the figures, but he could not possibly make the measure of protection on those two items the same. </para>

                    <para>- - In order that we may know exactly where we are, I intend to move a request in connexion with this item. I wish tq clear the ground in such a way that any one will be able easily to understand not only the demand for protection in Australia but the reason for it. It was assumed by some of us, apparently erroneously, that it was based upon a desire to compensate for the inequality in the conditions of labour in the Commonwealth arid in competing countries: or, to put it in another way, the demand is made because we decline to allow manufacturers and workmen in Australia to be handicapped in competition by the lower wages paid in competing countries. </para>

                        <para>- Very well, I will add that to the reasons for the demand. If we could bring the demand for  protec-tion  down to that point, I should &#39;be prepared to give it serious consideration. Before I move any request, let me briefly state the position.&#39; Before the adjournment for tea, I mentioned the cost of distribution of a particular article, and I did so in order to prove that the demand for protection, which from the manufacturer&#39;s point of view must be based upon a desire to obtain a better price for his goods or a larger command of the market, was not in this case justified on the ground that he had to face an unreasonable cost of distribution. I think I proved that. I drop that for the present, and propose now to address myself to another phase of the question. It is clearly proved that the wages cost of manufacturing a suit of clothes of the total value of 17s. 6d. is 4s. 6d., and if I allow the manufacturer a profit of is., no one will quarrel with that. </para>

                        <para>- The manufacturer to whom I referred would not say what his profit was, but I am assuming that he claims a profit of only is. on such a suit of clothes. If the wages cost of manufacturing a suit of clothes valued at 17s.- 6d. is 4s. 6d., that represents almost exactly 25 per cent. In order to discover just what the cry of protection in the Commonwealth is based upon, I am going to assume that the wages cost of making a similar suit of clothes in the competing country, England, is nothing at all. No one will venture to say that workmen in  England  get no wages ; but for the purpose of my argument, assuming that the demand for protection is due to a desire to compensate for inequality in rales of wages and conditions of labour, I say that I am prepared in this case to assume that in the competing country, England, for the manufacture of such a suit of clothes as I have referred to nothing is paid in wages. </para>

                        <para>- I leave that out of consideration. I wish to give the Australian workman the fullest possible advantage bv assuming that his wages for the manufacture of this suit of clothes amounts to 4s. 6d. - and may I remind the Committee that I am not dealing with a case of sweating, but with wages  actually  paid under the Victorian Factories Act and that the man in England who gets a similar suit of clothes made pays no wages at all. It is clear that what we have to make up to our - Australian workman is 4s. 6d. on 17s. 6d. If we give him a protection equivalent to that, we shall have entirely protected him against the lower cost of labour in the Old Country. That would be provided for by a duty of 25 per cent. Therefore, in order to test the views of honorable senators, and to see what the cry for protection is really based&#39; upon, I move - </para>

I am sorry that I cannot speak with certainty as to the profit, but I can speak with absolute certainty as to the wages cost.  It is impossible to deny the accuracy of my figures, or that a duty of 25 per cent, would more than cover the whole of the labour cost, because my calculation is based on the assumption that there would be no labour cost at all in England, the competing country. </para>

                        <para>- What have the duties referred to to do with Australian made cloth? If honorable senators are going to argue in al circle in this way, I might say that the duties on piece goods, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> refers, represent a protection far more than is necessary to cover the difference in cost of wages in the woollen-manufacturing industry here and in the Old Country. But it is not fair to pursue the argument <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum.</inline> If it is contended that&#34; we should give the makers of apparel in Australia a greater measure of protection because they are making up imported piece goods, that can hardly be said to be a useful argument for honorable senators opposite to use. Do they wish to encourage the importation of woollen piece goods? There is one thing I wish to say in connexion with the labour in this industry which should influence honorable senators on the other side, and especially those who are members of the Labour Party. Greatly to my disgust - though I do not know what view the members of the Labour Party take of the matter - it was stated in evidence that there is quite a considerable number of boys and girls under the age of sixteen years employed in these factories for the making up of apparel. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has demonstrated beyond dispute that the distribution of goods adds to their cost very much more than does the cost of manufacture, including the manufacturer&#39;s profit. The honorable senator has ascertained that in the case of a suit of clothes of a certain value the manufacturer&#39;s profit and wages cost amounts to 5s. 6d., and the cost of distribution to 12s., allowing for only two removes from the factory. Clearly this demonstrates that the smaller the range of distribution and the less handling of goods there is the fewer extortionate demands are charged against the consumer. The honorable senator has shown, at any rate to his own satisfaction, that 25 per cent., representing 4s. 6d. in the case to which he has referred, is a sufficiently high duty to cover the whole cost of wages in connexion with the manufacture of men&#39;s clothing, and. he proves that by giving the figures applicable to the manufacture of a suit of clothes of a certain value. </para>

                        <para>- If we admit that the figures are applicable to an average suit of clothes we can hardly base upon them a duty which will cover the whole area of the manufacture of apparel. Assuming that the honorable senator has been correct in his deductions, it is obvious that if a duty representing 4s. 6d. on such a suit of clothes as he has described would cover the difference in the cost of manufacture for all middle-priced suits we should require a higher duty for the higher line. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will admit that the making of a suit of clothes worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> would cost more in wages than the making of a suit worth  only 30s. If not, then my honorable friend displays a very limited knowledge. The point that I wish to press home is - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is perfectly right as to this - that the cost of distribution is the main extortion, if it is an extortion, that the consumer has to bear. If it costs 12s. to distribute from one part of Melbourne to another, how much would it cost to distribute from Germany to Melbourne, which would necessarily involve two or three additional profits ? If the goods were made in. Germany or in France or in the United Kingdom, they would be made by manufacturers there who probably would get very little profit, as is the case with the manufacturers here. But an exporting firm in Germany would probably insist on large profits. Then the goods would be sent out to a distributing, firm in Australia who would also have large profits. These charges would have to be added to the cost of the goods. </para>

My friend, who is a shopkeeper, bought a particular kind of chair which I need not describe. He bought it from a wholesale firm for 17s. 6d-  His  brother, the carpenter, said &#34; I think I can make a chair like that for less than 17s. 6d.&#34; He made one, took it to the wholesale firm, and said &#39;&#34; I can make&#39; this sort of chair for 6s. 6d.&#34; The man in charge said &#34; I have no power ; I am only a manager, but I will submit your offer to my principals and let you know.&#34; The first information the man had from the firm was, not that they would take chairs from him, but that this kind of chair was marked up all over Adelaide at 6s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>- We have had many experiences ot efforts made by importers to crush out local industries. The man who imports a hundred lines, as many importers do, makes a profit on each of them, but if he sees one of them threatened he can easily make less profit on that line, or sustain a little loss, to throw off the local competition that threatens him. If my honorable friends opposite deny that, I assume that they do not know the facts, and it only proves how little they have observed what is going on around them. </para>

I once worked for a man in Melbourne who was an importer and who was, by means of protection, compelled to become a manufacturer. He said, in language that was not polite - using an offensive adjective concerning protection - &#34; Before protection I could buy a thing for half a crown and sell it For a pound, but now, by God ! I have to sell it for five bob !&#34; That was his complaint. &#39; </para>

I can prove that statement from the reports of the Tariff Commission. We had it on sworn evidence from an importer himself that there was a ring and an arrangement amongst them to charge certain prices. Such arrangements are much more easily made amongst a few people whose source of supply is abroad and beyond the knowledge of those whom they supply, than amongst the manufacturers on the spot. </para>

It is absolutely certain, that if the goods are imported, and there are consequently three or four processes of distribution before they reach the consumer, these profits, costs, and charges will be multiplied, and therefore the consumer will pay more instead of less for his goods. </para>

                    <para>. - This Tariff has been responsible for, some strange alliances. Prior to the. dinner adjournment this evening, we had an alliance between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> Now we have an al,liance between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Trenwith</inline> - perhaps the most singular one that could be imagined. Prior to the dinner hour <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> made a statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> now hastens to admit and to strengthen by further ar.gument. The statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was that those who control the manufacture of apparel were found, some way or other, charging an excessive price for distribution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> now comes along and shows how that is done.  His  explanation is this - that owing to the high Tariff we have imposed, and to the manufacturer in the Old Country and the importer, having to face so many charges, the cost of distribution is increased. He argues that there are so many of these charges added on to the imported article, that it means that the article can only be sold at a much higher price, and that the locally-manufactured article is really, by this Tariff, brought to the level which these charges referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> have added to the imported article. </para>

                        <para>- I am simply congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> on the new ally he has made on the other side of the chamber. One little trouble- that faces me in this matter is this - that, much as I should like to vote for a lower duty on the item under consideration, I&#39; cannot shut my eyes to the fact that this Committee - though I think it made an error - has decided to fix a certain duty upon woollen piece goods. To my mind, that fact must be kept before us. There ought to be some relation maintained between the duty we now place on made-up apparel and that which we have determined shall be imposed  on the raw material of the trade. When I interjected, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> seemed to think that that was not an argument that ought to come before us in connexion with item 106. But I will quote a statement from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission that will show my honorable friend that the duties upon raw material ought to be considered. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of labour cost. I endeavoured to save time by asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> by interjection, if he was making any allowance for the duties upon woollen piece goods, which form the raw material of those who work under item 106. Here is what the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission says - </para>

                    <para>That an increase of the existing duties on woollen fabrics -  and we have decided upon an increase -  meant an increase of the price was practically, though perhaps unintentionally, admitted by the manufacturers! After asking that the duty on tweeds, serges, &#38;c, should be raised to 30 per cent., they added the further suggestion that the duty on clothing should be increased to 40 per cent. It was explained by one of these witnesses that &#34; it had been found necessary, in the interests of the clothing manufacturers, to allow  a  margin of at least 10 per cent, between the duty upon woollen piece goods (which constitute their raw material) and the manufactured article.&#34; When, therefore, the woollen manufacturers recognise the necessity of increasing the duty on clothing from - 25 per cent, (the present rate) to 40 per cent., consequent on their obtaining an increase to&#39; 30 per cent, on the raw materials of the clothing manufacturer, it is perfectly obvious that they anticipate a rise in the price of their products in the ratio indicated in these proposals. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I only mentioned that paragraph from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission because it embodies entirely my view. I believe that the duty fixed upon piece goods would increase the price to those who have to buy them. For that reason I cannot support the proposal put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> He proposes a duty of 25 per cent. The duties upon woollen piece goods are 30 and 25 per cent. It does seem to me that it would be an entire anomaly to adopt such a duty and, at the same time, to put duties of 40 and 35 per cent, on the raw material. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite do not believe, as I do, that, whether the piece goods used are made in Australia or not, the price is increased by the amount of the duty. It is because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> believes that, however, that I ask him to take it into account. If I were, addressing a protectionist I could afford to ignore that point, because all protectionists believe that a duty does not increase the price. If they believe that it reduces the price, and that the manufacturer of apparel here obtains .cheaper raw material in consequence, they can vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> proposal. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> believes, as I do, that the duty on piece goods increases the price pf the raw material to the. manufacturer of apparel, he ought to vote against his own request, because, as the&#39; report of the free-trade section points out, there should Be&#34; some relation between the duty on the manufactured pro-, duct and that on the raw material. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily 75 per cent. ; but I do say that it would be absurd and unfair to put a duty of 60 per cent, on piece goods, the raw material of the clothing trade, and give less than a duty of 60 per cent, on the manufactured article. Because this is what would happen : If there were any importations, they would consist of the manufactured articles, and not of the piece goods. I should have liked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to moderate his request, and keep it somewhere in proportion &#34;to the duty on piece goods.- </para>

I regard this duty of 40 per cent, as absolutely monstrous and unjustifiable. I am prepared to- support a request that it be reduced ; but I fail to see how. I can. be reasonably expected to vote for a request to reduce it below the level of the duty which the manufacturer of apparel has to pay on that which constitutes his raw material. </para>

Nine-tenths of that raw material must be imported. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; nine-tenths of the raw material used in the manufacture of men&#39;s, clothing is imported. We have- placed upon that raw material a duty of 30 per cent, in respect of the general Tariff, and a duty of 25 per cent, on imports from Great Britain. It is from thai plane that we must approach the consideration of this item. We must remember that we are dealing with a Tariff in which the principle of protection has been embodied, and as the &#39;greater proportion of the raw material used in the manufacture of men&#39;s clothing comes from the United Kingdom, we may say that &#39;the duty really payable upon it is 25 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has brought before the Committee some facts which seem important, but his information, although obtained from a witness on oath, is only partial. He has inferred a great deal more than he is justified in inferring from the knowledge gained in that way. In the first instance, he has told us that a manufacturer of clothing went to a warehouse and purchased certain materials for a suit costing, let us say, 9s. </para>

                        <para>- It might have been inferred from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that this manufacturer had gone to a warehouse and purchased the material. The honorable senator did not deal with that point as fully as he ought to have done. My interpretation of the facts is that an importer carrying on business, probably in Flinders-lane, and wishing to have a quantity of material made up, sent the manufacturer who appeared before the Tariff Commission al supply of cloth, which he duly entered- up against him. The price entered up does not affect the argument. As a matter of fact, he sent this manufacturer some, very common material to be made up in the commonest and cheapest possible form. </para>

                        <para>- I know as well as does the honorable senator what profits are made in this particular industry. What probably occurred in the case under notice was that a warehouseman in Flinders-lane sent to the manufacturer of clothing 3 yards of cloth, costing him about 2s. Or 2s. 6d. a yard, to be made into a suit&#39; at a cost of 5s. 6d. Assuming that the material costs 2s. 6d. per yard&#39;, we have a total of 7s. <inline font-style="italic">66.,</inline> and the cost of making &#39;the suit, plus the manufacturer&#39;s profit, gives us a total of 13s. The warehouseman would naturally want upon that sum his fair profit, which at 25 per cent, would mean an additional 3s. 3d. He would sell the suit - as a matter of fact such suits are sold - at about 16s. or. 16s. 3d. </para>

                        <para>- The wholesale man. I venture to tell the honorable senator, and I speak with a very &#39; considerable knowledge of the. trade, that&#39; instead of these suits being retailed at 30s., as suggested by him, they are sold in Bourke-street, Melbourne, at from 21s. to 22s. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> each. We could purchase at that price a suit which had been made in this way. When a retailer is holding a sale he will sell such suits at from 17s. <inline font-style="italic">96.</inline> to 18s. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> each. It is quite a common occurrence for suits of clothes to be made here and sold at such prices. In Sydney, under the sweating conditions which existed when free-trade prevailed in New South Wales, such suits were at times sold by warehousemen for as low a price as 10s. 6d. each. </para>

In this instance I do not think that the imposition of a protective duty will result in the manufacturer obtaining a larger price for his goods. But he will get more orders : in other words, he will obtain an increased trade. If his rate of profit is somewhat smaller than it was previously, his aggregate profit will be larger.. </para>

We know that for years prior to Federation Victoria imposed a high rate of duty upon clothing. The industry has been developed in this State by the imposition of a protective duty, and from every stand-point its production has excelled that of the sister State. My honorable friend knows perfectly well that for many years New South Wales admitted the raw materials of this industry absolutely free, whereas in Victoria both the material  and the manufactured article were dutiable at a high rate. .  But where did the shopkeeper go for his clothing ? </para>

                        <para>- Had my proposal last night for a reduced duty upon the raw materials of this industry been carried, I should have been quite prepared to support a reduction in what I, as a protectionist, regard as an  unnecessarily high tax upon the manufactured article. But the Committee has decreed otherwise. It has decided that the raw materials of manufactured garments shall be dutiable at 25 per cent. Of course I recognise that our manufacturers cannot get on without importing a proportion of their raw materials. Notwithstanding the high rate of duty which has been imposed upon those materials, I venture to say that the proportion of goods made from cloth of Victorian manufacture and that made from imported cloth will not vary very much. Consequently I hold that it would have been wise to reduce the duty upon the raw materials to 20 per cent. But, as I have already stated, we have not done so: The position of our clothing manufacturers is that the duty upon their raw materials has been raised 10 per cent., whilst that upon the&#39; manufactured article has only been increased to a similar extent. There is the same margin between the tax levied upon their raw materials and that imposed upon the manufactured article now as there was previously. Consequently I cannot see my way to agree to a reduction in the proposed rate of duty. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot help doing so. Had I been able to influence the Government they would never have occupied the position in which they find themselves. It is most deplorable, especially in view of the duties which we have levied upon cotton clothing, that we cannot extend some mercy to the people of Australia in respect of the duties imposed upon woollen clothing. To me- it is a painful thing, to be forced to vote in the direction that I intend to vote. But if we wish to frame a Tariff which will satisfy .the demands of the mill-owners upon the one hand and of the manufacturers of woollen clothing upon the other, there is no escape from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Mulcahy &#39;s argument. I feel that we are now about to reap some of the injustice which has been inflicted upon the people as the result of levying an excessive duty upon the raw materials of the clothing industry. We all know that that industry is being conducted under very  favorable conditions. I am very reluctant to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> upon this occasion, and I merely rose to emphasize the unwisdom of the Committee in refusing to reduce the very heavy duty which has been imposed upon piece goods. Of course I realize that if we now decrease the rate upon the manufactured article we must attack a strongly established industry. I can quite understand that that is not an argument&#39; to which free-traders will attach very much weight, but in my vote upon each separate item I propose to be influenced by the particular circumstances surrounding the industry involved. I wish to place upon record the fact that I am practically compelled to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> in order to prevent injustice being done to our clothing manufacturers. I am obliged to offer them some assistance, whatever may be the consequences, either to the importers of the raw materials of this industry or to the consumers. I shall give my vote almost under absolute compulsion. </para>

                        <para>- The old Victorian  35  per cent, duty was expected by the framers of the State Tariff to enable the industry of corset making to be established, but that it did not have that effect is shown by the Chief Inspector of Factories in his annual report. There were four factories, and forty-two females employed in them, in Victoria under the  35  per cent. duty. Since . Federation the duty has been considerably reduced, the factories have not increased, and the number of employe&#39;s has decreased from forty-two to thirty-four. I am reliably informed that the corsets made in those factories are of a special kind, and special prices are paid for them, while the corsets worn by the masses are not made in any. part of Australia. &#39; Although facilities have been given for the establishment of the industry of manufacturing these articles, no effort has been made in that direction. No evidence was given -before the Tariff Commission in . favour of a high duty. No desire has been expressed for it by people who might be regarded as interested in the establishment of the industry. Consequently I see no advantage, even from a protectionist point of view, in imposing a duty of.  40  or  45  per cent, merely for revenue purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - For a protectionist, above all a Victorian one - the ultra brand - to come forward as the chnmp&#39;on. of reduced duties is so rare a spectacle that I accept it&#39; as a solemn obligation to do all&#39; I can to assist the reformation of the honorable senator. It was with, some fear and trepidation that I gathered from his remarks that he, a bachelor, had been deputed to champion the cause of this particular article. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> admits &#34;that this will not be a protective duty. I can understand that he is travelling with somewhat hesitating steps in the right direction, but let me invite him to take the whole plunge at once. He need not be afraid of its being said that&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> a &#34;Victorian protectionist, moved an item on to the free list. This will be a revenue duty only. He also said that those who helped to place the article on the free list would receive the smiles and benedictions of thousands of the ladies of Australia. Surely more potent than any argument which I can address to the honorable senator upon the fiscal question will be that appeal, which he himself addressed to the Committee. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I object to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> as amended, being agreed to. The Committee had no idea that the Government were going to accept a reduced duty on this article, and consequently, in the first instance, some honorable senators voted against the article being made free who otherwise would have voted in the opposite direction, rather than vote for the imposition of a very small duty, which is only a revenue duty, and is not a protective duty in any way. I object to being, deceived in that way. I assert that the Committee, including myself, were grossly deceived in that particular direction. Fortunately, it is not too late for us to effect a remedy, because we can now negative the request. So far we have decided that the duty on corsets, shall be 15 and 10 per cent. These are revenue duties pure and, simple. </para>

                        <para>- No: but it will make the duty protective. I am opposed root and branch to any revenue duty when it can be avoided. I intend to vote against the request for the insertion of this new paragraph, because I much prefer to have an effective protective duty rather than a revenue duty, which will &#39; accomplish nothing. I invite protectionists - not north and south protectionists - to join with me to place corsets again under the protective regis of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- It is all stated in the item. When I made a suggestion in this direction a little while ago the honorable senator twitted &#39; me that I wanted to give a far larger protection to those who made up apparel and attire of this nature than to those who made up apparel ana attire from woollens and silks or from an admixture of those materials. But I point out to him that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, of which he was a distinguished ornament, recommended that the duty on these two items should be exactly the same, namely 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Of course the honorable senator would. My reason for moving this request is not so much to get an increased protection, not so much to pile up the duty on the item, as to remove what has hitherto been a constant source of friction in the working of the Tariff. Speaking on that subject a little while ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> twitted me that I was only willing to get rid of that source of friction if I could get my price, and that was an increase of the duty. I remind him that during the early portion of the day I fought just as consistently to remove a source of friction in another portion of the Tariff by a reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator twitted me for wishing to obtain a desirable end . in what to him appeared to be. an undesirable way. I have given him mv sole reason for moving this request, and should it be accepted I. shall move that the House of Representatives be requested to make a proportionate alteration in the duty imposed on imports from the United Kingdom. Honorable senators are . well aware that there is constant friction arising between the Customs officials and merchants dealing in all these classes of goods. Many departmental decisions in connexion with these items have been given, and they vary in different States. By a simple adjustment such as I propose we can remove all the existing sources of friction, and I&#39; con-  tend that that is worth a little. I was prepared this morning to accomplish that object by moving a decrease in a duty proposed, but I can accomplish it now only by a slight increase in this duty. I think it is desirable to remove any cause of friction  when it can be done without any great disturbance of the Tariff as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- Item 107 does not refer to woollen but to cotton and linen goods. When the Government proposed duties of <inline font-style="italic">46</inline> and 35 per cent, on apparel made from cotton and linen piece goods they were proposing duties of 10 and 5 per cent, upon the piece goods from which this apparel is made. As, in conjunction with another place,- we have removed the proposed duties of 10 and 5 per cent, on cotton and linen piece goods, there should be a reduction in the duties proposed on apparel made from those goods. But the Vice-President of . the Executive Council is proposing to support a request for an increase of these duties. He has himself admitted that duties on apparel should bear some relative proportion to those on the raw material from which the apparel is made. We have removed the duties at first imposed on cotton and linen piece goods, and now, though the inducement should be all the other way, the Minister without any explanation seizes the first opportunity to vote for an increase in the duties imposed on apparel made from -those goods. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend in this case to ask the House of Representatives to revert to the old duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. I point out to honorable senators that whereas the people who make up articles coming under item 107 had previously a protection of 10 per cent, only, they will now be given, even if my request be agreed to, a protection of 30 and 25 per cent. That must be admitted to be a very substantial increase upon the protection they had under the 1902 Tariff. For that reason have confidence in asking the Committee to favorably consider my proposal.

A little time ago, when this Tariff was very much before the people of New South Wales, at the time of a State election the leader of the party to which the mover of this request belongs, and of which he is so distinguished an ornament, came over in hot haste to New South Wales to cajole the people by promises that they would cut down the Tariff. But what do we find to-day? The election over, up goes the Tariff again !

                    <para>. - I desire to say, with regard to the proposal now before the Committee, that honorable senators opposite have frequently pointed out the necessity . for simplifying &#39; the Tariff. There are no two items in the Tariff in connexion with which there is so much trouble and difficulty as in regard to items 106 and 107. As to the three items with which we dealt this morning, I do not think that the difficulties which arise are anything like so great as those which occur in connexion with items 106 and 107. I should, of course, be satisfied with the Tariff as it stands; but as the Committee has already by its voice emphasized the necessity for the amalgamation of items with a. view to simplification, and as that has involved a reduction of duties, surely it is not unreasonable now, when for the same purpose of simplification an increase of 5 per. cent&#39;, is proposed -just as- on the other occasion a decrease of 5 per cent, was involved - that it should be agreed to. Under the circumstances, I have no compunction whatever about supporting the request. </para>

We have already been told that they do not know the difference between corn flour and starch, and now we are told that they do not know the difference between silk and woollen goods and cotton and linen goods.  But, though they do not know the difference between these commodities, the Minister told us this morning that they could actually tell to what purposes a piece of woollen goods was to be devoted after it went into consumption.

                        <para>- The honorable senator at least told us that these goods were very difficult to distinguish. I refer to items  106  and  107.  The goods in item  106  consist of wool and silk, and those in the item we are now considering are made up of any material not containing wool or silk. One includes wool and silk and the other excludes wool and silk. Clearly the Customs Department must be able to distinguish the goods that contain wool only, and goods that have silk in them, and goods that have neither. </para>

                        <para>- If the honor-  able senator knew as much about the&#39; things  he talks about as he thinks he does, his remarks would be more apt and more useful to the debate. I cannot believe that the Customs officers are as destitute of knowledge as the Minister has informed us that they are. I cannot for a moment believe that there is any necessity to increase an already shockingly high duty in order to obviate some unknown and impossible difficulty of determination as to what the character of goods is. When we take the  40  per cent, that is proposed now, and remember that that  40  per cent, is calculated not only upon the cost of the goods, but on  10  per cent, added, it will be seen that  40  per cent, is calculated not upon&#39; &#163;100 worth of goods, but upon  &#163;110  worth. Consequently the duty payable to the Department is really  44  per cent., and not  40 per cent. Every one knows that, and I cannot understand how any honorable senator could dream of proposing such a duty on a pinafore for a little child. We had put before us, only yesterday, figures showing that in the clothing factories of Victoria and New South Wales alone some 30,000 persons are employed. That industry has been expanding under duties of only 25 per cent., and prior to their imposition, in New South Wales at all events, under free-trade. Now, forsooth, we must have a. duty of 44 per cent, clipped on the unfortunates who are not sufficiently well-to-do to have their clothing made specially for them. Any one who has to purchase ready-made articles of wearing apparel is to be sweated in this manner, for what purpose goodness knows. The transactions of the manufacturers are large enough to show that they are not working unsuccessfully. This is not one of the struggling industries that wants to be coaxed and coddled in their infancy. It is a strong, healthy growing, largely conducted industry, but one, unfortunately, in which, perhaps, more than in any other, sweating is carried on. To benefit one of the sweating industries of Victoria and New South Wales, of which we have heard so much, and heard with condemnation, properly enough, we are to have an increase of duty to fill the pockets of the sweaters. I am surprised and shocked that such a proposal should emanate from those who profess to be the friends of the workers, but who are showing themselves to be the toilers&#39; most deadly enemies. </para>

                    <para>. - The duties of 35 per cent, and 30 per cent, appearing in the schedule in respect of this item are in all conscience high enough, and I should be very loth to support a request for an increase, but I know that, as a matter of fact, it will not result in any additional burden on the people, and that it will secure that simplification of the Tariff of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Givens</inline> has spoken. Nearly all the garments to. which this item relates are made in Australia. Although we hear occasionally of sweating, it cannot be said, so far as Melbourne is concerned - and I do not think that Sydney is behind it - that it takes place in factories in which sewing is carried on. The law is decidedly against it, the spirit of the people is opposed to it, and the Factories Acts regulate the rates of pay and bring about fair conditions of labour. As a matter of fact, this particular industry has been captured, and the garments covered by this item are all made in Australia. If any honorable senator is in doubt as to whether protection reduces or increases the price of these goods, he .can easily ascertain the facts for himself.&#34; Let any honorable senator who has the good fortune to have a wife capable of judging the value of children&#39;s garments, working men&#39;s shirts, and other goods coming within this item, take her to a draper&#39;s shop in Melbourne where they are sold, and she will tell him that they are offered at very reasonable prices. In ninety-five cases out of a 100 they are manufactured in Melbourne. Therefore the effect of the requested increase, so far as the imposition of any additional burden on the people is concerned, will not be what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> fears. </para>

If we have power to request another place to reduce&#39; duties we have power to request them to increase them. I take this opportunity of explaining why I voted, against the Government, in favour of a reduction of the duty on corsets. I was given to understand by some of the most prominent and intelligent protectionists in the Senate - by no less an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> himself - that it was a revenue duty. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not know what he is talking about. He made that statement immediately after explaining to the Committee that it was because of a misapprehension that he did not vote for a request to do away altogether with the duty on corsets. My honorable friend must have been asleep, and have just awakened. As to the item before us, I -would point out that the duties as they stand in the Bill were proposed in another place by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> and were accepted by the. Government, and agreed to without a division, after proposals to reduce the duties below  35  and  30  per cent, had been unsuccessfully pressed to divisions. These duties were proposed by a member of the very party which now seeks to increase them, and were accepted by the present Government, which also desires their increase. Thank goodness, this is a kind of Ministerial see-saw the like of which we do not often see. I think it my duty to draw attention to the game that is being played by the Government and a certain section of their supporters. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;10.5&#93;. - I wish to ask whether the exemption under this item should not also include the articles- covered by item 117? There is at present a dispute as to whether the covering for chairs and couches known as saddlebag comes properly under this item or under item 117. In my opinion, it should come under item 117.

                    <para>. - I wish t0 include in this item salt, gypsum, manure, and sugar sacks. I understand that the &#34;design of the authors of the Tariff was to make dutiable, under the previous item, those coverings and bags which are being made, or likely to be made, in Australia - bags of lighter material, such as calico, hessian, and linen - and in this item to include bags made of heavier material, such as &#39;jute, but which are not being made in Australia. The division, however, is not quite perfect. I shall not move now the request I have indicated, as I understand that a prior one is to be moved. When the question was being discussed in another place, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that he regretted that he had not accepted the suggestion to make these sacks free. Apparently, all the information was not available when the decision was arrived at. There is a difference between a salt bag and a salt sack. The bag is of lighter material, and is made in Australia. I am not proposing to put it on the free list. The heavier salt sack, which I wish to make free, is necessary where salt has to be sent long distances by rail, and sometimes by teams. The lighter bag, covered by item 112, is suitable for short journeys and for town trade. </para>

                <para class="block">Roughly, about 2,000,000 sugar sacks are used in the year in connexion with the sugar industry of Australia. A sugar sack is very much the same as a corn or flour sack. I believe the Government intended that sugar sacks should be free, and the practice of the Department at present is not to charge duty upon them. They are put on the same footing as corn and flour sacks. It will be safer to make the amendment I now propose, in order that no difficulty may arise in the future through a change of Ministers or varying interpretations of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- According to a circular, which, I suppose, every honorable senator has received, salt .sacks are made in Australia. In that circular it is pointed out that under the old Tariff salt sacks bore a duty of 10 per cent., and that those engaged in the salt industry have been accorded the benefits of additional protection. Further, we are told that salt sacks have for years been regularly made in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, and that, as salt is a food product, it is preferable that the sacks should be made in Australian factories by clean girls than by coolies in India, where the conditions are not so desirable. These are strong and patriotic reasons why salt sacks should enjoy some protection, as against the sacks made in the East, and therefore I hope the request will not be adopted. </para>

                    <para>. - I assure the Committee that I submit this request in good faith that the sacks I have in mind are not made in Australia. When honorable senators speak in general terms about sacks they are liable to error. There is a great difference in the weight of the various sacks made, and it is quite possible for the superficial observer, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> for instance, to walk in at one end of a factory and out at the other, and then, with a wave df the hand, declare that sacks are made in Australia. The whole question depends on the weight of the sacks. On the authority of the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures, and also a communication to the Treasurer from the Cheetham Salt Company, I am entitled to assume that these particular sacks for use in the salt trade are not made in Australia. In further support of that view I may refer honorable senators to the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Generally the. members of that section of the Commission were in agreement, but in this particular instance they were not, as will be gathered from the following words written by the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Sir John</inline> Quick, in dissenting from the view of his colleagues - </para>

                <para class="block">I may say that Messrs. Clarke, Higgs and McGregor dissented from that view, and recommended that a duty should be imposed upon these particular goods. But the evidence given, and the summary of the conclusions at which the Commission arrived, clearly confirm my statement that there is a variety in the weight of the. sacks. Generally speaking, the lighter sacks are made here, but the heavier variety, which are made by hand and not by machinery, are not manufactured here, or, if so, only in a. very small way. If these sacks are being made here, it is curious that such a pronounced protectionist as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir&#39; John</inline> Quick should have arrived at the conclusion I have read. Does any one doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick&#39;s adherence to the protectionist cause ? </para>

                        <para>- No one could be a sufficiently ardent protectionist for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> Wherever they see an article, they want to tax it. Really they are like an Irishman at a fair : wherever he sees a head he wants to hit it. If the Committee does not care to adopt my suggestion, I shall feel, at any rate, that there is a certain amount of retributive justice in its action, seeing that not long since it did give the salt companies the benefit of an increase of 7s. 6d. a ton. But I am not at all certain that in regard to the other two bags I have mentioned there is any compensation for the manufacturers of those commodities. If the Committee is not disposed to accept the suggestion I have made now, it may, perhaps, be prepared to allow gypsum and manure bags to go on the free list, even if it strikes off the salt bags. </para>

The next aspect of the question is that these bags are now being manufactured in Australia, and that if the duty be taken off that industry will be extinguished. Messrs.

                    <para>During last year we supplied from our Sydney factory between 25,000 and 30,000 salt sacks to the Che eth am Salt Company, Geelong, and are now negotiating with them for further supplies for the coming&#39; year. We have also been making large quantities of salt sacks in our Sydney factory, which&#39; are used for packing oil cake. For one firm alone we supplied between  90,000 and 100,000 during last year for this purpose. These are, to all intents and purposes, salt sack?, and should the duty be taken off we would lose this trade, as our customers would use the imported sacks. &#39; </para>

                    <para>We have not previously catered for the South Australian trade,* having no factory further south than Sydney, but we are negotiating with the Castle Salt Company, through their buying agents, Messrs. Henry Berry and Co., Melbourne, with a view to taking their contract for the supply of salt sacks, and if successful in securing this would make arrangements for the bags to be made in Adelaide, as the extra cost of freight to Adelaide would handicap the business if the bags were &#39;made in Sydney. The writer saw Messrs. Henry Berry and Co. when in Melbourne, and was informed that the Castle Salt Company had supplies on hand sufficient to la&#39;st for some months, so that there was no prospect of immediate business, but we trust to be successful in securing their order &#39;when they are ready &#39;o place another. </para>

                <para>Seeing that these sacks are being manufactured in Australia, I think the Committee will be wise if it refuses to agree to the request. </para>

                <para class="block">Castle Salt Company of South Australia. It was the reading of the circular by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> which. led to the discovery of my error. Honorable senators who know anything about the subject will see that the sample bag which has been shown round the chamber is suitable for holding many other things besides, salt. Factories which can make a bag of that kind can make bags suitable for other purposes. Bran, chaff, potato, onion, coal, and wood bags are to be allowed to come&#39; in duty free, but the manufacturers of salt are to be penalized by a duty on a bag which, except as regards the size, is no different from those bags. Why should that difference be made? If it is a fair thing to charge a duty on a bag when it is used for packing salt, it is equally fair to charge a dutv on a bag when it is used for holding chaff or bran. I ask my staunch protectionist friends to recognise that there is an anomaly. Either all bags should come in free, or they should be dutiable. </para>

IT my honorable friends believe that salt bags are being made here, if they believe the statement of Joyce Bros, that they are prepared to put up. a factory in South Australia to supply bags to the salt companies, surely they -can go and make the much lighter chaff bag? Let my honorable friends show that they have some belief in their own principles, and treat bags in a uniform way. But let them not pass a Tariff containing a glaring anomaly. </para>
