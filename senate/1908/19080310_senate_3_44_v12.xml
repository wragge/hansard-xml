Representations were made that a new office was necessary, and consideration of the matter was postponed until the Postmaster-General could personally visit Port Pirie. The Minister decided that if the proposed site could be obtained at a reasonable price a sum would be placed on the Estimates for a new office. The State Government has now been asked whether it is willing to accept a re-transfer of the present premises and site; also if it is prepared to transfer to the Commonwealth the other site which has been proposed. </para>

                (New South Wales)[2.49]. - The duty originally proposed in respect of this item was 25 per cent., which represented a material advance upon the rate levied under the old Tariff. The item previously was dutiable at12½ per cent., and free. As we have been piling up duties rather heavily, it would be just as well that there should be a little reasonable give-and-take in respect of this machinery, which is necessary to so many trades within the Commonwealth - I refer particularly to the machinery required in wool washing and scouring. The Commonwealth has recently provided a bounty for combed wool tops, and it is reasonable to suppose thai in the preparation of wool for the tops process a better class of machinery will be required than has been used hitherto. Certainly we can make improvements in our processes of treating leather. Can-making is a matter of considerable importance to orchardists, and to those engaged in meat works and a great: many of our primary industries. Where we come to the treatment of fibrous materials, felt, and felt hats, the making of paper, and particularly artesian boring machines, we may well extend a liberal hand towards various industries which involve the employment of a tremendous number of people, by making the duties as moderate as possible. Seeing that originally the item was12½ per cent. and free, it would be very fair if at present, instead of 15 per cent., we made the duty 10 per cent. That is a fair compromise, bringing the item practically to the old standard. I therefore intend to move -

                    <para>.-I wish to call attention to the change that has been made in paragraph a. In the Tariff, as introduced to another place, there was an asterisk drawing attention to a footnote "Subject to rebate under conditions specified in the schedule." The schedule provided that machinery imported for certain manufacturing processes should pay the duty on landing, and the amount be rebated on the machinery being placed in.  position. But that schedule does not now appear in the Bill. </para>

                <para>I am informed that there is no possible chance of those articles being made in this country. The machine shops at Home that do make them are enormous establishments, employing a large number of hands, and with very large capital invested in them. The demand for the machines is very large there, and they turn out some hundreds in the year, whereas any maker here would probably be asked for only one or two. This duty is, therefore, a tax on an industry that we should endeavour to extend. It is said that there can be made hare the following other machines - </para>

                <para>SenatorMcCOLL. - The honorable senator's interjections are very nasty, and very much out of order. Even if a rebate is provided for, it is still a tax, as is shown by the fact that during  1907  machines and parts were imported to the value of  £15,000,  and were to arrive in the first six months of  1908,  to the extent of  £10,000.  A lot of machinery has been put into position, but none of the rebate has yet been paid, nor can the manufacturers get it. I understand that Tasmania has had the rebate paid on what she has imported, but that not a penny has been rebated in Victoria and the other States. Nearly all these establishments are working on an overdraft, and, therefore, that loss of interest on the money they have had to deposit is very heavy. This duty is really a tax upon an important industry, and a serious item to the various establishments concerned. It has been ascertained, by testing the matter for a number of years, that the cost of importing this machinery from Home, including inland freight from the factory to sea-board, freight across the sea, and from the sea to the mill, amounts to  33  per cent. without any duty whatever. The addition of  15  per cent. brings it up to  48,  or almost  50  per cent. I imagine that our idea in passing the Tariff is to try to expand industries, but in this case we are lifting up with one hand and knocking down with the other. If these machines can be made here, let. them be made; but, otherwise, they ought to be admitted free. What I intend to propose is that they should be admitted, subject to departmental by-laws, which will give the Department an opportunity of making inquiries as to whether the particular machines can or cannot be produced here. </para>

                    <para>.-I am sorry to say, from one stand-point, that it is my duty to oppose the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl;</inline> and I should like to deal with one or two questions to which that honorable gentleman referred. First of all, the honorable senator stated that in the matter of rebates there was a grievance against the Department; but I can assure him that he must have made that statement under a misapprehension. When the Tariff was originally introduced, there was inserted, in regard to this and one or two other items, a provision that, in the event of the machines being introduced and set into place, a rebate would thereupon follow. The House of Representatives, however, refused to recognise any such arrangement ; and, therefore, on the 29th November, 1907, that provision was struck out. On the 8th August, when the Tariff was originally introduced, the public were, so to speak, bound by it in all its terms ; and between that date and the 29th November, rebates were made to certain persons, while, as a matter of fact, they have not been made to others. I have already given notice of a proposal to ask the Committee to authorize all rebates up to the 29th November, so far as this item is concerned. As honorable senators know, the public are bound by the Tariff, and prices are fixed according to the amount of duty, those concerned honestly relying on the Government proposals being passed intact. Therefore,I think that, when the time comes, the Committee will not hesitate to give that necessary authority, so that all concerned may be treated alike as between the 8th August and the 29th November. It will be seen, therefore, that there is no intention, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> seemed to infer, of differentiating between one person and another. </para>

                        <para>- I know; but I have notified my intention to rectify the anomaly, and I am sure that the honorable senator will be amongst the first to assist me. With regard to the proposal immediately before us, I may say that all the machinery, with the exception of that relating to fibrous materials, was inserted in this item, on the specific recommendation of the Tariff Commission. Another place, however, after a lengthy discussion, insisted on the insertion of the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> now seeks to have deleted, a compromise being arrived at whereby the present duty of 15 per cent, was imposed. To that compromise my colleague in another place was a party, and I am obliged to adhere to it, with one slight exception that will be consequential on something done in this Chamber, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will remember. It was acknowledged that high-pressure blowers for smelting could not be made here, and consequently it has been agreed that these, together with other blowers, shall be placed on the free list. I am desirous of adhering to the arrangement made ; and I feel myself bound by the compromise, with the small exception to which I have referred. Therefore, I ask the Committee to pass the item in the terms in which it now appears. It represents, I think, the almost unanimous feeling of another place, and appears on its face to be fair and just. It is possible that some of the articles mentioned by my honorable friend are not made here at the present moment; but, according to my instructions, nearly all of them are made here. It must be remembered, too, that as this and the other Chamber have dealt most liberally with the woollen industries, they, in turn, must be bound by the same class of protection as has been extended to them. The object of this item is to give the necessary protection to the machinery industry. I feel that in pursuance of the protective lines which it has already laid down, the Committee will support the item as it stands with the small exception to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>.- I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> after having supported a duty of 25 per cent. on fans for ventilating mines, cannot object very well to the duty on this item. The contention that an article is not made in this country should no longer hold good in the Committee, . because indisputable proof was given that fans for ventilating purposes are not made in Australia, and yet the duty on them was retained. Whether an article is made in the country or not, whatever duty is imposed on it can be justified. The Minister has stated that the industries in which these machines are used are very highly protected. If such industries have been lifted up with one hand and put down with the other, that is more equal treatment than to lift up an industry with neither hand, as in the case of mines. They get no assistance whatever. </para>

The statement that the machines named by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> may or may not be made in Australia should carry no weight with the Committee. We have imposed heavy duties on other articles, and I hold that as these machines are used in highly protected industries they can also bear a very fair amount of duty.

                    <para>-  It is ridiculous to compare the very intricate and elaborate machinery used . in woollen mills with fans. In Australia there are only a comparatively few woollen mills, whereas there are numerous mines which can use ventilating fans. A fan is an article which will be used frequently, and an industry for its manufacture can be well established. But in regard to the intricate machines which are used in woollen mills, capitalists will not embark in the industry because the plant which they would need to put down would be very large indeed, and the demand for the machines, when made, would be very small. I am informed that one firm making woollen and worsted machinery turn out about one hundred per week or more. The number of men employed by the firm is over  11,000.  while the capital is £4,500,000. The machinery for woollen and worsted mills comprises about one hundred different machines. There are  2,000  parts in a loom alone. Where shall we get any capitalist who will undertake to make such machines ? It is not to be expected that men will employ their money in the manufacture of these articles while the demand for them is so limited. </para>

                        <para>- No; under the old Tariff, woollen machinery was free. I am informed that one firm employs about  1,000  men in making these parts, and that their output is about  200  looms per week. In Australia, the demand would be limited to one or two looms per week. Under my proposal capitalists will be protected if they embark in the industry. If the machines are admitted under departmental by-laws, and it is found that they are being made, or that they can be made here, the Customs officers will impose a duty. But if they are not being made, and cannot be made here, why should we penalize a great industry which ought to be allowed to expand, and in which persons ought to be encouraged to invest their money, by levying a duty which will be of no possible service ? </para>

                    <para>. - One of the difficulties in dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> proposition is that it is so sectional. He has picked out certain machines, probably those with which he is familiar, and asked us to exempt them from the general duty, Whether it is to be high or low. There are many machines which ought to be placed in an exactly similar position. Take, for instance, printing machinery. I do not know any particular reason why those who are engaged in the manufacture of hats  - a  highly protected industry - should get their machines free, when the printers are called upon to pay a duty on theirs. The difficulty I find is in the want of knowledge as to what machines are being made here and what are not. It is impossible for me, or any one else, to divide machinery into two classes. So far as I know, not one article included in this item is entitled to different treatment from the balance. I am not disposed to assist the honorable senator in picking out particular items of machinery - more especially when they are largely used by the most highly protected industries in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- We are being asked to support a duty on them with, the understanding that they may be exempt from duty by the adoption of the very difficult and uncertain process of the carrying of a resolution by both Houses on the motion of a Minister of the Crown. The Minister concerned, if a member of a highly protectionist Government, might not be willing to submit such a resolution, and, even if he were, it is conceivable that in some circumstances the resolution would not be passed, when to oppose and defeat it might be to secure a party advantage. I believe that these machines are not made in Australia, and are not likely to be made here in the near future, and I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to suggest some means for the further encouragement of the woollen industry in this direction other than the proposal to make the free admission of these machines dependent upon the condition set out in item 167. </para>

                    <para>.- These machines have never been subject to duty, and for a very good reason. We are dealing with a highly important and most promising industry. It is scarcely possible to set a limit to its future development. I have no wish to disparage the mining industry, but we are here dealing with a far more important question than the free admission of machinery and tools employed in that industry. A mine may be worked out in a few months, or in a few years, but the woollen industry of the Commonwealth will continue to develop and become more important as the machinery for carrying it on is ma.de more perfect. It is an industry, which, perhaps, above all others is deserving of every encouragement, and it would be foolish on our part to impose any handicap upon it. No local factory is likely to begin the manufacture of these machines, which are now being made in the' Old Country as perfectly as human skill can suggest. </para>

                        <para>- We should encourage people to start something practical and sensible, and not the manufacture of machinery for which there is" very little demand. We have the raw material required for the woollen 'industry in abundance in the Commonwealth, and by-and-by it will have been so thoroughly established that there will be no further need for -its protection. Locally manufactured blankets and woollens are very largely used now. I use only Australian blankets, and would not look at an English blanket, because, in my opinion, the Australian article is better and cheaper.

                        <para>- No. What I wish to point out is that there is under the provisions already existing ample protection against the probability of a duty being imposed on machinery that it is impossible to make here. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> of what he must have learned by this time, that a number of protectionist manufacturers who desire protection on their own products are continually craving for freetrade on the products of other manufacturers. We should not overlook that Senator McColl has submitted a list of machines longer than the item under discussion. It is possible that the honorable senator is acquainted with every one of" them, but I should imagine that he has been informed by some manufacturer that it is difficult or impossible to obtain them here. If it is only difficult to' obtain then* locally, that is not a sufficient reason for refusing to impose a duty upon them, because the imposition of such a duty might, and; very possibly would, make it easy to obtain them here in the near future. </para>

The honorable senator believes so much in the future development of the industry that he thinks; our local woollen manufacturers will ultimately be masters of the situation, and yet; in the same breath he says that there is no inducement to manufacturers of machinery to invest their capital in the manufacture of machines which are essential to the development of the woollen industry. If the woollen industry has the potential!-, ties which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has claimed for it there is every reason why, if the raa'chines are not being made in Australia at the present time, encouragement should be given for the investment of the capital that' will conduce to their manufacture. But so&gt; far no proof has been submitted that the particular machines enumerated in the list which I hold in my hand are not made in Australia. I fail to see why, if the manufacturers are prepared to pay15 per cent. on the machines enumerated in the latter portion of the list submitted, the remaining number should not be made here;particularly in view of the great possibilities or this great natural industry. We have protected the woollen industry in all its bearings right up to the hilt. Here again we see an exhibition of the inconsistency of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> in regard to his protectionist principles. We find him one day voting for semi protection, and another day in the ranks of the free-traders. </para>

As far as I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> references to inconsistency they remind me of the aphorism that "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of a little mind." I have come across a good deal of inconsistency, and a great many little minds during these Tariff debates. What is the use of imposing a high duty on a manufactured article and then taxing the machines by means of which the protected article is produced - especially when those machines cannot be manufactured in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- We have agreed to protective duties on hats, and I fail to see why the hat-making industry should not be prepared to bear its proportion of the cost of establishing other industries. I have not the slightest hesitation in voting to cause it to do so. The hat industry may be said to be a branch of the woollen industry, and since we have done all within our power to insure its success, we should endeavour to bring into existence, or to support, other industries essentially associated with it. The position is altogether different in connexion with the item relating to mining machinery, which it was proposed to make free. When that question was under consideration. I could not lose sight of the fact that a very small percentage of labour is employed in the engineering yards of Australia as compared with the number of persons dependent on mining. The Committee, however, arrived at a decision, the' effect of which will be to build up the engineering industry, whilst at the same time eating out the vitals of one of the most important industries that we have in the Commonwealth. It will be necessary for us to give great consideration at all times to the mining industry ; but since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> 's request relates to machinery used by a number of industries which have the assistance of protective duties, E cannot' see my way to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot see my way clear to support the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> When the arguments which he used in favour of this request were advanced in support of a request to reduce the duties on machinery used in other industries, the reply made by our protectionist friends was that the machinery in question could be made here. We know that this machinery can be made here as well as can any other class. Another consideration that weighs with me is that we have imposed exceedingly . heavy duties on hats, and that I 'do not think it would be reasonable to admit free of duty the machinery required for hat making. Many of us thought that the duties on hats were too high, and I fail to see why we should be asked now to place that industry in a still better position. It is said that the revenue involved in respect of this request is something like  £10,000  a year. That is a very small sum compared with the revenue collected in respect of duties on mining machinery not yet made in Australia. The hat-making industry .is so well protected that it can afford to pay. a duty of  15  per cent, on the machinery it imports. If the proposal were to place the machinery used by all industries on a similar footing- </para>

                    (Queensland) {3.48]. - I propose to move a request which I hope the Government will accept. The object that I have in view is to remove from the paragraph under which it is dutiable at 25 per cent., and to include it in a paragraph under which it will be dutiable at 15 per cent., a machine which is the outcome of a series of experiments carried on during the last fifteen years, with a view of preparing molasses in a portable form. Had I been able to obtain before the information which I understand the Department require, I should have moved a request that this machine be included in a previous item, under which it would be free. Unfortunately I was unable to do so. The present system of carrying molasses in casks and tanks is very awkward ; but after a series of experiments there has been invented a machine which, first of all, disintegrates certain materials such as megasse, or the husks of corn, maize, and so forth, and saturates the powder so produced with molasses, of which it will absorb 72 per cent. of its own weight. Another part of the machinery converts this mixture into solid briquettes, and in that form it can be carried very conveniently over any distance. At present one of these machines is working successfully in England, and another, in all probability, will shortly be placed in position at one of the sugar mills in Queensland, of which the Government have control. My more recent information, apart from my general knowledge of the subject, has been derived from the Director of the Sugar Bureau in Queensland who is also controller of certain sugar mills. I had the pleasure of conversing with the expert attached to the Department, who pointed out that if the disintegrating, mixing and pressing process were done by different machines, each could probably be made in Australia; but I have ascertained from the Director of the Sugar Bureau that it is a combination machine which cannot be made here ; in the first place, because it is covered by patent rights, and, in the next place, because so few machines are required that it would not pay to put down a plant for their manufacture. If every centre of molasses production used one of these machines, the whole number needed would not be more than forty or fifty. I do not intend to ask that this machine may be put on the free list - although its importance justifies its free admission ; I intend to move that it be made dutiable at 15 per cent. In the
                    <inline font-style="italic">report</inline>
                    of the Queensland Department of Agriculture for the year 1906, it is stated that of the 8,373,000 gallons of molasses produced in the preceding year - probably an under-estimate - 4,500,000 gallons were allowed to run into the creeks and rivers, or were otherwise wasted. It is therefore highly desirable that every encouragement should be given to the utilization of this valuable by-product. It would be of immense advantage to the farmers and pastoralists of Australia if in times of drought they could get molasses for their stock at a reasonable price. Of course, an immense quantity has been sent in tanks to dairying districts and elsewhere to feed stock ; but with proper appliances a much larger quantity of this valuable fodder would be available. I move -

If what he says is correct, any duty imposed upon it will be merely revenue-producing, as the limited demand will prevent the manufacture of the machine in Australia. I shall not support the proposal to make the machine dutiable at 15 per cent., because I cannot vote for a revenue duty ; but I am willing to agree to a proposal to allow it to be admitted free. </para>

The Minister has no right to speak as if this proposal were being sprung upon him without warning. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> suggestion that I should move for the free admission of the machine, I may say that I am willing to do so, if it can be pointed out to me that it can be done ; but when I spoke to the  Chairman  about the matter privately this morning, he left on my mind the impression that that course was not now open to me. </para>

                        <para>- The words "machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials" are part of paragraph  a,  and, in regard to them, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> proposes alternative treatment. After an item has been dealt with, it is not competent for the Committee to go back on its decisions in regard to it, and, therefore, we are adopting, in this case, a practice already followed on many occasions, allowing a new paragraph to be moved differentiating in respect to the treatment of some of the articles mentioned in the item. This has been found a convenient course, because it enables the Committee to know how each article of the item is to be treated before it proceeds to fix the duties. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> proposal deals with articles already enumerated in the item. It affirms that these articles shall be differentiated from the others by being subjected to one of two courses of treatment. If they comply with departmental by-laws they will be admitted free, if they do not, they will be dutiable at 15 per cent. It must be obvious to honorable senators that if we agree to the body of the item, and proceed to deal with the duty set out under the general Tariff, the Committee will then have affirmed that the articles specified in the item shall be liable to that uniform duty. In other words, whatever rate we may adopt will govern the whole of the articles in the item. Having decided the rate of dutv which should be payable upon these articles, we could not then go back to the body of the item, either for the purpose of omitting from or adding to it. Therefore, I . propose to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to submit his proposal - </para>

                <para class="block">A point of order was raised that I could not receive such a request until after the rates of duty on paragraph a had been dealt with. I ruled that it could be received, and was in conformity with the practice followed throughout the consideration of the schedule. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> dissented from my ruling. I wish to draw your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to the important fact that the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> proposed to move, or part of them - " Machinery and parts thereof, used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials . . . " - are already in the body of the paragraph. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> request repeated those words with the addition of "as prescribed by departmental by-laws, free." The effect of his proposal, if carried, would be that if the machines complied with the conditions laid down by departmental by-laws they would be free, whereas if they did not so comply they would be dutiable at whatever rate the Committee thought fit to fix in regard to paragraph a. My reason for allowing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to move his request at that stage was that, if we passed paragraph a and also fixed the duties in the first and second columns, we could not subsequently receive any other proposition affecting in any way the articles named in paragraph a. If the Committee had carried the duties as they stand, it would, have affirmed that the duty on " machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials  . . . " should be 15 per cent. </para>

                <para class="block">The  Chairman  of Committees. - I did not give that direction on the floor of the House, although I am prepared to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> came to me, and I drew his attention to the fact that, as he proposed to have two classes of treatment for this kind of machinery, it was not necessary to omit the words from paragraph a, because, if the machinery did not comply with the departmental by-laws, obviously there must be some provision under which it could be dealt with. It was therefore necessary still to retain the words in the body of paragraph a in order that, if the machines did not comply with the departmental by-laws, they should become dutiable and duty could be collected on them. If, however, he moved to omit the words from the body of paragraph  a,  and also proposed new paragraph  a a,  then, . if the machines did not comply with the departmental by-laws, they would fall under " Machinery n.e.i." and probably have to pay very much higher duties - I believe 30 per cent. (general Tariff), and 25 per cent. (United Kingdom). In order that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> should have an opportunity to ask the Committee to agree that there should be' two methods of dealing with this machinery - which was his wish when he moved the original proposition that he afterwards withdrew, for he did not want to allow all this machinery to come in free, but desired that it should come in free only when it complied with the departmental by-laws - it was obviously undesirable from his point of view to omit the words from paragraph  a.  What he wanted to test the feeling of the Committee upon was the proposal that the machines should be dutiable if they did not comply with the departmental by-laws, and free if they did. </para>

                <para>The  Chairman of Committees. -  Yes, and the point is whether, as we have dealt with the body of paragraph,  a  up to the last line, he can move his proviso now. I ruled that if the Committee fixed the duties on paragraph  a  we could not then return to deal with those articles in any way. Our decision would then be irrevocable, and any request to deal in any other fashion with article? upon which we had already fixed the duty would be contradictory to a decision of the Committee. Otherwise, we should land ourselves in the position that any honorable senator could at this late stage move to include in the item now before us articles which the Committee dealt with days ago, but which are machinery of different classes. Moreover, the practice which I have now laid down has been adopted in a more or less qualified form throughout the consideration of this schedule. For instance, on item 134, dealing with trimmings and ornaments, a request was moved, before the Committee dealt with the rates of duty, to leave out of the item certain articles and make them free. </para>

                <para>The  Chairman of Committees. -  They are not quite on all-fours, but to some extent the cases are similar. It was proposed in that case to have, not two methods of treatment, but only one. We dealt with the body of the item in that instance, and practically made certain articles free under a new paragraph  b,  whereas a rate of duty was fixed on the other articles. In item 86, " Nuts edible," the first paragraph was  "a.  Cocoanuts, whole, per cwt, is." To that an amendment was moved to insert the following new paragraph "  a a.  Cocoanuts, whole, for the manufacture of cocoanut oil and cake and other substances, under departmental by-laws, free." </para>

My ruling may be, and is in many respects, novel, but I submit that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> were not given an opportunity of dealing with the matter now the item would pass from the control of the Committee after we dealt with the duties in the first and second columns. It is a point of vital importance that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> does not wish to omit the words in question from the body of paragraph  a,  because he does not desire to allow all machines of this class to come in free. He wishes them to come in free only when they comply with departmental bylaws. This was therefore his only opportunity of moving his request. </para>

Another aspect of the question is, of course, the bearing of our Standing Orders and of our general practice upon it. It is not desirable that the convenience of a member of the Committee should at any time come into conflict with our Standing Orders. It is never desirable that it should take precedence of them. But with regard to the question of convenience, you will see, if you look at the item, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> might have fully secured his object if he had moved to leave out of paragraph  a,  while it was before the Committee, the words " Machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous material and felt, and felt hats," and indicated that he intended, .if that request was agreed to, to move for the addition of two new paragraphs, as follow - </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> had adopted that method he could have achieved his whole object, which was to divide this particular machinery into two classes - that which had no limitation imposed upon it, and that which should be subject to departmental by-laws. That is all I desire to say from the. point of view of convenience, except that, if any member of the Committee misses his opportunity of bringing forward a proposal or a new item, I am afraid that, by the general opinion and procedure adopted, he is simply informed of the fact that he has missed his opportunity. It is assumed that an honorable senator must take his chance of submitting his proposal at the proper time. Further, I point out that if the question of hardship or convenience of honorable senators is to be given much consideration, there is the other method of recommittal. ' As to procedure or the Standing Orders, we have no warrant, from practice or otherwise, for, without a motion, postponing an item, and, in the absence of any postponement, by that means deciding to set it aside and leave it undealt with until we have, decided a subsequent item. In this case we have not dealt conclusively with item  165-,  paragraph a;. we have not finished the main body of the item or touched it. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has moved a new paragraph to the item, to be called paragraph  165aa,  and, as I understand the Chairman's ruling, it is that we shall address ourselves to that proposal, now. But, assuming that I desire machinery for the manufacture of paper to be dealt with under similar circumstances, what, then; would be the position? I should be jambed in between item  165,  paragraph a, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> proposed paragraph a a of the item. Assuming that I did not desire machinery for the manufacture of paper to be touched at all by departmental by-laws, what would the position be ? I do not know what the position of any honorable senator would be who wished for the particular treatment of any. commodity. ' Some might wish certain machinery to be under departmental by-laws, and other honorable senators, in regard to other machinery, might desire the reverse. Our powers of omission have proved most useful, and it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> ought to be restricted to what I consider has been the practice in this Committee. If the honorable senator desires any particular commodity to have separate treatment, he may move that it be omitted from the item. It is clear that the ruling of the  Chairman,  if acted upon, would be against precedent and the Standing Orders, and, moreover, would be inconvenient and undesirable to honorable senators who desire special treatment for certain commodities. </para>

                        <para>- In a matter of this kind, I should have been well satisfied to be guided by the  Chairman,  who has, undoubtedly laid down a practice for himself in regard to these matters. I admit that the  Chairman  must be permitted a degree of latitude in laying down what the practice should be; but, so far as I am aware, there has been no case analogous to the present one. There is no doubt that we have established the practice that we can strike out any portion of an item, or put any portion into a new sub-item. That has been done frequently j but in this case, the position is that we have carried the item down to " Machinery and parts thereof, used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials and felt, and felt hats." </para>

                        <para>- We have inserted after the words " Boring Machines " and before <inline font-style="italic"> ' ad valorem ' '</inline> the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway'</inline> s request. The item has, therefore, been carried to that extent. The proposal now is to take out some of the words which have already been carried, and give a different meaning to them. That could be done clearly in the item itself. That is to say, we could modify the item itself, so as to give the qualification ; but, strictly speaking, the correct way would be to insert after the words " Machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials and felt, and felt hats," the words " except machinery . and parts thereof prescribed by departmental bylaws." That clearly appeals to my judgment as the proper course. But, in view of your ruling the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> - with which I may say, with respect, I agree - I think it is still open to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> at the end of the item, to insert the exception to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- The point really before you, sir, is, Can a new paragraph be taken before the previous one has been dealt with ? I do not propose to -say anything about the convenience of honorable senators, or even to discuss whether it is possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to do what he wants to do, but to confine my remarks to the point I have stated. Suppose that the new paragraph suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> were already in the Tariff, would it be contended that we could pass from paragraph a and consider a new paragraph a a without having postponed paragraph  a ? .1 do not think so. If we could not pass from what was printed in the schedule - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> admits that we could not - under what standing order or previous procedure can it be said that we can pass from the paragraph under discussion to discuss an entirely new paragraph, and having done that, go back to the item which had been brushed on one side for the time being ? I cannot conceive that it is arguable that there is any possibility of passing from the paragraph under discussion on to another paragraph, and then going back to the paragraph which had been shelved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has stated that there was no other procedure possible. There were at least half-a-dozen other ways possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has already suggested one way, and when the suggestion was made, an interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> conveyed to my mind the fact that so far he has missed the wide difference between a tack at the end of an item and a new sub-item. It was entirely competent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to tack on to the body of the item words which would not have been absent from the sub item, and his request would' have been in order. Originally he proposed a request to strike out certain words. He withdrew that proposal for reasons which, no doubt, seemed good to him ; but had he persisted with it, and the Committee had agreed with him, he could have proposed later on a request to re-insert the words as a new sub-item. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that that would only be providing for the articles to be free, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wished to have an alternative treatment. That new sub-item, if introduced, could have provided, not merely for a dual or alternative treatment, but for half-a-dozen kinds of treatment. The proper course for the honorable senator to have pursued was to move a request for the omission of the words, and when we had dealt with paragraph a, to submit a request for the re-introduction of the words as paragraph a a or b, dutiable at 15 per cent. under one set of circumstances, and free under another set. That opportunity was missed by the withdrawal of his original request. But the mere fact that an honorable senator has missed an opportunity does not give us the right to depart from the Standing Orders. Even though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> missed that opportunity, a further way was open to him, as has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and still later, if the Committee had agreed with him, he could have moved for the recommittal of the item. I do not know that the convenience or the order in which he should proceed has much to do with the argument. To my mind the whole point is : Can we proceed with the consideration of a new paragraph before the one under discussion has been dealt with? With regard to the precedents quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> I would point out that the proposals then dealt with were requests to amend item 162. In this case he does not propose to ask the other House to amend a paragraph of an item, but to leave it for the time being, and to ask that House reinsert an entirely new paragraph, which is something very different from dealing with a request to amend the item under discussion. </para>

I gather that, first of all, he contemplated moving for the omission of the words " machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials," but that, subsequently, he withdrew from that position with the object of moving, later on, a request for the insertion of a new paragraph - (aa) Machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials, as prescribed by Departmental by-laws, free. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. Suppose that there were half-a-dozen articles which came under the head of " machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> request was submitted, I understand, with the expectation that possibly only three of those articles might be admitted free under departmental by-laws. Our Standing Orders are really not of very great assistance in determining a question of this character, for the simple reason that the procedure is absolutely novel, and the Standing Orders Committee have not taken into consideration how requests in respect of Bills of this class should be submitted. I take it that we have to look a great deal more to the substance than to the particular form in which requests are to be submitted. We do not amend the Bill at all - and that is,I think, the marked distinction between the present position and the position we should be in with an ordinary Bill - we do not amend the Bill, but simply make requests for its amendment. If the other House agrees with our request, it amends the Bill in the way which is considered desirable, in order to make it more acceptable. It appears to me that it would be in the same position as if the Bill had been recommitted in its own Chamber for the purpose of considering certain amendments : the whole of a clause would be brought under consideration. Suppose, for -the sake of argument, that we adopt the ruling given by the  Chairman  of Committees. Item 165 would go back to the other House with a request for a duty of 15 per cent. on " machinery and parts thereof used in the manufacture and treatment of fibrous materials," and also with a request that an amendment should be made so as to provide that a portion of that machinery should be admitted free " as prescribed by departmental- by-laws." It would, I take it, be perfectly competent for the other Chamber to make the amendment either in the form which had been desired by this Chamber, or in another form that would more clearly and definitely express that desire. I think it would have been better for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> first to have moved a request for the omission of the words from the principal item, and, later on, to have submitted a request for the insertion of a sub-item taking in the whole of these particular articles of manufacture, but asking that they should pay a duty of 15 per cent. unless they were manufactured " as prescribed by departmental by-laws." Had that course been taken, I think that we should have got over the difficulty without very much trouble. But the question arises, Can we go back and deal with the paragraph, as desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl?</inline> I have referred to the way in which item 162 was dealt with on Friday. A reference has been made to one or two other items, but I do not propose to refer to them, as I have not got them quite before my mind just now. The item before the Committee on Friday was-  and on and after28th November, 1907 - </para>

                        <para>- That is beside the question just now. The procedure was allowed by the Committee. It accepted the way in which the  Chairman  had seen fit to put the motion, which was negatived. . It may be said that in this case we have the words specifically mentioned which it is desired to deal with later on. I would point out that the words " machines and machinery, n.e.i.," in paragraph  b  of item 162 practically covered every possible class of machine and machinery which had not been elsewhere included, and, of course, included " fans for mines," although they were not specifically mentioned therein. I do not think that because in one case the articles are specifically mentioned and in the other case the articles are included in a generic term, a distinction can be drawn with regard to the position taken up by the Committee at that time. I think that the present case is pretty well on all-fours with the case referred to last week. Then the question was with regard to dealing with the amount of duty. Had a request for the insertion of the words " fans for mines, free " been carried, we should have been in the same position, I take it, as we should be in if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> request for the insertion of certain words were agreed to. Then the Committee dealt with the question of the duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> moved a request that the duty in the general Tariff should be fixed at 12½ per cent. That request was withdrawn, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie moved a request for a duty of 5 per cent. on " fans for use in mines and factories," which, of course, came under the generic term of " machines and machinery n.e.i.". That motion was considered and negatived, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> submitted a request for a reduction of the duty to  12½  per cent. To all intents and purposes items 162 and 165 appear to be on the same footing. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee has already accepted that method of dealing with the question. Of course, it is perfectly open to raise the question on a later item, although to a certain extent it may be inconvenient. I admit at once that if it could be shown that the method taken- in. the first instance was absolutely wrong it would not justify us in adhering to a bad precedent. This, I repeat, is an entirely novel position in which we find ourselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has dissented from the ruling of the  Chairman  -  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is at liberty to move a new paragraph to paragraph 165a before that paragraph has been either disposed of or postponed. </para>

                <para>I assume that by the use of the word " postponed " is meant the fixing of the duty. The question comes in whether it is a matter of important substance or form which we are to deal with. If we send the Bill back to the other House with the proposal which has been submitted by Senator McColl, will it truly embody the opinion arrived at by the Committee while dealing with item  165a?  Clearly if that item were passed altogether we could not go back upon the position taken up except on a recommittal. I think that in the circumstances, and in view of the novelty of the position, and, further, in order that the Committee may be given the fullest possible opportunity within reasonable bounds to express its will and opinion, the ruling of the  Chairman  should be accepted </para>

                    <para>. - I have already explained that as the Government regard this item as a compromise, I shall be obliged to adhere to it. The proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is, I think, a little more serious than the honorable senator contemplates. He proposes to. single out one industry, and, in regard to it alone, not merely to exempt machine tools in the terms of item  166,  which applies to the whole of the machinery division of the Tariff, but also machinery used in this industry. I hope the honorable senator sees what an extraordinary innovation that would be. According to item  166,  it is. competent for machine tools used in any of the industries affected by this particular division to be exempt from duty, as prescribed by departmental by-laws. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wishes to go a step further than what we have hitherto provided for, and to say that machinery should be made free of duty under the same conditions as machine tools. I think that is an unreasonable proposal. Should it be carried it would be very difficult for the Committee to resist the application of a similar proviso to every other industry, and that might prove disastrous to what we are seeking to do in this division of the Tariff. It might result in largely nullifying the whole of our work in the imposition of protective duties on machinery. I wish honorable senators to realize the full import of the request which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has submitted. </para>

                    <para>.-I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council in the last remarks he has made has been trying to draw a red herring across the track. A very great number of machines are used in this industry, some of which can be made here whilst others cannot. The Committee does not desire to impose revenue duties on machinery that cannot be made here. It is impossible in this instance for us to say what machinery required in this industry can be made here and what cannot, and I propose, as we have done in connexion with other items in the Tariff, to leave it to the Customs authorities by by-law to determine which of these machines can be made here. I propose that under that* by-law the machinery that cannot be made here should be allowed to come in free, whilst the machinery that can be made here would be dutiable. The distinction sought to be raised between tools and machinery is simply absurd, because what would apply to one would apply to the other. </para>

Originally, the Government sought to make the duty 25 per cent., with a preference of 5 per cent, in favour of the. United Kingdom. The Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent. The Government were unsuccessful, after a vigorous fight, in securing the protection that they desired. Ultimately, it was agreed that 15 per cent, was a fair rate. I urge honorable senators to fall in with this reasonable protective duty. </para>

                    <para>. - My honorable friend is acting on wrong information. This subject was inquired into by the Tariff Commission, who recommended that the particular machines enumerated in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> request, of the sizes specified in the item, could be made in the Commonwealth, and therefore should be dutiable. Similar machines of other sizes are already free. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has evidently moved under the impression that the duty was not limited to machines of certain sizes. </para>

                    <para>.- I think it is undesirable to use in this item the words " cannot be reasonably manufactured within the Commonwealth." Those words cover the future as well as the present, and an industry might be handicapped because of the inability of the Parliament to declare that certain machinery could not be " reasonably " manufactured here. For a dozen reasons such machines might not be manufactured in the Commonwealth, and there might be half-a-dozen reasons why their manufacture within a reasonable time would be improbable. Surely, having set up a number of industries by means of protective duties, we do  not desire to retard their operations by refusing to admit free of duty, on the ground that two or three years must elapse before it can be manufactured here, the machinery required by them. I should like to substitute for the words " cannot be reasonably manufactured " the words " which are not being manufactured in the Commonwealth and as to which there is no probability of their being manufactured within a reasonable time." </para>

                    <para>. - The words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobsbn</inline> objects appear in the first Federal Tariff ; they have been agreed to by another place and are well known and recognised. They seem to give full discretion to Parliament to determine whether or not certain machinery should be free. If Parliament in the exercise of the wide discretion for which this item provides comes to the conclusion that certain machines or machine tools cannot be reasonably manufactured within the Commonwealth it has power to declare that they shall be admitted free. I hope that the honorable senator will not press his objection. </para>

Is it to consider lack of skill or want of opportunity or of capital? We may be able to make a cer tain machine in the Commonwealth, but the demand for it may not be sufficient to induce any one to erect the necessary plant. The words to which I have objected are most inappropriate. </para>

I might be in a better position than a member of the Government to put before Parliament the whole facts relating to the manufacture of certain machinery; but under this provision, I could not take action. It is true that I could submit a motion affirming the desirableness of action being taken by the Minister, but for various reasons, some months might elapse before such a motion could be dealt with. I recognise that the responsible Minister should have such a power as this ; but surely, if it is possible to avoid difficulty hereafter by substituting for the word " reasonably" a more suitable word, we ought to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The honorable senator, I am sure, recognises that it is one of the first principles of responsible government that the Ministry of the day shall have control of the administration. They must have particularly the control of the Department of Trade and Customs, and be intimately acquainted with what is necessary for its effective administration. The initiation of taxation at the instance of a private member would be a most alarming departure .from all parliamentary procedure. In the first place, a message from the Governor-General is necessary, and such a message is given by the Governor-General only on the advice of his Ministers. To attempt to take this matter out of the hands of the Government of the day, would be a complete departure from the procedure and practice of Parliament, and a nonrecognition of the due responsibilities of Ministers. The power of the Senate will not be limited under this provision. It will be competent for any honorable senator to move the adjournment of the Chamber in order to make a certain suggestion, or to move an abstract motion affirming the desirableness of admitting certain machinery free. The address must be passed by both Houses. So long as the _ Government possess the confidence of another place, where there is a majority of Ministers, it may be taken for granted that they will be in complete touch with the necessities as they may arise in the extraordinary circumstances that are set forth here. I would urge, therefore, that my honorable friend is mistaken in assuming that the Senate is limited by the use of these words. They are usual, and are in strict accordance with our ideas of responsible government. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  [5.50].  - It was refreshing, but at the same time astounding, to hear the declaration just made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. He urged that all taxation must be initiated by a Minister, and that it is utterly unconstitutional to propose any other course; but during the last few weeks he has, time and again, supported the efforts of private senators to initiate taxation.  His  action in doing so has been challenged, and now he himself admits the enormity of the offence. He decries that which he has done over and over again. However, as lie has pleaded guilty, if he will go and sin no more, like another historical character, I shall forgive him ; but his topsy-turvy conduct has been so extraordinary that, although I have been holding ray peace in the endeavour to get the Tariff disposed of rapidly, I cannot allow it to pass without comment. In the hope that he has offended for the last time, I shall vote with him on this occasion.

                    <para>. - The statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council raises a rather nice question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> has suggested that dutiable machinery or machine tools cannot be made free under item  167  unless a joint address is passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the motion of Ministers ; that an address so carried on the motion of private members would be of no effect. The Minister has replied that the right to initiate taxation cannot be taken from a Government without an expression of want of confidence in it. That is quite true, so far as the imposition of taxation is concerned; but questions as to when and how taxation should be remitted differ entirely from questions as to when and how it should be imposed. Ministries have been 'defeated over and over again in regard to proposals for the imposition of taxation ; but item  167  deals with the remission of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that it is different. If it were not, it would be difficult for a Parliament to remit taxation. Proposals for the imposition of taxation are always introduced on the responsibility of Ministers, who, if an attempt were made to interfere with this constitutional right, would resign. But here we are dealing with the remission of taxation, and we are asked to enact that, notwithstanding that both Houses of Parliament may declare for remission, a joint address to that effect is to be of no avail unless passed on the motion of Ministers. There might be a particular machine tool or piece of machinery Which it would be advantageous to admit free, and which Parliament might wish to admit free; but Ministers, acting on the advice of their departmental officers, might be opposed to any remission of duty </para>

When the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., a preferential rate in favour of Great Britain had not been suggested. Those who desire that preference be given to the Mother Country should vote for a duty of 25 per cent. on the general Tariff, to allow a margin for preference. I ask honorable senators not to do in this case what has been done in many other items, namely, make the rate under the general Tariff so low that it will not be possible to give a preference to British imports. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> enable me to make a point which ought to be made. They amount to this : that a preference cannot be given to Great Britain unless the rate against that country is sufficiently high to keep out her productions. I am pleased to have this opportunity to draw attention to the plain statement of the leader of the Socialist party, although the position has already been made clear by many of the votes which we have had. He has told us frankly that a preference is not to be given to Great Britain unless the general Tariff is made so high that a margin is given for a preferential rate which will still keep out her productions. The honor able senator is to be congratulated on having exploded much of the oratory expended by the Prime Minister at the recent Imperial Conference. </para>

The B section of that body recommended 15 per cent. This is purely a revenue impost.

                    <para>.- The duty proposed in respect of this paragraph is intended to be protective in its incidence, because the item includes a large number of articles which are being made in the Commonwealth. It includes safes and doors, fireproof and burglarproof, all manufactures of tinware, such as kettles, saucepans, basins, dish covers, and dozens of household articles, guttering and down pipes, galvanized iron work of all kinds, buckets, tubs, baths, (cast iron and galvanized), bath-heaters, metal castings of all kinds, cooking stoves and ovens, perforated metals, wirework in extensive variety, anvils, basins, bedcradles, bedsteads, washing-boards, bolts and barrels. As every one of these articles practically represents an industry existing in the Commonwealth, I intend to ask the Committee to restore the duty originally proposed by the Government in respect of this paragraph, namely, 30 per cent. </para>

If this article were used as a part of a fixture upon a portmanteau or trunk, it would be admitted free under " minor articles of manufacture." But when it is attached to straps, it will be dutiable under paragraph a of this' item as manufactures of metal n.e.i. Surely that is an absurdity. </para>

If a bagmaker were to inform the Customs authorities that it was an ordinary article of manufacture used in his business, I venture to say that they would admit it free. But because this comes in as a complete article, it is embraced in the all-swallowing item of manufactures of metals. I should not have brought this matter before the Committee, except as illustrating the position of scores of other articles. Bearing in mind that many of these things are not made here, the best that I can do is to strive for a reduction of the duty ; I cannot be expected to know every article included in the item, and, even if I did, the list would be interminable. </para>

                        <para>- What about cast-iron saucepans and other varieties of domestic weapons, which are not made here? I believe that dog chains and parrot chains are included in this item. The poor humble Australian bird has to wear a chain weighted with a duty of 25 per cent.. ! Is that fair to the unfortunate denizen of the Australian bush ? I understand that a very large variety of domestic ware comes under this item, and largely on that account, and not because of guttering and down pipes, do I ask for a reduction of the duty. I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said in respect to the little metal attachment, the importation of which gives work to our tanners, leather-makers and leather importers. I suppose we could scarcely enter a household without finding a number of articles which come under this item, and, seeing that these articles are not made here, they ought not, even from a protectionist stand-point, to be penalized. I find myself getting so demoralized, that I am positively using protectionist arguments in my effort to reduce the inordinate duties which are being heaped on the household requisites of Australia. I hope the request will be carried. </para>

                    <para>.- Amongst the articles embraced by this item are many of tinware, and we recognise that all the requirements in this connexion can be supplied locally. I should have no objection to offer if we had not been told by the Minister that it is proposed to make the duty even higher than it is at present. We have here involved, amongst other things, the bucket, and . the billycan, the latter of which is almost a national emblem of Australia. It is not easy for us to discuss this item without having before us a list of the articles affected. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has carefully read out a number of articles, every one of which is made here ; but he should have gone further and given some indication that the manufacture of billycans and similar articles had been threatened by importation in the past, or was threatened in the future. </para>

                        <para>- The billycan, as I have said, might be regarded as a national emblem ; and, moreover, the very circumstances have led to its natural production here. I suppose it was made here before a similar vessel was made in any part of the world, much, in the same way as was the Collins axe in America. It will be a matter, for regret if the Government carry out the idea of an increase of the duty. I suggest that tinware might, for the purposes of the Tariff, be separated from cast-iron ware, though I am not prepared to say exactly what should be the duty on each class of goods. </para>

It is an extraordinary mixture to have Milner's safes and pannikins, tin mousetraps and steel ladders, under the one item. If would be much more convenient to subdivide it. Some of us might agree with the Minister as to the duty on one class of articles, but not on the other. It would simplify the Tariff very much if the small household tin goods were covered generally by one paragraph, and the iron castings, Milner's safes, and other large manufactures of metal, by another. </para>

                    <para>. - What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> urges is almost impracticable. I have had considerable experience in these matters. I know we had comprehensive items of this kind in the Victorian Tariff, and the same thing, following past experience, has been done in the Federal Tariff. This item is . intended to be very comprehensive. While it includes domestic utensils such as have been mentioned, those are, speaking broadly, a comparatively small part of it. Speaking generally, perhaps more than half of it consists of various brass articles such as hinges and bolts, while it also includes articles the produce of foundries, such as all sorts of castings. It might be possible to differentiate as to particular classes of domestic utensils, but that would be a very small and incomplete classification. As to setting out a list of the articles which the paragraph includes, I could name fifty at the present moment, but the most experienced Customs officer could not make out a complete list of what the item is supposed to include. </para>

                        <para>- Tinware is made throughout the Commonwealth. We consider that there should be a duty of  30  per cent. on both tin and ironware, in order to give effective protection. I would gladly meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> if I could, but the item is very complicated, and it would be impossible to divide it into classes such as he suggests without very great care and consideration. It is a usual and recognised item in State and Commonwealth Tariffs, embracing all the things that are now included in it. </para>

                        <para>- I have produced one article, and challenge any one to say that it is being made in Australia. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> argument that they all ought to be made here was to determine all out acts on this Tariff, we need have had only one line in it - a fairly heavy duty on everything coming in - on the simple plea that if it is not made here it ought to be. That is reducing the thing to an absurdity. More attention ought to be paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway's</inline> suggestion, from the very fact that the Minister intends to ask the Committee to impose upon this multiplicity of articles a still higher duty, It might not be so serious if the duty were moderate. Are we, without knowing what is covered by the item, blindly to follow the Minister in making the duty higher still ? </para>

                        <para>- the only reason the Minister can give is that he wants a higher protection for some of the articles covered by the item. But as some are not made in Australia, and the duty upon them must be a purely revenue one, there is no sense, even from a protectionist stand-point, in blindly putting a higher duty upon things which are not made here, merely to give additional protection to things which are. It ought not to be necessary to put those who, like honorable senators opposite, wish to protect local industries, in the position that they must, to do what they want, also levy duty upon things which are not made here, and to that extent penalize the people who have to use them or manufacturers who require them in other industries. </para>

I do not pretend to know every article that is made or not made in Australia. But the Minister's question is intended to convey to the Committee the impression that there are not more than two articles covered by the item which are not made here. </para>

                        <para>- The peace of every homestead in the country will be absolutely disrupted if this Parliament ventures to stand between housewives and a reasonably priced flat-iron. I have mentioned already more than two articles covered by this item which are not made in Australia. It is a serious matter that we should be asked to tax many articles which are not made in Australia in order that we may also tax a number that are. The old story of the Chinaman burning down' his house to roast his pig is a mere circumstance compared with an item like this. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> does not favour taxing things which are not made here. He has throughout the debates on this Tariff consistently shown that he is averse to purely revenue duties, and a tax on an article which is not made here is nothing but a revenue duty. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> believes that everything can be made in Australia, and that a duty should be levied upon it, he should not have stood behind the Government on this Tariff. If those are his views, why did he agree to vary the rates? He has voted sometimes for 12 per cent., and sometimes for 15 per cent., 20 per cent., or 40 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- He never tried, not did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> try, for 40 per cent. in every case, because they recognise that different circumstances surrounding each trade require variations in duty. Does not the same principle apply here? Surely it is not necessary to impose the same duty upon a variety of articles of different type and character. A very reasonable subdivision of the item has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> There is a marked difference in the amount of labour involved in, and in all the circumstances surrounding, the making of tinware and of any of the iron articles which are now imported. I do not wish to delay the Committee in arriving at a decision ; but I certainly protest against a drag-net item of this kind. How many articles it covers we do not know, nor do we even know the particular class of goods which it covers. We know, however, that much labour is employed in manufacturing some articles, and very little labour in making others. Yet we are asked to levy the same duty asa protective duty on certain classes of goods, and as a revenue duty on others. I ask honorable senators, whether they are free-traders or protectionists, to see if it is not possible to secure a better classification than that which is contained in the item. </para>

                        <para>- The usual argument which is brought forward by my honorable friends opposite is, that imported goods compete with locally-made goods, and that, therefore, the latter do not get a fair show. In this case, that excuse cannot be made, because the fact is that if a man wants a good reliable safe, such as Milner's or Chubb's, he has to pay perhaps £60, as against from£10 to £20 for an Australian made safe. The latter article also enjoys a high natural protection in the heavy freight on safes from the Old Country. There is not a large business concern in Australia which does not use an imported safe. There is not a single instance in which the States Governments do not keep important documents in a Chubb or Milner safe. The Australian safe has not to compete with a cheap article. It is improbable  that the higher classes of safes will be made in Australia for many years to come.. My honorable friends on the other side would be astonished at the degree of skill and experience required to put together first-class fire and burglar resisting safes. I look upon this item in respect of safes as. nothing more or ' less than a. revenue item. With some knowledge of the conditions under which safes are made, I say, advisedly, that first-class safes cannot be made in Australia, nor is it probable that they will be made here for many years to come. Throughout England and Europe there are not more than perhaps half-a-dozen manufacturers whose safes are considered thoroughly reliable by those who have large interests to conserve. On behalf of the commercial community, and others who absolutely require -these important articles in connexion with the conduct of their businesses,- I protest against the imposition of this extraordinary duty. From safes we pass to stew-pans, which are an absolute necessity in every household. I question also if there is a single household in which that simple article called " scissors " is not used. We all know the variety of uses to which it is put, and yet it is liable to a duty of 25 per cent. No one will contend that scissors are made here. I suppose that hundreds of thousands of them are imported every year. In every household they are to be found lying on the table. From scissors we pass to rattraps. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friend had any knowledge of the conditions existing in Sydney and Brisbane during the last few years, he would realize the value of rat-traps. I doubt if any article has been found to be more necessary for maintaining the health of the people of Sydney than have rat-traps. They are to be found in every house. In. Sydney, a premium was offered for every rat which was caught, and from the considerable sum which was paid honorable senators can imagine that a large number of rats were caught. The Minister has mentioned nuts and bolts as being included in this item. These, too, are articles required in every household. They are stocked in every little hardware shop, and used throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Not a great quantity of them is made in Australia. I may tell the honorable senator that there are nuts and bolts which it would be very difficult to make here. Yet these articles, which are used in. every household, are subjected to a heavy duty. The item also includes cheap spoons, corkscrews, flat-irons, and tacks;- in fact, it is almost impossible to conceive how many articles are comprised in this hotchpotch. So far as I can see, it includes not only articles which it is impossible to make here, but also articles which may be made here, but not for many years to come. How the Minister can possibly include in this item such important articles as Milner's, Chubb's, and other safes, and the smaller articles which are in daily use, I cannot understand. There appears to be no affinity between the articles at all. I think that the honorable senator might adopt the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> and differentiate between the articles. If he were to take articles of tinware and other. articles of a small character, we should know how to vote. The Vice-President of the Executive Council should give the Committee a little more detailed information as to the articles covered by this item, so that honorable senators may know what they are asked to vote upon. Whilst I am prepared to assist in passing the Tariff, the Vice-President of the Executive Council must accept some responsibility if its passage is delayed, when he asks honorable senators to increase duties which, as agreed to by another place, are, in the opinion of many, already too high. With the exception of one or two articles, such as safes, I believe that almost' the whole of the imports covered by this 'item would be used by the poorer classes of the people. I wish to say something on the subject of patterns. I do not know whether the patterns required in various trades and manufactures are included in this item, but if they are I would like to ask whether the Minister realizes what the effect must be. In shipbuilding and the manufacture of all kinds of machinery patterns are essential. Every manufacturer in Australia .must he convinced of the importance of being able to obtain readily the patterns he requires? Even the tailor requires to be able to obtain his printed pattern as cheaply as possible. The Government propose to impose an absolute tax of 25 per cent, upon patterns which' are absolutely essential to the progress and development of a variety of commercial undertakings carried on throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Minister will give honorable senators an opportunity to vote for duties on the articles included in the item differently grouped. 'For instance, item 170B makes articles made entirely from aluminium for household use dutiable at 5 per cent. Why should articles made from aluminium be specially singled out? , Why should we not be given an opportunity to decide the duty to be imposed upon articles required for household use from whatever material they may happened to be manufactured? I should be prepared to vote for one duty on articles required for household use, and another on safes and such articles. Perhaps it would be well to postpone the consideration of the item now under discussion until honorable senators generally know, as well as does the Vice-President of the Executive Council, what if covers. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> that he is mistaken in saying that fireproof and burglar-proof safes are not made in Australia. Their manufac.ture was started in Western Australia by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makutz</inline> eight or ten years ago under a 5 per cent, duty, and it is now carried on successfully. The safes locally manufactured are by many people preferred to imported safes. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I am not in favour of a higher duty on safes, whilst I believe there should be a very low duty, or no duty at all, on articles required entirely for household use. If we take articles of tinware, for instance, I should say that we have been manufacturing such articles for household use long enough in the Commonwealth .to be able to compete with the world in their manufacture. I ' hope. that the Minister will be prepared to re-group the articles covered by the item. </para>

                    <para>.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council must see that a number of honorable senators are very much opposed to the high duty proposed in connexion with this item. I wish him to appreciate the shock which some of us' received when he spoke of submitting a request to raise the duty at the first opportunity. I was rather alarmed by the statement, and the Minister would shorten the debate if he explained why he proposes that the duty should be raised, when almost every member of the Committee objects to the present duty as too high, and desires that there should be some differentiation between articles required for domestic purposes in every cottage home in the Commonwealth, and other articles covered by the item. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> has just made an excellent suggestion, and very properly wishes to know why, in the case of articles for household use, an exception should be made in regard to articles made entirely of aluminium. I direct the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to a list of articles referred to in a letter quoted in another place, bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> The honorable gentleman did .not give the name qf the writer of the letter, but he made a point of saving- </para>

Fancy every man who carries on a little industry, if he wants to have a block and pulley, having to pay  25  per cent. ! The tools of trade of other persons are to be let in free, whilst blocks and pulleys are to be taxed. I should not like to say that these things cannot be made here, but if we go on year after year having to import them, there is reasonable ground for assuming that they will not be made here. It is not a question of " cannot " but of " are not." I suggest that we should free all goods made from metals which are required for domestic use in every home in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- If the Ministerial phonograph would keep quiet for a little while we should be able to get on better ; but the honorable senator is charged to the brim - as far as a phonograph can be charged. He is in himself the sum of human knowledge and almost of human misery in regard to this Tariff. It only requires any one to touch the wire to set the machine going, and when it starts one cannot stop it. I have listened to appeals in respect of flat-irons, cow-bells, and other things, and I have on my own account made a list of a few matters in response to the Minister's challenge to my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that he could not name two articles in this list that are not made in the Commonwealth. Of course, to say that they cannot be made in Australia is to talk childish trivialities, because, as there is no limit to the possibilities of time and expenditure, it is impossible to say that anything cannot be made here. We might even find a sensible Minister evolved in the process of Australian development. Even that is a thing that I look forward to as a remote possibility. I think that reference has been made to the humble, but very necessary, cast-iron saucepan. These goods are not made in Australia. But what about the cast-iron frying pan and the cast-iron grilling apparatus? Those articles are imported also. By the way, before the dinner adjournment, the Minister was very strong on downpipes and guttering as being only little matters of zinc or tinware. But since dinner he has risen in the scale. He is now eloquent on brass candlesticks, which also appear to come within this item. No doubt they do ; and I can suggest another article for the Minister's consideration - cast-iron shoe scrapers. They are not made in Australia; they are im  ported. And what about iron hat and umbrella stands, which also are not made :.in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I am only talking about what is, not what may be. This particular industry has been singled out for special attention, of an agreeable character, no doubt, to the proprietor. It is well known that his business is advertised all over the country by means of imported enamelled signs. They are to come in under this heading. I do not so much object to enamelled signs coming under ' it, but I point out that, at any rate, this is another reply to the Minister's challenge to us to name good's that are not made in Australia. The Minister has now been supplied, not with a few articles, but with a list of about two dozen, that come in under .this heading. I- could go on enumerating them ; there is a large number that could be readily named. But the Minister has met the demand for a reduction by the threat of an increase. I complain that no Minister has a right to threaten the Committee in any such manner. </para>

                        <para>- We have been so long dealing with this Tariff, and the Minister and his whip- or his phonograph - have taken up so much time, that we have nearly forgotten many things that have happened. The particular item that the Minister has threatened to raise is down at 25 per cent., and I have moved a reduction to 20 per cent., being the rate recommended by the Minister's own colleagues on the Tariff Commission. When I say his colleagues, I mean those members of the Commission who share his own fiscal faith. But I think we may as well have a quorum present. The Government supporters have cleared out. Even the phonograph has disappeared. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.']</inline> As the Minister is a protectionist, one would think that he would be interested in the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. They only recommended 20 per cent. Now the Minister is threatening 30 per cent. The free-trade section of this unfortunate Commission recommended 15 per cent. I call them " unfortunate ' ' from the stand-point that their recommendations' are being used in an utterly battledoor and shuttlecock manner, as, I am sure, the recommendations of no . Tariff Commission in any part of the world have ever been treated. They are one moment trotted out by the Minister as an argument, and are ignored by him on the very next item. I do not know what the Minister's colleagues in another place think of his conduct in over and over again setting aside by his votes the arrangements that have been entered into elsewhere by the  Government. I say, with a complete absence of heat and with a freedom from any personal unfriendliness, that this is the most extraordinary procedure that has ever been countenanced in a British Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not attempt either to go behind the ruling of the  Chairman  or the well-known parliamentary rule that prohibits quotations from debates in another place. But within the last few hours I have had brought under my notice a most positive contradiction of what the Minister has just asserted in his challenge to me. These very duties were agreed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> colleagues elsewhere. He is now proposing to go back on what his own colleagues assented to publicly, and to demand a higher duty. I do not suppose that the honorable senator will support my request, but I hope that he will at least avoid the serious error of proposing such a request as he has indicated, assuming that he gets the chance.I am hopeful that my request, which is certainly most reasonable, will be assented to, and that this multitude of domestic articles may be introduced into Australia at no higher rate of duty than obtained under the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - During the course of the debate we shall probably obtain from the Vice-President of the Executive Council a statement as to what are and what are not covered by this very wide drag-net item. I wish to know, in the first place, whether roll shells, which are used for crushing ores by almost every mining company in Australia, are included in it. </para>

                        <para>- That, I think, is too high a duty to impose upon them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> read a list of household necessities which are included in this item, and if the Minister persists in moving the request which he has indicated, there will be a direct attempt to put some of those articles on the free list. I am somewhat astonished at the attempt on the part of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to renew, so to speak, a struggle which we thought had been satisfactorily settled in another place. What can be his reason for asking for a higher duty, seeing that his colleague in charge of the Tariff in another place was forced to consent to a lower rate ? Why should he say, " We shall have the duty which my colleague in another place originally proposed?" </para>

                        <para>- Considering that one of his own supporters is in the same fog as most of us are in, the Vice-President of the Executive Council is scarcely doing justice to the Opposition when he interjects so sharply as he has just done. The more we analyze this item the more its drag-net character is exposed. It includes such things as door bolts, gate latches, cast-iron saucepans, boilers, corkscrews, fenders, fire-irons, and glue-pots. Almost everything in use in the household is being taxed. Many of the articles covered by the item will not be manufactured in Australia for many years. Our population is so small that it would not pay any one to put down the necessary plant. Many of these things are being manufactured, not in tens, but in hundreds of thousands, and, apparently, not one-half of them will, or can, be made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If the Vice-President of the Executive Council desires the duty to be increased, it must be either because he wishes to encourage or stimulate the manufacture of these articles in Australia, or because he wants to secure more revenue. My reply to the first of these contentions would be that not one- fourth of the articles covered by the item are likely to be made for years in Australia, while, if the increased duty is desired in order to secure more revenue, my answer is that the Tariff is yielding enough without the imposition of this increased tax on almost every household. </para>

                        <para>- It is nothing short of it. The argument that these things can be made in Australia is more or less fallacious. We can, of course, make anything if we like to pay for it. We could, for instance, make diamonds, but  any man who started their manufacture here would be regarded as more or less of an idiot, and would be advised to search the drifts, where diamonds and other precious stones may be found. Then, again, we might liquefy gas, but it would not pay to erect the necessary plant ' in Australia. The cry, " These can be made in Australia," is more or less absurd, and is being used for the very worst purpose of protection - to carry duties up to the point of prohibition. </para>

                        <para>- Under the guise of a certain species of patriotism to cover up the appeal for such high duties. I thought that the spirit of " made in  Australia  " disappeared some time ago when the item of kerosene was under consideration. In that case we were perfectly willing, within . a certain limitation, to help an article which could be produced in Australia, but it was determined by the majority that kerosene should be free. That being so, why should we impose a heavy duty in respect- of any goods that are not made within the Commonwealth ? The item, represents something more than fiscal hypocrisy, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council will have considerable difficulty in inducing the Committee to request an increased duty. He will be very fortunate if the Committee agrees to the rate passed by the House of Representatives. But if he obstinately refuses to explain how the duty will operate, and insists upon asking for an increase, it is possible that some of us may compile a list of the articles in common use in every household,' with a view to discussing whether each or all of them should or should not be made free. Just as we have been warranted in putting on the free list tools of trade, so shall we be warranted in similarly treating articles which are household necessaries. . I see no reason for any differentiation. So far from allowing the Vice-President of the Executive Council to have his way, if he presses his proposals, he will have to resist a very strong movement to get the duty reduced, or altogether removed. </para>

                        <para>- I see that paragraph  a  of item  176  makes side plates and balls for ball mills dutiable at  5  per cent, under the general Tariff, and free if imported from Great Britain, and my purpose is to reduce the taxation on all these parts, so as to lessen the cost of the machinery used in the reduction of ores. In "such machinery as Krupp ball mills, Griffin mills, Chilian mills, and grit mills, there is great wear and . tear of certain steel parts. Only two or three firms in the world make a specialty of the production of hardened steel parts to be used as linings' for such mills. The evidence taken before the Tariff Commission shows that the steel substitutes produced, in Australia do' not last one-fourth as long. It is a rather serious matter to stop a mill treating between  10,000  and  17,000  tons of ore a. month, and I  wish to make free the steel linings of such mills, which cannot satisfactorily be produced in Australia. It is not my desire to do anything to interfere with the local steel industry. I think that my proposal, if agreed to, will encourage it, by keeping going a larger amount of' machinery, and therefore giving greater employment to the local works. The local manufacturers of iron and steel recognise that they cannot turn out suitable linings for these mills, and that the request, if agreed to, will benefit them, because it will enable propositions which are now almost on the point of shutting down to keep working. 1 shall not speak at greater' length On this subject, because we have already had so much debate on such trifles as pans, saucepans, and curling tongs. </para>

It is clear that the parts referred to are not made here, and the policy of the Government is . to allow the free introduction of such things as cannot be locally produced. I therefore accept the request, subject to such modifications as on further consideration may appear necessary . </para>

                        <para>- I think I can show that it is quite wrong. In framing a Tariff our aim should be to group, as far as possible, like articles together. Clearly this item, which relates to manufactures of metal, has no special reference to mining machinery. But there is an item in the Tariff which specially refers to that class of machinery and to the particular portions with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wishes to deal. I refer to item 176, which includes earth and rock-cutting machinery, smelting, leaching and metal refining appliances, rotary and percussive rock drills, coal-cutting machines, side plates, and balls for ball mills. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that item 170 relates to manufactures of metal, but does not cover mining machinery generally. It includes a number of miscellaneous articles to which previous reference has been made. The draftsman of the Tariff showed very clearly where he thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> proposal ought to be incorporated. Mining appliances more nearly approach to the subject-matter of his proposal than do such articles as flat-irons and corkscrews amongst which he proposes to group them. </para>

                        <para>- So is a rock-boring machine and a coal-cutting machine. For the better classification of the Tariff I think that the honorable senator's proposal should be submitted when item 176 is under consideration. The duty proposed in respect of paragraph e of that item is 5 per cent. under the general Tariff, whilst goods from the United Kingdom are admitted free. When that paragraph comes under consideration I intend to move that the articles enumerated in it shall be made free all round. The duty of 5 per cent. is clearly not a protective impost. The Vice-President of the Executive Council must recognise that the opposition to this proposal springs largely from a knowledge that he intends to move for an increase of the duty. I therefore ask him to definitely state his intentions and also the reasons why he proposes to ask for an increased duty. </para>

                    <para>. - Under ordinary circumstances there is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> proposal should have been submitted when this item was under consideration, inasmuch as it relates to manufactures of metal. But if adopted it is obvious that it. will mainly, if not entirely, apply to mining machinery. In that case the words " side plates and balls for ball mills " will require to be eliminated. So that for the purposes of grouping, his proposal might with more advantage be included in item 176. Of course in framing the Tariff it is very desirable that we should group like articles' together, and I therefore suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should withdraw his proposal and submit it when item 176 is under consideration. </para>

But I would point out that if it be included in item 176 there will still remain in item 170 a large quantity of mining machinery of an inferior character. For instance, manganese parts containing a lower proportion of manganese than 7 per cent., will still fall under that item. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it would be better to have as many of the articles used in the mining industry as possible under item 176, so that those who have to refer to the schedule may know where to put their finger on anything they want. It would therefore he better if the Government would undertake to frame under item 176 other paragraphs than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has referred to, taking out the machinery that comes under this heading, and putting it all together under the one main head, with each article itemized in separate paragraphs according to the rate of duty. There are many different kinds of steel, varying in the quantity* of manganese or other hardening substances contained in them, used in connexion with mining, and no matter what  the duty is they should be as much as possible under one main heading. The schedule, if it is reframed in that way, will be much more creditable to us when it leaves our hands than it will be if we deal with one section of these articles under item 170, and with another under item 176. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister and a number of other strong protectionists on the other side say that manganese steel cannot be made here. It can be made here, is made here, and is used here. But it is not hard enough, and wears out too soon. Those who have the benefit of high protection argue that the higher the duty is made the better the article they can produce; but there are various proportions of manganese in different steels, and some steels are made by people who have a secret process. That referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is one of those, and I shall support his request. That made here, although used for the same purposes, is not sufficiently hard or tough. At the very least, five plates of steel liners made here will wear out as against three of this special kind. But I cannot allow the statement to pass unchallenged that manganese steel liners are not made in, Australia. On many occasions the Vice-President of the Executive Council has refused to accept any proposal which comes from this side of the Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. - What the" Minister has stated is perfectly true. A few days ago I discussed the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the Minister, who, before we had spoken very long, said he was prepared to accept an amendment of this kind. Therefore, the complaintof <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> that if the proposal had come from the Opposition side the Minister would not have accepted it, is wide of the mark. Manganese steel containing 7 per cent. of manganese is not made in Australia. There is manganese in every kind of steel made, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> proposes to exempt only steel containing 7 per cent of that substance. The only difficulty is in the satisfactory definition of the chemical parts of the steel. There are many articles I should like to see imported which are used for the same purposes, but I cannot see how we can arrive, as 1 have already said, at a satisfactory definition. I understand, however, that the present request meets with general acceptance, and I regard it as the most feasible proposition. </para>

                    <para>. -  The leader of the Opposition asked that I should take an opportunity to make an explanation in regard to the proposal to increase the duty on this item. I would gladly have done so at an earlier stage, only the  Chairman  would, no doubt, have ruled me out of order. If it is the desire of the Committee that I should make an explanation, I do not hesitate to do so. Having already circulated a request, I think it only fair to state what my intention is, not by way of threat, but by way of information. It may be remembered that in the old Tariff manufactures of metals included not only the items to which I have already referred in a general way, such as cast-iron pillars, parts of machinery imported separately, and so forth, but also brasswork and gun-metal for general engineering and plumbing and other trades. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and thereupon the Government made a separate  item.  The duty has been in working operation since the  8th  August, and I have to frankly tell the Committee that it is quite impossible for the two items, for the purposes of satisfactory administration, to be separated. As honorable senators know, the very same articles are made from iron, steel, . and brass. An invoice comes out in the usual way describing the contents of the case, and simply referring to them as hinges, bolts, and so forth; there is no indication whatever as to what these articles are made of. The result is that there has been caused most serious friction, irritation, and annoyance, and in a large number of cases expense which previously had not to be met. In view of this experience, the question was whether to reduce the duty on brasswork, which was specially recommended by the Tariff Commission to be  30  per cent., to  25  per cent., or to increase the duty on the item  170,  paragraph  a,  to  30  per cent. When I said that the duty had been in operation since the  8th  August last I was slightly incorrect, because there has been a differentiation of duty since  29th  November. But these articles must be put on the same level, and if the Committee decide that the duty on the present item shall not be increased beyond  25  per cent., it will be my duty when we reach the item of brasswork to move that the impost be reduced to the same figure, so as to prevent future annoyance and irritation. That is frankly and honestly the position of affairs. When I urge a duty of  30per  cent. I am not urging unreasonable protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft,</inline> the leader of the Opposition, and others have contended that there should be some exemption in favour of domestic utensils. I have been thinking that matter over, and although I have been charged with obstinacy time after time, I am anxious to meet honorable senators so far as I reasonably can. I have made inquiry as to how far the duty on these goods could be regarded from a merely revenue aspect, and, under the circumstances, I think it a fair suggestion that kitchen utensils made from cast iron, tinned' - which will include pans, kettles, gridirons, fryingpans and so forth - should be placed on the free list. In regard to the balance I urge that the protectionist duty of 30 per ' cent, might be granted. I have frankly placed the matter before honorable senators, and in the event of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> request being defeated I shall move a request that the duties be 30 and 25 per cent, instead of as at present 25 and 20 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I am obliged to the Minister for having so promptly responded to my appeal to take the Committee into his confidence, both as to what he proposes to do, and his reasons therefor. But whilst I appreciate his action in the matter, I cannot quite draw the same conclusions from the facts submitted as . he apparently does. If I understand the position aright, he says that it has been found, by actual experience extending over some months, that it is difficult, if not impossible, for the Customs officials to discriminate between the items which probably come under the head of brassware and those which come under the more general item of manufactures of metals. I can quite believe that, and  up to that point my honorable friend and I are quite in agreement. But if we are to bring the two items into one, for practically that is what it means, the question is - What duty ought to be placed on the amalgamated Items? The Minister at once assumes that in order to ease the administration we have necessarily to raise the duty on one item to the level of the higher duty on the other item. That is something gained, but it is extremely difficult to say what will be the value of the goods to be exempted. That is impossible for the honorable senator to say, and the Committee can hardly expect him to be in possession of "the information. But, leaving that aside for a moment, he laid great .stress upon the recommendation of the Tariff Commission with regard to brassware. Surely he is entitled to attach equal importance to its recommendation on articles embraced in manufactures of metal. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">If its recommendation on one item is entitled to any respect, its recommendation on another item is entitled to. equal weight. It did recommend a duty of 39 per cent, on brassware, but a duty of only 20 per cent; on manufactures of metal. If the Minister is under an obligation' to follow the recommendation with regard to brassware, a corresponding obligation is upon him to follow the recommendation with regard  to ordinary manufactures of metal. I suggest to him that there were open to him two courses which, if adopted, would hardly have invited criticism. One would have been to split the difference between the duties on the two items. I am not saying that even then the duty would have been acceptable to freetraders, but, at any rate, it would have shown a desire on the part- of the Minister not to use the difficulty of administering the two items as an excuse for getting a higher impost on one item, if he had taken a duty half-way between that imposed on brassware and that set out against item 170. The duty on brassware is 30 per cent., and the duty on manufactures of metal, which I take to be a much more important and larger item, is 20 per cent. By what system of logic can it be shown that, in order to secure a uniform rate on the two items, it is necessary to raise the lower duty to the level of the higher duty ? Surely, if the honorable senator merely wished to get over the difficulty of administration, he would have taken the half-way course, and proposed a uniform duty of 25 per cent. Had he done so, it would have largely disarmed criticism. Honor.abale senators, whether they thought that duty too high or not, would have understood the position of the Department. But it seems to me that, not having taken that course, the Minister is using the difficulty of administration as - a lever to raise the lower duty on item. 170 to the level of the higher duty on item 172. He can hardly, expect honorable senators on this side to indorse a proposition of that kind. It was open to him to bring down the duty on brasswork to the level of the duty on the other item. Knowing his fiscal views, I do not expect him to do that. If the only reason for doing what he is proposing is to smooth administration, we have- a right to ask that he should bring down the higher duty and raise the lower duty. But" there was no need to do either. He could have split the difference and proposed a duty of 25 per cent, on each item. It is clear,;  however, that he is not prepared to do that. All the weight which he seeks to attach to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission goes for naught. Because of the other item, he frankly discards it. If he is prepared to discard it there, it is useless for him to turn round and pretend that he is guided by it. . I do not know whether honorable senators know what the recommendation in its entirety was. It was not merely that a duty of 30 per cent. should be placed on manufactures of brassware, but that an export duty of 15 per cent. should be placed on exports of scrap copper, scrap gun-metal, scrap brass, scrap zinc, scrap German silver, scrap nickel silver, and spent cartridge cases. In view of the tremendous weight which the Minister has attached to the recommendation, and remembering how he has used it, not merely in regard to brassware, but also as a lever to raise the duty on tinware and ironware, if he believes that it is so infallible that it ought to be followed, I should like to know whether the Government intend to carry it out in its entirety ? </para>

                        <para>- That is equivalent to saying that the honorable senator accepts the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, not because of its value, but because it suits the Government's purpose. They discard a portion of the recommendation. If they had approached this question firmly believing that the Tariff Commission, after its investigation, was the best body to recommend a course of action to be taken, they would have accepted the recommendation in its entirety. But they discard a portion which maybe like the keystone of the arch. It is idle for the Minister to pretend that he attaches weight to the recommendation at all. He selects a part of it and discards the rest. He selects merely that part which enables him not to give effect to the recommendation regarding brassware, but to get a higher duty on tinware and ironware. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff Commission recommended a .  duty of 20 per cent. on manufactures of metal, and it may be assumed that they referred to manufactures of tin and iron. It looks as if the higher duty on brassware was to be used as a lever to raise the duty on manufactures of metals 10 per cent. over and above that recommended by the Tariff Commission. That does not appear to me to be at all fair. I can only repeat that the Minister seems to be using the plea of departmental convenience as a lever to induce the Committee to increase the duty on iron and tin manufactures of metal. While he makes this plea, the honorable senator suggests that it is because of the great regard he has for the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but when we know that the Commission recommended 20 per cent., and the Minister now asks the Committee to make the duty 30 per cent., we can safely disregard his plea. I am entitled to assume as I do, that what the Minister desires is not the adoption of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, but an increase in the duty. The Tariff Commission's report is only referred to by the honorable senator when it can be used to support an increase in the duty proposed, I, of course, believe that the duties on both these item; should be lower than those proposed, but I ask the Committee to recognise the absolute fairness of the suggestion I make. The Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent. on iron and tinware, and30 per cent. on brassware; the mean between these is 25 per cent., and if it is necessary to put the two items together, there is no reason why the strongest protectionist should not be prepared to agree to both being made dutiable at 25 per cent. If the Minister had adopted this course, he would have disarmed criticism from this side, be  cause the proposal would have commended itself to honorable senators as an effort to solve the difficulty of administration. As things are, the honorable senator is fairly open to the charge of using that difficulty for the purpose of increasing the duty recommended by the Tariff Commission. In view of the reason offered by the Minister., I shall not lay much stress upon an interjection he made earlier in the evening, but I still think it desirable to refer to it. The honorable senator challenged any one to say where he had departed from any proposal agreed to by his colleague. This is one of the cases in connexion with which the challenge may be fairly taken up. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will remember that I commenced these observations by saying that, in view of the reasons which the honorable senator has given, they would be rendered to some extent unnecessary, but I still thought it desirable to point out that one of the honorable senator's colleagues elsewhere had approved of the duty proposed in connexion with this item. I should be content to drop the subject if it were not that the Vice-President of the Executive Council, by shaking his head, appears to deny the statement, and there is no denying the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne accepted item 170, as it stands, without protest. As a matter of fact, it was adopted as it stands at that honorable gentleman's suggestion. The Vice President of the Executive Council may be justified in departing from an item to which his colleague agreed, but it will be idle for him in future to pretend that there has not been one occasion on which he has invited the Committee to depart from an item accepted by his colleague elsewhere. I ask honorable senators to say whether the suggestion I have made is not reasonable and fair. I think that a duty of 25 per cent. would more than amply protect both industries concerned, and the suggestion, if adopted, would afford a straightforward means of overcoming the difficulty referred to by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the Minister to refer to household utensils of cast-iron and tin. Apparently, it is now proposed to make this concession in respect only of articles of cast-iron that have a coating of tin, and then only in respect of such articles as would come under the description of. kitchen utensils. If that' be so, the whole thing is so narrowed down that it is not worth while to make the discrimination suggested. The ordinary castiron article, such as forms the bulk of the articles used, is not to come in, but the superior tinned article is to be favoured. </para>

The Minister proposes to make a certain section of goods free.

I have seen a great number of goods such as are used for camps, and I never saw one that was tinned. But the Minister proposes that the superior goods shall come in free, whilst those used by the prospector, and in the homes of the poor, should be taxed at  30  per cent. I hope that the Committee will not agree to any such proposal. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>
                    (New South Wales)  [10.10].  - The proposal of the Minister is a breach of faith with his colleague in another place. The duty in the Tariff was voluntarily suggested by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                    Lyne.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has not explained his attitude, and, what is more, he cannot. He ought to explain it to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                    Lyne. We have arrived at a condition of affairs in the development of this Tariff conspiracy that seems to require a little exposition. The measure was introduced in one form in another place, where it was voluntarily amended by the Minister in charge, and agreed to. It was then introduced in the Senate in its altered form, and we now find the Minister going back on his own Bill, on his own colleague, and on another place, in a manner that is unwarrantable, and without precedent in the history of any decently-conducted Legislature.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    may laugh, but he cannot do . it as well as the laughing jackass. However well he is able to laugh, he can be outshone by another Australian native. It is not a decent thing to laugh over. There is such a thing as honour in connexion with the transaction of public business; but we are not in this instance getting a specimen of it. We are not getting a specimen of Ministerial decency. We may have a specimen of Ministerial hilarity, but in connexion with responsible Government there is room for something more than cackling. I certainly most strongly object to the proposed increase of this duty - a duty which is designed, as admitted by the Minister tonight, to strike at the commonest necessities of the poorest household. That is the object of the taxing Ministry; the Ministry that is scrambling for some untoward, unexplained, and devious purpose, for additional taxation. I suppose we shall find out by-and-by what particular form of Ministerial outrage lies behind the present proposal. We see it now as a request for an increase of 5 per cent., but whatever it is from the Ministerial point of view, from the public point of view it is a scandal. It is one of those proposals which no Ministry ought to father, and which no Legislature ought to indorse. The smallest, commonest, cheapest, and most necessary adjunct's of the poorest cottage home, the miner's tent, or the prospector's camp, are to be struck at by a Ministry that agreed publicly to a certain duty, and now, because they have a servile majority in another place, are playing fast and loose with the taxation of the people and the decency of public life.

                    <para>. - It is scarcely to be expected that I or any one else who has paid attention to the progress of the Tariff will consent, without a protest, to the action that the Minister is now taking. The Tariff came to us with a proposal to levy a duty of  25  per cent on this item on manufactures of metal n.e.i. The Vice-President of the Executive Council now seeks to carry a request to raise the duty to  30  percent. , and once more there is thrown on the Opposition the obligation to defend the Minister's own Bill from his own attacks. A more extraordinary position was never presented in this or any other deliberative assembly. If the Minister in charge of a Bill has any responsibility at all, it is to endeavour to get his Bill through as reasonably near the form in which it was first introduced as possible. When the Minister just now gave us the reason for  his desire to increase this duty, I, being non-suspicious, naturally accepted it at its face value. But since I have given the proposal consideration, and have recalled what has transpired here, I feel that I have a right to ask myself whether it is any part of the settled policy which the Minister has set up for himself, namely, to get the Senate to undo the work of the House of Representatives by putting the Tariff into the position in which it was when introduced by the Treasurer. The Minister is trying to have duties which were reduced increased to the original rates. To tell us that he does this because of some difficulty which has been discovered in administration is merely to use an accident as a lever by which to effect his obvious purpose. It is not ordinarily the part of an Opposition to defend a Ministerial measure, but as this unfortunate Tariff has been so ill-treated by its Ministerial father, we must extend to it a protecting hand. I should have no hesitation, merely because the House of Representatives had come to a certain decision, about taking a contrary course if I felt justified in doing so, but if theCommittee aid the Government in this matter, a special responsibility will rest upon it, and especially upon that section of it which supports the Government generally. The Ministerial party in this Chamber is a negligible quantity, unable without the assistance of the Labour Party to affect divisions. The course taken by the Labour Party in this matter may be sound and wise, but I wish to impress upon them and upon the people that they will be responsible for the ultimate form of the Tariff. They have not shown why the duty on household necessaries should be increased to 30 per cent., and, as they claim to specially represent the poorer section of the community, I ask them to carefully consider the matter before voting for this proposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft,</inline> evidently instructed by the Government, proposes to exempt from taxation kitchen requisites used in the houses of the wealthy. </para>

                        <para>- There is actually a very considerable difference between kitchen requisites and household requisites. The first proposal was to exempt household requisites, but that has been whittled down by the substitution of"kitchen" for " household" and the introduction of the words "cast iron tinned." I hope that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> insists on helping the Government to increase the duty to 30 per cent., he will agree to a wider list of exemptions. </para>

As a matter of fact, the entire item was agreed to without division. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was therefore quite right in saying that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has run away from his Bill. He has done more - he has run away from his "pal," and wishes to do more than his pal could get done elsewhere. What was the Treasurer's reason for abandoning his proposal at the very first breath of opposition? If he really desired such a high impost, and it was vital to his financial scheme, why did he not fight strenuously for it? But the records of the debate in another place show- </para>

                        <para>- In an important debate which took place elsewhere, the Minister responsible for the framing of the Tariff submitted a proposal to levy a duty of 35 per cent. upon this item. We know, as a matter of fiscal history, that that impost was reduced. The Vice-President of the Executive Council now wishes to make the duty 30 percent. Such a tax is a remarkably heavy one to levy upon articles which are an absolute necessity in every household. Under the pressure of criticism, it is very clear that that section of the Committee which possesses all the power in this Chamber, but is saddled with no responsibility, is becoming uneasy, and that its members are beginning to hedge. As indicative of how they are hedging, it is significant that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has intimated, either directly or indirectly, that he will eliminate from this item cast-iron tinnedutensils.I think he is fairly open to the accusation that he declines to adopt any suggestion made by honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber, notwithstanding the weight of reason which may be behind it, whereas the moment a suggestion is made by those honorable senators upon whose votes the political existence of the Government depends he does not care one straw what his colleague did in another place. In acting in that way he is not treating the Opposition with the consideration to which they are entitled. Under the circumstances, we are warranted- in "rubbing in" our criticism. </para>

                        <para>- It is all right now, sir. The proposal of the Ministry to raise the duty to 30 per cent. is at variance with the Bill as it came to us from another place. It is at variance with the recommendation of the A division of the Tariff Commission ; it is a 100 per cent. advance on the recommendation of the B section of that Commission, and a 5 per cent. advance on the Bill as it reached us. It is a proposal to place back the duty to a rate which was voluntarily abandoned by the Minister in charge of the Bill elsewhere. By his own offer the duty was fixed at 25 per cent. and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> asks us to go back upon his colleague in another place, and upon the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, to double the recommendation of the freetrade section of that Commission, and to place a burden which is little less than intolerable upon every home in the Commonwealth. I have no desire to occupy time unnecessarily; to repeat what has been well said by many speakers during the debate, which has now lasted from between 4 and5 o'clock. But the length and the fervour of the debate, the strenuousness of the eloquence that has filled the Chamber during all those hours, point to the fact that the item before us- </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator had better spend a little of his spare time in studying the item, because his ignorance of the fact that it does include hollow-ware is deplorable. What has taken place in connexion with this item shows how keenly some honorable  senators have been striving to relieve the necessaries of the home of import duties. The Minister has proposed that some few articles made of iron and coated with tin should be freed from this extortionate taxation. But in his first deliverance he told the Committee that down-pipes, guttering, and bird cages were the chief imports covered by the item. . Not one of those articles is constructed of iron coated with tin, and that is sufficient to expose the hollowness of the Ministerial proposal. Honorable senators will, no doubt, remember Lord Macaulay's lines - </para>

                        <para>- The lengthy discussion which has taken place on the item, and the fervour of the utterances of many honorable senators who have addressed the Committee, clearly show how strong the feeling of opposition is to the Government proposal to assault the home, however humble or lofty, the tent of the miner or prospector, and the home in the wilderness of every striver after the development of the resources of Australia throughout the wide domain of the Commonwealth. On the very threshold of the home we find that there is a tax imposed on the iron scraper on which a man cleans his boots. He cannot have a metal hat or umbrella stand in his hall without having to pay duty on it under this item. </para>

                        <para>- I am not quite sure that door handles would not come under this item, but there is no possible doubt that door knockers do. It is a positive outrage that a man cannot be disturbed at 12 o'clock at night without a tax of 30 per cent. having to be paid on the knocker with which his slumbers are disturbed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has suggested that the hinges by which the door is hung are subject to a 30 per cent. duty. The lock and the key with which it is turned come under this item. If we go into the laundry or kitchen we find that there is a duty of 30per cent. on almost all we see, whether it be the saucepan, the kettle, the frying pan, the gridiron, or the flatiron. I cannot, at this time of the night, remember all the little etceteras that go to make up the domestic requirements of the kitchen and laundry, but this taxation penetrates with a blighting influence the homes alike of the richest and humblest members of the community. Even the rings that constitute the most important part of the hobbles on the overlander's horse are taxed at 30 per cent. The bell that hangs round the neck of the bullock, that forms an important member of the teamster's team, and the bell on the pack-horse when it is turned out to feed, pay 30 per cent. A common pair of scissors, such as are used by every one, the steel that is required for sharpening knives, the stew-pan used in the kitchen, and the enamelledware advertisement, such as is used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> to proclaim the virtues of his pianos - all pay 30 per cent. A large proportion of the articles under this heading are made of iron coated with tin. There is also a considerable number of articles in common use that are constructed of some cheap metal and coated with nickel. These are all to be assailed with a 30 per cent. duty. The chain that ties up the domestic dog, and that which is fastened to the parrot, alike pay 30 per cent. I could occupy very much more time in enumerating the goods subject to this impost. But I think the Minister might, at this stage, reasonably indicate that he is not disposed to press for this increased duty. I might go so far as to say that I should be willing to withdraw my request if he would withdraw the Ministerial threat under which we feel that we are suffering, and let the. duty stand even as it stands at present in the schedule. It is not possible to make a more reasonable proposition than that. I hope that the suggestion I have made by way of settling a difficulty that certainly threatens a very long sitting will be regarded as reasonable, and that we may come to a friendly settlement of a question that seems to promise a great deal of personal discomfort and possibly more untoward effects. </para>

                    <para>. - Earlier in the evening I suggested that the Minister should endeavour to meet the Committee by separating ironware from tinware. I have here a book which deals very fully with the methods by which tin plate is produced from iron, but I do not propose to weary the Committee by reading it. The Minister told us that there was great difficulty in differentiating between ironware and tinware coming under this item, but I contend that a duty of 30 per cent. is altogether too high in respect of the tinware which he said was covered by it. We find that it includes not only blacksmiths' anvils and Milner safes, but dog 'chains, gas tanks, corkscrews, fenders, gluepots, and many other articles. There also come under this item such tinned ware as gridirons, saucepans for use over gas jets, hinges and door bolts. The two classes should be dealt with separately, and, if in order, I should like to move a request for the insertion of a new paragraph providing that tinware for household use as prescribed by departmental by-laws be free. Such a division of the item would to a large extent settle the difficulty which exists between the Government and the Opposition. These household goods are required, not only in the mansions, but also in the huts of Australia - in the camps as well as in the towns. </para>

                    <para>. - We ought to clearly understand what articles come under this item. In considering the rate of duty to be imposed we ought not to lose sight of the fact that  paragraph a covers such household utensils as saucepans and stewpans. The Minister of Home Affairs must feel it rather hard that he should be called upon to support so high a duty in respect of stew-pans, which are used in nearly every household in Tasmania. In the State of which the honorable senator is a representative nearly every family makes its own preserves. The position is to a large. extent the same in Victoria, and although this State has returned a majority of protectionists,  I feel satisfied that . if the higher duty be carried those who are called .upon next year to pay an increased price for stewpans will raise an outcry. A strong protectionist has shown to-night that there is a natural protection of 33 per cent, on metals and metalware, and the Government wish to increase that by another 30 per cent., making in all 63 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, what right has the Government to increase a duty which has been reduced by the House of Representatives? The Ministry may have a majority behind it; but it is the duty of the Opposition to prevent the undue taxing of the people. In every State there are unfortunates who make what in most instances is, I am sorry to say, a poor living, by washing and ironing, and, by increasing the duty on irons, the Government is still further increasing their expenses and reducing the profit of their labour. Then, while an attempt has been made to stimulate the local manufacture of clothing, one of the tailor's chief tools of trade, the goose - the heavy iron which he uses for pressing - is made dearer by a. heavier duty. It is those who are least able to afford additional taxation, the workers of the Commonwealth, who will be oppressed by these duties. Surely the higher rate is not required to increase the revenue, which we are told will yield at least ,£2,000.000 more than was expected. The smaller return to be expected under this item from a duty of 25 per' cent, will not materially affect the total revenue. Many articles in dan\' use by ordinary citizens are included in this item, and under the Government proposal these will be dutiable at an' increased rate of 5 per cent. If I thought for a' moment that this increased duty was really required from a revenue stand-point, I might feel disposed to vote for it. But. seeing that we have an overflowing Treasury, we know that it  is not required. The Vice-President of the Executive Council desires an increase of 5. 'per cent, upon this item to bring it into harmony with the duty levied upon another item.I wish also to point out that there is a certain class of boiler used for the purpose of boiling clothes- </para>

                        <para>- The  Chairman  has already ruled that I am not at liberty to allude to other than the item under discussion. These washing boilers are principally lined with tin. They may be found in every household, and especially in the bush. Now we are asked to increase the price of them by 5 per cent. In some parts of the bush, residents have been compelled, by reason of the high price of these boilers, to use kerosene cans and nail cans as substitutes. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to be a case of tax, tax, tax all the time, and some protectionists would readily vote for rates as high as 100 per cent. They should take into consideration the unfortunate people . who have not £600 a year to spend. Honorable senators are, of course, in a different position, but I hope their feelings for those they represent will prevent them from increasing the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I believe so, as they are made of iron, and coated with tin. To tax jam tins will be contrary to our professed policy of fostering local industries. I am surprised at the attitude of the Minister of Home Affairs, because Tasmania has developed a large jam trade, the success of which depends on cheap material for the making of jam tins. This proposal will crucify the jam-making industry of Tasmania, as the margin between profit and loss is even now very small. There is <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> large industry of tinning fruit in Mildura, for which the Vice President of the Executive Council ought to have consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> wants to see Mildura industries flourish, but is at the same time willing to place taxation on them. Queensland is building up a large trade in canned pineapples and other fruit. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to tax the Queensland canned-fruit trade. The margin between the cost of production and the sale price is so small, that if this duty is imposed people will be driven out of the industry. Do honorable senators opposite intend deliberately to sacrifice the people on the land to their ambition for high protection ? Tomatoes are also articles which this duty would affect, as may be gathered from the fact that some 340,000 cases of the fruit are sent away from Bowen, in Queensland, annually. Many people have been induced to go on the land, and yet, under the Tariff, the cost of every implement they require is increased. Then, again, during the last twelve or eighteen months some 500 or 600 settlers have entered the sugar industry, with the result that an immense number of gallons of syrup have been allowed to run to waste, because it did not pay to sell at the price offered. If a lower duty were imposed on manufactures of metal, there is not the slightest doubt that the cost of packing tins would be made much cheaper. At the present time in Queensland, persons are throwing away molasses merely because they have no market, whereas, if they were enabled to procure cheap tins, that by-product could be exported to other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that the honorable senator, as a strong protectionist, would be the last man in the world who would wish to drive any work out of this country by imposing a revenue duty. I am really surprised at him asking me that question. He ought to be supporting us in our effort to get tin admitted at as low a rate as possible, in order to give employment to our own people in various directions. So far as I know, this item includes barrels which are made of metal. I hope that the representatives of Western Australia are aware that a' many metal barrels are used for the purpose of hauling dirt. There is also a cask which is made from steel, and which, I presume, will come under this item. The price of steel casks or buckets will be increased by 5 per cent. if this duty be carried. I was very pleased to-day when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> accepted </para>

                    request for a certain class of steel to be admitted free. But it is now proposed to nullify that good act by increasing the duty on another class of steel, which is also used largely in connexion with mining. I cannot understand the reasons which induce honorable senators on the other side to take, up that extraordinary position. I was moved very deeply this afternoon by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline>
                    very pathetic appeal on behalf of a number of mines which are approaching a paying point, and naturally I was- very pleased when he carried his' request for a reduction of the duty, on the item in question. But .this item includes an article which is used in great numbers, more especially in mines before they - get to the company stage. Steel buckets are used with a whip or a whim, or a small engine, in hauling the mullock when sinking a shaft, hauling up the quartz afterwards, and bailing out water in wet ground.

                        <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the fact that tinned cucumbers form an important item of export from Queensland, and the duty sought to be imposed "on manufactures of metal will be severely felt by those who are engaged in the tinning- of cucumbers in the northern State. I mentioned also that it will act in .some degree as a deterrent to the settlement of people on the soil. I am sorry that honorable senators should be prepared to do anything that would prevent the- settlement of people on the soil, but we cannot hope to induce people to settle on the land of the Commonwealth unless we afford them the greatest possible facilities for the disposal of their produce. I have referred' also to another important industry - the tinning of fish. I forgot at the time that we had passed a Bounties Bill in which we have offered a bounty to persons who will take up this industry. It seems extraordinary that we should now be asked', to impose a duty on the tins required iri an industry for the development pf -which we have offered a bounty. Again we have established in the Commonwealth, and especially in Queensland and in the Northern Territory, an industry for the tinning of. meat. A few years ago we had a large surplus of cattle in Queensland which, owing to drought in the central districts, could not be travelled to the southern markets. It was necessary, therefore, that the cattle should be killed in- the State and the meat preserved in tins. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator is not aware that there are various kinds of tin.. There is lode tin and stream tin, but I am dealing now with the tinware included in 'the item under discussion. Some years ago in North Queensland we had a surplus supply of cattle. The people who owned them not being able to dispose of them otherwise, had the carcasses  boiled down, tinned the flesh, and even tinned the dripping. By the action of this Parliament we are making it impossible for the meat tinning industry to be  conducted profitably in a bad season. At present, fortunately, we are enjoying splendid seasons. But I do not want honorable. senators to take away from the people in the North the opportunity of getting rid of their stock at a profit. This is supposed to be a protectionist item, but as a matter qf fact it is a purely revenue item.- The' tin must be imported. </para>

It is also well known that tins cannot be closed up without the use of solder, which is a manufacture of metal. I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> is perfectly in order in referring to the requirements of the great' tinning industry of Australia. So much is it an Australian industry that  Deputy  Survevor-General Evans, who. was brought over from Tasmania to New South Wales to complete the exploration of the Blue Mountains, and who discovered the Bathurst Plains, related in his report to Governor Macquarie that on Christmas Day - and this occurred two years before the Battle of Waterloo- </para>

                        <para>-  I was relating that  Deputy  Surveyor-General Evans reported to Governor Macquarie that on Christmas Day, 1812, the weather was so extremely hot that the fish in the river - now known as Murray cod - would not bite, and that he had to fall back upon the case of tinned roast beef which he had taken with him. The fact shows that two years before the Battle of Waterloo even, roast beef - to say nothing of boiled - was tinned in Australia. From that day to the present the tinning of meats and other foods has been a great Australian industry ; and I submit with great respect that the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Savers</inline> in reference to the fact that the material necessary for that industry is imported into the Commonwealth tinder item 170, is perfectly in order. Let me say, lest there should be any possible doubt about the matter, that I have been referring in all good faith to an official report of Considerable interest ; and upon that document I base my argument as to the importance of the industry. </para>

He certainly would be out of order if it were absolutely necessary for the tin used in that way to be imported in sheets, but it is competent for any one to introduce tins already made up, and such tins would come under this item. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is deserving of censure for having raised a point of order, the only effect of which is to consume valuable time. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Dripping is put into these tins, which are then soldered up, and the contents sold largely throughout the Commonwealth. In Tasmania, and even in Victoria, in the winter, when butter is dear, thousands of people live on bread and butter and dripping. Do honorable senators wish to make it harder for the poor by making this commodity dearer? Some honorable senators have declared that they will not tax articles of food j  but this is an indirect food tax. They must know this, yet, apparently, they have made up their minds to impose as much taxation as possible, without regard to the conditions of those who, even at present, can hardly make both ends meet. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The frying pan is used in every working man's home, and is often seen with the swag of the bush worker. As frying pans are not made here, this duty, and the duty on gridirons, is a revenue tax, wholly unnecessary, seeing how largely the revenue is exceeding the Treasurer's estimate. If those who support the Government upon this .item are not revenue tariffists I do not know what they are. I maintain that the duty proposed is a purely revenue impost. We have not been told anything to the contrary, and it has not been shown that the articles covered by this item can be manufactured in the Commonwealth. For the eight months of the present financial year this Tariff has yielded £1,800,000 in excess of' the revenue derived from the Tariff of 1902; It is apparent, therefore, that by the close of the financial year the revenue from it will exceed the amount collected under the old Tariff by, approximately, ,£2,250,000. Notwithstanding this fact,  honorable senators opposite have, day. after day, sanctioned the imposition of increased duties. In the other Chamber a compromise was accepted upon, this item - a compromise from which the Vice-President of the Executive Council now desires to depart. I am satisfied that if the duty be increased to 30 per cent., our action will be resented in more places than one. It will be resented by the general public, and we shall be here another six months before the consideration of the Tariff has been completed. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt  that we shall be defeated in our attempt to prevent excessive taxation being levied upon the people. "Brute force will always prevail. But, . in justice to the electors who returned us, we must resist this iniquitous taxation. I  feel certain that if the proposal of the Government be agreed to, we shall, at a later stage, be Obliged to retrace our steps. 1 do not want to see the Senate placed in that position, neither do I desire to be kept here' till next Christmas. During the Tariff debate I have been surprised' at the moderation exhibited by the Opposition. Time after time We have endeavoured to assist the Government, but the moment that we have' asked for the smallest concession,' we have met with nothing but rebuffs. I can claim <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft's.</inline> vote on this item because he has refused to tax the food of the people. My arguments in favour of the poor man whose family have to live on dripping because they cannot afford butter should convince him. that he should not vote to increase their cost of living. Although a protectionist, he is open to reason. I have not occupied much time so far in the -discussion pf this Tariff, but I felt that I. must fight to the bitter end the attempt of the Government, without giving reasons, to force us to increase this duty from 25 to 36 per cent. If they meet us fairly with" reasonable proposals we shall always be prepared, to assist them. This is; an encroachment on the rights of the people, and must be strenuously opposed. I am now informed that a compromise was offered to the Government, that tinware and ironware should be separated. That would hardly meet my views, because if tinware were relieved pf the duty many articles of iron used in the household would still be taxed. I 'hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Croft</inline> will succeed in exempting all tin" and ironware used- for household purposes. The Government, however, appear to have made up their minds that, having a majority, they can force their proposal through the Chamber. It is. our duty to resist to the utmost anything that we think is a burden upon the taxpayer. If honorable senators opposite were on this side they would be the strongest opponents of this iniquitous taxation. I hope the request, if agreed to, will be sent back to us again, and that then we shall be better prepared to deal with it. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [1.58 a.m.]. - Most of the eloquence to-night has been devoted to the domestic aspect. I shall take up the maritime aspect, and - as I have a little Irish blood in my veins - break new ground upon the waters. Under this item of metal manufactures comes in that which is essential to the wel-being of Australia. Doubtless steamer propellers will come under this item ; and we can realize how seriously the cost in this connexion might be increased. How can we hope to build up an Australian maritime power if all the requisites are to bear a heavy duty, with the result of enhanced prices on both imported and locally manuf actured articles ? All sorts of supplies for the Commonwealth and States Governments will be affected, and increased burdens of taxation thus imposed on the people by means of this extraordinary Tariff. Indeed, the Tariff, although it has not yet passed the two Houses, already possesses anomalies which the appointment of the Tariff Commission was intended to abolish.

                        <para>- The value of the imports under this item is£609,948 per annum, and on that, under the Government proposal, there will be collected duty amounting to nearly£200,000; and this in regard to articles used, not only in every house, but in every room of every house. If Ministers had any regard for the rights of the minority there would be no need for this late sitting; but I am prepared, if necessary, in order to show that the Opposition intend to have a voice in this matter, to move a dozen amendments on every item. I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council could have taken a note of the various articles which are comprised in this item. When my cautious friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> quoted a certain letter in the other House, he said that the authority was undoubted. According to that authority a blacksmith's anvil is not made in the Commonwealth. Do the Deakin Government wish to encourage the indus tries of the country by imposing a duty of 30 per cent. on a blacksmith's anvil? When I go to a garden party I like to have some creases in my trousers. I desire to know if it is possible to get a locally -made tailor's iron. I do not believe that it is. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> every time we impose a duty the price of the article taxed is cheapened to the public. This, however, is the one exception to his grand doctrine. Even he will not admit that the price of a tailor's iron is cheapened by the imposition of a 30 per cent. duty. We ought to have had set out in an explanatory document all the information which has been furnished to the Minister by the Customs officials. Is a mason's sieve or riddle a tool of trade, or is it to be liable to a duty of 30 per cent.? Will the cost of the article be cheapened by the imposition of a duty? The item also includes bells of every description. Am I to understand that all sorts of bells are not made in the Commonwealth ? Fancy such articles being subjected to a duty of 30 per cent. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will tell me that it will cheapen the price of the article. I do not like to suggest that an Australian worker cannot make a door-bolt, but, because he does not, it is proposed to punish every person who uses the article by imposing a duty of 30 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has pointed out that fireproof safes can be made in Australia, but that they are not to be compared with the British article. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> would compel every man to provide himself with a cheap and nasty safe simply because it is made in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that my honorable friend is going to discriminate in regard to those articles which are used in the kitchen. If he would only go a little farther in that direction we might be able to meet him. I believe that cashboxes can be made in Australia, but I understand that the cost of importing is at least 20 per cent. As my honorable friend proposes a duty of 30 per cent., he is really taxing those necessary articles, to every office, and to many homes, to the amount of 50 per cent. I have made up my mind not to buy an Australian-made cash-box in the future. Some hours ago we were talking about an article which I should like to use now, and that is the homely corkscrew. I find that it also is to be dutiable  nt  30 per cent. Fenders and fireirons, which I am informed are not made in the Commonwealth, will also have to carry the same duty, although the natural protection upon them, due to the cost of freight, must be enormous. I find that blocks and pulleys are also to be charged  a  duty of 30 per cent. I should like to know  what  our working men, who- are building four-roomed cottages for themselves, will say when they find that under this Tariff they will be compelled to pay high duties upon every article of furniture and household utensil they require. I have heard no reason to justify the proposed increase of the duty on this item. It will create difficulty in another place in fixing up the Tariff which, in my opinion, will not lead to the same amount of sound business as the Tariff which . it is to replace. I have shown that on 80 per cent, of the articles embraced in this item, the duty proposed is not a protective duty. Why did the Tariff Commission conduct a judicial investigation extending over two years, at an expense of £10,000, if, at the sweet will of. Ministers, we are to disregard their recommendations and increase these duties? If the Vice-President of the Executive Council has any suggestion to offer to bring this sitting to a close, I shall be glad to hear it ; but I have felt it my duty to enter a solemn protest against the imposition of a duty which must be felt to be a grievous burden on every householder in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- At this hour of the morning, I appeal to the Vice-President of the Executive Council to recognise that, in asking him to be satisfied with a duty of 25 per cent, on this item, we are making a reasonable request, since that would be an advance on the duty approved by the Minister, in charge of the Tariff in another place, and on the duty recommended by the protectionist section of .the Tariff Commission. I think I have a right to ask that a quorum should be present. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> Why is a request made for an increase of the duty on this item? It cannot be because Ministers fear a reduction of revenue under this Tariff, because so far the revenue derived has been double what they anticipated it would be. </para>

                        <para>- I should have thought that Ministers, as trustees of the interests of the people, would have felt it to be their duty to reduce, rather than increase, duties which have not a protectionist effect. This duty will be levied upon a great variety of articles, 90 per cent, of which are used in the homes of the people, and, if I can read a sign of the times, the future is not so promising that we can safely impose additional taxation upon them. There may be times ahead of us when every penny of taxation will be felt, and when those who are responsible for the imposition of .increased duties will have to suffer the consequences of their action. In this matter,  honorable senators on this side feel that they are fighting the battle of the people. We fail to see why, when the Tariff was intended to remove anomalies and not to. increase duties, and when a Tariff Commission, after an inquiry lasting over two years, during which, at great expense, they examined numbers of witnesses- </para>

                        <para>- I felt that I was entitled to refer to the work of the Tariff Commission, because the Vice-President' of the Executive Council has repeatedly mentioned the fact that evidence in connexion with the various items in the Tariff was submitted to the Commission. It is impossible to deny that the members of the Tariff Commission, who heard the evidence, were in a better position to advise as to the duties than we can be. Now, I propose to deal with a few of the articles included under the item. First, I may mention bells. J believe that no bells are manufactured in the Commonwealth. See how this duty will fall on our churches. At Ashfield, New South Wales, where I live, we have just put in the church a peal of bells that cost over £300. Under this item the duty on those bells would .have been over £90, apart from the heavy freight and packing charges. It is almost barbarous to tax such hells. I also point out that this duty would fall on fire-alarm bells and bells used for factory, office, and domestic purposes. Letter-boxes are- also included under this item, and to tax them is most unwise. Even ships' propellers will not escape under this item. The folly of increasing the cost of safes by this duty has been referred to previously, and should not be overlooked. </para>

                <para class="block">Only a few weeks ago I bought a small safe for £50. I could probably have bought a colonial-made safe for £20, but I paid the extra money because I knew I could absolutely depend upon the reliable work of the English makers. To put a duty of 30 per cent, upon safes, the freight on which is already very high, is a serious mistake. </para>

                        <para>- Under this item, something like 250 small articles used in almost every household are bracketed with such things as iron safes and propellers. It cannot be said that the item has been scientifically arranged when it subjects scores of small- articles of great value from the point of view of the housewife to the same duty as is imposed on such large things as fireproof safes and ships' propellers. A duty of 30 per cent, is a barbarous one, and ought not to be imposed. This is not an equitable tax, and a lack of knowledge of the principles which should guide us in levying taxation is shown by those who put it forward. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> should be prepared to support it. He must know that it will inflict' an absolute injustice on the people. I appeal to the Vice-President of the Executive Council to consider the compromise which the Opposition are prepared to agree to. The imposition of a duty of even 25  per cent. upon many of the articles covered by this item is, to my mind, little short of outrageous, and, in voting for such a tax, I shall feel that I am taking a very strong dose of a nauseating physic. There is certainly no need for so high a duty as the Government propose. The Treasury is overburdened with money. The Tariff is yielding an enormous revenue, and the Ministry, instead of proposing to increase the existing duty, should be prepared to make an effort to reduce the burden of taxation on the people. Most of the articles covered by the item are essential to the development of Australia. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland [4.30 a.m.]. - The item now under discussion is one of the most important in. the Tariff, an importance which has been made more manifest by the request which has been moved in connexion with it. But when the members of the Opposition desired to extend the scope of the exemptions, the action of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in refusing to explain his attitude in resisting the attempt to reduce the taxation on household implements, made it necessary for us to insist in making plain the incidence of the proposed taxation. Tinware and tinned ironware enters very largely into the ordinary household economy. It was the importance of this metal to the ancient world that led to the discovery of Great Britain by the Romans.

Probably, the reason of the present supremacy of Great Britain in the production of tinned ware - a supremacy which I hope she will long enjoy - is due to the fact that for so many centuries that country has been remarkable for its deposits of tin ore. From the report of the Tariff Commission I gather that Australia cannot supply anything like the number of articles of tin and tinware that are required in even the humblest household in Australia.

                        <para>- There are very few humorous questions in life which, when deeply probed, do not present aspects of very great importance. Indeed, it has been said by the greatest writers, that no man who is not possessed of a sense of humour really views serious issues in their proper proportions. Every one knows the importance of tin and tinware in domestic life. At a very early age in the history of the world, the importance of tin and  tinware was recognised even by semi civilized communities. Indeed, an article of tinware was a subject which occupied the attention of some of the greatest intelligences of the ancient Empire of Greece. Of course, the story is familiar to all. Rat, mouse, and other kinds of traps are included in this item. Cheap traps may help to check the bubonic plague, to the danger of which Australia is constantly exposed from the East. </para>

However, wire gauze has been removed from that item; and the question is whether it now falls within item 170, or goes with perforated zinc, which is on the free list. I am afraid that, according to the official interpretation, wire gauze comes under item 170. </para>

                        <para>- If a duty be imposed on the raw material, then it will be necessary to impose a duty of at least 40½ per cent. on item 170. It is a matter of regret, and, to some extent, a slight to the Senate, that, while in another place the Government suspended the consideration of the Tariff in order to deal with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, it has not been thought necessary to consult honorable senators in regard to that measure. In another place, the Tariff was dealt with as though the Manufactures Encouragement Bill had been passed into law. The Government only deemed it necessary to ascertain what the other House thought, and having done so, it proceeded to shape its Tariff. The Minister in charge of the Bill frankly stated that he would accept the verdict of the House on the Manufactures Encouragement Bill as an indorsement of the proposals of the Government, and having received that indorsement, he immediately recast the Tariff. He has proclaimed, not merely to the Senate, but to the constituencies, that the Government does not pay the slightest heed to what the Senate may think on important proposals! We have no indication as to what may happen to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, or, if it be carried through the other House, what amendments are likely to be made therein. That places a disability upon the Senate. It creates a difficulty in the minds of some honorable senators as to what ought to be done in regard to items such as the one before the Committee. We should know the. exact terms of the request which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> proposes to submit. We are asked to impose a duty of 30 per cent. on a large number of articles in this item, and he proposes to take out of that number certain articles. In proportion as that number is large, it will lessen the objection to the proposed duty. On the other hand, if the number  be comparatively small or insignificant, the objection to the duty will be all the more serious. I understood when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> first moved in the matter that his request would be limited to iron and tinware used in the kitchen. I ask him now to state exactly what its terms will be. </para>

I have no desire to put him in the position of appearing to make a bargain. I propose to do what, under ordinary circumstances, might be regarded as a foolish thing. Having stated the case, I am going to trust the Minister to treat this side of the Chamber in a reasonable and fair manner. If he is prepared to take a division, well and good. When it is completed, I shall repeat my request for an adjournment. </para>

                    <para>. - After the arguments to which we have listened throughout the night I should have thought that honorable senators would never dream of sending to another place a request to make the duty on this item on imports from the United Kingdom  25  .per cent. What becomes of the policy of preference ? Australia for the Australians is evidently the motto of honorable senators opposite, and not Australia for the Empire. We are dealing with an item which embraces a great number of articles required in every household, and which covers imports the total value of which, in  1906,  represented  £609,048,  and yet honorable senators opposite are proposing that the British manufacturer should' be given a sham preference, which involves the payment by him of  5  per cent, more in duty under this item than he had to pay under the old Tariff. What will they think of us, in the dear old Mother Country? I blush to think that this Tariff, when it leaves the Senate, will make only a mockery of the great principle of preference. </para>

                        <para>- I am frying to show that the Government proposal to give preference in connexion with this item is only to make things worse for the British manufacturer than they were ' under the old Tariff. I am shocked to think that the members of the Australian Labour Party, who, I thought,* believed in class legislation, should, in this instance, be prepared to abandon their class by refusing to the labourer the advantage which he might obtain by an effective preference on the import of these household articles from the United Kingdom. We ought to be told what proportion of the imports in  1906  valued at  ,£600,000  came from the United Kingdom, and what was the amount of duty paid on those imports, that we might be in a position to know what duty will be collected on imports from that source under the sham preference now proposed. As a result of what has been done in this Committee, I believe that when the Tariff leaves the Senate Great Britain will be given, a smaller measure of preference under it than she was given under the Tariff as it was introduced in the Senate. Does this mean that our honorable friends in. another place are more Imperialistic than "we are ? It can hardly be. I know that I am Imperialistic to the backbone. I propose now to leave other honorable senators on this side to say what they think of the sham to which we are asked now to agree. </para>

                    <para>. - We are now considering the amount of preference we shall give to the United Kingdom in connexion with this item. We know that the question of preference was discussed at the Imperial  Conference  which the Prime Minister attended to instruct the people of Great Britain as to the proposals his Government intended to submit. On this question there should be no better authority than the Prime Minister, and before the Committee decides on the preference to be given in connexion with this item, it might be well that honorable senators should hear what the honorable gentleman had to say at the Conference. I quote from page  337  of the official report of its proceedings, where the honorable gentleman is reported to have said - </para>

                    <para>So far as I can speak for the people of Australia this motive - speaking of them as a whole - counts for as much as any promise of direct material advantage to themselves - if you can speak of direct material advantage to us apart from that of the whole Empire.

                <para>I take it from that expression that the Prime Minister was just as anxious to benefit Great Britain as to promote the trade interests of Australia. I should like to hear some explanation as to how it will be for the benefit of Great Britain that we should impose this tax against her. The Prime Minister went on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>But for the moment, speaking as if the interests could be severed, I believe a motive quite as strong, and probably stronger, than that of "money gain or advantage of this trade influences the bulk of the people of Australia.  . . . They look to the operation of trade and to its great agencies, particularly the shipping of the Empire, to uphold the proud position which it occupies to-day. 'Lord Tweedmouth, when he was with us, mentioned some very striking figures on that point. . </para>

                        <para>- If consistently with our duty to Australia we can lower the' duty against Great Britain, we certainly ought to do it. Our contention is that to reduce the duty in the second column to 20 per cent, would materially help the Mother Country without in any way prejudicing a single manufacturer at present carrying on in Australia the business of manufacturing any of the items included under the. item. We are dealing with articles almost entirely of a domestic character, nine-tenths of which come from the Mother Country. They are manufactured in England in enormous quantities. It would not pay to make them in Australia. It must be clear that by lowering the duty we. should confer a benefit upon every household in this country. The cheapness of our domestic articles arises from the fact that they are manufactured not for a market of  4,000,000  people, but for the market of the whole world. Moreover, many of the articles included under the item are in a sense raw materials for articles of Australian manufacture. There are many things made in this country the frames- of which, cast in metal, come from the United Kingdom. The work which makes them marketable articles is done upon them in Australia. By lowering the duty we shall benefit such manufactures. I do not know whether the Government expect to get increased revenue from the item. </para>

                        <para>- I think they should be more specifically dealt with. It is just as well that honorable senators should clearly understand the purpose of the duties. Having ascertained what articles are covered by this item we have next to discover what, proportion of them can be made in Australia. Surely if they are being made here the Government can produce statistics giving the local output. We have had very little information on that point, and the reasonable inference is that most of the small household requisites covered by the item are not made in Australia, and that it would not pay to enter upon their production here. Surely Australian industries cannot be imperilled by the proposal of the Opposition? If effect is to be given to the desire for preference expressed by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference- </para>

It is only a regard for what I conceive to be my duty that induces me to take this step. The paltry preference proposed by the Government in favour of imports from the United Kingdom under this item warrants our questioning their sincerity in respect of preferential trade generally. I do not doubt that the Prime Minister is permeated with the Imperialistic sentiment with which the whole question is surrounded, but I believe that he has associated with him in the Ministry men who care little for preferential trade with the United Kingdom, and also have tried to give the Old Country as little as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hayes,</inline> secretary of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, on his return to Australia after a visit to England, was interviewed at Fremantle a day or two ago, and said that the commercial and mercantile community of the United Kingdom were greatly dissatisfied with the mere veneer of preference for which this Bill provides. Although another place decided that in respect of this item, imports from the United Kingdom should enjoy a preferential duty of 20 per cent., we are now asked by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to cut down that preference. The Government are trying to restore to the Tariff wall the brick which another place removed, and the Vice President of the Executive Council has done everything possible to show that the preference proposed by the Government is an absolute sham. </para>

                        <para>- I have little to add to what I said before the adjournment for breakfast. My main desire is to insist that any preference granted to the Old Country should be of practical advantage to her merchants and manufacturers. But, according to the Secretary to the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, they are quite disappointed with the proposals of the Government. As a matter of fact, the duties in this Tariff against British goods are higher than the duties under the old Tariff. In this instance, in my opinion, the preferential rate should remain at 20 per cent., and I hope that the Government will not press the request for an increase to 25 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the division is taken, I wish to explain why the Opposition has felt justified in opposing so strongly the action of the Government with regard to this item. Our reasons are two : The first is that this is another attempt, on the part of the Government, of which we have already had several, to ignore the decisions of the House of Representatives, and put back the duties to the rates originally introduced. The obligation has thus been thrown on the members of the Opposition to defend the Tariff, which should have had the special and tender care of Ministers. Had this been the only instance of its kind, more weight might have attached to the reason given for the Ministerial proposal ; but the Government has acted similarly in quite a number of cases. The second reason which actuated the Opposition was that we see in the proposal of the Government to raise the duty against imports from the United Kingdom further evidence of insincerity in regard to preference. It must now be generally recognised that effective protection and preference to the United Kingdom are incompatible, and that on every occasion the Government has chosen the former. Had it stood by its Tariff, it would have had the  support of the Opposition, and the measure would have escaped mutilation. But Ministers have themselves insisted on mutilating the Tariff, and the Opposition felt justified in registering its protest against this conduct. </para>

                <para class="block">My desire is to make aluminium articles for household use dutiable like other similar metal utensils. I am informed on the best authority that these aluminium goods can be made here. Aluminium is a comparatively expensive metal, and the articles dutiable under paragraph  b  are, therefore, such as are used chiefly by the well-to-do. If protective duties are a tax, it seems unfair to make those whose means compel them to use articles of tin, or iron, pay more than those who are better off, and can afford to purchase aluminium. </para>

If he wishes to secure an independent vote of the Committee on. his proposal, he should move the insertion of a new paragraph.

At the same time, I point out that in regard to nine-tenths of the manufactures of metal, n.e.i., the duties have a protective incidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> wishesto make aluminium goods dutiable at the same rates as other manufactures of metal ; but the replies to inquiries which I have made show that these goods are not manufactured in Australia. </para>

Nobody has ever attempted to obtain aluminium for manufacturing purposes in Australia, nor is such an attempt likely to be made in the near future. Under these circumstances it would be unwise to levy a higher duty upon this class of goods. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. It would not pay to undertake the enamelling here. Seeing that these articles are used in every household, I am not asking much in the shape of a concession when ask the Vice-President to agree to their admission free. </para>

There is a great objection to the adoption of that course, because, in various States of the Commonwealth the enamelling industry has been established. Further, the general understanding amongst honorable senators was that the admission, free, of kitchen utensils, made of cast iron, tinned or plain, was all that we desired.

                        <para>- That by-law could be revoked to-morrow if the Executive were assured that mechanics' saws were being made in Australia. The item practically imposes a 15 per cent. duty, which the Minister calls protective, on all band saws less than five feet in diameter. We are asked to believe that those are made in Australia. Fifteen per cent., from the Minister's point of view, cannot be protective. It is certainly a revenue duty. Here again we are in an anomalous position, with a duty too small for those who want protection, and too high regarded as a revenue duty on a tool of trade. </para>

                <para class="block">I take this step because it is absolutely necessary in the interests of Australian workmen and Australian industries. According to the report of the Tariff Commission, the brass working industry was brought to a fairly satisfactory state under a  40  per cent. duty, but when the first Commonwealth Tariff was imposed, it began to decline, until to-day many highly competent brass founders and workers are following other occupations, through lack of employment in their own trade. In view of the immense quantity of brass work used in Australia, I incline to think that it would be wise to impose a prohibitive duty on this item. The importations of brass work are increasing every month, and, correspondingly, Australian brass workers are being thrown out of their ordinary employment. I intend afterwards to move for a proportionate increase in the duty on imports from the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> to reconsider his request. He was not present last night when this matter was fully dealt with. Item  170,  paragraph  a,  was brought on to a level with item  172,  because it was found impracticable by the Department to work with the two items at different rates of duty. Under the  1902  Tariff, as in most of the States Tariffs, it was found that brasswork comprised  30  or  40  per cent. of manufactures of metal. The Tariff Commission made a special recommendation of  30  per cent. on brasswork, which the Government accepted, and so differentiated the duties on the two items. But as goods, such as hinges, bolts, &amp;c., are made indifferently of iron, steel, or brass, the Department found it impossible to say, without opening the goods, what they were made of. This caused much irritation, and it became imperative to make the duties on the two items the same. </para>

The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a sudden jump to  25  per cent. The freetrade section are represented as recommending  10  per cent. We are asked, with our eyes open, to put a direct and onerous tax upon knowledge. We should think, not of half-a-dozen rich newspapers, but of all the country papers which cater for the people in the outlying parts of the Commonwealth. To those people the newspaper is the one source of information and education, and we should encourage local newspapers in every district. For every big and wealthy newspaper there are fifty country newspapers that can hardly pay their way. I am informed that - </para>

                        <para>- Within the last few years the Sydney foundry has been making much greater varieties of type than was the case previously. This additional measure of protection will give the industry an impetus, and many printers, who now buy their type abroad, will find it advantageous to purchase from the Australian manufacturer. The Sydney foundry is a great convenience to printers throughout the Commonwealth. When a large order has to be executed by a printer, there is often a run on certain sorts of type, and in such cases Wimble and Company can supply the necessary sorts direct, without the printer having to buy a complete font. Most of the newspapers in the big cities are not printed from movable type, but are served by linotype machines. </para>

                        <para>- The interjection of the honorable senator suggests that Messrs. Wimble and Company can charge any price they like. As a matter of fact, for a number of years there was no duty, and all foreign manufacturers were in competition with this Australian firm. I believe that those foreign manufacturers were getting type invoiced to Australia at a price below its value. Representations have been made to certain honorable senators that it would be well, in the interests of the employing printers, to give protection to Messrs. Wimble and Company, for the particular founts or faces he produces. I trust that a request to that effect, if moved, will not be accepted, because type could be brought in under half-a-dozen aliases, and thus the Australian firm would have no protection at all. It is true that employing printers have made a request that type should be free, but, as against that, we have the Typographical Society of Victoria, and, I believe, the typographical societies of other States, expressing a desire for a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Committee will not be misled by statements of that kind. I do not think that there could be quoted an isolated case of any small printer who has been handicapped in consequence of the protection afforded to this firm. Many newspaper proprietors, having adopted monolines or linotypes, have got rid of their stocks of ordinary type at a much lower price than they paid for them. Type suitable for newspapers can be purchased from Messrs. Wimble and Company at a very reasonable rate; and in the case of type for job work the firm's prices are lower than those of Continental manufacturers. </para>

At any rate, the measure of protection proposed will be an incentive to American and English type founders to establish works here in the event of Messrs. Wimble and Company falling short. </para>

In fact, it is shown that the number of hands has increased from forty to eighty, and that orders have multiplied to such an extent that a still larger number of men will have to be engaged. Messrs. Wimble and Company also cast leads and slugs, quotations, and French metal furniture ; and these articles, while not requiring any special skill in their manufacture, are absolutely necessary in the. printing office, especially where varied work is turned out. I speak with some knowledge of newspaper work and printing generally ; and although, as I say, Messrs. Wimble and Company may not turn out as many founts as do the Continental makers, they will, I believe, if accorded the proper measure of protection, demonstrate before long that up-to-date type can be produced in Australia by Australian workmen. </para>

                    <para>. - One of the difficulties in dealing with the proposed duty is one that is always more or less present when, in an effort to assist one industry, there is a liability to lay an impost on another. In this particular case, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has admitted, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> himself admits, the purchasers of type are not the proprietors of large newspapers, but those of smaller establishments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble,</inline> who appears to have given his evidence in a plain, candid way, admitted that the large newspapers do not use body type now that they are equipped with linotype and other typesetting machines. That means that the principal output of his factory must go to the offices which are not so equipped. One has to ask first whether he has really made out a case for the imposition of ' a duty, seeing that he has well established his business without that aid ; and, secondly, whether the advantage that would be given to him by the imposition of a duty would not be counterbalanced by the burden which might be thrown upon the smaller newspaper proprietors. At one time I was conducting a newspaper office, and had some slight transactions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble's</inline> firm. I ask honorable senators to say whether the average country newspaper does not do good and useful work in the less settled districts of the Commonwealth ? Many of these pioneer men have a pretty keen struggle in order to get along,  and their struggle is always keenest at the initiation of their business. What justification is there for levying a duty in the interests of a man who has already established his factory without that aid, when by so doing it will place a corresponding impost on a large number of the smaller newspaper proprietors ? </para>

                        <para>- In his sworn evidence he said that the price which he charged was the English price, plus the cost of bringing out the English type. That is exactly what he would charge if the duty were retained. As the imported type would cost more with a duty than without it he would naturally raise the price of his type to that of the other. There is no reason why he should sell his type below that price, and any one who would expect him to do so cannot have much knowledge of business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has practically admitted that not for a considerable time, can <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble,</inline> owing to the. smallness of the local market, hope to supply all its requirements. When I was dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> he was turning out excellent plain faced type for newspaper work. It is when one goes outside the stock lines that his factory, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> admitted, must necessarily fall behind as compared with those of American and British firms, and some Continental ones. Here is one difficulty which I foresee, Tn order to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> protection on the lines which he can make, we are asked to impose a duty on those lines which it is not likely that he can make for some time. Of course, he says that if we give him a duty, he will make them. But I venture to say that if he were asked whether he thought he could supply all the printing requirements of Australia, he would pick out -certain lines which might reasonably be left on the free list. Seeing that there is an increasing number of lines which it is not possible for the local factory to supply, we ought to hesitate before we place. on type the very high duty which is proposed. It is another matter whether the Committee should take the extreme course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> To my mind, we ought at all times to go very slowly before we attempt to levy any duty which is likely to retard the spread of newspapers. Whatever may be said against individual newspapers, our press, as a whole, is one of which Australia can be proud. It does exceedingly useful work, and does it very often in places which the larger and stronger newspapers, for some reason or other, do not penetrate. For these reasons, I hope that the Committee will pay some little regard, not merely to the interests of individual proprietors of newspapers, but also to the interests of that scattered section of the community which they so diligently serve. </para>

                    <para>. - I find that according to the official statistics of the Commonwealth we imported in  1906 £9,032  worth of printers' materials, including circles, clumps, curves, paring knives, rules, leads, slugs, and type. It cannot be said that we are dealing with an industry which is likely to develop largely, inasmuch as type has been replaced to a great extent by linotype machines. I desire to give a fair amount of protection to every industry ; but, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> has got along fairly well without a duty, it seems to me that a protection of  20  per cent. is too high. It will affect those whom we do not want to affect prejudicially, namely, the owners of small newspaper and jobbing offices. </para>

                        <para>- It is really the small printing houses which have to depend upon type. Even if the establishment which has been discussed here so freely should be developed much more largely than it has been, a large quantity of ornamental and fancy type would have to be imported in order to satisfy the demands of customers. This industry has advanced to a certain stage without any assistance, and I think if we impose duties of  10  and  15  per cent. the protection given will be ample. </para>

It follows obviously that countries which are old must be ahead of a country which is entirely new. Now, one hundred years ago, America was very materially behind the United Kingdom in this regard. By adopting the plan which we are proposing to adopt here, America has got ahead of the United Kingdom in the production of type faces. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that from an authority on the subject. It is an argument justifying an increase of the duty in order that the local manufacturer may be protected from the aggression of outsiders, whose interests we are not called upon to specially consider. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble,</inline> in his evidence, said that his prices were the English prices, plus the cost of importing type from Great Britain, and the honorable senator inferred from that, that in future the prices of the locally manufactured article would be the English prices plus the cost of importing, and plus the duty. There is no justification for that assumption, but we are, I think, entitled to assume that the English prices are based to some extent on the fact that there isa competing firm in Australia. Reference has been made to a particular firm, but we are, of course, concerned only about the establishment of the industry. The gentleman carrying on the manufacture of type at present in Australia must in time go out of the business, but we hope that the industry will remain for the advantage of Australians yet unborn. </para>

The printers ask that they be protected from high duties, as they have to import most of their type.

                    <para>The representative of the Caxlon Type Foundry had previously been secretary to the Printers' Overseers' Society of New South Wales. In addition to the evidence summarised in the report of the  Chairman,  this witness stated there were only two or three type foundries to supply the whole of the English-speaking world ; it would not pay to design one " face," even if every printer in Australia would take a font. The expense of designing was great, and frequently several fonts were designed, but only one might " catch on." He stated that makers in Australia did not design, they simply get a cast of a new " face." The complainant he stated sold his type in New Zealand against the makers of other countries, and did a fair share of the business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble's</inline> prices in Sydney were from 2d. to 6d. per lb. more than those of the firm the witness represented, and the Australian maker paid freight on his goods sold in New Zealand. </para>
                    <para>In the matter of labour, the witness asserted that the wages cost could not be much, as one automatic machine would turn out£100 in a day, or perhaps half a day. He believed, however, the Australian maker had only hand machines. </para>

                <para class="block">He also stated that he had seen youths employed in the Australian factory doing work, which, in America, is done by men. We shall be doing a great injustice if we extract money from the public for the further assistance of one manufacturing firm that is already doing well. When one type foundry can very easily supply the whole demand for type of a kind in Australia there is no justification for the high duty proposed for the protection of the industry. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot permit the item to pass without saying something on the subject. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has moved a request that the item shall be free. I cannot support the honorable senator. I have the greatest possible sympathy with the small newspaper proprietors and jobbing printers throughout Australia, because I happen to have been one of them myself. I must, however, admit that it has been a great advantage to them to be able to obtain what they require in Australia without having to depend upon anything they might get through agents from the Old Country or America. Reference has been made to a certain firm at present engaged in the business of casting type in Sydney. I have done business with the firm for years. So far as my experience of them goes they have always charged reasonable rates, and their work has been thoroughly good. It remains to be said that the almost universal adoption of such machines as monotypes, monolines, and linotypes has greatly altered the conditions of this industry, and has made it less remunerative. In the circumstances I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> not to press his request. I consider that the industry requires some protection, and, although I am not prepared with some of my ultra-protectionist friends opposite to suggest the highest possible duty which the Committee might be induced to accept, I think there is room in this case for the adoption of such a compromise as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">No evidence before the Committee justifies the duty now proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble,</inline> himself, when before the Commission, stated that his list prices were English prices, plus the cost of importing English type, say,  71/2  to  10  per cent. In view of that statement, what becomes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> contention that the local type was lower in price than the imported type? The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in introducing the Tariff, claimed as a justification for granting a reasonable amount of protection the high wages paid to Australian workmen as compared with the low wages paid in Great Britain, and in other parts of the world. That justification cannot be advanced in this instance, because it is a fact sworn to that the wages paid in American and in British type foundries are higher than the wages paid in Australia. That being so, what earthly excuse can there be for a duty of  20  per cent, on this item? With regard to prices, it appears that an agent of one of the importing firms was examined by the Tariff Commission, and he stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> sold his type in New Zealand against the makes of other countries, and did a fair share of the business. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble's</inline> prices in Sydney were from  2d.  to  6d.  per lb. more than those of the firm he represented, whilst the Australian maker paid freight and expenses on his goods sold in New Zealand. All the evidence goes to show that the local manufacture of type has been getting on well without protection. That should prove to my honorable friends opposite that there is something better than protection, and that is a man's own determination to succeed. This man has succeeded, and yet my honorable friends opposite come here whining for him as if he were one of those doddering lean-up-against-a-post sort of people who cannot get on without the assistance of a Tariff duty. </para>

                        <para>- I believe the statements contained in the circular respecting the wages paid in . the type foundries in America and in Sydney. I am satisfied, without being possessed of absolute confirmation of the statements made in the circular, that the wages paid in England are lower than those paid in Sydney. I am also satisfied with regard to the American conditions. Of course, however, there are in the large type foundries of England and  America men who are really artists in this line, and whose business it is to design founts of type. They are designers of a high order, and of course receive very high salaries indeed. But those who occupy subordinate positions in the type foundries are not as well paid as men doing similar work in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the duty of  10  per cent, as being a' fair compromise, and a duty more than sufficient to enable this industry to  develop. I am glad to know that the only type- founding industry in the Commonwealth is in New South Wales.I have the pleasure of knowing the firm. But it will be granted that Wimble and Company have established their business without any duty whatever,-. They have built up an industry that is a credit to themselves and to Australia, without Tariff assistance. My policy is to support <inline font-style="italic">low</inline> duties, or no duties whatever, on articles that affect either, the food of the people or food for the brain. I look upon the development of literature in all its surroundings as vitally connected with the progress of Australasia. To put a tax on type would be to hamper the progress of the newspaper press and of our magazine literature. While in the future there may be a development in type manufacturing sufficient to meet all the requirements of Australian business, yet at present we must recognise that our printers have to depend largely upon importations. For this reason it is my intention to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> request. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [11.56 a.m.]. - This is one of those cases, where the industry in question is established in my own State. I should be following illustrious examples in this Committee if I were to support a duty which- would benefit the firm concerned. But, on the other hand, there are scores and hundreds of printers who are extremely desirous that a duty may not be placed - or, at all events,' not a' heavy one - on the type of which they are constant users. Upon the principle of " the greatest good of the greatest number," which has actuated me throughout these Tariff discussions, I must reluctantly give a vote that will perhaps operate against this particular firm. But I must give that vote notwithstanding any effect that it may have upon the establishment in question. Scattered all through New South Wales are hundreds of newspapers, the majority of which are struggling quite as hard and quite as honestly as is this type-founding firm. This Committee should not consider one class of business to the detriment of a very much larger number of other classes of business. The proposal to put on a. duty of 20 per cent. - which as every one knows is in practice 22 per cent., on account of the manner in which the duty is calculated -on- type that has hitherto been duty free, is one that does not appeal to me; and I honestly believe that the firm that has been referred to as the one type-making firm of Australia, is not so greedy as to require anything of the sort. This firm started under free-trade. It started without any adventitious aid from Customs duties. It -has carried on its operations with credit to itself, and advantage to the community. As far as I know, it is not anxious for any such duty as is proposed in the schedule. The lower rate of duty that has been suggested, 10 per cent. - actually 11 per cent. - is, in my humble opinion, a very satisfactory start in the direction of protection for a firm that has never had any protection before. It is a reasonable advance, if there is to be an advance at all.  While one firm may not obtain under the reduced duty the advantage that has been held out by the Government proposals, on the other hand a very large number of printers and publishers throughout the Commonwealth will derive advantage from the lower duty.. Indeed, when I spoke of my own State, I was only comparing the . one firm with the many. If I extend my consideration to the whole Commonwealth, I have to ask myself whether one firm ought to be greatly . advantaged, whilst hundreds, if hot. thousands, of printers throughout Australia are disadvantaged.

To benefit the makers of one class of type to the disadvantage of every one else in the trade - a trade that must import because it cannot otherwise buy what it wants - is really one of those proposals which, however well meant, is very unfortunate indeed in its incidence, and very unfair. I shall feel it to be my duty to support the lower duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane.</inline> Indeed, I have given notice of some such request as that submitted, and therefore, in supporting it now, I am only supporting that which I had determined upon bringing forward three months ago. </para>

                <para class="block">It is extraordinary that it should be proposed to make dutiable patented articles for fighting one of the most devastating scourges against which we have to contend. In hundreds of townships in the Commonwealth there is no such thing as a water supply and a fire brigade. At such places, as well as in isolated homesteads, hand appliances, such as come under the item, are the only means of fighting what the newspapers are fond of referring to as the fire fiend. Firemen's helmets, fire hoses, and other fire brigade equipment, is free, and it seems, therefore, the more absurd to place hand fire extinguishers within the grasp of the tax gatherer. There is no proposal to make lifebelts and lifebuoys dutiable, because the mind revolts from anything that would lessen the means of saving life. But it is similarly insane to make it more difficult to obtain the means of preventing the destruction of property, and, perhaps, of life. It may be that the item is an oversight, but I hope that, if so, . the Government will rectify its mistake. The revenue can benefit but little by the tax, although the duty will press heavily upon those to whom hand fire extinguishers are a protection against loss and danger to life. </para>

                    <para>. -In  New South Wales the maintenance of fire brigades is subsidized by the Government, and it, therefore, seems ridiculous that the Commonwealth Government should levy a tax on a means of fighting fires. Hand fire extinguishers must be regarded as a means of preventing not only the loss of property, but also loss of life. The awful calamity which occurred recently in the United States of America appalled us all : but we should have felt it even more had it happened in our own country. It should serve as a warning against putting difficulties in the way of the freest distribution of all means for the extinction of fires. </para>

                    <para>. - If I were quite sure that a proper definition and limitation is used in this item, I would say that it would not matter whether the duty was 15 or 40 per cent., because these fire extinguishers are merely vessels of the simplest construction, which any tinker could make, being filled with a chemical mixture which, when liberated, promptly extinguishes incipient fires. The manufacture of these articles is almost too insignificant to bother about ; but they are so readily made that the effect of the duty will not be to penalize those who use them. </para>

                    that hand fire extinguishers are not defined, and insist merely upon the necessity of preventing fires at all hazards. Under the old Tariff, these extinguishers were free, and certainly if the necessaries of life should be free, means for rapidly extinguishing fires, which may mean much loss to business men, city householders, or persons in the country, and, possibly, occasionally the sacrifice of life, should be similarly treated. If the articles are so simple that they can be easily made here, it is not necessary to impose a duty to protect their manufacture. It would be very much better for us to present this Tariff to the people of Australia without the blot which the imposition of the proposed duty will involve.

                    I am justified in saying that I possess an expert knowledge of fire extinguishers, inasmuch as for many years I was a fire insurance manager in Australia. Honorable senators may accept my assurance that upon premises in which these appliances are installed, it is customary for the fire insurance offices to reduce the premiums which the owners or occupiers are required to pay.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline>
                    has remarked that we might just as well import iron buckets. If that be so, why did he previously affirm that fire extinguishers were constructed of glass? As a matter of fact, many of them are composed of very brittle material. When a fire occurs they are simply thrown upon the flames. The force of the impact liberates their chemical contents which are precipitated upon the outbreak. I sympathize very strongly with what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>

                    have said regarding these appliances being designed for the protection of life, as well as of property. I desire to point out that the destruction of property by fire involves the entire community in a loss by reason of a valuable asset having -been dissipated.

I have been a resident of Australia for  40  years, and I have never seen one of these appliances to my knowledge. But I understand that their construction is very simple, and that they are being made in the Commonwealth' The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission have recommended a duty of  20  per cent, upon this item, and the free-trade section of that body a duty of  15  per cent.

                    <para>. - I hope that- the proposed duty will be agreed to. We know perfectly well that in the old days the remedy provided in case of an outbreak of fire was a bucket of water, and the city regulations stipulated that a certain number of these fire buckets should be supplied upon each flat of establishments where boarders were taken. That state of things has now disappeared, and in every large establishment there is a fire extinguisher handy. These appliances are made in the Commonwealth. Why, then, should we purchase them abroad? I take it that our first duty is to protect our own workmen and manufacturers. If the latter cannot succeed with the aid of a duty of  20  per cent., it will then be time enough for us to import these fire extinguishers. In my judgment the proposed duty is a very necessary one. The standard of living in Australia is higher than it is in Germany, where many of these articles are made. The German will not send them here if he has to pay  20  per cent, in duty. The people of Australia will not have to pay this duty. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> advocate that no protection should be given to the Australian workman, who should be brought down to the standard of workmen in Hamburg and Berlin ?

                    LEDGER (Queensland) the question from the proper point of. view. If an extinguisher, infinitely superior to anything made in Australia, was made and patented in Germany, or the United States, no Australian municipality or Government would fail to purchase it, even if it cost 20 per cent. more. The duty would not prevent an article, which was 50 per cent. more effective, from being brought in, and so would not protect the Australian workman. Even if it did, it would be putting the whole of the community to an unnecessary expense, because the manufacturers in Germany or the United States would add the duty to the cost of the article.

                    <para>. - The fire extinguisher referred to is simply an enclosed cylinder with one outlet, filled with water holding bicarbonate of soda in solution. When it is put into use sulphuric acid is brought into contact with the carbonate, and from the chemical reaction that follows carbonic acid gas is given off. That gas and water are effective for some distance in extinguishing fires. These appliances are very useful about a household. I have been able to assist in the extinguishing of two fires with them. They are simple in construction, and, instead of paying 30s. each for them, if they were made here as a regular industry they could be obtained for 15s., or, at the most,£1 a-piece. </para>

                    <para>- I am surprised that my honorable friend should bring against me an accusation which is based on an entire misapprehension. 1 believe that there is no honorable senator who has been more regular in his efforts to secure British preference than I have. On this occasion I wish to secure a preference for the workpeople who are taxed, if not for the protection of our shores, at least for. the protection of the great trade which goes between Australia and England and other parts of the world. The work-people of England, who are taxed to maintain her vast navy, to some large extent assist in the protection of our shores and the maintenance of peace along our tremendous coastline, which approximates in length to that of Europe. Surely they have some claim upon the good-will of Australia as compared with foreign nations who maintain forces and navies, certainly not in our interest. On this broad ground alone I ask that the workers of England may have the little advantage which a differentiating duty affords. </para>

Of course, the phrases "following the flag" and "following the advantage of a duty" merely represent the existence of an interest either personal or national.

                        <para>- I am getting tired of these assertions based upon a splendid optimism, and a hopeless hope. I am really weary of the statement that everything can be made here, or is going to be made here. The honorable senator, who is piloting this miscellaneous schedule through an unwilling Committee, is entirely dependent for his knowledge of the various items of the Tariff on something that filters to his ear now and again from a certain quarter. As a member of the Federal Legislature, I protest against this kind of legislation. It appears that the whole fiscal policy of the country, as involved in this Tariff, is to be based upon nothing better than the whispered information of gentlemen who are, no doubt, very honest and honorable, but whose very years preclude the possibility of their having compassed the sum of human knowledge. This is the fifth or sixth Tariff that I have had a hand in framing in Australia, and I have never before witnessed such a state of affairs. Ministers, without the smallest possible business knowledge, or the remotest connexion with any one of the thousand and one trades affected by the Tariff, are acting as the conduit pipe for information supplied by gentlemen who are certainly not senior officers of the Customs Department. It is unheard of that Ministers should play in Parliament merely the part of a Post-office for passing from left to right information tendered by officers of the Customs Department whose position does not constitute them even responsible officers. </para>

                        <para>- He probably would not know anything more about the subject being discussed. I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is a distinguished member of the learned profession to which he belongs, but that does not constitute him an "Admirable Crichton," or an authority on " music stool screws, engravers' set screws, brake, and plough screws, table, roofing, and spiral screws." I venture to say that the honorable senator does not even know what is meant by the words "engravers' set screws." If the honorable senator admits that he knows nothing about these matters, and it is honorable on his part to do so, we should, at least, have senior officers of the Customs Department present; competent by knowledge and experience to give the information required by the Committee. But it would require the box in which the officers sit to be enlarged tenfold to provide accommodation for all the officials who would be necessary to give us reasonable knowledge of what is going on. </para>

                        <para>- That is a reflection on the Chair, and I hope that sort of thing will not continue. I say again that it would require very much more room than is provided for departmental officers to accommodate all the authorities whom the Minister ought to be in a position to consult, seeing that he knows nothing about the important matters that come within the purview of this particular item. It is impossible for an officer of the Customs to know all about the manufactures of the whole Commonwealth. It is ridiculous to suppose that gentlemen concerned with the landing of goods, and that particular aspect of commerce, should know all that transpires in every portion of the Commonwealth in connexion with manufacturing. Notwithstanding the inquiries made from the Ministerial Bench about the manufacture of various articles, I venture to say that statements concerning their manufacture have been made without a. scintilla of information from the sources from which the Vice-President of the Executive Council draws his fiscal inspiration. I affirm that a very large number of these screws are not made in the Commonwealth. It is absurd to suppose, for instance, that the few screws that can possibly be required for music stools should be made within the Commonwealth at a price that would enable the makers to compete with the great output of European manufactures, to say nothing of Continental makers. The variety of machinery required for turning out the articles included in this item absolutely precludes the possibility of those articles being made in Australia at a profit ;  because any factory established in Australia would not be able to work more than three months in the year without overtaking the demand. While we have so small a demand we can never manufacture successfully in competition with makers who are able to afford constant employment for their workmen in the production of these articles. I say again that these things are not made here, and it is childish - and worse than childish - to assert that they are. The articles included in item  175A  are very largely required in our industries. To that extent a duty would be a tax upon the very industries that honorable senators opposite profess a desire to support. It is mere childishness to impose a tax so as to put money into the pocket of a man on one side of him, whilst the tax-gatherer empties his pocket on the other side. I hope that my request will be agreed to by the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should not have troubled to rise again except for the most unwarranted attack made by my honorable friend, who has just resumed his seat, on the officers who are present for the purpose of assisting me, and assisting the Committee; and whose duty it has been for many months past to give a close and searching investigation to every item in the Tariff. I do not pretend to be altogether inexperienced in dealing with Tariffs; but I do say this - that any parliamentarian, with no more than a week's experience, would know that a Minister in charge of such a measure is obliged to depend largely upon the aid and guidance of experienced officers of the Customs, such as have been deputed to make special inquiries for the purpose of enabling the Government to come to a determination as to what a particular duty should be. It is only fair that I should say that I have had the advantage of consultation with the officers referred to constantly during the last six or eight weeks. I have invariably found them to be capable and well informed men. It has been their special duty to make inquiries for the purpose of assisting the Minister and Parliament. Under all. these circumstances, why they should have been subjected to these most unwarranted reflections - which are hardly consonant with the usual courtesy of my honorable friend - I cannot understand. What have they been doing? Simply performing their duty. Their ability is beyond dispute. We are much indebted to the assistance they have given to us. As regards the item itself, I did hot lightly make the statement that these articles are made in the Commonwealth. Under the old Victorian Tariff, we had industries established for the manufacture of this particular class of screws. While it is true that during the period of the Commonwealth the industry has suffered through want of assistance in the way of a duty, and has been languishing, the manufacturers have been clamorous - and reasonably clamorous - to get the benefit of a duty again for the purpose of rehabilitating their industry. We have been satisfied from inquiries we have made, and from the production of patterns of screws which are actually made in the Commonwealth, that these articles are made here. Why then should not the industry be protected ? It is relying upon that information, and upon the investigations to which I have already referred, that the item is now submitted to the Committee. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [2.56]. - The statement of the Vice-President either proves too much or too little. He alleges that his source of information is absolutely outside human cavil. That is nonsense on the face of it, because there is nothing in this world of ours that is not open to question, and commonly the subject of mistake. The honorable senator knows that a Royal Commission was. in existence for years taking sworn evidence all through the Common wealth. That Commission visited towns where I venture to say the authorities to whom

                        <para>- The other Chamber was satisfied, I suppose, on proof adduced at some ungodly hour in the morning . We know that this Tariff was put through in a hurry to enable honorable members to get away to their homes at Christmas - a very laudable ambition, no doubt. But that way of dealing with it has thrown upon honorable senators a very large amount of work in trying to adjust anomalies that were made elsewhere. Before sitting down I wish to disclaim the accusation that the Minister made against me by implication, that I had said something that was derogatory to the gentlemen who have been supplying him with information. I have done nothing of the kind. But I say that if the Minister admits himself to be incapable, he should have at hand the highest and most responsible authority in the Customs Department to supply him with evidence, and should not have to depend upon the statements merely of most worthy, most well-intentioned, but necessarily not very experienced officers. That is all I have to say. I suppose it is recognised in every walk of life that experience is worth something as well as knowledge laboriously gained. I utterly repudiate the idea that I have made one remark that can be considered as discourteous to the gentlemen who are supplying the Government with information. I do not for an instant suppose that they do other than their very best. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [3.18]. - I do not rise to oppose the request, but to point out the strange commentary which it affords on the whole of the Tariff. Now we are let in to see the genesis of some, probably all, of the items. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline>
                    has interjected, this is a kind of composite duty. It appears to have been inserted, not to encourage an Australian manufacturer, but to encourage some British or outside manufacturer, or person not a manufacturer, who has been pulling the leg of the Ministry, and telling them that if they would impose a duty he would come here and make these screws. I think that a tariff framed on any principle of that kind is not one which we ought to seriously consider. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has many items of that description in the Tariff he ought to call our attention to them. It is really an insult to the Parliament to be told that a line was solemnly placed in the Tariff on the mere suggestion of an outsider that he would come here and manufacture the article if a duty were imposed. That is a very disgraceful way of framing a Tariff, and a still more disgraceful way of bringing it under the notice of the Senate.

                    <para>. - I understand that these duties of. 5s. 6d. and 5s. per cwt. on wood screws have been collected for some months. It is well that the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> should be made very public. He has told us in so many words that because some one interviewed the Minister, the. Government decided to insert this item, with the result that every man who has imported wood screws since that event has been compelled to pay a duty, which he has just admitted to the Committee, is utterly unwarranted. It is the practice of the Ministry not to refund any money which has been collected, no matter under what circumstances. The importers of wood screws since the 29th November, when this paragraph was inserted in the item, will have to suffer simply because the Ministry were fooled with a statement made by somebody, undisclosed to them, that if a duty were imposed, an industry would be established. </para>

                        <para>- Its imposition was an act of gross injustice; in fact a contemptible act. Fortunately we have had from the Minister an open admission which throws a very searching light indeed upon the way in which the Tariff has been framed. Every man who has imported screws in the interval has been deliberately fleeced by a Ministry only too ready to listen to an idle tale coming from any source. I think that the whole proceeding has been a scandal. </para>

                        <para>. - This item embraces a large proportion of the machinery used in mining. Paragraphs a, b, and c are practically on the same footing, and deal with three different kinds of mining machinery - that for ordinary mining, ore dressing appliances, and smelting appliances. I do not think that any words of mine can summarize the position with regard to the mining industry in a better way than has already been attempted by the members of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. I propose to ask honorable senators to listen to the conclusions at which they arrived after most careful consideration and the closest attention to the whole of the evidence given on the subject. I quote from page 17 of the report of that section of the Commission. " We accordingly find - </para>

                <para>I add a little to that by saying that we are to-day of necessity forced to consider which of two industries is of the greater importance. There is obviously a conflict of interests between mining and the manufacture of mining machinery and appliances. The free-trade section of the Commission have emphasized the fact  that this question remains to be solved, and that the Commonwealth is invited to say whether it is more desirable to  encourage  the manufacture of mining machinery or the development of mining itself. </para>

I add that these mining propositions are in every State with, perhaps, the exception of Western Australia, rendered still more low-grade by the present reduced prices of metals. If they are not worked at a profit, sooner or later they must cease to provide a wages fund, and they must continue to be worked although the price of copper now. shows a fall of£50 a ton, of lead, £8 per ton, and of tin, from £200 to £130 per ton. whilst silver has fallen in value about 25 per cent.

Many representatives of engineering firms stated frankly that they recognised that their existence depended entirely upon the continued development in Australia of the mining industry. They further admitted that a large proportion of engineering work arising from the development of mining in Australia would, in any circumstances, and with or without the imposition of duties under a Tariff, come to them. They admitted indirectly that they derived quite a considerable benefit from the introduction of new and special mining plant and machinery. I state definitely that they often assumed an attitude, so to speak, of friendliness towards progressive mining companies that desire to develop their mines to the fullest capacity. They said that the foundry work which incidentally they were given as the result of the development of mines by the use of appliances patented and manufactured elsewhere, was of immense benefit to them. We must all know that there is no mine equipped on a large scale in Australia at the present time that does not spend a great deal of money in the various foundries established in Australia.

                </list>
                <para class="block">The statement that the establishment of local foundries has interfered with InterState trade puts in a nutshell a vast number of the complaints we had in dealing, not only with this item, but with other items in the Tariff. Some of the States, by reason of the fact that their manufacturing establishments had had a much longer start than those in other States, had been accustomed to supply foundry work to the other States. They began to find that this work was falling off. Victorian manufacturers immediately came to the conclusion that the Tariff was the cause. With respect to the work which they did for Western Australian mines, it became obvious to every member of the Tariff Commission that the Victorian foundries had lost some work simply and solely as the result of InterState competition, and not because of competition from abroad. They lost a certain amount of work in Western Australia because foundries were started in that State, which, for the last two or three years, have been turning out work which was previously done in the Victorian foundries. That is a healthy state of things, with which we do riot wish to interfere. Inter-State competition is desirable, but it is not desirable that manufacturers should attribute a falling off in their trade to the Tariff, which is really due to the establishment of healthy competition in the other States, thus erroneously blaming the Tariff for one of the obvious effects of Inter- State free-trade.I should like to say a word with respect to the statement about the large quantity of second-hand machinery that has been utilized and the general dullness in mining in most of the States. If I had taken care to provide myself with detailed particulars, I could have given specific instances showing that Melbourne firms have been making large profits over a long series of years by passing on from first to second to third and fourth hand old and comparatively useless machinery, which they manufactured many years ago. On the mining fields of Ballarat and Bendigo to-day you can find machinery that has been used for a dozen different mines, and that has been bought and sold by the same engineering firm for use by different mining companies. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that one could give a very interesting statement with regard to the promotion of mining companies in Victoria, and the methods with which they are carried on. But I say without fear of the slightest contradiction or qualification, that a leading firm in Melbourne has for years been making large profits out of buying and selling this old machinery time after time for use by mining companies. Well now, the first deduction that one can make from that sort of thing is that it would be extremely difficult for the mining industry of Victoria to be carried to a successful issue if carried on as mining is conducted in Western Australia, with the most up-to-date methods. You find there the best and most economical mining appliances which the world can produce. Every one who knows anything about Western Australian mining is aware that upon the possibility of securing that machinery the future welfare of the State depends. The same remark applies with equal force to other parts of Australia. </para>

There is a certain amount of specialized machinery which is made mostly in America, .though occasionally in England, the demand for which is limited, the value of which can hardly be overrated or overstated, but with regard to which we were told by witnesses before the Tariff Commission quite fairly and frankly that it would not pay a foundry owner to put up a plant to make it in this country. The reason for that, of course, is that the demand for machinery of that highly specialized class would necessarily be very limited, and intermittent. While it may pay foundrymen in America, where mining is conducted on an infinitely larger scale than in any other part of the world, to equip themselves to turn put this highly specialized kind of machinery, it would be simply madness for any foundry in Australia to make an effort to produce it. Even if we were to put on a duty of  50  per cent, it would still be bad business for any foundryman in Australia to attempt to equip many of the mines in this .

This letter is dated 30th January of the present year, and is signed by the secretary of the Chamber. It says - </para>

                    <para>I am directed by my Executive Council to draw your attention to the serious injury that the Tariff, if finally passed in its present form, will have on the mining industry of Australia, and especially of Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>The special Committee of the Chamber, appointed to deal with this question, has carefully examined the Tariff in the form in which it left the House of Representatives. Some slight alleviation of the great burden that it imposed on the mining industry is certainly noticeable. The duties in some instances have been reduced, and the free list has been extended, but these changes constitute a comparatively insignificant improvement. A close analysis shows that the Tariff, as it now stands, means that the mining industry of Western Australia alone is still taxed to the extent of over £50,000 a year more than it was taxed under the sufficiently burdensome Tariff of 1902. </para>
                    <para>My Council feel deeply disappointed at this result, particularly in view of the great pains that were 'taken to impress on members of the House of Representatives the severe penalties that an increase in the duties on mining machinery and supplies would impose on an industry that has done so much for the country - an industry that has, unhappily, of late been struggling hard against many adverse conditions. </para>

                    <para>On 27th and 28th August, 1907, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council respectively passed a ' resolution stating that the Federal Tariff would " most injuriously affect the primary industries of Western Australia, and would subject the State to . a period of depression, fraught with the gravest danger to her existence." That resolution, -declaring, as it did, that the Federal Tariff would bring about a period of depression endangering the very existence of Western Australia, was carried unanimously in the Legislative Council, whilst amongst the fifty members of the Legislative Assembly only six voted against it in that Chamber. The address that was then prepared from the State Parliament to the Federal Parliament could not, unfortunately, be presented owing to some constitutional difficulty, but it affirmed that, as the result of the Tariff - " The purchasing power of wages will be diminished, avenues of labour will be closed, the number of unemployed will be increased, and both workers and tradesmen in our midst must suffer severely." </para>
                    <para class="block">The five Western Australian members of the House of Representatives showed by their voting in regard to the duties on mining machinery and supplies that they indorsed the strong pronouncement of the State Parliament, irrespective of party differences. Some of those members were returned to support the policy of protection, but they evidently recognised that the case was one where high duties, even from the protectionist point of view, would be a serious mistake, as such duties would do infinitely more harm to a great industry than they would do good to any other industry. The thanks of Western Australia are due to those five gentlemen for the unanimous stand they made in the direction of relieving the Tariff burden from mining. Unfortunately, the results of their efforts were not as successful as they deserved to be, and the Chamber confidently appeals to the Senate in the hope that they will see how essential it is for the welfare of Australia to relieve the raining industry of the Commonwealth, employing as it does over 111,000 persons, of as many Tariff restrictions as possible. </para>

                    (New. South Wales) [4.3]. - We might reasonably have some regard on this item for the struggling mining industry, not only of Western Australia, but of the Commonwealth. There are hundreds of mines that are not paying dividends, and never have paid one. A few months ago, the official returns showed that there were only twenty mines in Western Australia paying dividends, some of them as low as£1,000 for the twelve months. In other cases, the dividends were much larger. But where is the list of the struggling mines? Over 400 of them have been registered in London alone. We might show some reasonable regard for persons who jeopardize their lives and money in an effort to win from far below the surface that wealth which contributes to the wellbeing of this great community. Perhaps the proposal to make the item free is too drastic to hope for success. If it is defeated, I shall move a less drastic request, but I feel that I may do far worse than vote for it. We cannot hope to gain wealth from below the ground without expensive and extensive machinery. The methods of to-day are not those of the antiquated pick, shovel, and cradle. To win mineral wealth from the soil now requires the most elaborate and costly machinery that human ingenuity has yet devised. We should not impose such duties as appear in the schedule upon an industry which produces not only wealth for the community, but a livelihood for tens of thousands engaged in it. We should extend the greatest possible consideration to an industry which, while extremely profitable to the few, is a matter of great loss and the most complete uncertainty to the vast majority who embark in it.

I know, as a protectionist, that many of the bigger machines -used in mining can well be made in Australia. Big winding engines, mills, stampers, and so forth, can be produced here nearly as well as in any other part of the world. I shall not vote to' injure any well-established industries of that kind, but the question of the manufacture of other machines, such as rock-drills - a much more specialized piece of machinery - should be considered. Much has been done on the surface to improve the processes of gold mining, but' if we exclude rock drills, we shut out the only tool of trade that can be said to have come to the front in modern times to assist mining below ground. I have made careful inquiry into the making of rock-drills in Victoria. I believe there is a company engaged in that work on a small scale at Bendigo, but they have no representative or office, so far as I could discover, in Melbourne. No witness gave evidence on their behalf before the Tariff Commission, and the  Chairman  of the Commission candidly admitted that all he had from the company was a solitary letter that had been mislaid. We have no evidence that the company desire increased protection. They had a protection of <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> J per cent, for the last five years ; but, notwithstanding that the whole of the Com-' mon wealth has been open to them as a market, the Taylor-Horsfield machine has declined considerably. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to harm the company. I wish them to have a fair field, and shall say against them nothing that I cannot prove. There were a few of their machines in Kalgoorlie years ago, but to-day the American and English makes hold the field, and the Australian made drill is almost  an unknown quantity. The rock-drill lends itself to improvement, and great improvements have recently been made in it. Years ago, it took two or three men to work it, but now one man can produce satisfactory results from the more modern machinery. The history of our attempt to foster the making of rock-drills in Australia is not encouraging. In . paragraph  e,  coal-cutting machines are dutiable at 5 per cent, and free. They are equally tools of trade with the rock-drill. I doubt, if most honorable senators would know one from the other. They are used for practically the same purpose. One cuts coal and the other rock, otherwise there is very little difference between them. As regards outward appearance, driving force, and general mechanism, they are practically identical. When the coal miner's tools of trade are placed on the free list, what justification is there for levying duties of 20 and 15 per cent, on a similar machine for the gold-miner? It can be reasonably argued that the rock- drill is just as much a tool of trade as is any one which has been exempted. It must be remembered that either directly or indirectly most of our industries have derived some advantage from our protectionist policy, but no one has yet said that such assistance can be extended to gold mining. If a heavier load is to be placed on any one industry, it should not be- put on that which can get no assistance from our protectionist policy. When it is remembered that agriculturists and others have got a lower duty placed on their tools of trade, it will be seen that a very unfair duty is being imposed on this item. I desire to quote some evidence given before the Tariff Commission in Western Australia by a gentleman who undoubtedly, from his very calling, was interested in securing as much protection as possible to his industry. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hasforth,</inline> Secretary to the Engineers' Society at Kalgoorlie. When he was asked what articles which were used in connexion with gold mining, and could be made in Australia, should be protected, and. what articles should be placed on the free list, because they could not be made here, the rock drill was one of the few articles which he singled out to be exempted. I take it that by reason of his intimate acquaintance with mining operations, his statement ought to carry much more weight with a deliberative assembly than almost any other evidence which could be obtained. Ve all know how enthusiastic a protectionist the average engineer is. As regards every other kind of machinery, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hasforth</inline> is a strong protectionist, but he recommends that the rock drill should be placed on the free list, because, in his opinion, it cannot be made here successfully..  His  statement to that effect was made in the presence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and notwithstanding the fact that the Horsefield drill is supposed to be made in Bendigo, no protectionist member of the Tariff Commission questioned its accuracy-. That, to my mind, is very significant indeed. If we desire to do justice to the mining industry, we ought, in the interests of all concerned, to reduce the duties on tools of trade as far as possible. The Americans are exerting their utmost efforts to perfect the rock drill. I can state from personal knowledge that already they have effected very great improvements. It would be a great mistake to shut out any assistance which we can get from that quarter to make mining below ground more profitable than it has been, especially when they can supply us with a much better machine than we can make. </para>

                    <para>. - I have quite as serious a complaint to lodge against this item as had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> I recognise the difficulties against which the mining industry has to contend, and am prepared to extend to its conductors every facility which will enable them to proceed on payable and progressive lines. This item almost shatters the hopes of every one who has considered that the Tariff ought to be fair in its application. I cannot see how, owing to the arrangement of the item, it is possible for us to act on anything like fair lines. In Western Australia a very large proportion of the mining machinery has been purchased from South Australia, Victoria, and wherever else in the Commonwealth suitable articles could be obtained. This item is placed before us by the Ministry without any record of the transactions in mining machinery which have been going on between the States. They have not furnished us in detail with the articles which are usable and procurable here. They submit the item in a sort of conglomerate fashion. If we only knew what it meant we could at once pick out the machinery which we are positive is not being made, and is not likely to be made, here for some time to come. In that way we could relieve the mining industry of many of the difficulties with which it is contending today. Let me give a case in point. In Coolgardie there is a very low-grade mine which is paying a dividend on a production of about from 6 to 8 dwts. per ton. It is only paying a dividend because it has been enabled to obtain the most up-to-date machinery for the treatment of low-grade ores. If we impose excessive duties for the sake of assisting an industry which employs from 1 5, 000 to  1  6,000 men to try to do something, we shall impede the progress and development of an industry which is employing a little over 120,000 men. </para>

The moment a Tariff of any kind was applied to the Tasmanian mines it would become cumbersome and unscientific, thereby fleecing an industry which has no possible means of receiving any direct advantage-and indeed very little indirect benefit -from any kind of Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely, and I gave my vote for every protection to the woollen industry. It is impossible to apply to the mining industry the same line of reasoning or the same application of a protective Tariff. I frankly admit that I argue on free-trade lines in dealing with the mining industry, because I recognise that the machinery requirements of the Commonwealth for many years to come will not require the employment of anything like the number of people employed in the mining industry in Australia to-day. It is probable that the mines at present being worked are capable of supporting a larger number of persons than they are supporting to-day, but if they are to continue to give employment to the number already employed, they must be given every facility to treat the low-grade ores of which there is  such an abundance in every State of Australia. Another phase of the question requires to be considered. We have high-grade but refractory ores, which can only be successfully treated by machinery which has been perfected as the result of scientific investigation and years of study. I referred some time ago to machinery of this class, the manufacture of which has not yet been attempted in Australia. I pointed out that on the landing of a machine of this kind £1,500 in duty was levied under this Tariff upon the owners of one mine in Western Australia, merely because they required for their operations a special kind of engine which might not be required by twenty other mines in the Commonwealth in half a century. No one would dream for a moment of building up mechanical engineering works to supply a demand for twenty of these machines within twenty-five or fifty years. It would not pay to do so. I wish for a moment to be allowed Co refer, though a little out of their place, to coal -cutting machines. In connexion with them, the Government have again made a very grave mistake as the result of a lack of information. They have proposed that they shall be dutiable at 5 per cent. under the general Tariff, and that if imported from the United Kingdom they shall be free of duty. Ministers had only to look up the question in order to discover that England, with all the mechanical skill at her command, is actually working her coal mines with coal cutting machines made in America. We are asked under this Tariff to impose a 5 per cent. penalty upon the coal-mining industry in order to give a useless preference of 5 per cent. to the manufacturers of the United Kingdom. I trust that when we come to deal with the item to which I refer the Committee will be prepared to make it free. I shall be compelled, in the circumstances to which I have referred, to vote for the lowest possible duties I can obtain on the item now before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to say that I agree with most of what has been said by Senators Henderson and de Largie. I assume that rock drills and spare parts will come under this item. I am not going to say that rock drills are not made in the Commonwealth, but those which are made here are not considered satisfactory by the people who have to use them. Yesterday we dealt with an item covering what were called "liners." There is 7 per cent. of manganese used in their manufacture, which is carried on by persons who have a secret knowledge of the means of hardening metal. These machines cannot yet be manufactured in the Commonwealth. Local manufacturers are not able to temper the rings as they require to be tempered. As a consequence, they will not stand wear and tear, and if a ring that it not properly tempered is used, before the drill has been down the mine an hour it must be taken up again for repairs. I have here a communication from correspondents who specially ask that rock drills and spare parts, and drill-sharpening machines, should be admitted at as low a duty as possible. We can only assist the mining industry by enabling those engaged in it to obtain the machinery which they require as cheaply as possible. I have been connected with many mines in the northern part of Queensland, and I can inform the Committee that the best material employed in them is brought from Victoria. Since the establishment of Federation we have been importing from Victoria ordinary engines and boilers and air compressors. Very good air compressors are made in this State.We have foundries in Queensland, but it has been shown that the Victorian foundries are able to cut into the trade and quote lower prices than the Queensland foundries. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrington,</inline> of the Maryborough foundry, has found fault with Queensland mining people for getting their engines and boilers from Victoria. This machinery can be landed at the railway wharf at Townsville from Victoria at a lower price than machinery manufactured by the Maryborough firm. It must be admitted that people in every State will go where they can get the best article at the lowest price. The Queensland people would not go to Victoria for mining machinery unless they could get it cheaper and better there than from the Queensland foundries. They would be prepared to go to the Victorian foundries for rock drills, if they could get drills up to the standard of the imported machinery. We have a large quantity of poor ores, and must employ the best appliances in dealing with them. We can only keep men employed in our mines by obtaining our machinery as cheaply as possible. I am sure that it is not the desire of the framers of this </para>

                <para class="block">Tariff or of the members of the Committee that any man at present engaged in the mining industry should be thrown out of employment. In the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Miner,</inline> from which I quoted the other evening, reference is made to several mines in North Queensland that are under exemption. In one of these mines £70,000 has been sunk in machinery and labour. To-day the mine is not working, and although the machinery is on the ground, the company are unable to find money to carry on the mine. In these circumstances, it is strange that we should be asked to impose taxation on the mining industry that can serve no useful purpose. When in connexion with a mine on which £70,000, has been spent, and which is laid under exemption, calls are made, before people can be expected to invest more money to carry on the mine they must be given at least some hope of a  Teturn.  They should . certainly not be burdened with additional taxation under a Tariff because some less important industry may be calling out for protection. We know that if people spent £70,000 in the establishment of any other industry, and claimed that it was languishing for want of protection, honorable senators would be found ready to give them protection to the extent of 40 or 50 per cent. We have spent in mines in Northern Queensland something like £1,000,000, and it is not right that we should be asked to pay unnecessary taxation on all mining supplies. If there is an article that is not made in Australia, and  it  is the most suitable article for the work required to be done, it should be allowed to be imported at as low a duty as possible, if not free. It has to be borne in mind that the work to be done on different gold-fields varies very much. Some fields have ores that are quite free. I was in Victoria some fourteen or fifteen years ago, and was well acquainted with what we called free stone, that did not require a great deal of treatment. On Gympie, Queensland, they have not half the trouble in extracting gold that they have at Charters Towers, where the stone has to go through several processes. After being treated  in  a variety of ways,  it  has to pass over the Whiffley table, which is a patented article. In a large industry, like this  it  is necessary to allow the results of the genius and energy of the world to be called to our assistance. If a machine is patented, our own people cannot get the use of  it without  paying a high royalty, and  if, in  addition, a heavy duty is imposed, the price becomes almost prohibitive. Perhaps, before I sit down, the Minister can tell me under what item drill sharpeners appear? </para>

                    <para>.- I should have liked to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie address himself at greater length to the reasons for the very important change which he has proposed in the duty on rock drills. I am aware that he referred to the subject at a previous stage, but his remarks then led me to conclude that he did not know very much about what we are doing in Australia regarding the manufacture of these machines. I wish to put before the Committee the facts of the case. Reference has been made to the fact that; the principal maker of rock drills in Victoria did not appear before the Tariff Commission. I do not know that it ought to be urged against a man that he did not go bowing and scraping to a Commission Certainly, it ought not to count to his discredit. He did, however, send a letter, in which he asked for an increase in the duty, which was previously 12½ per cent. I suppose he thought that that was sufficient. It has also been said that the particular maker of drills to whom I refer has no agency in Melbourne. There is no need for an agency for rock drills in Melbourne. The agency is required on the gold-fields, where the rock drills are used. Mining men do not come to Melbourne to buy them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Horsfield,</inline> the inventor of the rock drill that bears his name, has an agency in Kalgoorlie, where he employs sixteen men. It is difficult for an Australian manufacturer of such machines to get into the run with the managers of mines in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- He did not think it necessary. It is, I repeat; difficult for an Australian manufacturer to get in with: the mine managers of Western Australia, because many of the mines there are owned bv English proprietors. They are worked largely by English capital, and their managers like to use English goods. I do not say that that is wrong. What I do say is that it makes it 'difficult for an Australian manufacturer to get a footing when mining managers try to " please their directors as much as to please themselves about the machinery which they buy. The manufacture of rock drills has been carried on in Horsfield 's establishment for. the past twenty years. He is a clever mechanic. I worked with him for some years in a workshop. He got above the position of journeyman, struck- out for himself, and now has an excellent establishment covering 2 acres of ground. He made a specialty of rock drills, being the first out here to devote himself practically to making and perfecting them. It is a most elaborate machine. One -advantage of having it made here is that all the standard parts are interchangeable, and can be replaced at any time. The parts are case hardened and tempered so as to give the best possible wear, and the machine can be worked either by steam or bv compressed air. It is made in eight different sizes, from I 4-inch to 3f-inch diameter. In </para>

                <para class="block">Bendigo, it has almost entirely superseded the imported drill. Bendigo is one of the greatest quartz-mining fields in the world. On it is the deepest quartz mine known - now 4,363 feet deep. There are some 150 companies working in Bendigo. Two mines are down over 4,000 feet, 16 over 3,000 feet, and 20 over 2,500 feet. I am therefore speaking of no small field. The rock in Bendigo is pretty well as hard as it is anywhere. The only harder rock I know is that at Stawell, which is like flint. The Bendigo rock contains extremely hard, sandstone. I speak on this question under a sense of responsibility, because myself and partner make our living mainly by managing mining, companies. Whilst we do not take part in the practical management of the mines, we have to pass the accounts,- know- the men who supply the mines, and what is being paid. It is not to be supposed that a- machine that has been run down, like the Taylor -Horsfield has been to-night, would command the -market at Bendigo, where such enormous work has been done,, and beat the imported drills out of the market, if it was not a good one. Some two months ago, -a very special drill was made in the same factory. ' Those who wanted it could not get it anywhere else in the world. . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Horsfield</inline> made it for them. The diameter of the cylinder is- 8 inches, length of stroke 12 inches, and the weight of the drill 1 ton 5 cwt. It is entirely of Australian design, and is the largest rock drill built in the world. It is designed to drill holes from 6 to 12 feet in depth, by 18 inches in diameter. It will be used in some 30 feet of water. I believe it has been made specially large because the holes are for the purpose, of ventilating mines. All the makers of rock drills think that their own is the best, but more of the local drills than of any other are used in Victoria. In Bendigo, a" very strong machine is required, and this one is being made specially to fit the conditions there and in other parts of Victoria. We have passed a good many duties on the mere assertion that articles' are being made here, but I am giving absolute proof in this case:  1  shall prove, presently, the work that this machine does. A good deal has been made Of patent rights, but local manufacturers of drills can make almost any other drill in the world, because the patent rights of the Ingersoll-Sergeant and others have nearly all run out. If the patentees do not make them in Australia within two years, our patent law gives any one  the right to make them without being proceeded against. Consequently, the question of patent rights is a mere bogy. Even if the rights have not run out, every patentee is anxious to enter into arrangements with makers in other countries to make his machine, on the payment of royalties. An instance of that I mentioned lately in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> of Castlemaine, securing from Hornsby's the right to make their patent gas-producing engine. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Horsfield</inline> has made 3,000 drills. That number would not be taken unless he gave satisfaction. He has forty or fifty men, I believe, working at Bendigo. Most of our mines, except, perhaps, some in the West, are kept going by Australians who desire that all the work possible shall be done in Australia. I speak under the responsibility of managing with my partner from twenty-five to thirty mines. If I advocated anything detrimental to the mining industry, my directors, who are practically my masters, would not be pleased. I advocate this drill because I know they are satisfied with the machines they are getting, and desire to see fair play given to Australian industries.

                    <para>The principal rock drill recognised on the Kalgoorlie mines is that of the Ingersoll Sergeant Company, New York . This drill has been worked alongside of and against the Taylor Horsfield (Bendigo) and other outside makes of drills, and it has been found that the Ingersoll Sergeant drill bored better and quicker than any other. The mining manager of the Ivanhoe Gold Corporation mine was not able to say which of the drills wast responsible for the greatest consumption of air. It was proposed to make proper comparative tests of the various drills, including Australian, in order to show the exact consumption of air for the boring done per minute, or per hour, as the case may be. Whichever was found to be the best would be installed. </para>
                    <para>We are told that the American drill bored better and quicker, but a good deal depends on the man working the drill. One man with a better drill may be beaten by another with a worse drill. The fact that that was not looked upon as a final test is proved by the statement that another test was to be made later on. On page 31 it is stated that- </para>
                    <para>Many types of rock drills are in use in Australia. A Victorian engineer (Taylor-Horsfield, of Bendigo) and a South Australian mining manager (Captain Hancock, of Moonta) had designed rock drills, which had considerable improvements on those imported. It was said, however, that under present conditions there was small chance of getting Australian designed and made drills into general use. The better such drills were the greater the probability of their being copied by American makers and sent to Australia free (if percussive). The method of American manufacturers was thus described : When they found a better drill than their own their agent secured samples, sent them to America to be copied ; they were then sent to Australia and sold at any price, until the local manufacturers were knocked out. Percussion rock drills, now duty free, were made locally, but competition with the importer was impossible. A duty of 25 per cent. would enable the local men to capture the market, and would greatly increase employment. </para>

                    <para class="block">Smart Work with Rock Drills  -  The Record Broken. </para>
                    <para>Such work as is now being carried out in the North Long Tunnel mine at Walhalla, Victoria, besides attracting much favorable comment in mining circles, is worthy of note as a practical illustration of the great strides made in mining in Victoria. In the last fortnight a distance of 100 feet has been driven, and the previous fortnight 95 feet was recorded. . This feat is, as far as we know, not only the Victorian but the Australasian record for quick work of this character. In Bendigo, where smart work in crosscutting has often been accomplished, a distance of90 feet, driven in a fortnight at the 2,355 feet level of the Kentish shaft on the Carlisle mine, is the greatest length ever reported. The effect of such progressive work is obvious in reducing the slow rate of speed which often makes a big undertaking in mining a heart-breaking venture. As in this instants, where a distance of about 800 feet has to be driven to intersect the lode, the quick rate of speed will not only give great satisfaction to individual shareholders, but this development will stand as an illustration of what work is now possible in mining where rock drills and air compressors are brought into play.

                    <para>On the 15th December, 1902, the Long Tunnel Cold Mining Company started on their straightaway shaft sinking, with the intention of going to a depth of 3,000 feet. This, without a doubt, is one of the greatest shaft-sinking undertakings ever entered into in Australia. For this great work Australian drills, manufactured by Taylor Horsfield, were used. </para>

                    <para>Work in the crosscut from 2,827 feet in the incline shaft of the Long Tunnel is proceeding briskly, the celerity with which the contractors are driving being indicated by the fact that they accomplished 20 feet of crosscutting since Monday afternoon, in two days and two shifts. The distance sunk since last report is 580 feet - a weekly average of 23 feet. The total depth attained is 2,880 feet, and this work, including plats; has been carried through since the 15th December, 1902, the monthly (lunar) average from start to finish being 124 feet. As a delay of three weeks incurred in completing the connection of the two sections is included in this period, the Board believes that the result is a record for speedy shaft-sinking in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It was a report from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> correspondent. I have here some economy tests, but I do not propose to quote them, because they are contained in the manufacturer's book. I know that on several occasions, in Bendigo, the Taylor-Horsfield drill has been pitted against imported drills. Sometimes, the one would have a little advantage, and sometimes the other, but generally the balance was on the side of the Taylor Horsfield drill. The fact that it is being used by 150 mines in Bendigo - one of the greatest quartz-mining districts in the world, where mining is carried on at a greater depth than elsewhere, and where the mines are managed by careful, shrewd men, who would not employ any machinery which would not do the work properly - is proof that the statement made here that we have not a rock-drill which will do the work is altogether incorrect. I trust that this very moderate duty of 20 per cent. will be given to this industry, because this machinery is made not only at Bendigo but also in Queensland, by Walkers Limited, at Maryborough ; by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hancock,</inline> at Moonta, in South Australia ; and by the Austral Otis Company, at South Melbourne. Surely we are not going to withhold from the manufacturers of this particular article the protection which during the last few weeks we have been giving to other manufacturers with not one-half of the claim which they possess? </para>

It was doubtful whether the rotary and percussive rock-drills were the same as the coal-cutting machines; as a matter of fact, it was argued that they were the same; but the coal-cutting machines which the other House intended to include were the bar, chain and disc coal-cutting machines. In order to distinguish the coal-cutting machines from the rotary and percussive rock-drills, it is necessary to insert the words " bar, chain and disc " in paragraph  e.

The object is clearly to impose a limitation, whilst if we leave the item as it stands it will embrace every type and variety of coal-cutting machines. By imposing any limitation we might intentionally or otherwise exclude a valuable coal-cutting machine known now, or a machine which possibly may be invented and patented hereafter. </para>

                    (Western Australia)  [5.33}.-
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    has, I think, mentioned the objections to the Minister's request which I intended to advance. The disc, bar, and chain machines are the machines in common use to-day, but there are other machines that would not be covered by the proposed definition.  It would not, for instance, cover the Ingersoll coal-  cutting machine. There are also in existence to-day coal-cutting machines on . the rotary principle which are altogether different from any of the types referred to in the proposed amendment. To-day the inventive skill of man is being employed in every direction in the effort to economize in the production of coal. Four years ago in one mine in Western Australia, in which no coal-cutting machine was worked, the output per man engaged on the coal face was about  297  tons per annum for a given number of days' working. At the present time, as the result of the introduction of high-class machinery, the output of the mine has been increased to not only double the previous output per man at work on the coal, but double the same quantity per head reckoned over . the whole of the employes of the mine. This is an instance of the advantage of the introduction of high-class machinery in mining. If tomorrow a new coal-cutting machine was invented that did not come within the Minister's proposed definition, it would be held to be dutiable under some other item in the Tariff, and thus a tax would be imposed on the industry. Another point is that all these machines should be free tinder the general Tariff, as every one covered by the proposed definition is an American machine.

                    <para>- The honorable senator may be so advised, but I am in a position to instruct him that it is not a percussive rock drill. All the machines coming under the proposed definition are American machines. Most of the coal-cutting machines employed in England to-day belong to one or other of the three types referred . to and are manufactured in America. Yet the Minister proposes that they should be dutiable at  5  per cent, under the general Tariff and free from the United Kingdom, where they are not made. The effect of the proposal is merely to levy a  5  per cent, tax on the coal-mining industry for the use of machines that British manufacturers cannot supply. I hope the Committee will decide to leave the item as it stands. </para>

                    has already given good reasons, if any were required, why this request should be agreed to. Most of this machinery is American patented machinery, and even if it were not, I can see no reason why it should be dutiable at  5  per cent.

                <para class="block">My object in submitting this request is to reduce to 10-horse power the capacity of the electric motors dealt with by the item. In paragraph  g  of this item the Government propose that generators for direct coupling to steam turbines shall pay duty at  5  per cent. under the general Tariff, and be free in the case of the United Kingdom. It is clearly an anomaly to provide that if a generator is imported to be coupled with an engine or to be run with the belting of other machinery it shall be treated differently. We cannot, at the present time at all events, make electrical machinery in Australia sufficient to satisfy our requirements. It is necessary to bring this economic power into direct relationship with our mining industry. Electricity must be available as cheaply as possible. Honorable senators who have perused the reports of the Tariff Commission must have been struck by the manner in which electricity is being at present used in mining. To my own knowledge in Western Australia, some low-grade mining propositions could not be worked unless steam had been discarded in favour of electricity; and they could not continue to be run with the belting of other machinery it shall be treated differently, life to a number of mines simply for the sake of providing a higher duty for the benefit of a small industry in some of our large cities would be a foolish step to take. </para>

                        <para>- We certainly can pay too much for an article. I recognise that there are heavy types of machinery that can be made in Australia, and that, indeed, have been preferred by the users of steam throughout the Commonwealth. It has been found to be an advantage to have them made in Australia, because their local manufacture keeps the foreign engine maker within reasonable bounds. But I cannot see how that argument applies to electricity. Our requirements in relation to this motive power are very small as compared with the demand for the heavier types of machinery. If honorable senators will turn to page 51of the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission they will find that evidence was given at Coolgardie with regard to an Australian made electric motor that was not found to be satisfactory. We will pass by that allegation and pay attention to the price. The price of the Australian article was £67 9s. 3d. The Commission added - </para>

                        <para>- Even then the difference in price is so marked that it is unfair to call upon our industries to support what would, after all, be a struggling undertaking until Australia is well enough developed to start the electrical industry on a sound basis. That evidence was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker,</inline> manager of the Kalgoorlie Electric Power and Lighting Corporation, a gentleman whom I know well, and whose knowledge of electricity is equal to that of any man in Australia. He is an electrical engineer, who came from America. There is other evidence in this report of Australian-made machinery being purchased by mine managers in Western Australia, who found that it was to their advantage. The local manufacturers have been the means in many instances of keeping the agents of foreign makers within reasonable bounds in their prices. The manager of Walker's Foundry, at Maryborough, Queensland, gave evidence that if 100 per cent. was placed on electric motors and generators they would come in just the same. . He had no interest in the electrical machinery industry. In the interest of those who will have to use electricity on a large scale in the future we should not impose an excessive duty, but should make paragraph a correspond as nearly as possible with paragraph g, with the exception I have stated. </para>

                        <para>- We obtained that information from a firm with whose name I will gladly supply the honorable senator privately. It was evidence such as that which warranted us in proposing the item in its present form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and others who are supporting the request have made sad enough havoc already in earlier items. I, therefore, in view of the concessions which have already been made to the mining industry, appeal to them to allow this item to stand. These articles are made here, and the industry should certainly be cultivated. If my honorable friends have the numbers, of course I shall have to submit gracefully for the present. I put it to them, however, that it is not reasonable to lay such violent hands on this item, which represents a very worthy industry that should certainly not be wiped out. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [6.10]. - The Minister is evidently quite ready to agree to the request when he begins to put a halo round the item, and describe it as sacred. I do not regard any interference with the schedule as sacrilege. On the contrary, it is a kind of sacrilege to allow a number of the items to remain, because they do violence to our ordinary economic good sense. In many instances the duties have been fixed without considering the importance of making articles free in the interests of the country. I shall support
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline>
                    request, although I cannot see the necessity for putting it in its present form. It would be better for the honorable senator to move to make the paragraph free, although it gives it a greater air of absurdity to substitute  10  horse-power for  500  horsepower. I am very glad that it is proposed to make paragraphs  a  and  b  free. Dynamo electric machines mean, I presume, dynamos or' generators. . Nothing in this country deserves encouragement more than the use of electric power and electric lighting, particularly in mining, but also in other spheres of industry. Owing to the duties imposed, electric installation is made exceedingly costly. My experience, without wishing to disparage the dynamos made here, is that the local article, from the generator to the general equipment in connexion with installations, is by no means equal to the imported. We get from America, England, and Germany infinitely superior electric equipment. To- encourage the use of electric power and lighting, we should, at present at any rate, reduce the duties as much as possible.

                    <para>.- I regret very much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has felt 'it necessary, in the . interests of a particular industry, to move what I consider to be a free-trade request. I could understand the honorable senator if he took a broad view and said, " Whilst the mining industry is an important one to Australia, there are many industries which are equally important." If it is necessary that the mining industry should be assisted by the free admission of the machinery which it requires, why does he not go a step farther and assist the free-traders to get all the machinery required in other established industries brought under the same heading ? When one takes a hasty view of the Tariff Commission's report, and the summary of the evidence, he sees at once that in his own State the Secretary - of the Trades and Labour Council, and representatives of the Engineers' Society, were loud in their complaints that work was very difficult to obtain, and that wages were being lowered because of the large importations of various kinds of machinery, which, if their industry were protected, would be made here, and" so give them continuous employment. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that; but: it could be made here. That the electrical machinery now employed in many of the biggest mines in Australia was made here can be proved beyond the shadow of a doubt. ' If this request be agreed to, it will be a very serious thing indeed to many well-established industries. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> takes up the position' that because machinery can be imported more cheaply than it could be made here, he becomes at once an illogical protectionist ; because all' the free-traders have urged that, if there were' no duties on certain commodities, people would be able to get them more cheaply. The honorable senator has urged as a reason why the duties- should be imposed on other commodities, that the hours in other countries are longer, that the wages are lower, and that the conditions generally- in regard to industrial life are quite dissimilar from those which obtain in different parts of Australia. And he fortifies himself in submitting this request by the make believe that it is better to encourage one well-established industry than to give any form of assistance to any other industry which may not be in such a strong position as the particular industry in which he is interested. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very fallacious argument for a protectionist to use. The miners of Victoria are riot free-traders, but essentially protectionists. They know that all their sons, even if they had the desire, are not able to follow their occupations. Most miners are not desirous that their sons should do so; hence they want to get them into protected and established industries, and one of the best in Australia to-day is the engineering trade. The ige of electricity is in its infancy.  Electrical power is superseding other power in almost everything. Do honorable senators intend to give no assistance to this coming power?  Do .they want to give free admission to that kind of machinery and to keep our boys engaged in making obsolete machinery ? Do they propose to protect the. obsolete machinery which is not required in connexion with the mines of Western Australia and to refuse assistance to another industry which is established to-day, but mot so well established as the .one for making machinery driven by steam? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in all seriousness to consider his position as a protectionist. </para>

Here is an effort being made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to seriously affect an established industry and do an injury to men, who have been long suffering in many parts of the Commonwealth, because of .the insufficient measure of protection which they have received. I hope that he will reconsider his position and see his way clear to withdraw the request, because otherwise he will show himself to be a highly inconsistent protectionist, and to be influenced by arguments which have been used here time and again by some of the most violent of the free-traders. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. It would' be better for the various industries of the Commonwealth which want, to adopt electrical power if the honorable senator would move a request to make the item free. I can conceive that there are many dynamos of very limited horse-power capacity which are a useful addition in perhaps some of the secondary industries carried on in Melbourne. I have no desire to single out any industries for harsh treatment. If the honorable senator would adopt my suggestion he would spread over a wider field the benefits which I believe he desires to confer upon Australia. He would achieve his own particular object and probably assist some other industry which ought to be considered by us equally with the mining industry. It is true that if the horse-power be reduced from 500 to 10 it will entirely destroy the effect of the item. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that Senators Lynch and Neild will get into agreement. It would be unfair to tax dynamos with the capacity of10 horse-power at the rate of 20 per cent. and to allow larger dynamos to escape taxation. There is no special reason for allowing a big lighting or mining company to get its dynamos free and taxing the man who is carrying on an industry with a dynamo of limited horsepower. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will withdraw his request I am sure that  a request to make the item free will be submitted. </para>

                    <para>. - The discussion so far on this item would lead one to believe that the manufacture of electrical machinery has been fairly well established in Australia. If that were so, I should not be found opposing the proposed duty, but the whole of the evidence - and I have carefully read the reports of the Tariff Commission on the subject - goes to prove that it can hardly be said to exist. According to one witness, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> an electrical engineer at Kalgoorlie, if one factory were established for the manufacture of turbines on a scale sufficiently extensive to secure economic working, it could turn out in one year a sufficient number of machines to supply the Australian demand for twenty years. Even allowing that this witness exaggerated very greatly, it is clear that he does not consider that the industry has been established. </para>

                        <para>- The manufacture of motors and dynamos can only be said to have been established in a very small way, as there is really only one motor factory in Australia at the present time. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith's</inline> evidence was given two years ago, possibly before Wevmouth's factory was established, but he denied that there were any factories in Melbourne for the manufacture of electrical machines. He said there were some small shops, but the only factory of any consequence was that of the New Australian Electric Company, which is now defunct. He further said that when he was in Melbourne, and closely connected with the electrical manufacturing done there, the duty was 25 per cent., and in spite of this high duty it was found far cheaper to import electrical machinery than to purchase from the local manufacturers. He considered that a duty of 25 per cent. afforded very little prospect of the establishment of the industry. The one factory established at Richmond is on a very humble scale, and turns out very few motors or dynamos of more than 2 or 3 horse-power. What better evidence could we have on this subject than that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to the effect that a motor which could be imported for £27 would, if made in Melbourne, cost about £70 ? In the face of these figures the protection required to foster the industry would require to be absolutely prohibitive. We know that these electrical machines cannot be made here at anything like the price at which they can be imported. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker,</inline> of the Kalgoorlie Electric Power Company, gave evidence similar to that given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> and said that motors could be imported at £27, and that he had only one made in the Commonwealth, which cost him £67, and which did not give satisfaction. He did not say what was the horse-power of the motor he had made in Australia, but I take it that it was a small motor such as those turned out at Weymouth's factory. If we give the local manufacturer a sufficient measure of protection to justify him in continuing the manufacture of motors of small horse-power we shall be acting wisely in his interests and in the interests of all who require to use electrical machinery in the Commonwealth, and we shall be doing all that can reasonably be asked of us. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out to honorable senators who are urging that this duty should be reduced on the ground that the industry is not developed here, and that better and cheaper machines of this class can be obtained from America, that if that argument were applied over the whole area of industry we should never have any industry developed in Australia. Honorable senators are aware that there was a time when in the production of all kinds of machinery Great Britain was ahead of the world. She reached that position by the imposition of duties protecting her mechanics and her captains of industry. But America, comparatively recently, when she had no more people than we have, if as many, and when her internal and financial difficulties were very much greater than ours, established protection on the lines we now urge for Australia. Electrical engineering, of course, was not known at that time at all, but the same argument exactly applies, and when it is urged that we cannot or do not make this machinery we may well contend that Australian mechanical genius is equal to that of the people in any other part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- We have not done so yet, but I have no doubt that we will obtain from Japan very shortly electrical machinery made by artisans receiving a wage of from 6d. to  2s.  per day. That would be very much cheaper than anything we could hope to do while we demand that our artisans shall be paid at least  10s.  per day. </para>

                        <para>- But American labour is efficient, because it has been developed by protecting it in its initial stages from the cruel and sometimes unscrupulous competition of older-established industries abroad. That is what makes it possible now to get from America cheaper and more efficient machines than can be obtained elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - I have very much pleasure in supporting the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and am glad that nothing has been put into it that would suggest that my honorable friend proposes to relieve from the burden of taxation only those electrical motors which are required for mining purposes. The question of electric light and power is important, not only as applying to mining. It is an important and serious factor in an immense number of industries. Will instance an industry that pertains to my own State, and particularly to that portion with which, I am, best acquainted - namely, the sugar industry. I suppose that every sugar mill in Queensland is now lighted by electricity; and, in many cases, they are endeavouring to get over some of the difficulties attaching to sugar cultivation by putting electric light in the fields so as to enable the. crop to be harvested at night time. Not only do I welcome this request, but I shall support it, and hope that it will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - I sympathize with the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> on behalf of higher duties on electrical motors, though I think that his was a very laboured argument. Indeed, he himself seemed to recognise that it was laboured before he got far in his contention that because America had established many industries by the imposition of a Tariff, it was under the pressure of that Tariff that the more recent invention of electric power came into such general application in the United States. </para>

                        <para>- It is insufferable to listen to the argument that the duty embodied in this item is one that we ought to support because America imposed  a  high Tariff in 1812. The evidence is clear that we have never attempted to make in Australia electrical motors beyond those of a very low horse-power. . The provision embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> request will for a very long time to come amply serve the electrical industry of Australia. So far as I understand, the electrical works that exist in the Commonwealth at present are repairing bureaux rather than manufacturing industries. If these firms can show their capacity to make, say, 10 horsepower motors, it will then be ample time to take into consideration the question of giving them further protection. But what is the use of saddling people whose necessities demand motors of something like 500 or 600 horse-power with heavy taxation in order to encourage people who make motors of 2 or 3 horse-power? </para>

                        <para>- The people who use the machine will have to pay the enhanced price which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie so frankly admits will be charged by the manufacturer under a  20  per cent. duty. The honorable senator therefore wants the user of the larger dynamo to get an advantage over the smaller man. I cannot agree with that proposition. Dynamos ought all to be free. It is most repugnant to me to be placed in the position of exempting companies or big men who want larger dynamos from the added cost incidental to the imposition of the duty, while refusing the same advantage to the smaller man who wants a dynamo up to  10  horsepower. I wish to make no discrimination between the big and small men, or between the man living on a mining field and the man who carries on a secondary industry in Melbourne. While I oppose the policy of protection to small industries, I am equally opposed to a policy that hampers them. To tax the smaller dynamos in the way proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will interfere with many secondary industries. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie not to make fish of one and flesh of another. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> request, which reduces the horse-power to an absolute minimum. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> takes up an extraordinary position in proposing a maximum of  10horse-power,  when he and other honorable senators have heard me read figures showing that some twenty-two of these machines, ranging up to about  350  horse-power, have been supplied to Australian mines by Australian manufacturers. It is absurd to say that the manufacturers shall have the privilege of supplying only machines up to  10  horsepower. Honorable senators seem to think that it is easier for them to make the smaller dynamos, whereas they are more capable of supplying the larger ones. </para>

                        <para>-They all come under this item. It will be observed that the Mount Lyell Company bought several of these machines. They would never have come back for a second if the first had not been satisfactory. Cock's Pioneer mine bought a machine of  300  kilowatts - a kilowatt being equal to horse-power - and subsequently purchased four of  90  horsepower. The Broken Hill Proprietary mine bought one; the Block  10  Company and certain of the Walhalla mines bought several. There is no reason to doubt this information, which was obtained specially by an officer sent for that purpose. I should have been quite satisfied if the figures "  500 "  had been struck out, so as to have no limitation. I shall be greatly disappointed, however, if this proposal is followed by a request to make the item free. I want the representatives of Western Australia to  understand that their share of the benefit of the item will be infinitesimal compared with that of the lighting and power companies elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- Rightly or wrongly, I gathered the impression that the State was to be specially benefited by the request. As a matter of fact, it will benefit some of the richer companies, which are not mining companies, but lighting and power companies. If we give the necessary encouragement the ultimate benefit, so far as the local article is concerned, will necessarily accrue. I ask honorable senators to consider well whether they ought to persist in their effort to mutilate the item any more. I want them to bear in mind the concessions which have already been granted to the mining industry. If this request is directed especially in the interests of that industry, let me enumerate what has already been done on its behalf. My honorable friends have put on the free list high-speed engines, coupled to dynamo electric machines to be used in mines ; steam turbos ; turbo blowers ; high-pressure blowers for smelters; manganese and chromium parts and portable hoists. </para>

                    <para>. - So far as I can see, especially after the last speech, the position for the Committee to determine is a very clear one. I admit that I had some little doubt until I had the advantage of listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> arguments. By the last division the Committee has decided, apparently, that it would be well to separate the dynamos into two classes, and the point now for decision is as to the arbitrary line which is to be drawn to distinguish the larger of these two electrical appliances from the smaller. The debate has certainly made it manifest that the Committee thought that 500 horse-power was too high a capacity to adopt. It was in conformity with that opinion that it decided to strike out the figures " 500," and now the blank has to be filled. When the insertion of the figure " 10 " was suggested prior to the omission of the figures " 500," it appealed to me at first, perhaps, not as an unfair alternative, but the Minister has said that a 10 horse-power limit is absurd. I accept him as an authority on the matter; and, as there is already enough absurdity in the Tariff, I feel bound to change the course which I had mapped out of voting for the insertion of the figures " 10," and to support the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline></para>

He went so far as to say that our endeavour to free this class of machinery would be for the benefit of large companies. He does not need to be reminded that under his own Tariff it is proposed to allow generators, which are intended to be coupled with turbines, to come in free. </para>

                        <para>-It is the proposal of the Government, as submitted to the Senate. The schedule provides that generators of either one or one thousand horse-power, so long as they are coupled, or intended to be coupled, with turbines, shall come in free. It will, therefore, be quite easy for any lighting or power company to order a turbo dynamo combination, and get it landed free. My proposal does not differ very much from the Government's proposal, if, indeed, it does not resemble theirs in many respects. </para>

                <para class="block">That is my position with regard to this proposal. If Australian requirements in this line were on a vaster scale, the imposition of a duty which would give effective protection to the manufacture of this class of machinery might be justified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> referred to the experience of America, but as a close student of the history of Tariff -making, the honorable senator must know that the United States' adopted an effective protectionist Tariff only by gradual stages. When he advises the Committee that in Australia, with a population of 4,000,000, we should begin with an effective protection on electrical machinery, the answer is that in the United States there were periods during which free-trade was in force, and then gradual stages of increasing protection. It was in 1867 that protection became the settled policy of that country, and subsequent to that date the Dingley Tariff, and then the McKinley and Wilson Tariffs, were passed. The American experience would appear to show that it is not wise in the interests of a nation to establish too early a highly protectionist Tariff. On other items in this Tariff I have consistently given protectionist votes, but whatever the consequences of my action may be, I draw the line here in the* interests of the mining industry, which I think would be injured if the present proposal were adhered to. </para>

                    <para>. - It is of little use for honorable senators to charge each other with inconsistency, as during the consideration of the Tariff I suppose every member of the Committee has given a vote' which has made him appear more or less inconsistent. We should remember that we are dealing with a Tariff in which we have very largely adopted the principle of protection. I suggested some time ago that we should be given some further information in connexion with this item, and the very interesting information supplied by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, has shown that I did well to do so. It has been shown that extensive users of electrical machinery have been satisfied to obtain" articles of local manufacture. I refer to the Mount Lyell Company, the manager of which is a man of very high scientific attainments, and one of the most competent mining managers in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Let me inform the honorable, senator that the Mount Lyell Company,, largely by means of electrical machinery, are handling and smelting every day no less than  1,100  tons of ore. The information supplied by the Vice-President of the Executive Council proves that dynamos and motors up to  200  horse-power have been manufactured in Australia, and supplied to Australian purchasers, and, further, that their manufacture has been developed to this extent under a duty of  I2L  per' cent. I think that the proper thing to do is to substitute 200 or 250 for the 500 horse-power referred to in the item, to make the discrimination which the Government have themselves introduced in submitting a differential rate of duty on dynamos and motors of different horse-power, and to lower the rate of duty proposed. Circulars were sent out by the Chamber of Mines in Victoria dealing with the duties on mining machinery, and I think some respect should be paid to representations made by the official secretary of the Chamber as the result of inquiries. The circulars asked for relief from duties under various items, and pointed out the injury which the mining industry would probably suffer if the duties proposed were not reduced. Certain honorable senators, myself amongst the number, replied to the circulars by asking for some more definite information as to the machinery that must be imported in order that an effort might be made to make it free of duty, and also as to the machinery manufactured in Australia that was giving satisfaction. </para>

                        <para>- I have done so, but I consider that the suggestion with respect to paragraph a is inconsistent with that made with respect to paragraph b, since it would make the limit of the horsepower under paragraph a 50 horse-power, and there would then be a jump in paragraph b up to 250 horse-power. It seems to me that the most sensible alteration to make in the item would be to provide in paragraph a for machines 200 horse-power, because machines of that power have been manufactured in the Commonwealth ; and as these were manufactured under a duty of 12½ per cent. a duty of 15 per cent. should be sufficient encouragement for their continued manufacture. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [8.59]. - I yield to no one in my desire to relieve mining enterprise in Australia of all unnecessary impositions. If there is one industry which more than another is entitled to special privileges and exemptions it is the mining industry, not because it does not at times afford very large profits to those engaged in it, but because, in the first place, its profits are fluctuating and uncertain, and, in the next, it is the industry to which, for the last fifty or sixty years, Australia has been indebted for a great deal of its prosperity. I say once and for all that on every occasion when I can relieve that industry of impositions that press unduly upon it, I shall do so; but I do think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline>
                    has given utterance to protests of unblushing selfishness, emanating from the Chamber of Mines of Victoria. Such action would alienate any one who wished to take a fair and reasonable view, such as was expounded by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    in the excellent speech that he has just made, and would induce them to be less favorably disposed towards the mining industry than they otherwise would be. This item affects, not only the mining, but many other industries ; and will affect still more industries as time goes on, because if there is one thing more to be observed than another, it is the spread of electrical motive power throughout cur industrial life. My honorable friend,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline>
                    as the mouthpiece of the Chamber of Mines, was scarcely fair in quoting the limit that they sought to put upon paragraph  b,-  whilst not reading to the Committee, except under gentle compulsion, the fact that they suggested 50 horse-power instead of 500.

                        <para>-I never saw it. I only got my information about it from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson..</inline> When we find from this document, emanating from the organized exponent of the wishes of the mining industry, that they wish to put all motors at a rate of duty to- suit themselves, I say that that is a selfish argument to address to the Committee, and that we ought not to be led away by "it. What does it do? It equally ignores all other industries in this country that are using, or may hereafter require to use, dynamos and electric motors. What do the mining people care about other industries? Not twopence. What do the Mount Lyell people care - I mention them because their names have been referred to? What do they care for the small man and the small industry in relation to this duty, so long as we relieve them from this 20 per cent, tax? They do not care who has to pay it, so long as they do not. I say that that is grossly unfair. I am willing to relieve the mining industry, but I want it to be done fairly. It is not exactly that other people who use small motors are being penalized as that the mining industry are desiring to get a privilege not extended to other people. These, mining people, who require large motors and dynamos, are putting pressure on this Parliament to get for themselves privileges not extended to smaller men. </para>

                        <para>- We ought not to give it to them unless we can deal fairly and give it to others also. I take the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has put very forcibly to the Committee, that the electrical industry is practically in an experimental and crude stage. We have excellent electrical engineers in Australia, but we are now dealing with the manufacturing part of the business, that has not yet emerged from the experimental stage. We " have struck out " 500," and have to put in some other figure. We should see to -it that the small men get the same privileges in the matter of exemption from the 20 per cent, duty as the big men do. I have moved that the blank be filled up bv inserting the figure " 1," because the blank must be filled in owing to the form of words used in the item. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has shown unanswerably,' in the facts that he has set before us, that there is no reason in the world why we should do otherwise than reduce the figure to the smallest limit. </para>

                <para class="block">I admit that if we insert the figures " 10 " in the blank they may have to be revised later on. Probably every member of the Committee has been struck by the scanty information contained in the reports of the Tariff Commission concerning this important question. Only about three pages are devoted to it. I conclude that whatever we do will not be a final settlement of the question. I suggest the insertion of " 10 " as a tentative measure. I especially draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> attention to the need for some limit, and remind him that he and his brother members of the Tariff Commission have generally sought to fix a rate so as to preserve a balance between the price charged by the local manufacturer and the price charged by the importer. The limit of 10 horse-power will serve much the same purpose, because if a person is in need of an  8  or 10 horsepower motor, and thinks that the local manufacturer is not treating him, fairly, he can avail himself of a more reasonable price for an imported motor by getting one of11 or12 horse-power. Thus we shall preserve a reasonable balance between the price of the local producer and that asked by the importer. </para>

                    <para>Practically none of this machinery is manufactured in Australia. G. Weymouth and Co. do a little manufacturing. They built, and sent to us, a motor which we endeavoured to use ; but we found it not satisfactory in working. The price to us was £679s. 3d., while similar motors which we import cost us£17 10s. invoice price. The Australian article is more than twice the cost of the imported. It would be impossible to use electric motors for mining purposes if they cost what Australian manufacturers charge for them. The Australian industry is new; and there had been no opportunity of developing a manufacturing plant. Nearly all of such motors here are used on our lower-grade mines, especially the smaller mines commencing ; because electric motors are much cheaper to instal than steam. Therefore, anything we can gain by way of reduction in duty will directly assist the low-grade mining propositions. Owing to the limited use made of electrical apparatus in Australia at the present time, I do not think it can be locally manufactured. </para>
