                            <para> So far as I can ascertain it is not true that owing to scarcity of operators telegraphists are working from nine to sixteen hours straight off without a break, even for meals. It is, however, a fact that in Brisbane, out of a staff of seventy-two telegraphists, two are, as a rule, kept on in their turn from nine to ten hours daily, except Saturday and Sunday, and in times of emergency - such as serious interruptions to lines - a larger number of officers have, to meet public requirements, been on duty from nine to sixteen hours without leaving the office for meals. However, as a rule telegraphists do not work continuously during their hours of attendance, and they have at all times the opportunity of partaking of. refreshments. Tea is handed round to telegraphists between 4 and 5 p.m. daily, and hot water is provided for those who choose to make their own tea; and if they wish they may send out for a meal. </para>

These temporary transfers in no way interfere with the hours of duty of other telegraphists in Brisbane. Ten telegraphists are employed for the purpose of providing relief, owing to the absence of telegraphists from any cause, and at country offices temporary assistance is afforded as far as practicable whenever required. </para>

                <para>When this request has been disposed of I intend to move for a duty of 20 per cent. on importations from the United Kingdom. After the discussion of last night, it is not necessary to state at length the reasons for the proposed reduction. It must be borne in mind that the ordinary upright piano is to be found in the homes of persons of every class. Some honorable senators may have regarded grand pianos as within the reach only of the well-to-do, and therefore fairly taxable at 30 per cent. as luxuries. The upright piano, however, is in no sense a luxury, being found in the houses of miners, farmers, and persons of moderate and small means everywhere throughout Australia. Therefore, even protectionists should impose upon these instruments as low a duty as possible. A duty of 30 per cent. is almost prohibitive. The monopolistic local manufacturer, who is a resident of New South Wales, has done  a healthy and progressive business under free-trade, and under a 20 per cent. protective duty, and he has not asked for a higher duty than 25 per cent., the rate asked for by the representative of the Wertheim Company, which may perhaps establish a factory here. Furthermore, we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> that he intends to export his pianos to India, the Philippines, the Pacific Islands, and Europe - a proof that his cost of manufacture is very much the same as that of his rivals abroad, seeing that in the markets which I have named he must sell in competition with their manufactures. I read yesterday his statement that his pianos cost, on the average, &#163;19 1 8s. each, while imported pianos cost, f.o.b., from &#163;20 7s. 6d. to&#163;20 10s. each, which, with the freight and other charges, together with the duty of 30 per cent., brings their landed cost up to&#163;35 each. Therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> makes a very good profit on the instrument which he sells for &#163;45 each. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely repeating the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> The fact that his company is now in a position to export, and to sell in foreign markets in competition with makers abroad, shows that its cost is not much greater than theirs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has acknowledged that he is more than satisfied with the business which his company has been doing. It has developed continuously since 1900, although it was making satisfactory progress under free-trade. The Minister, however, has given no reason for his proposal to increase the duty by 5 per cent. more than the representative of the Wertheim Company asked for, and the rate with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> would be satisfied. The manager of Beale and Company stated that the company did not need an increase of duty, but that a rate of about 33 per cent. would be necessary to get German and other foreign firms to establish factories im Australia. A duty of 30 per cent. will be a heavy tax upon the general community. It will have to be paid by every mother who wishes to give her daughters a musical education, and by every teacher of music. When we consider the conditions under which our population lives, how scattered our settlement is, we should do all we can to encourage musical education. Bishop Green replied in his old age, when asked what were the greatest pleasures of life, &#34;The harmony of music and the singing of birds.&#34; Those who know the pleasure which the gift of music gives, will realize the importance of encouraging its acquirement, and I hope that the Committee will, at least, do nothing to take this pleasure from the people. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;11.27&#93;. - The courtesy shown by the Minister, last night, will cause me to curtail my remarks very considerably, which will be an evidence to him that he has lost nothing by his action. I strongly support the request. The fact that although, for five or six years, there has been a duty of 20 per cent. on pianos, no second factory has sprung into existence in Australia, makes it absurd to penalize the lovers of music throughout the Commonwealth on the off chance that some one may be induced to start a second factory somewhere between Port Darwin and southern Tasmania. The existing factory was started, and held its own, under freetrade, and it has made considerable progress under a protective duty of 20 per cent. The company has made it known that it was doing well under the old Tariff, and no one is better pleased than I am to hear of its success ; but that is no reason why thousands of music lovers should pay dearly for pianos to increase its profits, or to slightly increase the chance of another factory being started. For these reasons, and, without going into the question which was properly raised by

On the other hand, it is quite right that I should say a few words on a matter which affects an industry in my own State, and, in a much larger degree, affects the whole of the people of the Commonwealth.

                    <para>- There has been a somewhat lengthy discussion on this item, but there are one or two phases of it which will bear emphasis. We are now dealing with the upright piano, generally known as the cottage instrument; and this is not merely an article of furniture, but an instrument which is admitted to have an elevating effect in every home where it finds a place. It affords one of the most innocent of all the artistic pleasures which man enjoys ; and I know nothing that appeals to our sentiments so much as the idea of providing in every home music which, in many cases, tends to harmony, in more senses than one, and keeps the family together. We know that the manufacture of pianos has been started in Australia ; and I think it would be disloyal to institute any comparison between the Australian product and the imported article. The Australian instruments, so far, are in every way worthy of Australia; but it is no use disguising the fact that if a musician requires a really good instrument, he must turn to the foreign product. No doubt the Australian pianos will attain that excellence which appeals to musicians, as it has been attained in the course of generations in other countries. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the keeping of a piano in tune is a great point, but that is no monopoly of Mr. Beale&#39;s, although I understand that he has a very useful appliance directed to that end. There are many manufacturers who will guarantee their pianos to keep in tune in almost any kind of climate. We are now asked to increase a duty which, up to the present, has resulted in the creation of only one manufacturing firm, which, I may say, started operations under free-trade conditions. It was then apparently flourishing, and it certainly has flourished under a duty of 20 per cent. What is the outside competition that this firm has to meet ? It is not the competition of Great Britain, because the figures show us that out of a total of &#163;241,000 worth of pianos imported, Great Britain furnished only 10 per cent., or &#163;24,500 worth. What we are asked to do is really to increase the duty against German pianos by about 50 per cent; and that seems to me most unreasonable. Whatever our sentiments may be in regard to Germany, it is the home of music, and the place where the best instruments in the world are manufactured. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> as a consistent free-trader, is coming to reason ; because it is a practical matter we have now to decide . Most of us know that pianos are mostly bought on the credit system. I suppose that out of every ten pianos nine are so purchased, and if we impose a very high rate of duty we shall tax a number of households that I am sure we have neither the desire nor the intention to tax. We shall not stop the importation of German pianos by a 30 per cent. duty ; and, therefore, I regard the proposed increase as quite unnecessary. This is a tax which will bear most hardly on a large number of artisans, small farmers, and others who cannot afford any additional burden of the kind. I am quite willing to fall in with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> proposal, merely pointing out that the preferential duty will make very little difference, in view of the fact that only one piano in ten comes from Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire to go into that question. I am assuming that if we carry the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> the purchasers will get the full benefit of it; and, if they do, I estimate it will mean a reduction of about &#163;1 on each instrument. This item appeals to me personally; and, under such circumstances, I suppose any. honorable senator is inclined to say, perhaps, more than he ought. I do not purpose, however, to give way to that tendency, but merely to draw attention to another aspect of the question. Most of us, I think, know something about pianos and music generally, and we are forced to recognise that, unfortunately - and I use the word advisedly - the best pianos do not come from England. What is proposed is a reduction of 5 per cent. on the pianos made in Germany, the country which is best fitted to produce such instruments. The preferential duty, from my point of view, does not affect the question very much. Pianos from England are, and always have been, inferior in those; qualities which appeal to the musician and the artist - that is inferior to German, and, occasionally, French pianos. While, of course, I shall vote for the request, and the consequent reduction in the second column, I express my regret that it means so little - that we are largely beating the air. I am afraid we are merely satisfying the desire we all have, as human beings, to have a reduction in the duties, however small that reduction may be, when we think it desirable in the interests of the community. I regret that it is impossible to fix a lower duty than that suggested in the request, in view of the fact that so many honorable senators have spoken, I shall not say pathetically, but, at any rate, eloquently, as to the desire to make as free as possible the opportunities in Australia for developing musical and other artistic  tastes. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry we are obliged to struggle so hard for the reduction of a duty which affects so much the dweller in the cottage. This industry was started under free-trade, and apparently did well. Under the Tariff of  1902  a duty of  20  per cent. was imposed ; and I am happy to believe that the industry did even better. But we are now told that this manufactory will be closed unless there is an increase in the duty - that, without an increase, no other factories will be started. That, , however, is utterly inconsistent with the past history of the industry. The increase really means a handicap on every little home throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

The cost to the consumer should not be more than at present. The number of pianos imported into the Commonwealth in 1904 was 9,102. If all these instruments were made here employment would be afforded to from 2,100 to 2,200 people directly in the piano factories themselves, as well as to a large number of others connected with kindred industries - such, for instance, as saw-milling, glue-making, &#38;c. </para>

The importations since  1903  have consistently gone up, showing that the duty of  20  per cent. was insufficient to protect effectively the Australian manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not admit thai. Where there is a good margin of duty &#34;the greater is the inducement to foreign manufacturers to start factories in Australia, and that is what the Government want. They do not want merely to protect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale. Mr. Beale,</inline> whose acquaintance I have not the pleasure of having, is a well recognised Australian manufacturer who, no doubt, can look after himself. The Government are not concerned with his interests. What the Government are concerned about is the employment of our own people, and the further establishment of factories in Australia. There is, at present, an enormous margin for internal competition. We are importing nearly 13,000 pianos per annum, representing a value of something like &#163;250,000. I take it that only about &#163;25,000 of that represents pianos which come from the United Kingdom. Consequently, the duty of 30 per cent, in the general- column, would operate against about &#163;220,000 worth of pianos imported from Germany. </para>

                    BEST. No doubt, and for those who desire the luxury of a first-class German piano, the additional 5 per cent, will not make any difference whatever. The point that I seek to emphasize is that it is not
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline>
                    that we are looking after, but the establishment of factories in Australia. I impress upon honorable senators that the 20 per cent, duty has not during the last six years been effective in creating an additional factory. It is an ominous fact that at this moment we have no second piano factory in the country ; but no sooner do we increase the duty than we have another manufacturer coming forward to establish a factory here. The 1904 importations, which were considerably less than those of to-day, were 7,102, whilst to-day . they are 12,263; the value of the imports in 1904 being &#163;201,706, whereas to-day they are &#163;241 ,000. If I remember rightly the importations for 1907 were in value upwards &#176;f &#163;300&#62;0&#176;o. What is conclusively shown is that these importations have increased year by year by something like 25 per cent. Even on the basis of the 1904 importations, it was estimated that the manufacture of these instruments would afford employment to upwards of 2,000 persons. That employment .would be correspondingly increased were there a greater number oi locally-manufactured pianos. I do not intend to say that the effect of the increased duty will be to shut out all German importations. That, of course, will not be so., but the effect of the duty will be in th&#60; direction not only of increasing employment throughout the Commonwealth in pursuance of our declared policy, but of also utilizing our own timber and of increasing employment indirectly in the manner that I hav( indicated. Under these circumstances,  1  do say &#34;that a reasonable case has beer, made out for the further protection of the: industry. I further ask honorable senators to accept last night&#39;s division as a fair test.

                        <para>- The original proposal of the Government was for a duty oi&#39; &#163;16 ros., or 40 per cent., in the general column, and &#163;15, and 30 per cent. - as recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission - against the Unite Kingdom. But another place saw fit te* strike that out and to impose duties of 3c and 25 per cent. . They also thought h desirable . that these duties should be applied to uprights. I contend that last night&#39;s division -ought to be regarded as a fair test division. Therefore, in dealing with the upright piano we should assent to the same duties of 30 and 25 per cent. I would, in conclusion, point out that even in the. one factory which we have established in Australia employment is found for something like 450 hands, and that something like &#163;60,000 per annum is paid in wages. There is ample room for two or three like factories, and, therefore, for an enormous increase of employment. When we realize that the extra 5 or 10 per cent, will have that encouraging effect, why should we not give our own people the benefit of the increased protection ? </para>

                        <para>- It is going to be no tax on the people whatever. The cottager is not going to pay1s. extra duty by virtue of this duty. This particular class of piano can be most readily made in Australia. It is the higher class of instrument, such as is purchased by those who can afford to pay more, which will be increased in price by this increase of duty. In view of the facts which I have mentioned, and of the desire for uniformity in the duties, I urge that the schedule rates should be adhered to. </para>

                    <para>. - I am one of those who believe that the imposition of extra duties will have no effect whatever in increasing the price of these pianos to those who use them, whilst it will have a material benefit in enabling the manufacturers of Australian pianos to give increased employment. Nor do I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is very anxious to have the duty increased or kept very high. A high duty will be sufficient to induce other manufacturers to come here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> will not then be able to enjoy a monopoly, whereas if the duty is made low he will have to face the competition of other manufacturers as well as that of the importers. The same thing occurred with regard to another duty. When it was proposed to increase the duty on condensed milk by 5 per cent. nearly every milk factory in Australia was opposed to it. Why? Because they enjoyed a monopoly of local manufacture under existing duties, whereas they knew that if the duties were increased so as to keep out foreign importations, they would have to face the competition of other local manufacturers. An increase of the duty on pianos will probably have the effect of inducing other manufacturers to come here, and we may have one or two factories established in Sydney or Brisbane. It is a laudable desire on our part that the pianos used in Australia should be manufactured here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has referred to the natural protection which the manufacturer gets as being sufficient. He pointed out the enormous expense to which importers of pianos were liable on importing pianos f .o.b. from Germany or England. But as a matter of fact, except in regard to those portions of New South Wales within easy reach of the port of Sydney, the piano manufacturers of Australia will enjoy no natural protection whatever, because it costs just as much to send a piano from Sydney to Adelaide, or Perth, as to bring it from England or </para>

                <para class="block">Germany. Therefore, I contend that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> or any other manufacturer of Australian pianos is entitled to the fair protection that any ordinary protectionist is inclined to give to an Australian industry. </para>

                        <para>- The increased duty will not increase the price to the &#34;poor cottager&#34; one iota. The only effect, if the duty is sufficiently effective, will be to induce the manufacture of pianos in Australia instead of at the other end of the world, and work will thus be provided for Australian artisans. A further result will be that the enormous amount of money now spent on pianos in Australia, instead of going into the pockets of foreign manufacturers will be retained in this country. The percentage duties leave the door open for all kinds of invoice faking, and bogus valuations. I prefer the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission to make the duty in the general column &#163;5, or 30 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty, and after the present request has been defeated I intend to move accordingly. </para>

                <para>I  think that honorable senators are aware that a very large variety of locally -made filters - and, if necessary, I shall add imported filters- are put on the market which, from a medical point of view, are most inefficient. Of late, this subject has interested me a little, and I desire to bring certain facts before the Committee. It is not very long since a scientific test was made by the best authorities in the United Kingdom to ascertain which kinds of filters were adequately satisfactory. The result of the test was that only two out of, I think, nearly 100 filters were declared by high medical authorities to be really adequate for the purpose for which a filter is used. There was one variety of Berkfeldt filter, and one variety of the Pasteur filter. The first of these is made in England, and the other in France. They are patented filters, and it is certain that they are not being made in Australia. I suppose that for the most part the makers of filters in Australia rely chiefly upon the sponge to do the work of filtration. </para>

                            knows that what I desire is that we should admit free the filters which have been proved to be effective for the purpose for which a filter is intended, and the honorable senator should join w wwith me in that desire. We know how important the proper filtration of water is, not only in the country districts, but in the large towns of Australia. The non-filtration of water is largely responsible for the frequent outbreaks of typhoid.

                            is aware that I am not decrying anything made in Australia. I never do that. I state that the result of probably the most important investigation of filters that was ever made, showed that of nearly one hundred various forms of filters only two were pronounced to be really effective by the eminent authorities who conducted the test. Their report was strongly condemnatory of a vast variety of filters commonly used. They stated, as some of us are aware, that many so-called filters, instead of being effective for the purpose for which they are intended, positively increase to those using them, the danger of imbibing noxious germs. I hope that honorable senators will recognise that we ought to put within the reach of the public of Australia the best filters that the world can produce, irrespective of where they are made, and for that reason we should allow filters to some in free. It cannot be pretended that his duty of  15  per cent. is a protective duty, and it should not be necessary to argue the matter at length to induce

                            to accept the request I have moved. The honorable senator cannot attach very much importance to the revenue aspect of the question, as according to the statement supplied to honorable senators, only  &#163;814was  paid in duty on filters in  1906.  This is an item in the Tariff which should certainly be free, as I am sure the Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree with me that the proper filtration of water is one of the best means that could be adopted to prevent the spread of disease.

                    <para>. -  Senator Clemons has really furnished the Committee with a very substantial reason for insisting upon the duties proposed. He has very properly said that the result of a test of some  100  varieties of filters in the Old Country, showed that only two of them adequately and effectively answered the purpose of providing absolutely pure water. That is a very strong reason why the enormous percentage of those which may be regarded as defective filters should not be placed on the Australian market free of duty under high sounding titles. If there were some guarantee that only the three or four filters that have been proved to be effective would be imported there would be some force in the honorable senator&#39;s argument; but it is probable that those filters, because of their command of more important markets, would be less known here than the defective filters. We are really being asked to open the door to the bogus filters which formed the large proportion of those examined in the test to which the honorable senator has referred. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a high duty, but it would have a discouraging influence upon importations. It is intended to be a protective duty. It is the duty that was imposed under the old Tariff, and the duty recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission after investigation. </para>

                        <para>- We need not travel one hundred yards from this building to find one of the best and most popular filters made in the Commonwealth. It is used by nearly all, if not all, the cordial manufacturers in this city, and commands, to some extent, an export trade. The duty  proposed is a mildly protective one, and it is desirable that it should be retained. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a difficulty in this matter which prevents me from supporting the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> Honorable senators will remember that when we were dealing with marine machinery, I brought under the notice of the Committee the very peculiar and, I think, unsatisfactory position which arises from the fact that while a fully equipped vessel can be brought here free, if a ship-builder in Australia wishes to avoid the payment of duty on the engines and other machinery with which it must be fitted, he is compelled to resort to the expedient of bringing them in in bond and then sailing with them out of Australian waters in bond on a voyage, which may, or may not, be spurious, when he can bring them in free. When I directed attention to the matter, the Committee was not prepared to assist me in removing the anomaly. I point out that if we were to agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> request, we should create just such another anomaly, because whilst the maker of a yacht in Australia would have to pay duty on the different materials and fittings, he used, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> proposal, it would be possible to import a completed vessel free of duty. One effect of that would probably be that the industry of yacht building, which is at present carried on to some extent, at any rate in Sydney, would be transferred to New Zealand. The boats would be built there, sailed here, and brought in free under this proposal. Much as I dislike all the duties connected with the shipbuilding trade, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will see that by his proposition he will be doing a distinct injustice to our local builders. </para>

                    <para>. - Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council agree to modify this item by making oars and sculls for racing boats free? I do not know that it will largely affect the item from the Minister&#39;s point of view, but it will help on the most healthy sport in the Commonwealth. In nearly every four or eight-oar racing boat in Australia, oars or sculls made in England are used. Nearly every sculler uses them also. One of the reasons is the kind of wood out of which they are made. The English oars used are made either by Norris or Ayling. I know of many cases where they have been imported, not because those who use them want only an article made in England, but because it is recognised that they are better made in England at present, and that there are better opportunities there for getting the timber which is most suitable for racing purposes. Of all the sports indulged in by English-speaking people, there is none so healthy or free from gambling or other contamination as rowing. </para>

                        <para>-I am glad to say, because I have had something to do with racing in my time, that most excellent racing boats are made in Melbourne, but the best oars and sculls are at present made in England, although they may be used here in Australian made boats. The two firms I have named have world-wide reputations. Most rowing clubs in Australia are rather short in their finances, because, although healthy, the sport is very expensive, and the payment of the duty will be a serious matter. We could encourage the sport to some extent by relieving the members of rowing clubs of. this impost. If oars and sculls are made here to satisfy rowers and scullers, they will buy them, whether the item is free or not, because the cost of importing is considerable. The duty represents a tax that operates largely against every healthy rowing club in the. Commonwealth. I suppose that so far as the Customs Department is concerned, no confusion or anomaly will be created by what I propose, because oars and sculls for racing boats are entirely different from those used in ordinary rowing boats.

                    <para>. - It is obviously the desire of the Government, and of many honorable senators, that this paragraph should be completely free, for the reasons contained in the description of the articles covered by it. Why then tax them at 5 per cent. under the General Tariff? While I hope that England will be famed for her art for many centuries to come, I cannot pretend that she has a monopoly of it, or of the instruments used in it. I therefore move - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Subsequently, if that request be adopted, I intend to ask the Committee to agree to a request for the insertion of the following paragraph:  - &#34;(b)  N.e.i., free.&#34; The object of the present request is to give a small protection to the superphosphates industry. It has been established for a period of thirty-five years, and certainly it is one of our best, perhaps one of our most flourishing, industries. It represents an investment of something approaching&#163;1,000,000, and employs about 1,000 men at a cost of about &#163;150,000. Honorable senators will naturally ask, Why is a protective duty sought at this stage? Hitherto we have been able, without any difficulty, to compete with the importations from the United Kingdom and Europe, but recently large importations have been made in Japan. In the latter country there exist great natural facilities for the production of superphosphates, and labour is obtainable at about one-twelfth of the cost which is paid in Australia. The large dumping operations which have taken place during recent years have created considerable misgivings. Under the old conditions the imposition of the duty proposed would not have been sought, but we regard with a large degree of apprehension the inroads which are being made by Japan in consequence of their cheap production of superphosphates. We have endeavoured,- by legislation and otherwise, to protect ourselves against dumping operations, but when we see that the local industry is liable to be injured, workmen discharged from employment, and capital employed unprofitably, it is our duty to give a reasonable measure of protection. I have no reason to fear that this duty would result in any increased price to the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- The first thing we have to do is to secure the establishment of the industry on a sound and healthy  basis, and then should combinations be formed they may be regulated by our internal legislation. We have large phosphatic deposits in the various States. I believe that there are enormous deposits in South Australia which are capable of being profitably worked. There are deposits in Tasmania from which sulphuric acid, which is a very important element in the manufacture of superphosphates, can be readily obtained. There are similar deposits in Western Australia &#39;and in  Queensland. </para>

The duty proposed would amount to about 12 J per  cent, under the general Tariff, and about  6  per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom, and is submitted merely as a measure of protection against dumping operations. I repeat that there is no reason to fear that the consumer will be in any way penalized under the operation of this duty, and as its imposition will tend to maintain the industry in a healthy condition, I recommend the request to the Committee. </para>

We have to deal here with a comparatively simple question. It is well known that superphosphate is manufactured by the application of sulphuric acid to phosphatic rock, and the world&#39;s supply of the phosphatic rock, which every manufacturer of superphosphate requires, is obtained practically from one island, known as Ocean Island. </para>

                        <para>- That is practically in the same group as Ocean Island. To show the extent to which Ocean Island is resorted to for supplies of phosphatic rock, I may say that both Australian and Japanese manufacturers of superphosphate obtain their supplies of phosphatic rock from that island. South Australia is the only State in the Commonwealth in which so far a phosphatic deposit somewhat in the nature of phosphatic rock has been discovered, and I say advisedly that if the South Australian deposit were good for the manufacture of manures the people who own it would be in possession of an immense fortune, as every manufacturer of superphosphate in Australia would be delighted to be able to obtain his supplies of phosphatic rock from that source. Unfortunately, although many scientific investigations of the deposit have been made, speaking generally the quality is not good enough for the purpose. Though the South Australian deposit is&#39; now availed of to a certain extent, there would be a rush of people engaged in the manufacture of superphosphate to obtain supplies from that source if the quality were what is required. As I have said, superphosphate is made by the application of sulphuric acid to phosphatic rock. Sulphuric acid is manufactured very largely by the Mount Lyell Company, by Cuming, Smith, and Company, of Melbourne, and other companies,&#39; and is derived from pyrites. Every pyritic ore contains sulphur, and it is the sulphur extracted from these pyritic ores&#39; that is applied by the manufacturers . to phosphatic rock to turn it .into superphosphates. I believe that the Mount Lyell Company are now the largest manufacturers of superphosphates in Australia, and they started their operations when superphosphates were free of duty. They have practically no difficulty to surmount, but the. one difficulty common to all engaged in this industry in Australia of acquiring supplies of phosphatic rock. </para>

The Mount Lyell Company are manufacturing superphosphates to such &#39;an extent, and so cheaply, owing to the advantage they have in owning the mines from which the sulphur, and consequently the sulphuric acid, which they require, are obtained, that their competition with other Australian manufacturers has become severe and - I greatly dislike <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> mention names - Messrs. Cuming, Smith, and Company, of Melbourne, are being beaten by them. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. They are being beaten by the Mount Lyell Company, because of the advantage possessed by that company owing to the fact that their own mines provide them with a better supply of the sulphur necessary to manufacture sulphuric acid than can be obtained from any other mines in the Commonwealth. The other firm to which I have referred is at the present moment compelled to purchase pyrites from which to extract sulphuric acid, and the Mount Lyell Company, working on their own supply of pyrites, are consequently at a distinct advantage. It is clear that the competitors of the Mount Lyell .Company must pay much more for the pyrites from which to extract sulphur than the Mount Lyell Company  have to pay, and the consequence is that they are being left behind in the local competition. I do not believe that the imposition of the proposed duty would help those suffering from the competition in the slightest degree, but a probable result of its imposition would be that the Mount Lyell and other companies manufacturing superphosphates would avail themselves of the duty by forming a combine to put up the price. The duty cannot be necessary to the Mount Lyell Company, because they began their industry about four years ago, when there was no duty imposed on this article; they made big strides in the business, and largely increased their output. I am satisfied that they are not suffering from the effects of any importation of superphosphates, real or imaginary. If this duty is imposed, it will represent, neither more nor less, than an added cost to the price which farmers must pay for superphosphates. Any one who is conversant with the modem progress in agriculture must recognise that, speaking generally, our farmers cannot use too much superphosphate. One of our chief troubles in connexion with the cultivation of land in Australia for many years past has been due to a neglect to apply scientific methods in the industry. So far, our farmers have not used nearly enough superphosphates, but their supply in the future must depend upon the supply of phosphatic rock. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking from . memory, I think I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> that no one made an application to the Tariff Commission for the imposition of a duty on superphosphates. The Mount Lyell Company are doing very  well, and their operations in the manufacture of superphosphates is responsible for a large percentage of their annual (profits. I emphasize my statement that if the phosphatic deposits in South Australia were of sufficiently high quality the owners would have  a&#39;  big fortune at their command for the obvious reason that at the present time manufacturers of superphosphate have to go to Ocean Island for their supplies of phosphatic rock. We do not need to be protected against the importation of sulphuric acid, because no ship would .bring it to Australia except at excessive rates of freight. Practically the same rates of freight would be charged on sulphuric acid as are charged on explosives, and we have therefore no reason to fear in Australia any importation of this article. Though it is scarcely relevant to the question, I admit that sulphur is sometimes imported by those who cannot obtain pyrites, but that is  a  very expensive means of obtaining the raw material for the production of sulphuric acid. I am certain that the imposition of this duty can only lead to an increased price of the article. </para>

                        <para>- I can scarcely understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> interjection. The honorable senator will agree that the question of importation does not come into the matter if there is to be a combine. Whilst the Mount Lyell Company are doing well now, and do not require this duty, if it is imposed, as business men, they would no doubt be prepared to avail themselves of the opportunity, by combination _ with other manufacturers of superphosphates, to secure this extra  10s.  per  ton. We have nothing that it is necessary to protect. There is no question of our wanting to protect pyrites or phosphatic rock. If we have that rock, it is just as good to us as gold. We might just as well impose  a  duty on gold to protect our gold mines, as impose  a  duty on &#39; phosphatic rock, if we have it in Australia. Seeing that it will inevitably result in adding to the cost to every farmer of what he ought to be using far more than &#39;he. is at present,  it  would be extremely bad in the interests  pf  the Commonwealth to impose  a  duty. </para>

                    <para>- If I thought that the imposition of a duty on superphosphates would increase the cost to the farmer, I should not be prepared to vote for it, but I feel absolutely certain that it will not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has referred to the fact that the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lvell</inline> Company has the advantage of other, makers, but I have been assured by the Australian manufacturers that they do not fear the competition of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Company, or, in fact., the competition of any Australian or English manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- But they do fear the Japanese manufacturers, and the dumping of Japanese manures in Australia. Provision has been made in Japan for the manufacture of a very much larger quantity ,of superphosphates than will ever be wanted there, and the Japanese will be prepared to dump the surplus into Australia. Before superphosphates were manufactured in the Commonwealth, the price was very much higher than it) is now. I suppose that every honorable senator has been supplied with a copy of this circular, which shows that, before the advent of local manufacturers, the price of superphosphates in Australia was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per ton. There are now at least nine Australian manufacturers, and surely their very number causes a certain amount of competition, which will prevent an absolute combination to raise prices. Since the advent of the Australian makers the price has been reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> 7s. 6d.  per ton. The Australian manufacturers are prepared to guarantee that in the event of&#39; this duty being imposed they will not raise their price to the consumers. They are prepared to give  any guarantee that the Government, think necessary. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators have been supplied with a cutting from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of recent date, showing that the Farmers&#39; Co-operative Society at Warracknabeal called for tenders for the supply of superphosphates. The object of those farmers in co-operating is to obtain goods and retail them to their shareholders at wholesale prices, so that the farmer who wants only one ton of superphosphate - practically a retail quantity - gets it at a wholesale price. The whole of the Australian manufacturers, recognising that the object of the Co-operative Society was to sell retail quantities at wholesale rates, quoted a reasonable price which was very much lower than that prevailing before the article was manufactured in Australia, but a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hasell,</inline> an agent for Japanese companies, was able to quote a price of several shillings less per ton, and got the contract. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But I know that he is the agent for Japanese companies. I have travelled with him from Melbourne to Adelaide, and I know that he has a much greater admiration for Japanese than for Australian workmen. It is a very fair assumption when he is able to undersell all the Australian manufacturers that he is supplying Japanese superphosphates. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the importations have increased largely. It is because of the alarming increase of the importations from Japan and Germany that the necessity for the proposed duty exists. Prior to the advent of the Australian makers, it was found that the imported manures were largely adulterated, and in South Australia and Victoria  special  legislation had to be passed to deal with the question. </para>

                    <para>The workman in. Japan receives only 7&#189;d. to 10d. per day of eleven hours, whereas the average wage paid at present in this industry in Australia is 7s. per day of eight hours ; or, in other words, the manufacturer in Japan gets just twelve times as much labour for the same amount paid by the Australian manufacturer. In addition to this, Japan has superior facilities in regard to cheap raw material, and can land superphosphates in Australia at lower rates by subsidized steamers. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That is an additional advantage held by the Japanese over the Australian maker. A large amount of capital is invested in the Australian industry, which must expand enormously. Every year the amount of wheat-growing land for which this manure is principally used is increasing. In South Australia alone there are millions of acres that have never yet been used for wheat-growing - light lands which can grow wheat only with the use of superphosphates. </para>

                        <para>- This industry is just the same as any other. There are nine manufacturers in all the States except Western Australia. If the- combination to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred is making such a good thing of it, that it is worth any One else&#39;s while to go into the industry, I am certain that men of capital, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> instead of investing their money in Government bonds, will put it into a factory for producing superphosphates, and enter into competition with the combination of nine companies who are alleged to be making such glorious profits by robbing the Australian farmers. I do not apprehend &#39;that anything of the sort will take place. I am satisfied that the Australian manufacturers are business people who are satisfied with a fair business profit. All that they desire is to be protected against the dumping of this product from cheap-labour countries. They have not the slightest fear of each other. It would not matter if one company had a monopoly of sulphuric acid, which, by the way it has not. I am glad &#39;that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has introduced this request. If he had not done so, it was my intention to move it, because I realize the magnitude of this great industry, and recognise its immense possibilities of expansion. The local companies are now producing 185,000 tons, and employ 785 men, but those are only the hands in their immediate employ. In addition, there are hundreds occupied in quarrying the rock, carting it to the factory, and supplying the other necessary ingredients and materials, including fuel. When we estimate what the industry will be in a few years&#39; time, taking into consideration its probable expansion if we only impose a protective duty sufficiently high to enable Australian manufacturers to compete against the cheap labour of Japan and against the black labour of other countries - and the proposal of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is for a moderate duty - we must see that there is ample justification for this proposal, and I hope that the request will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. There is plenty of it everywhere, but there is very little pyritic rock so. rich as that being mined at Mount Lyell, so to some extent this may be regarded as a Tasmanian industry. Therefore, if it affected Tasmania . alone, one might agree to a larger rate of duty being imposed. But -there is one matter which we must remember in connexion with this item, and it always affects my vote when we are dealing with primary industries, and particularly with the farmers. We have imposed&#39; duties on certain goods, and whatever may be the benefit to the industries concerned, those duties must penalize the farmers for some time. </para>

One fact not referred to as frequently as it ought to be is well known in connexion with the farming industry, and that is that it is the natural tendency of farmers getting on fresh ground to exhaust that ground of all its  fertile properties before renewing them. That has been going on for years in Tasmania, where there is the most fertile land in the world. </para>

                        <para>- Wherever a farmer takes up rich land, his tendency is to go on using and re-using it until its fertile qualities become exhausted and require renewing. There is a vast area of land in Australia that has been exhausted of its fertile qualities through unscientific farming. Crop after crop of the same nature has been produced from it. The history of the superphosphate industry is a good indication of that state of affairs. A little while ago the manure in use was the ordinary stable manure. Afterwards guano  was used, and then a method was discovered of producing &#39;from phosphatic rock a product having superior qualities. Just at the time when the farmers are feeling the necessity of using this material, it is proposed to impose a duty on it, in face of the fact tha&#39;t the manufacture of  this particular kind of manure has developed without any assistance in the way of a duty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want my protectionist principles to interfere with the large farming industry now dependent on superphosphates. I have never claimed to be anything but a commonsense protectionist. I am not going to impose a penalty on all farmers simply to encourage the superphosphate industry. What is that industry compared with the farming industry which is to&#34; a great extent dependent on it, and which is becoming more dependent on it every day ? I quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story&#39;s</inline> intention, but I would like the honorable senator to look at the question broadly. In South Australia there are enormous areas of very poor land - the poorest land in any of the States. Those areas can be easily cultivated and worked, but above everything else they need the kind of manure with which we are now dealing. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> propose to do? For the sake of what is a miserably small industry compared with the farming industry he is going to penalize all the farmers of South Australia ? </para>

If honorable senators wish to do the right thing, a.nd I should be perfectly, willing to help them, the proper course is, when both Houses of Parliament are satisfied that the super-phosphate industry is developed to such1 an extent as to supply all Australian demands, to impose a duty by proclamation.

                        <para>- The honorable senator should not impute motives like that. If there were any reason why I should be influenced in that way it is the fact that the principal ingredient in the manufacture of  superphosphatic  manures is a by-product of the Mount Lyell mines in Tasmania, and therefore I should be in favour of the duty for Tasmanian purposes. It is not fair to tax Australian farmers&#39; until we have established the fact  that superphosphatic  manure can be produced here at bedrock prices, and that our natural conditions are such as to enable us to give farmers the manure they require at the lowest possible rates. We do not regulate the prices of wheat.. Our farmers have to realize at whatever they can get in the market. </para>

We know that our State settlements are now being pushed out into the drier regions, and that the settlers in those localities are greatly penalized unless they can obtain the cheapest form of fertilizer in order to make their areas productive. </para>

                        <para>- It is unfortunately this country&#39;s besetting difficulty that under existing circumstances we have to force our population into rainless districts. We are very much in need of an adequate rainfall in many parts- of the Commonwealth, and to overcome this climatic difficulty resort has been made to the use of superphosphates, in order that the crop may be got in&#34; early and got out early before the dry weather of summer comes1 along to shrivel it up. </para>

                        <para>- For. my part I care not where the fertilizer comes from, and I hold that it would be an absolutely mistaken policy to enforce any conditions that would render our dry areas less productive than they could be made. Under these circumstances, when it comes to making a choice between encouraging the manufacture of these manures in our several States and increasing the area of land that can be used for farming, I am strongly in favour of going for the enlarged  area, and so creating for numbers of men an infinitely better means of .livelihood than could be obtained in the cities. I think that the rate of wage in this industry has been fixed at as low as 6s. and 6s. 6d. per clay. I do not allow that fact to influence me in the slightest degree, but I suggest to the Committee that it is far preferable to enlarge the area under cultivation, especially in the drier regions, by enabling the farmers to obtain the cheapest possible fertilizer, no matter whence it may come.. Under existing conditions, we are face to face with the fact that our people are being forced into, the drier regions. </para>

During the last twenty years, we have had periodical droughts, and statistics show that we have had to import wheat. For instance, we imported, in 1897&#39;, 7,000,000 bushels, and, in 1903, 9,000,000 bushels. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it would. On five occasions during the last twenty-two years we have been obliged, to import wheat. What is the remedy proposed for Australia&#39;s unfortunate lot in  possessing a dry climate? Evidently it is to increase the cost of artificial manures. That will be a mistake if it is done. I believe that by encouraging the local manufacture of superphosphates we shall reduce the number of settlers in our dry areas, and to that extent diminish the amount of settlement, and production. I intend to oppose the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that this is the first time that an attempt has been made in a Parliament in Australia to put a duty on manures. It has always been considered a wrong thing to impose any artificial barriers between the cultivator of the soil and those factors that will aid him in its cultivation. The use of manures during the last eight or ten years has revolutionized farming in very many districts. Much of our soil is not very rich, especially in the plain country. It has been found that the use of manures with a moderate rainfall has almost doubled the crops. Of course, without moisture superphosphates do more harm than good, but with the manure and a little moisture, a man obtains a much better crop. </para>

                        <para>- Because I am not prepared at the present time to subject the farmers to the risk of an experiment of this description. In a matter of this kind, who are the parties to be considered by us ? Ought we to consider a few manufacturers in the centres of population, or the great body of agricultural population upon whom the prosperity of the Commonwealth absolutely depends? It cannot be denied that we have to depend almost entirely upon productions from the soil. To that source we owe our exports, and consequent large returns to the country. We have been told that there is no chance of the price of superphosphates being increased; but there are certain indications which point to the formation of a ring which is keeping up the price. For instance, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 27 th of March published the following report from Warracknabeal - </para>

This, it was considered, was evidence that the various firms had combined to keep the price up. The association decided to purchase  250  tons from Mr. Hasell at &#163;41s. per ton, as he was the only one Who had stood aside from the combine. The <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. S.</inline> Atkin, said the manure was better in quality than was arranged for. </para>

We have it on reliable authority that such is the case ; all the larger makers of superphosphate, and two out of three importing firms in Victoria having come to an understanding not only as to prices in this State, but with other manufacturers and importers in New South Wales and South Australia, not to trade within each other&#39;s provinces ; the only States open to all being West Australia and Tasmania.

                    <para>Further, we are informed, not only are prices fixed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> 7s. 6d. per ton (in Victoria), but, as the analysis indicates, the intrinsic value has been reduced, as a comparison with the details given in the <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Journal</inline> of February, 1907, shows. This difference, it is alleged,  is equal to 5s. to 9s. per ton disadvantage to buyers. </para>

                <para>This is an article which can be manipulated very easily. Unless you have a scientific test, you cannot tell the difference between manures. Therefore, these people are not only raising the price, but also reducing the actual value of the article by from 5s. to 9s. per ton. </para>
                <para>European superphosphates are 2s. 6d. to 4s. per ton dearer owing to rise in cost of raw material. Concessions by way of discount to Farmers&#39; Unions have been withdrawn; and we learn that an additional 1 per cent, interest is this season charged by the firms in agreement on sales made on terms. This, however, we believe is not quite all the story, for, owing to the present large production, with prospects of further increase when the new works of the Mount Lyell and Wallaroo Company in South Australia are open, it has been found desirable to find a market for surplus output rather than induce greater local consumption by lower prices; so one company at least is selling superphosphate delivered at main New Zealand ports at 72s. 6d. to 75s. per ton, paying freight and insurance, as against <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4,</inline> the lowest wholesale price to agents, and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> 7s. 6d. to farmers on this side. </para>
                <para class="block">What then becomes of the statement that the price o&#163; the article will not be increased? The production of the article has been increased largely, but instead of production and competition tending to lower the price of the article to the farmer, as we have been told, we find that these people are taking the product out of this country and dumping it into New Zealand at a price much lower than that at which they  sell  it to our own people. In the face of these facts, is it any wonder that we, who are trying to protect the farmers&#39; interests, should object to. this request? I trust that it will be rejected. </para>

                        trust that the request will be carried. Senator Lynch made a very strong speech in opposition to the proposal. Again, he showed his inconsistency as a protectionist. It will be recollected that while the Bounties Bill was under consideration he made a strong,&#39; and, in a measure, a pathetic appeal in favour of a bounty&#39; for the encouragement of an industry for the production of superphosphates.

                        <para>- The honorable senator was then prepared to give protection to the industry by asking the taxpayers to contribute so many thousands a year in order to secure its establishment. For what purpose? So that it would be able to provide farmers and others with manures at a price which would be satisfactory as compared, with the prices of imported manures. It is a remarkable thing that, in respect to an industry, when a request is made that will not place the farmer or the primary producer at any disadvantage, honorable senators claiming to be protectionists should say that their first duty is to see that the cheapest article is provided for a certain section, irrespective of the conditions under which it is made or manufactured. If protection is a good thing in connexion with industries which are established in closely populated parts of the Commonwealth, it cannot be a bad thing for the farmers. I can understand this request being opposed .by honorable senators who have taken strong objections to every protective duty, but when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> claims that the farmer should get this material as cheaply as possible, no matter under what labour conditions it is produced, he is very illogical. If a farmer is to be permitted to get his manures from Japan because it will be an advantage to him, surely, on that line  of reasoning, the instruments which he re- . quires for the cultivation of his land should be allowed to come in free? I cannot understand the position in which some protectionist senators must find themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I did not move to free corsets from  duty.  That is merely an aside. Senators Lynch and McColl have in various divisions been found voting in support of duties on agricultural implements and machinery on the ground that, as they are manufactured in the Commonwealth, the application of the principle of protection to the industry would lead to the employment of Australian workmen under Australian conditions, and that internal competition would tend to lower the cost of agricultural implements to the farmer. If they considered that contention sound and logical - and I say that it was - how can  they reconcile with it their present contention that manures from abroad should be admitted free of duty? As other honorable senators have pointed out, the industry for the manufacture of this particular kind of manure is established in various parts of the Commonwealth. Considerable sums of money have been invested in it, and it gives employment to a large number of men. </para>

If this request is not agreed to the probability is that in a few years&#39; time the Japanese manipulators will have the Australian market in their hands, and we know what we may expect when that takes place. When I say that there is not much commercial honesty about the Japanese trader, I am not voicing merely my own opinion after a visit to Japan, but the opinion of persons who have had many years&#39; experience of the Japanese. </para>

                        <para>- The statement has been made that within a short period of time the quality of the locally manufactured manures has deteriorated. That is a charge made against the Australian article by men who profess to be anxious to advance the interests of the Commonwealth. If they were so anxious to decry this Australian industry, why did they not look for opinions in regard to the quality of Japanese superphosphate? If they had done so they would have found that the Australian article is superior in every respect to the article imported from Japan. This is an industry which deserves protection, and if it receives the encouragement to which it is entitled, it will turn out as good an article as any that can be imported, and at a reasonable price. A guarantee is given by those interested that the price of superphosphates will not be increased if this duty is imposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I was a good deal surprised to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council submit this request. Until I received a circular from local manufacturers this morning, I had no idea that there was a desire on the part of any one to impose a duty on manures. I find now that Ministers take up the same position as the local manufacturers, and wish to impose such a duty. In South Australia, the Adelaide Chemical Works and the Wallaroo Smelting Works are manufacturing superphosphates. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has already started, or is contemplating the starting of, the same business, and I have heard no suggestion from the representatives of any of these companies that they cannot carry on without a duty. I think that if they suffered any hardships because of the fact that no duty is imposed on manures, I should have heard something about it. </para>

                        <para>- I had an interview this morning with some of the gentlemen who are responsible for this request, and their chief complaint was with respect to the importations from Japan. It is the cheap labour employed in the industry in Japan that is causing them inconvenience. This is confirmed by the statement made by the Minister in moving the. request. If it is the yellow man who is causing the trouble, I suggest that the Minister should propose a specific request for the imposition of a duty on. manures imported from Japan, leaving manures imported from other countries free of duty. That is a proposal which would be consistent with the position which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has taken up. If there is only one country against whose manures we desire to be protected, let us specifically refer to that country. I should like to say, from the farmer&#39;s point of view, that, whilst we tax all his implements, and whilst recognising that with other people he should contribute something in this way, he cheerfully submits to that taxation, he is then put into competition with all the cheap labour of the world in the disposition of his product. He has to compete with the cheap labour of Russia, Greece, Argentine, and other countries, and it is useless for him to complain. If honorable senators in placing him at a disadvantage by imposing this duty could rectify matters by regulating the prices of his products, the position would be entirely different. The prices of his products are regulated by the world&#39;s markets, and that being so, he should not be subjected to a duty on manures. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> pointed out just now that the drier areas of country in Australia are gradually being opened up, and this must lead to an increased consumption of superphosphates, because country with a limited rainfall can only be profitably cultivated bv the aid of these manures. Their use is not confined to the. drier areas of country, because inferior land, with a reasonable rainfall, can also be profitably cultivated with the aid of superphosphates. This all goes to show that the demand for this article will increase year by year as settlement extends, and that is a strong reason why we should refuse to impose a duty, because the output of the local manufacturers must be very largely increased. If the only objection is to the low price of labour in this industry in Japan, I repeat that the Minister should submit a request to make manures free from other countries and dutiable if imported from Japan. That would be the logical course to take, and unless the Government are prepared to take it, I shall not vote for the proposed duty. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly the whip had not gone round, or was not sufficiently heavy upon the back of the Government. But now, on the eve of concluding the Tariff debate, a request concerning a most important item is sprung upon us without notice. Possibly the Vice-President of the Executive Council thought  that the fighting power of the Opposition in this Chamber was exhausted. We all desire to bring this business to a speedy conclusion, and if we get fair and straight play we shall .give fair and straight play in return. We had a right to expect a few hours&#39; notice at least of this move. Now that the Government are going, of their own accord, or being driven, along this track, either by influence inside this Chamber or by some power outside it, they should go a little further. They are surely sufficiently acquainted with developments upon the other side of the world to know that there is such a thing as nitrogen, which is said by the greatest scientists to be one of the most powerful factors in the development of agriculture. Possibly, as nitrogen,, according to the scientists, will play a most important part in promoting the agriculture not only of Australia, but of the world, the Minister will accept my suggestion reinsert a prospective prohibitive duty against the importation of that product in its manufactured state. </para>

To-day he is equally  eloquent in his attempt to induce the Committee, to admit free the product of Japanese labour in the shape of artificial manures. That is beautiful consistency ! The honorable senator is usually strong in his assertion that we must shut out from Australia black or other Asiatic immigration, but on this occasion he advocates the free admission of a product, of cheap- coloured labour. . The night before last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> was most eloquent in proposing a duty on certain almanacs - a. part of the printing trade that he knows something about:- because, they were made in Japan. To-day he advocates the free admission of Japanese manures&#39;. I feel bound, therefore, to compliment those two honorable senators on the consistency of their inconsistency. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- Should it not rather be an inducement to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> even at this late hour, to reconsider his decision, and, if he cannot vote for a duty to protect this most important industry, at any rate to refrain from voting at all? The honorable senator, as a protectionist, has argued that if the local manufacturer is crushed out and the importer has the full control of any market, the latter will immediately raise the price to the consumer. That is perfectly true, but to my astonishment the honorable senator who, throughout the discussion of the Tariff, has been a consistent protectionist, excepting on one or two items of mining machinery, and has been especially emphatic in his advocacy of the exclusion of the product of black and Asiatic labour, has on this item slipped from the protectionist oath and from the White Australia ideal, and desires to admit duty free the product of Japanese superphosphate manufacturers. The ultimate effect of that policy must be, according to his own arguments on previous items, to shut up Australian factories, and allow the cheap labour of Japan to overwhelm an important Australian industry. </para>

                        <para>- To make the best money out of an industry one has to produce the best article; That is business all the way through, and there is no doubt the manufacturers engaged in making superphosphates are inspired by exactly the same idea. Therefore, I believe the Government are doing a proper thing. The duty will not injure the farmer or anybody else, but we shall benefit Australia as a whole when we have set ourselves the task of providing for our own requirements. Surely there is no place where fertilizers of every description can be manufactured better than in Australia, and therefore I will support the request of the Government. </para>

Otherwise, he would be aware that there is a considerable number of men who obtain their living by line fishing. We have allowed the tools belonging to a large number of occupations to come in duty free, and, as a matter of equity and justice, it is only right that we should make duty free the tools of trade of fishermen, whose occupation is more hazardous, and certainly less surrounded by the pleasures of life, than probably is any other occupation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, as cordage. The local industry was established with a protection of 20 per cent. Very early in the morning when its members ought to have been in bed, instead of dealing with the Tariff, the question of fishing hooks cropped up in another place, and, strange to say, somebody suggested the inclusion of the words &#34; and lines &#34; in this item. The suggestion was adopted because it was not recognised at the time that if was taking away a protection from a well established industry not only in Victoria, but throughout the Commonwealth. It may be doubted whether it is possible to produce fishing lines. But I hold in my hand over twenty samples of various kinds which I believe will catch from the smallest fish to a shark. I submit that any honorable senator who was returned to maintain the rates in the old Tariff must vote to retain the duty of 20 per cent. on fishing lines. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable senator must be aware that what are called deep-sea fish are caught with these lines? For instance, schnapper and trumpeter are caught with hand lines, though a few of the latter variety may be caught in a net. I really cannot understand why any honorable senator should desire to levy a protective duty on fishing lines. The position would be different if the proposal were one to levy a duty on all lines required for fishing rods, because they are chiefly used by amateurs, but it is simply absurd to tax the lines by means of which men have to make their living on our coast. Rightly or wrongly, the other House decided to allow these articles to come in free from the United Kingdom, and at 5 per cent. from other countries. I am amazed at the action of the Government in making a stand on this item when everything was proceeding so smoothly here. Is it fair or reasonable to tax the lines by means of which the ordinary fisherman obtains his living, especially when the duty produces such a small sum? I shall vote against the request, as this is purely a revenue duty and affords no protection to any one. </para>

                        <para>- I voted to put a duty on tools of trade which can be produced here. But here are articles which we do not produce, and which I hope will be allowed to come in free, because they are required in the prosecution of certain industries, which are essential to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth. Fishing is a very important industry for the development of which the Parliament has appropriated a considerable sum. Why should we hamper the industry by imposing a duty on its essentials? Again, rabbit nets and netting are essentials to the men engaged in the industry of trapping rabbits. That is becoming a very important industry. In many parts, in fact, nearly all over Australia, rabbits are becoming a pest, and it is desirable that the means of keeping them in check should be obtainable as cheaply as possible. This duty represents merely a bogus preference as do many other duties which disfigure this Tariff from end to end. </para>

                    <para>. -I wish to point out to the Minister that it becomes necessary for some manufacturers to import a kind of cotton yarn that has undergone a process known as &#34; mercerizing.&#34; The object is not to adulterate a material which should be made entirely of wool, but to produce a design or pattern on a woollen material by the use of a silk or mercerized cotton thread. The durability of the material is in no way affected by the use of this mercerized cotton yarn, but a certain appearance required to suit the public taste is obtained by mixing a thread of mercerized cotton yarn to form a check or a stripe. I therefore suggest that mercerized cotton yarn should be admitted free. Drapers in a large way of business, finding that certain designs of imported materials become very fashionable and are much inquired for, send patterns to local manufacturers if the material can be manufactured locally at practical prices, and ask them to supply a material like the pattern submitted, showing a design produced by the use of mercerized cotton yarn. I might mention that the price of this yarn ranges from 4s. to 5s. per lb. It is somewhat dearer than wool yarn, and is only used, as I have said, as a substitute for silk to embellish a woollen material. I propose to move a request for the insertion of a new paragraph making mercerised cotton yarn free. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope honorable senators will see their way to permit these duties to remain. The protection afforded by them is comparatively small, but it would have an encouraging effect, and should be considered in conjunction with other legislation with which we have dealt. We have passed a Bounties Bill in which we have provided encouragement, by way of bounty, for the growth of cotton in Queensland. It is being freely grown in that State, and we have reason to anticipate that it will shortly be grown to a very much larger extent than it is at present. The necessary plant has been laid down for the manufacture of cotton yarns, and just when the people concerned are starting this new industry, relying upon the proposal of the Government, it would be very discouraging and possibly disastrous to them if the Committee did not agree to the imposition of these duties. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Tariff was first introduced a duty was imposed on cotton piece goods. Certain people acquired a plant originally established at Ipswich for the manufacture of cotton piece goods, and with the idea of continuing the manufacture of such goods they did a great deal in the way of inducing farmers to cultivate cotton, with which they could supply the local mills. When cotton piece goods were made free the company realized that they had no chance of competing against the outside world in those articles; but, having the place in going order, they were able to manufacture cotton yarn, with which they supply the market to a very great extent. </para>

If I were compelled to procure a cheaper article, as a large number of people are, I should want to get what suited my pocket. As this Parliament has already passed bounties for the production of cotton, in order to induce the farmers in West Moreton or other districts to take up that industry, we should not allow all cotton manufactures to come in free when we know that a mill has been put up for the production of cotton yarn and other cotton goods. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot at present, although the history of the factory has been given in this chamber several times. The building is substantial, and contains a considerable amount of machinery. The Queensland Government at one time gave a bounty for the production of cotton piece goods, and a certain amount was made. For one reason and another, very little raw cotton was produced after that time. The company have, without the intervention of the Government, procured information regarding cotton-growing, and supplied it to the farmers, and have obtained also the best cotton seed available, and practically given it free to the farmers around the district to induce them to grow the raw material to supply the mill. As they have done so much in the direction favoured by this Chamber when it passed the Bounties Bill, it is only reasonable for us to give them a small amount of protection for producing cotton yarn or other cotton goods, which will go some way towards meeting the demands of other people in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has been able to give us some information on this question. The use of cotton yarn in woollen fabrics is often called adulteration, but strictly speaking it is not regarded by people who understand the trade as adulteration at all. It is a mixture. Certain people require flannel of a certain price, or blankets of a certain weight. Their purse will not allow them to purchase the finest qualities. Woollen material mixed with cotton is being largely manufactured in Australia. It is also being adulterated or mixed in some of the mills with something which many people regard as worse than cotton - the material generally spoken of as &#34;shoddy.&#34; But there may be various degrees of quality of shoddy. </para>

                        <para>- There are good and bad shoddies. In any warehouse in Australia can be found tweed goods which are composed to a large extent of shoddy, but which are really more highly priced and more sightly and durable than some of the so-called wools would be. These are requirements of trade, which will exist so long as human nature remains what it is. People will be poor, and, to quote the old Irish proverb, &#34; Poor people must have poor weddings,&#34; so they must have cheaper qualities of flannels or blankets. It does not necessarily follow that a certain amount of adulteration or mixture makes such articles unfit for the purposes for which they are used. A low-priced flannel, adulterated to a certain extent with cotton, is not a bad material, although it is not pure wool. The only deceit about it is when it is sold as pure wool at a higher price than people would otherwise pay for it. Looking at the matter in an economical and industrial light, the Australian manufacturers will have to compete to a certain extent with outside manufacturers of these articles, and, therefore, cotton yarn will be necessary. I am glad to hear that in Queensland the yarn is being manufactured. Although some honorable senators think that its use in the manufacture of woollen goods should be prevented, I see no obiection, as it will have to be used, to confining its use to that manufactured in Queensland. </para>

I have never voted for a preference where the duty was not necessary to protect an Australian industry. Where the question of Australian protection does not come in, I want goods to be free. The wool coming under this paragraph should be free because it is a common article of household use, and is the raw material women use in knitting stockings. In addition, as has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> this yarn is the raw material of a number of hosiery manufacturers, and as the duty is merely a revenue duty, the Committee ought to make it free. </para>

The total imports were of a value of  &#163;90,935,  and of them  &#163;75,234  worth came from the United Kingdom and &#163;13,326 worth from Germany. Between &#163;15,000 and &#163;16,000 worth altogether of these yarns came from Europe, and it is only to that wool that the duty of 5 per cent. really applies. </para>

                    <para>. - As far as I am concerned, the item is eminently satisfactory, but I would draw attention to the fact that in another place an effort was evidently made originally to give a preference of 5 per cent. to the United Kingdom. This preference, to which some people seem to attach a certain amount of importance, was removed. If certain honorable senators are aiming at giving a preference to the United Kingdom, I cannot detect any difference between this item and the last item we voted on. </para>

                        <para>- In this &#34;case it is not a question so much of talking to one&#39;s colleagues as to all sides of the Chamber. We will say that the Ministry are responsible for the preference in the last item. I cannot understand why they fought so hard to give a preference of  5  per1 cent, to Great Britain in the last item, while in this item and in the two following items all goods are admitted free. Surely this item afforded another opportunity for the Ministry to exhibit their marvellous preference to Great Britain. Why does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who is full of enthusiasm of same sort, vote to make the general Tariff on this item  5  per cent. ? </para>

                        <para>- That interjection just shows how we may be deluded bv this group of articles. No doubt a fumigator is often ordered by a medical man to be used for the  purpose  of . disinfecting a house in which there has been an infectious disease. I cannot understand why an instrument of that kind should be grouped with an  odorizer,  nor do I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> would desire to see an instrument used for sanitary purposes put in the same category as an ordinary article of toilet use such as an odorizer. </para>

It is specially used in very dry ground, where rock drilling is carried on, for the purpose of separating the particles of rock in the air, and so making the air purer for the miner. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a proposal to revert to the duty imposed under the Tariff as originally introduced in another place. I think this item did not receive the attention there to which it was entitled. Under the old Victorian Tariff&#39; there was a duty of 4d. per lb. on these corks, and at that time a very large number of cork-cutting machines were in operation in this State. When the Victorian duty was abolished by the first Federal Tariff, practically the whole of those machines were thrown out of use and a number of men in the cork-cutting industry had to join the army of the unemployed. One of our objects is to remove anomalies existing under the old Tariff, and as this is the only opportunity we may have to do justice to this industry I take advantage of it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose that at the present time there are more than twenty employed in the industry throughout the Commonwealth, but prior to the introduction of the Tariff of 1902 there were 130 employed in Victoria alone. It may be said that the industry is not a very important one, but we have given protection in this Tariff to smaller industries, and it will be admitted that it was a very great hardship upon men who had sunk the little capital they possessed in the purchase of cork-cutting machines and found employment at this work, that they should have to seek work at another calling. As honorable senators have been supplied with a good deal of printed matter in connexion with this item, I shall not delay the Committee further. </para>

Cartridge cases and powder are admitted free, and the filling of these cartridges in the Commonwealth is a recognised industry.

A private member proposes something, and the Minister, with a splendid anxiety to get on with the business, at once announces his entire concurrence with the raising of the duty. For a good many years I was a member of a Chamber that was specially concerned in the granting of taxation. I must own that it is a novel experience to me, although it may be a useful one, to find private members, without a message from the Crown, proposing taxation.

However, I do not wish to go behind your ruling; but I am sure you will permit me to reply to the Minister&#39;s statement that this thing has been done fifty times before. Murder has been committed in this world fifty times and a thousand times fifty times, but that does not make it any the less murder to-day. A thousand offences against the laws of God and man have been committed in the past; but that does not make them any more appropriate today. My honorable and learned friend, with whom I would be the last to have a personal difference, should not practically challenge me with the proposition that a thing is right because it has been done a great many times. I regret that this proposal has been made. I do not think it my duty to follow the lead of any private member in imposing taxation; and shall therefore vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- Wherever the fuse came from, it has been responsible for a great many of the fatal and minor accidents in Australian mining. Whilst I have used miles of fuse, I do not think that I ever handled a piece made in Victoria. I have used several of the imported fuses, and have headed agitations to prevent mine-owners from supplying certain classes of fuse, because of its inferiority and the disconnexions of the explosive in it. There is, however, an imported fuse known as Bickford&#39;s, which is the best ever put into a miner&#39;s hands. </para>

                        <para>- His fuse is being imported. I suppose that if fuse is made in Bendigo the Bendigo miners will get it immediately it is made, and consequently in the very best condition. But I question very much whether a yard of Victorian fuse would be seen in any of the Queensland or New South Wales mines. In Western Australia, so far as my experience goes, there is scarcely a miner who will take any other kind into a mine with him than Bickford&#39;s double tape, which is known to be thoroughly safe and reliable. This is a matter upon which we ought to be very careful. The duty as it stands is sufficiently high. I should not like to give a vote that would prevent Bickford&#39;s fuse from coming into Australia, or increase its price. </para>

                    <para>.- There is no doubt that very much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has said is perfectly correct. In mining there is nothing to be more careful about than the selection of good fuse, and I suppose defective fuse has been the cause of more explosions in mines than anything else. I would like to point out, however, that the factory making the largest quantity of fuse in&#39; Australia, and which sends fuse all over Australia, is that of Bickford, Smith, and Company, of Bendigo. They are the company making the fuse of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> speaks so highly. They purchased their factory at Bendigo in 1888, when it was a small affair, and have been carrying on business there since. I believe the fuse manufactured by that company is the only kind in use in the Bendigo district, where there are some 150 mines at work. To my knowledge there has never been any complaint whatever about it. With regard to the way the factory is managed, and to the question of wages, I do not think that there is any similar place in Australia where there are better conditions, or conditions even as good. In a way, the manner in which this factory is carried on can be compared with Cadbury&#39;s cocoa factory in the Old Country. The greatest attention is paid to the comfort of the persons employed, and the wages are excellent. That, however, is only a subsidiary question. The real question is : Are they making a good fuse that the miners can depend upon for safety and uniformity? There is no doubt whatever about that Bickford, Smith, and Company started the factory under a duty imposed by the Victorian Parliament. That duty was taken away, I think, under Federation, and it is a slight thing to give them the increase they ask for. It only amounts to one farthing on the coil. </para>

                        <para>- I question very much whether that is the case. It is quite possible that it would be an easy matter to find some Bickford fuse in some of the Bendigo mines. Nobody imports it simply for the fun of doing so. Bickford fuse is the most costly fuse on the market to-day. I will give the position regarding the fuses that are used as I knew it something like four years ago. There were three brands of fuse. One we could purchase at 7&#189;d. per coil ; another at 8&#189;d. per coil; but for the Bickford fuse we never paid less than10&#189;d. per coil, and we were prepared to pay that twice over in preference to using the stuff that could be got at 7&#189;d. per coil, for the simple reason that the Bickford fuse was reliable. Every time we had to use fuse we knew our lives were in our hands. </para>

                        <para>- Probably that is so. I am not interfering at all with what the Bendigo miners are doing. If they are taking the locally-made fuse, my position is absolutely tenable. The present condition of the schedule gives them an opportunity to continue using the Bendigo fuse. I am not endeavouring to compel them to use Bickford fuse, but I am trying to prevent the Committee doing anything that will force other people to use fuse that is inferior to Bickford fuse. </para>

How strange it is that in the northern mines of Queensland, where I mined for gold, in the southern mines of New South Wales, where I mined for coal, and in the mines of Western Australia, where I worked for years, I never came in contact with one foot of Victorian fuse. </para>

I am quite prepared to vote for the duty as it stands, but if the Ministry are stupid enough to make an attempt to increase it, then in the interests, not only of the miners but of the general community, and to prevent as many accidents as I possibly can, I shall be compelled to vote against them. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> will not press his request. Under item 341 we did make free certain sensitized films, because they are not made in the Commonwealth. They are different from the sensitized films which are used in connexion with photographic apparatus. It must be known to honorable senators generally that a plant has been purchased and a factory is being erected for the production of photographers&#39; sensitized films on a very large scale. A member of a very enterprising firm has been in America and has made all his arrangements for the establishment of a factory here, because he was encouraged to that end by the terms of the Tariff. I suggest that in the circumstances we should grant this reasonable protection of 30 and 25 per cent. I may add that at present these films are only made on a very small scale here, but the enlargement of the business is proceeding. </para>

                    <para>. - There is very good reason to anticipate the early erection of machinery and buildings for the carrying on of this industry in Australia, but I do not see why we should deal with this anticipated industry in a manner different to that in which we have already decided to deal with other industries which it is expected will be established within the Commonwealth at no distant date. We have dealt with other cases of this kind by making provision for the imposition of certain duties by the issue of a proclamation after a resolution has been carried by this Parliament stating that the industry has been established locally to such an extent as to warrant the imposition of the duty. </para>

Why should we not in this case follow the practice we have already laid down in regard to industries which it is anticipated will shortly be established in Australia ? I do not wish to suggest that in this instance there is any desire to deceive the Committee, but I believe that in at least one other instance the Committee was induced to agree to the imposition of duties on a mere empty statement without corroboration that something was going to be done at! some future undefined date. </para>

Some of the articles included in this item are already being manufactured here, and I should like to see their manufacture encouraged within reasonable bounds. They are referred to in a letter which I have received from a worthy Australian Federalist, and I believe a sound protectionist. </para>

                    <para>The principal photographic materials manufactured in the States of the greatest importance to the photographic art are dry plates and sensitive papers. These are of the utmost consequence to the production of photographic work, and it is essential that both should be of reliable and good uniform quality. As a large user of Australian sensitive papers (by compulsion), I regret to say that it possesses neither of these qualifications. </para>

We have decided to encourage other industries by the imposition of duties of  25  per cent. and  20  per cent., and I am at a loss to understand why we should go beyond that measure of protection in this case, and also why we should depart from the very wise course we previously adopted in respect of industries to be established of recommending the imposition of duties when by resolution of Parliament it has been affirmed that the local industry is sufficiently established to warrant their imposition. I should prefer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> to specifically mention in his request the articles on which he thinks duties might be imposed, and to add the condition which we have previously adopted providing for the withholding of the suggested protection until it has been demonstrated that the articles can be manufactured of good quality in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - We cannot let this request go without some further information than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has given. According to the honorable senator, some Australian has been abroad, has taken photographs, and then converted them into .stereoscopic views in Australia, and now he wishes to impose a duty of 30 per cent, upon anybody else who wishes to introduce stereoscopic views. The honorable senator enlarged upon the educational value&#34; of these views, but why we should specially educate our people by means of this particular set of stereoscopic views, and should not permit them to obtain other equally good views for the same purpose, I am unable to understand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> admits that his proposal is one which would impose a tax upon the education of the people, in respect of a knowledge of what is to be seen abroad. If that kind of thing is to be done, we might just as  well impose a duty of 30 per cent, on works of art. I should like the Minister  to explain why he remained silent when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> brought forward this entirely new proposal, which is so much at variance with opinions which members of the Government have expressed in connexion with other items. - </para>

It is not. It was contained in the Tariff as originally introduced. The word &#34; photographs &#34; only was used, but this was limited in another place by the addition of the words &#39; &#39; of Australian subjects.&#34; That limitation had the effect of admitting stereoscopic views from other parts of the world free. The case made out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is that there is established in three of the States a photographic business whose proprietor is sufficiently enterprising to send throughout the world photographers to take the most attractive views. </para>

The negatives taken by the travelling photographers are sent to the proprietor in Australia, who finishes them and turns them into regular stereoscopic views of a very high class. Some have been exhibited to me and to other honorable senators. As the request was comprehended within the original proposal of the Government, and involves the encouragement of an excellent industry, I have no hesitation in supporting it. </para>

Works of art are free under other items. There are numerous other instances in which the common sense of the community and their love of the beautiful has overwhelmed the desire for the promotion of protection to these exceedingly limited industries. I trust, therefore, &#39; that the Committee will reject the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- It would appear so at first sight. I do not want to go to the extreme of taxing the negative and allowing free the print taken from it. That would be an inducement to an Australian or anybody else to develop his plate outside Australia and send the print in. On the other hand, I object to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> proposition that because some one has taken a photograph in New York we should place a duty on some one else who takes a photograph in  London. The honorable senator cannot tell me that any one is sufficiently energetic to have visited and taken photo-  graphs of the scenery in all parts of the world. The honorable senator, because this Australian is said to have visited aH the beauty spots of the world, would make dutiable astronomical views which can only be taken by scientific men at the various Observatories. Is it desirable to put a tax on those, merely in the interests of the one individual to whom the honorable senator refers? A reasonable way out of the difficulty would- be to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> request, but to considerably reduce the duty on the item, which is double that of the 1902 Tariff. . Will the Minister accept a reduction of the duty? The item covers licht-pauspapier  - light tracing paper in the prepared state. We have already agreed  to make light tracing paper in the unprepared state  -  licht-pausrohpapier - free. That paper is prepared in Australia by, I believe, one man only, in a small way, but, on the other hand, it is used by engineers and draughtsmen allover Australia for duplicating their plans by the helio process. It is rather a heavy handicap on them to place a duty of 30 per cent. on the paper they use merely because one man in Australia is attempting in a primitive way to sensitize the unprepared paper. The paper I refer to is not the ordinary paper used by photographers, but comes under the term &#34;sensitized paper.&#34; At . this stage of the Tariff I shall not propose to make a separate paragraph of it. It is far better to leave it where it is, and reduce the duty after the body of the item has been dealt with. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order. In the past the practice has been, when a request to leave certain words out of an item has been carried in order to put them in a new paragraph, to complete the new paragraph before dealing with the part of the item from which the words have been taken. Would it not be more consistent to do that in the present instance? </para>

Printed testimonials to the effect that it is equal to the best imported standards are at the disposal of honorable senators. On the production of this class of work there are engaged five firms in Melbourne, four firms in Sydney, three firms in Adelaide, two firms in Perth, and two firms in Brisbane. I may mention that in addition to the testimony which was borne by my honorable colleague as to some very artistic work which had been done in Tasmania, I hold certain testimonials which speak in the highest possible terms as to the artistic character of Australian work. We have various firms engaged in the industry, and. if the work can be done here as well as it is done abroad, there is no reason why we should import any articles of this description. </para>

                        <para>- I made no promise of the kind. I mentioned that I had been waited upon by certain persons who were interested in having stained glass windows made free, and that long before the question was raised here I had declined to make any promise to them. I have not re-read what I said on that occasion, but I feel certain that <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> will show that I simply stated to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the proper place for discussing the matter was in connexion with an item in the miscellaneous division. I pointed out that the request if carried would go beyond the expressed wishes of those who were responsible for its submission, because it would permit of the free admission of not only church windows, but also the parts that are imported and assembled into the various designs which find expression in windows in ecclesiastical and other buildings. I simply indicated, as I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will remember, that the proper time to discuss the proposal would be when we reached this item. Although representations of a very strong character had been made to me, I declined to promise to support any such proposal. I opposed the idea and pointed out that if it were to be discussed, free from ever)&#39;, other consideration, there was one place in which it could be raised, and an opportunity would be afforded to any one 4.- submit a request. But as for supporting a proposal to include heraldic-glass in this item I certainly gave no such promise. </para>

                    <para>. - I had overlooked this item until attention was drawn to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. But I have a recollection of the discussion which I originated some time ago. I had not had an opportunity ot looking up the debate, but I think that my honorable friends have misconstrued The&#39; statement of the Minister. I cannot recollect any remark which justifies the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> made a definite promise. One of my complaints about this Ministry is that one cannot get a definite promise about anything. It would, indeed, startle me if in this matter the Minister had committed himself, because at that time there was no reason why he should. Although he is politically young, still he has been here long enough, I venture to say, not to give a promise unless he is absolutely compelled by the circumstances of the case. He gave me the impression that he was trying to get &#34;rid of the matter for the time being. He uttered a great many phrases about matters which were not pertinent to the subject, and I thought that he was displaying some skill at considerable length in avoiding the real issue. I hope that he will not do so tor night. </para>

That remark applies to every other work of art which is admitted free. The honorable senator said that a certain number of persons are engaged in turning out work of the highest quality. Cannot the same thing be said in regard to works of art such as statuary and pictures? </para>

                <para>Honorable senators must be aware that the authorities of various churches in the Commonwealth import some of the finest pictures that find their way to Australia. Under this item as it now stands they would be unable to import these pictures free of duty, because churches are not mentioned in the item, and I believe that in the Commonwealth they are not covered by the definition of a &#34; public institution.&#34; Under the item as it stands persons interested, in public institutions would be able to import works of art free qf duty, and I desire to permit church authorities to do the same. </para>

                            (New South Wales) &#91;9.25&#93;. - I wish to ask a question in reference to this matter. &#34; Pictures n.e.i.&#34; and &#34; Works of Art, framed or unframed, imported for public institutions,&#34; are admitted free under separate items. Why should we have two different items dealing with the same matter. It seems to me that there was clearly in the mind of the framer of this portion pf the schedule the necessity of making a distinction between works of art and ordinary &#39; pictures which could not be so described.

I am sorry that the honorable senator is not able to say at. once that he will do so. I am sure that he is not altogether destitute of artistic taste, and I therefore regret that he should have said that there is no limit to our excellence in the production of stained glass work. I am sorry also that one of his supporters should have- asserted that a stained glass window does not represent art. </para>

More than once I have objected to putting heavy duties on such articles, and my objection still remains, in spite of many defeats. I see no reason why the few articles in this item should have been removed from the free; list. Whether they are made here or not, they should be free. It is a great blot on this Tariff that we should be taxing articles of medicine and surgical appliances. I move - </para>

Hence the distinction. I submit that  25  per cent. is a fair protection to give. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the hose used by fire brigades all over Australia. It is a special make, the best of which is produced in Dundee - the &#34; Rob Roy &#34; hose, made by McGregor. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade will be importing, this year,  25,000  feet of it. That is only one brigade, and there are ninety-nine in Victoria, considerably more in New South Wales, and many in the other States. The duties of  25  per cent. and  20  per cent. in item  349,  under which this hose would otherwise fall, will mean a very serious expense for the brigades to meet. Hose of this size is not made in this country, although smaller hose is. The Committee, I am sure, have no wish to penalize those bodies, which exist for the public good, and are maintained partly by public subscriptions, by compelling them to pay a large amount to the Commonwealth revenue. </para>

                        <para>- The item does not include nets and similar appliances into which people cut off by fire have to jump to save their lives. I do not want to harrow any one&#39;s feelings, but at a great fire in Sydney a few years ago, since the inception of the Commonwealth, and while the Senate was actually sitting, a young man driven to the top of a high building by the heat of the fire from below was at last forced to make an awful leap - a leap that ended in death. I am sorry to say that I have to own that this occurred because the Fire Department had not provided the nets or whatever appliances are used for persons to jump into. When any one passes that lofty building, as I and other New South Wales&#39; senators have frequently to do, the thought is borne back to us with a feeling of much more than sorrow that any human being should be placed in such an unfortunate position as that young man. </para>

                    <para>. - This item seems to carry with it a recommendation on the part of the Ministry that any immigrant, or for that matter any citizen of the Commonwealth, returning from abroad, shall be allowed to bring into the Commonwealth furniture and household goods free. But there is a proviso that the furniture and household goods shall not exceed &#163;50 in value for each adult passenger. If we are going to recognise the principle - and it is a desirable one too - it seems to me we are making the limitation too low. I can quite conceive that many immigrants from England, desirable from many points of view, might come here, and bring furniture and household goods, preferring to do so than to sell them, and I think the limitation of&#163;50 is too low. I would ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, seeing that the Government recognises the principle I have mentioned, to increase the amount. I. suppose it is assumed that a man coming to Australia will not have more than&#163;50 worth of furniture and household goods. If he is a valuable immigrant, and brings anything at all, he will bring goods of a greater value than&#163;50, and it would not be a pleasant thing to tell him on his arrival that we will only allow him to bring in&#163;50 worth of his goods free, and will tax the rest. The limitation is too low, even for a man of very humble means, and is too low altogether for a person possessed of considerable means. I do not think it would be anything more than the occasion requires; if the Government made the limitation&#163;150. </para>

                    <para>. - The&#163;50 limitation contained in the item was in the Tariff of 1902, and is the limitation which existed previously in certain State Tariffs. The limitation is&#163;50 for each adult. The first thing I would point out is that if a man comes to Australia with four children and a wife, he  will be able to bring in household goods&#39; to the value of&#163;300. </para>

The limitation is one which we are accustomed to, and it was in operation in certain of the State Tariffs. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> answer does not make the position much better. Until I pointed it out to him he did not recognise that if a man comes to Australia with a wife and family, and his children are under  12  years of age - they would be desirable immigrants, I suppose - no additional allowance is made him with regard to the goods he may bring in free. The item ought to be more elastic in one of two directions. Either the amount should be increased to  &#163;150,  or two children should be reckoned as one adult, no matter what are their ages. If the latter course were adopted it would save the Customs authorities from inquiring into the age of a man&#39;s children, and would probably save the father of a family making mis-statements regarding his children&#39;s ages. </para>

If they were not retained, any one, of his own volition and without restriction, could send his goods elsewhere to be repaired, and on bringing them back be liable only in respect of the repairs, although the repairs might just as readily have been made in the Commonwealth if it were not for the existence of a certain prejudice. This practice would no doubt be adopted by the importing agents for special classes of goods. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;10.29&#93;. - Iaskthe Minister to consent to a request for the omission of the words &#34; at the time of exportation.&#34; He will see that the owner of the goods at the time of exportation would not be likely to have a legal representative. If I read the item incorrectly, my honorable and learned friend will put me right, but it seems to me that the words &#34; at the time of exportation &#34; set up a difficulty which is practically insurmountable. So long as the owner of goods is alive, he will not have a legal representative in the sense involved in this item. I think the words to which I refer might be omitted without the slightest detriment to the revenue. I have no doubt that what is meant is that if a person leaves the Commonwealth with goods in his possession on which duty has been paid, and dies abroad, those goods being returned in charge of the legal representative of the deceased should be admitted free. I am afraid that the words &#34; at the time of exportation &#34; render this item a nullity. I propose to move a request to leave out those words, but will not do so if there is some explanation that will get over the difficulty.

                    <para>.- The honorable senator appears to be putting upon this item a limitation which it does not bear. He comes to the conclusion that the owner of the goods has died abroad. That is not necessarily so. This is the recognised provision. Personal effects come in under item 438. This item deals with travellers&#39; samples, which must be checked on exportation. Would it meet the honorable senator&#39;s views to insert the words &#34; at the time of exportation &#34; after the word &#34; owner &#34; where it first occurs, instead of&#39; where it second occurs ? </para>

These blankets, which are not blankets in the ordinary sense, are not made by the people who make the. machine, but are bought by them from some one else when putting up the machine. They give what is called a &#34;spare.&#34; Under this item half-a-dozen spares can be imported with a machine, but if a spare is bought after the machine has been brought in, duty has to be paid on it. The proposal is absurd. </para>

                    <para>. - This motion brings us back to some ancient history. In the case of items 255 and 256 which included glass scientific apparatus, the latter was struck out with a view of making them dutiable, seeing that similar articles are manufactured in Queensland. The paragraph now under consideration embraces practically the same class of instruments, and, therefore, it is only consistent to make it dutiable. </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to paragraph a, I point out that a duty of  2d.  per lb. on currants was all that was asked for by the A section of the Tariff Commission, the B section recommending only  20  per cent. Even a duty of  2d.  per lb. is equal to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of about  100  per cent. Now it is proposed to increase that duty by one-half. So that a duty equal to something like  150  per cent. is proposed. Surely this is an enormous rate. It would be absurd to agree to it. It is time to take notice of the way in which important revenue-producing items are being treated, the revenue being thrown recklessly away. Why should we impose a duty of  150  per cent. on an article such as is used in every home in the Commonwealth? I cannot believe that the Committee is willing to pass a duty exceeding  2d.  per lb., and therefore I move - </para>

If there is one reason that should move the Committee in favour of a duty against imported dates it is contained in the report which has been presented to the Senate in connexion with Secret Drugs, Cures, and Foods. In that report there is the following reference to dates - </para>

                    <para>A personal friend, who was for many years an exporter of dates and other produce from Northern Africa, where he was a resident merchant, related as follows : - Dates are brought in bunches from the interior on camels&#39; backs, which are unloaded every night, the loose hair and general dirt are well mixed up in the process. Before packing, the dates are &#34; washed &#34; in tanks which are themselves never cleaned from year to year. Water is added, any water, as the liquid diminishes in the tanks whence the dates are taken for packing. During the season the packers are gathered from the streets or anywhere; ragamuffins with any or every kind of disease, and all irredeemably dirty and insanitary. The dates are pressed into the boxes with the packers&#39; feet. Details do not matter. &#34; No more dates for me,&#34; he added, &#34; I have never touched them since.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I would like to say very briefly that this request is made solely in the interests of the Mildura raisin and currant-growers. As far as the date industry of Australia is concerned, whatever it may be in the future, at present it is hardly in its infancy, and Parliament has already passed a bounty on . dates. That is sufficient encouragement for the growers. There is also a duty of1d. per lb., which is the most the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission ventured to suggest. The proposal can only have one object in view, that is, to shut out dates, not in the interests of any one growing them here, but simply because they come into competition with the dried fruits which Mildura sends out. There ought to be a limit beyond which the Committee will not go. There is a duty on dates recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and there is also a bounty. </para>

I should not have brought it forward had I known that I would be driven in a corner like this.

The other House saw fit to strike out the schedule, but on item 123 duty was paid from the 8th August to the nth December, 1907, and on items 162 and 165 from the 8th August until the 28th November. In some cases the rebate was paid, but in other cases, although it was claimed it was not paid. The object in requesting the insertion of this new schedule is to permit of small claims for rebate during the period I have mentioned being duly paid. </para>

In the case of a firm who paid duty under protest, and who did not raise the prices of the machinery articles they sold in consequence of any increase of the duty, have they, under this proposal, a reasonable hope of getting a refund of the duty so paid?
