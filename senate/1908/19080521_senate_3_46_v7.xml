                    <para>. - By this request we sought to define the meaning of &#34;superficial foot &#34; and &#34; super face.&#34; Honorable members in another place have accepted our definition of &#34; super face,&#34; harmonizing as it does with the practice of the&#39; Department and the usages of the trade. They have not, however, agreed to accept the amendment we requested them to make, defining the meaning of superficial foot. The matter has been discussed at such length that I need not now go into it very fully&#34;. The practice under the previous Tariff, and of the trade, was to reckon a superficial foot as being one inch  in thickness, and duty was charged accordingly. If a board was any proportion of an inch in thickness, one-sixth inch or one-eighth inch thick, only one-sixth, or one-eighth of the duty was charged upon it. It is quite true that in the Tariff as originally introduced, the Government provided for a definition of superficial foot in the terms of the definition proposed by the Senate, but such strong representations were made from all the States, other than Queensland, and by the trade, that the Government were convinced that it would be most inequitable to alter the old practice in such a way as to quadruple the duty or increase it in the proportion to which the board was under one inch. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Committee not to agree to the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The honorable senator talks about consistency in protection, but in this case the Government are running away from a proposal which is calculated to give an enormous amount of employment to workers in timber in Australia, quite apart from the protection which it would afford to the national timber industry. I point out that it is impossible to cut an inch, board into two half-inch boards, because allowance must be made for the cut.. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The definition of &#34;superficial foot &#34; proposed by the Government would be an inducement to importers of timber not to import it in large sizes, but to have it cut up into small sizes abroad to avoid waste and duty. They would thus deprive the workers in timber in Australia  of work to which they are legitimately entitled, and yet, in the face of this fact, the Minister has the unblushing effrontery to talk to&#39; other honorable senators about consistent protection. Arguments which the Minister has .not advanced at all were used elsewhere, and largely influenced the Government in altering their decision in connexion with this matter. It was urged that timber cut very thin, and required here to be used for veneers, could not be obtained in Australia. It is known that the Government has a very high regard for the local piano industry, which uses a great deal of veneer, and is very largely benefited by the protectionist policy. The Government has abandoned that policy as applied to a national Australian industry, to give another industry a further show, notwithstanding the fact that there is a high protection given to the piano industry already. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny that, but I am pointing OUt some of the reasons which induced the Government to back clown in this matter. I have always contended that veneers do not come under this item at all, but I am referring to the special pleading which was used in order to effect the back-down of the Government. To overcome the difficulty raised in this connexion, I am willing to make a concession in the proposal that I shall submit. My object is to prevent the importation of the half-inch rubbish which is imported here, chiefly in the form of American white pine. </para>

It would be better for a man to build his house of cardboard than to put this half-inch American white pine into it. My object is to prevent the importation of that kind of timber at the ridiculously low rate of duty imposed on timber in half-inch planks, tongued, grooved and dressed, To overcome the difficulty with regard to veneers, which has had such enormous . influence with the Government - and it would be useless to deny it, because every member of both Houses has been circularized . with regard to the effect of this particular definition of superficial foot, on the introduction of timber- for the manufacture of veneers - </para>

No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is of the same opinion ; but, working on the salvage principle, he is adopting a wise course in proposing to throw some of the cargo overboard. There are strong reasons for accepting his amendment. The matter is, of course, of some concern to the sawmill employ6s, especially in Queensland, though it also affects every saw-mill in Australia. I dare say that  20,000  or  30,000  men in Queensland are directly or indirectly concerned in this matter. I hope that honorable senators opposite will remain stalwart in support of the Senate&#39;s former, determination, and that we shall send the Tariff back to the House of Representatives with an indication of our , sense of the importance of the point at issue. </para>

Since we dealt with the matter some weeks ago, I have been placed in possession of more information than I then had. It is idle for any honorable senator to say that the imposition of this extra duty will give additional employment to saw-mill hands in any other State than Queensland ; and I doubt very much whether it will have such an effect there. As a matter of fact, the particular timber that will be affected is that which is used very, largely in the back-blocks by settlers who want to build cheap houses. They build almost entirely of timber, which, if the Senate&#39;s former definition is enforced, will pay double duty. A considerable portion of that, timber is&#189;-inch matchboarding. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind will result. Matchboarding is cut up at the mills out of timber that would be practically waste if not so used. The&#189;-inch stuff to which I am referring is cut out of the scantlings after the large* pieces of timber have been cut. It would&#34; never pay to import the waste timber, because, on account of the awkwardness of the shape, it would be difficult to stack it. The same thing applies to i-inch floor boarding, which is certainly used by the poorer people who cannot afford expensive houses. The carrying of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> amendment would not lead to any additional employment in saw-mills, at any rate, in the southern portion of Australia. </para>

                    Of course there is timber- in Queensland, but it is not suitable for all purposes, and, as has been stated over and over again, the Queensland people have not sufficient enterprise to supply orders from Melbourne and Adelaide which have been standing over for twelve or eighteen months.

                        <para>- Of course they do, to supply their own necessities ; but it appears that they are not prepared to supply the southern States. The imposition of the proposed duty would mean that people using 1/2-nch timber would have to pay double duty, or bear the increased cost of obtaining Queensland timber. I hope that the Committee will agree to the Minister&#39;s motion, and not press the request. </para>

                    <para>. - &#39;In case any honorable senator should be led astray by the special pleading of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> on&#39; behalf of the jerry builders, I wish to point out that the facts show a discrepancy in his own argument. The honorable senator says that fc-incli boards are nearly always cut out of the scantlings left over when- the larger, sizes have been cut up. There is not a member of the Senate who knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> does that this 1/2-nch timber, imported &#34;as matchboarding, is generally cut out of white pine that is useless foi almost every other purpose. It is never  used for big work at all, because it would not be accepted for any of the purposes for which large timber is required. </para>

Now, in regard to work being done in other States besides Queensland, I submit that the adoption of this definition would not increase the price by one iota to the poor settler about whom the honorable senator made such an <inline font-style="italic">ad misericordiam</inline> appeal. It would lead to the timber being imported in larger sizes, and the saw-mills in the other States would be employed in cutting up the imported timber just as the sawmills in Queensland would be employed in cutting up local timber. I have travelled very considerably throughout Australia, but I have not yet known sawn timber to be carried into the back-blocks from the coast to be used in building houses. A good Australian slab humpy is infinitely superior to any house made out of that rubbish ; even a tent would be as good. As a matter of fact, we cannot afford to carry the timber away from the railway line, or to carry it very far in a train, because the cost is prohibitory. If, however, it is necessary to carry timber by railway,I submit that the test way to economize is to pay freight on good timber rather than on rubbish. </para>

                        <para>- No. My desire is to secure to Australian workmen as much employment as possible in the cutting up of the timber. I do not want the whole of that work to be done in Canada or the United States, or the Baltic. This timber is rarely, if ever, used by any one who is building a house for&#39; himself or wants honest workmanship in his house. It is mainly, if not entirely, used by jerry builders in the big cities. I do not think that they deserve any special consideration. With regard to the general application of this definition, in all the States, except New South Wales of late years, the definition of a super foot of timber has been one square foot, one inch or less in thickness. I have frequently bought timber, but any timber below1 inch thick has been, charged as if it were an inch thick. </para>

The timber merchants of Queensland have never supplied any flooring boards for the southern States&#39;. They have been requested to supply various kinds of timber, but orders sent eighteen months ago are still unfulfilled. This will be simply a revenue duty, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has stated over and over again in this chamber that he is strongly against such duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope a division will be taken. It is not fair of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> to ask us not to press for another expression of opinion. How often has the honorable senator, during the consideration of the Tariff, moved for different rates of duty, and when he could not get one rate, modified his proposal a little and divided the Committee on it again? I have a distinct recollection of three separate divisions on one item, a proceeding which was characterized here as putting the matter up to auction. Now, when honorable senators have decided not to come down to three-eighths of an inch, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is willing that the timber which has been described as matchboard shall be exempt from the provision, it seems fair to ask the Committee to agree that at least one-half inch in thickness shall count throughout Australia under the Tariff just as it counts in Queensland now in connexion with all timbers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out that that is the regular method by which timber is sold there. This is not a new matter. It has been brought under the notice of Ministers of Trade and Customs time and again during the last four years, with a request that the question should be fixed up. The answer was that no alteration could be made, because under the old Tariff the practice was definitely agreed on, but surely, now that the Tariff is being revised, it is fair to ask, in the interests of those employed in the timber industry, that provision should be made in the schedule with regard to timber of these small sizes, which, if cut here, will give work to a large number of people. </para>

                    <para>-- I hope the Committee will adhere to their re quest. It was agreed to on a motion submitted by myself. The matter is one which, from a protectionist stand-point, is regarded as of considerable importance by the printers of Australia. . Having at one time filled the position of President of the Australian Typographical Union, comprising thousands of working printers, and constituting really a federation of the working printers of Australia,- I am in a position to say that they are unanimously of opinion that the duty which we requested to be imposed would be ah equitable one, and would give them the measure of protection to which, as protectionists, they claim they are entitled. </para>

The reason given is that the rates had not been paid upon the ^.building occupied by this person, and his ~~name did not appear upon the ratepayers&#39; roll. Wise&#39;s depend in a large measure upon the rolls, and as the name did not appear there it did not appear in Wise&#39;s -Directory. </para>

They also say that Australian printers are not able to undertake their work because of the time in which they require to get it done. Now I have before me two directories. One is the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Directory</inline> published by Sands and McDougall - in my opinion the most important directory published in Australia. The work in it is much superior to that contained in <inline font-style="italic">Wise&#39;s Directory.</inline> The printing and publishing of this book is performed within a period of three months by the firm of Sands and McDougall. Their directory is sold at 21s., while Wise&#39;s costs 22s. 6d. </para>

                    <para>. - The duty as it now stands ought, I think, to be sufficient for all purposes. Assuming that one of these directories weighs 4&#189; lbs., a duty of 4d. would come to about&#163;75 on 1,000 copies. Now, &#163;75 on the cost of 1,000 copies means a very considerable amount on the total number. The duty, it is to be remembered, is charged on the complete book, <inline font-style="italic">pot</inline> simply on the printed pages within the cover, so that, on the printed matter alone, the duty is far more than 4d. per lb.I cannot imagine why a larger duty should be asked for. The method of charging duty at per lb. is apt to be deceptive. If it were charged per ton, we should better understand what we were dealing with. Here is a duty amounting to &#163;37 per ton, and we are asked to increase it to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;56</inline> per ton. It is too much altogether. If a protection of , &#163;37 is not enough, I am sure that a protection of &#163;56 is not justified. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It should not be forgotten that the circulation of directories is limited, and that if the difficulties of production are made too great, a man may have to cease operations, so that the circulation which now takes place, and which does afford a very substantial distribution of money, may be lost in the effort to get so much. I submit that, in the interests of Australia, the duty, as it now stands, is too high, and ought not to be increased. </para>

                        <para>- No. If one could imagine what he says - that the duty is going to be so heavy as to crush out these people - of course it would have the effect I desire. Let me point out to those who talk about high duties the great disparity in wages in the printing, trade in Australia as compared with some of the important cities in the United Kingdom. In Victoria, printers work forty-eight hours a week, and receive &#163;2 16s. In: New South Wales, printers receive about&#39; the same wage as in Victoria. In Tasmania, the wages paid to printers are as high, and in most cases higher, than the wages paid to many other classes of artisans. On referring to the <inline font-style="italic">British Printer,</inline> I find that in most cities in the United Kingdom the. hours of printers range from fifty-two to fifty-six, and the wages from 28s. to 32s. a week. Honorable senators can understand, therefore, why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> is extremely anxious to have this work done, not in Australia, but in the United Kingdom, where the hours of work are considerably longer, and the wages, in many cases, only about one-half of that which is paid to Australian workers. </para>

                    <para>. - On inquiring in the Library, I found that the price paid by the Commonwealth for these directories, large and small alike, is a guinea. Assuming, as a general basis, that to be the retail selling price of the books here, it is fair to assume that the invoice cost of them at Home would be about 12s. or 12s. 6d. Last night I weighed two directories. The New South Wales Directory weighed 5&#188; lbs., and the Tasmanian Directory, 3 lbs. If we take the average weight at 4&#189; lbs., then, at the rate of 6d. per lb., the duty on a book worth 12s. 6d. would come to 2s. 3d. On that basis, in order to be consistent with the rates which we have imposed for protective purposes on other items, what is . now proposed seems to me to be pretty reasonable, although, of course, it&#39; represents an increase of 50 per cent, on tHe original duty of 4&#189;. per lb. Under the old Tariff, these directories were admitted duty free. It must be bore in mind, however, that the importers supply these directories, not only to Tasmania, but to Great Britain, and many other countries. Even New Zealand, which is even more protectionist than is Australia, imports Wise&#39;s Directory. We have a directory established in Australia, and it seems to me very doubtful whether we should not  give our own man a chance to compete favorably with the outside production. There is no doubt that directories can be printed in Australia. Probably, the people . who are catering for other countries desire all the printing to be done in one establishment&#39;, under their control. It would suit us better to have them printed in Australia, and, I think, that the present duty, although high, is a legitimate one to support. </para>

                <para>SenatorCLEMONS (Tasmania) &#91;4.18&#93;. - I am not concerned very much about the duty. I could not see any reason for fixing the duty in the preferential Tariff at! 4d. per lb., if the duty in the general Tariff were made 6d. Suppose that we did press our request for a duty of 6d., is the other House- likely to give way, or should we have to thresh out this matter again ? </para>

                    <para>- I do not agree that. this is a small matter. It is of the utmost importance in connexion with the working of metalliferous mines. The Committee previously agreed that the freest importation should be allowed of machines of this description for use in mining. I have not seen any of them, but I have read of their invention and introduction into the mines of South Africa. I am not aware that there are any atomizers in Australia yet, but a special effort is &#39;being made by the Western Australian Government to have them tried in the mines of that State. While they are at present confined to the patent stage, it is our duty to give special &#39;consideration to them. This request was tossed on one side in another place with scarcely any thought or . consideration ; but, seriously, &#39;it is a subject regarding the lives of the miners to which we should pay the most earnest attention. I hope the request will be pressed. </para>

                    <para>- - I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has followed the example of another place and given the .matter so little consideration, stating&#39; in a comparatively careless way that there were no means of distinguishing the article in its use for mining from its use in fifty and one other directions. Nothing could be more illusory than that . statement. The use of the atomizer is very simple. It is employed in conjunction with rock drills in order to prevent not merely the inconvenience but the danger of personal injury to miners arising from their being compelled to breathe the dry dust coming from the face where the drill is at work. There are crude methods at present employed in the Commonwealth of obviating that danger. One is to have a jet of water continually playing on the face of the rock, and especially on the hole that the drill is making. These atomizers are simple and ingenious, and comparatively cheap. .They prevent not only the inconvenience but the actual danger to miners from the inhalation of dust when using rock drills. </para>

                        <para>. - This matter evidently formed the subject of a compromise in another place. Stained glass windows for churches or public institutions were liable to duties of 30 and 25 per cent. We requested that &#39; they should be admitted free, and the compromise to which I have referred appears in the suggestion of another place that they should be admitted under departmental by-laws, not at duties of 30 and 25 per cent., but at 20 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - The wretched proposal which the honorable senator describes as a compromise involves a miserable reduction of 5 per cent, in the duties sought to be imposed on. works of the highest form of art. Merely because something of a similar nature is being manufactured here, it is assumed that these works of art can be produced in the Commonwealth. I should prefer that the duty should remain as it is to accepting such a proposal as a compromise. Honorable senators were practically unanimous in asking that these stained glass windows, which are most frequently imported for the decoration of churches, should be admitted duty free. To suggest that the production of these works of art is an Australian industry is altogether too absurd. It is true that something is being done in the production of coloured glass, and possibly of painted glass, in several of the States, but there should certainly be a strong objection to the imposition of any duty on high-class works of art of this character, which are usually very costly, and often depict subjects which- probably could not even be copied here without the consent of the proprietors of the original designs. I hope that the Committee will either press the request or abandon it altogether. </para>

                    <para>.  - It would be a very great pity after the vote previously taken on this particular item for the Committee now to assent to the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent, on these stained glass windows. In my opinion, the Vice-President of the Executive Council is seeking to impose a duty upon works which, when they are carried out to perfection:, represent the&#39; finest exemplifications of art. He is seeking to impose that duty on such works of art when imported for the ornamentation of churches or public institutions, where they would be open to every one to admire them, and any one possessed of an artistic sense might gratify that sense. There might be some excuse for the- imposition of a duty on the highest specimens of art if it were intended that they should be kept in some place where they would not be open to the public. We desire to admit free of duty such magnificent specimens of art as can be seen in many of the cathedrals, churches, and public institutions of the Old Country. We made the request because we knew that for many years to come our people could not possibly hope to reach such a degree of perfection in&#39; the production of these works of art as is exhibited elsewhere. The stained glass window work done in Australia is, for the most part, represented by the beaded or leaded glass which we find in many places over doors and windows. The stained glass windows which the Committee had previously in mind were specimens, for the most part, of ecclesiastical art to be found in cathedrals, and sometimes in important public institutions, where it is well that the people should have an opportunity of seeing them. By imposing a duty of 20 per cent, on such productions we should do ourselves little credit, and we should be doing something to suppress an ambition which we all ought to have, to* be able artistically to enjoy the contemplation of works of art of this kind. I hope that the Committee will again request another place to make these importations free. </para>

                    <para>There are four businesses in Australia which produce stained glass windows for churches and public institutions. The owners of two or three businesses know nothing whatever of the technical work of the business, but employ competent workmen to design and execute the work. The owners of the other two are practically technical men who have been trained to the work, and who, at the same time, conduct the ordinary business arrangements. &#39; All the establishments in England and on the Continent which supply stained glass windows for churches and public institutions are, with a few exceptions, owned and conducted by persons who have no technical knowledge of the business, and who were never trained to it, but who employ skilled workmen to do the work for them. The few exceptions are businesses owned and conducted by practical men. It is clear, therefore, that &#39;the businesses in Europe are practically the same as those in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery</inline> added, that it was an extremely rare thing for an ordinary artist to attempt&#34; to design stained glass windows, as that work requires a special technical training; in the absence of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joshua</inline> Reynolds is said  to have made a failure of a stained glass  window, designed by him, and which is to be seen in one of the public institutions at Oxford. Whilst the designing of stained glass windows is an art, it is not recognised as high art amongst those who are engaged in the work; it&#39; is known as &#34;Applied Art.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery</inline> stated that a stained glass window is designed and the design handed over to ordinary craftsmen  to copy, in about one-tenth of the time which an artist working on canvas would occupy in producing a similar picture. The Australian houses, which are carrying on an identical business with the European houses, are charged 15 per cent, on their raw material, while the finished article will be admitted free if the Senate&#39;s request is acceded to. As the production of stained glass windows is everywhere carried on as an ordinary business, it is strongly urged by the Australian&#34; producers that it is an injustice to admit the finished product free whilst the raw material (not produced ia Australia) for the Australian producers is taxed. </para>

                            (New South Wales) &#91;5.1&#93;. - I hope that the Committee will insist upon the request sent down to the House of Representatives. The question was thoroughly debated od the previous occasion, when similar representations to those which have been laid before us by the&#39; Vice-President of the Executive Council were submitted. The result was that our request was adopted without a division. Honorable senators considered that it was only a fair and reasonable request to make that stained glass windows, which are works of art, should be admitted duty free. The request is one that ought to be reaffirmed, and it will be a proper thing for honorable senators to stand firm by what we deliberately did.

                        <para>- There is a duty, unless they are original works of art. It has to be remembered that those engaged in producing stained glass have to pay duty on the raw material with which they operate. It is much to be regretted that this question has not been discussed without the introduction of sentimental and religious feeling. Will any honorable senator maintain that there are not firms in Australia that are capable of making a stained glass window? Some honorable senators talk about churches and public institutions as if there were a sacredness about them which should debar any man from raising a finger against their requirements in matters of this description. There are dozens of men in Australia who are capable of doing such work, and are longing to do more of it. They should have an opportunity of developing the genius that is in them. Those honorable senators who, for the purpose of catching a few votes have introduced the element of religious sentimentality have simply been trying to induce the Committee to take a side view of the matter. The real question is that we should by this duty give the genuine workman an opportunity of proving what he is worth. I hope- that the duty, of 20 per cent, will be sanctioned; and that the result of it will be to prove in&#39; the near future that we have artists in&#39; Australia who are equal to any in the world. . </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> may. rest assured that when we have artists of the first rank they will find a ready market for their work and obtain good prices outside of Australia as well as within it. This is a question that should be lifted high above the level of ordinary fiscalism. We are quite justified in imposing duties that we regard as sufficient when we are dealing with industries that if is advisable to protect by means of a Tariff. But when it comes to supplying the community with works of art, we are dealing with matters that appeal to the finer emotions of men. I have known men who had very little, if any, religion in their composition, but who were quick to admire fine works of art. In the present instance, ordinary fiscal principles do not apply. If we were to impose a duty of 20 per cent. upon the works of art with which we are dealing, the extra amount would have to be paid by those who are determined to obtain the best possible works of the kind. I have gone to some trouble to ascertain for myself what kind of coloured windows could be produced in Australia. I have seen some of the Australian works, and I honestly did my best to bring myself to believe that acceptable stained glass work was being done here. But, after the closest examination, I found that only about two out of half-a-dozen works which, I saw were worth looking at. I went with the hope that I should find something which would satisfy my taste in this direction, but was disappointed. I am satisfied that people who require stained glass windows for churches and other public institutions- will continue to go to the best artists in the world for them. I cannot vote for this as a revenue item, and hope that the Senate&#39;s request will be pressed. </para>

                <para class="block">When the other House came to deal with the schedule, it refused to allow a rebate to the manufacturers and importers in those cases, but, . of course, between &#39; the 8th August and the date on which it cancelled the provision in the schedule - that -is, the nth December - certain piece goods had been used in the manufacture of rubber waterproof cloth, and some manufacturers had obtained the benefit of the drawback. The object of our request was to give other manufacturers who had used such materials between those dates the benefit of the rebate to which they were originally entitled. So it was, too, with regard to the second part of the schedule. Some manufacturers who had imported a certain class of machinery got the benefit of a rebate of the full duty paid between the 8th August and the 28th November, when it was decided that no rebate should be allowed in the case of such machinery. The object of our request for the insertion of the new schedule was to treat all these persons alike. I believe that claims  for rebates to the amount of about&#163;400 have not been paid. Consequential upon acceding to our request, the other House had to make certain alterations in the Bill. The Tariff itself is now called schedule A, and the new schedule which Ave requested is called schedule B. That involved consequential alterations in the text of the Bill, which, as honorable senators are aware, are categorically set out in the message from the other House. I move - </para>

I see no insurmountable difficulty in the way of our message being forwarded to another place tonight, dealt with there in the morning, and sent back to us in the afternoon, with every reasonable probability of the Tariff being finally disposed of to-morrow. I regret that the Government have not handled the business in the way I have suggested, which would have permitted of this long-drawn-out Tariff being made the law of the country this week. </para>

No honorable senator representing other States will be able to leave Melbourne in any case before 4 o&#39;clock to-morrow afternoon. No harm will be done to any one by our meeting tomorrow. There is sure to be a quorum, and at that stage the Minister will be able to tell honorable senators definitely whether he has succeeded in the interval in getting a message sent to another place and returned to us, so that we may finish the Tariff. It is to be regretted that the other work that we expected has not reached us, but, jf another place have not finished the Additional Estimates, we are at their mercy. Still, if we meet at 12, or even 2 o&#39;clock to-morrow, there may be work for us in finishing the Tariff. </para>

It will, therefore, be absolutely impossible for us to get&#39; a message regarding the Tariff back before half -past 4 o&#39;clock to-morrow. </para>

If we adjourn until Wednesday next, that will give them to-morrow and Tuesday&#39; to waste. If they knew we were meeting tomorrow, and every day next week, to complete the work, they would have no excuse for dilly-dallying. My&#39;  experience  has always been that one House of Parliament takes its cue from the other. If we adjourn until Wednesday week, members of another place will find plenty of things to talk about until we come back again. </para>

                        <para>- It is the voice of the Government. The Minister would not give that assurance without making the fullest inquiry.&#39; If he had not made inquiry, and the Senate met to-morrow with no business to do, those honorable senators who are now demanding a meeting to-morrow, would denounce him for not telling. them that there was no business to be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is. of opinion that if we decide to meet to-morrow at 10.30 a.m. that will be an indication that we desire honorable members in another place to go full steam ahead, and that if we decide to adjourn until Wednesday next they will be given some inducement to be more talkative. I do not think that they take very serious notice of our adjournments. If I&#39; may be permitted to say so, I think that honorable members in another place are as anxious as are honorable senators to deal definitely and finally with the Tariff. We have been told that the Government do not expect that the Additional Estimates will be ready for our consideration to-morrow, and no member of the Senate can. by any stretch of imagination conclude that the Tariff will be ready for further consideration tomorrow. The requests which we have disposed of to-day can scarcely reach&#39; the printer&#39;s hands for the next couple of hours, and it will take time to carry out the printing which our work has made necessary. If honorable senators believe that an adjournment until to-morrow will mean work for the Senate. I suggest that we might meet at  10  a.m., and if there is then no work for&#39; us to do,&#34; we could .adjourn until n a.m., and continue meeting and adjourning. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> contention, two or three adjournments to-morrow should result in our having plenty of work to do. </para>

If they feel that they- are justified in hoping that we shall have &#39;received some work from another place&#39; with which we can deal to-morrow-, I shall be only too glad to accede to their wishes. It will&#39; be admitted that I have done everything I can te expedite the business of the Senate. In deference to the wish expressed by honorable senators, I am prepared to withdraw my motion, and if in the meantime my honorable friends will use their influence with honorable members in another place with such effect as to result in our having the Additional Estimates to deal with tomorrow, no one will be more gratified than I. It has been suggested to me that as a Parliamentary Committee will be meeting at  11  o&#39;clock, to-morrow, we might meet at a. later hour. </para>
