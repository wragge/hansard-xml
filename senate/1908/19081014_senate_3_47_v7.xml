                        <para>- Yes, perfectly true, and that is one of the present embarrassing matters. It is, as I have said, for the Commonwealth Parliament to . determine where the Seat of Government shall be located. There has been an expression of opinion by one branch of the Legislature, and the Government think that it is only proper that an opportunity should be afforded to the Senate to express its opinion. Such a course is an obvious necessity, and will be calculated, I hope, to save time, because, despite what has taken place elsewhere, it will be of no use to introduce a measure repealing the present Act unless the views of the Senate on this subject are known. What I propose to do is to give notice to-morrow that on the following Wednesday I shall move that the procedure for eliciting an expression of opinion be practically the same as was adopted elsewhere. Amongst the proposals will be one which will have for its object the fixing of a day on which an exhaustive ballot shall be taken. Of course it will be for honorable senators to fix any date they think proper, to suit their convenience. </para>

I think it necessary to point out that the honorable senator is in this way trying to achieve an object which was defeated by a division taken on. Friday. As a matter of fact there will be a mercantile marine office in every important port. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it would be hardly wise to make the alteration proposed. The matter was practically settled by a vote which has already been taken. The Minister will have to accept the responsibility of appointing an official and if, according to the amendment I suggested, that official is a public servant, that will be a guarantee to the public that the terms of the Act and the duties of superintendents in connexion with these agreements will be faithfully carried out. It is frequently a source of very great convenience for masters and men to have these agreements entered into on board the ship itself. </para>

                    <para>. - My objection to this clause is based upon the fact that I entertain a very strong desire to suppress desertion. Here we have an opportunity of taking, the first step towards coping with that evil. In this connexion let me recall an incident which I am sure is fairly fresh in the minds of honorable senators. Quite recently a ship arrived in Port Phillip, having on board a crew the members of which were dissatisfied with the food supplied to them during the voyage here, and also with their treatment at the hands of the master. They were brought before a magistrate at Queenscliff, who ordered their discharge. The master of the vessel then ordered them to return to their ship. They refused to obey his command, and as a result were brought before the Court in Melbourne, where they were sentenced to a term of imprisonment. An appeal was lodged against their conviction, but whilst the case was pending the master of the vessel - notwithstanding that the representative of the Sailors&#39; Home informed him that there were four deserters from other vessels on board - attempted to engage another crew to take his ship away. At the present time foreign ships transact the bulk of their business at the consuls&#39; offices. The superintendent of mercantile marine has no record of desertions, nor of those seamen who are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> paid off upon their arrival here. It is thus possible for crimping agents to get deserters from foreign vessels to engage to serve on British ships. I contend that every sailor who signs an agreement to serve on a British ship ought to do so at the mercantile marine office. </para>

                        <para>- If we desire to prevent crimping and desertion we should insist that all men who desire to ship upon British vessels shall sign  articles at  the mercantile marine office. For what is that office established? Is it not to see that justice is done as between the seamen and the masters? Why should we build mercantile marine offices, furnish them, and supply them with official documents if the most important part of the business is not to be transacted there? Under the Customs Act do we permit a ship&#39;s clearance to be effected on board? No, she has to be cleared at the Customs House? This Bill contains a provision under which the master will be at liberty to sign on substitutes, before a witness in lieu of any members of &#39;his crew who fail to put in an appearance. Surely that is sufficient to meet alike the convenience of the master and of the men ! In the case to which I have already alluded, the fact that deserters were on board the vessel was well known. It had been the subject of comments in the daily newspapers and also of a deputation which waited upon the Chief Secretary. Yet, because the master had not been notified that these men were deserters, he was able to sign them on. At a later stage I hope to secure the insertion of an amendment providing that foreign consuls should be compelled to supply the mercantile marine office with, a list of all deserters from foreign ships. Under this clause it would be just as easy for a deserter from a foreign ship to engage to serve upon a British ship as it would be for a sailor who had been <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> discharged. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Committee would be very unwise if they adopted the amendment. It would not restrict crimping at all, and would press very heavily on the inter-State steamers. Consider some of the objections. The steamer <inline font-style="italic">Riverina</inline> comes to Melbourne from Western Australia, arriving here regularly every four weeks on the Saturday. Her crew are engaged for six months. The men invariably want to ship again, as they are well treated. The vessel leaves on the same day for Sydney. The shipping office is closed at noon on Saturday. Why should not a proper officer be permitted to re-ship the man on board if required ? If this amendment were carried the crew of eighty-seven men, wishing to renew their agreements, would have to walk up to the shipping office, perhaps a mile away, thereby losing their time and perhaps losing their ship. The men are known, and there is no question of crimping in reference to the engagement. If the amendment is carried, it will be a serious detriment to the convenience of sailors. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> for a great deal of useful information and we shall be under obligations to him again before we have done with this Bill. But I must ask him to have some sense of the proportion of things. However desirous we may be to put a stop to crimping, this is hardly the way to do it. The shipping office is established to do justice between sailors and their employers. But at the same time we must allow a certain amount of freedom, and we ought to permit business to be done in a commercial manner. There is no answer to such a case as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has instanced. Others might be mentioned. The <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> comes to Melbourne every other day and leaves again on the same day. If a number of her, crew had to leave their employment and go to the shipping office when they were re engaged it would be very inconvenient. They are all reputable citizens resident in Melbourne or Launceston, and there is no objection to the deputy shipping master going on board and continuing to do what he has been doing for years past. The idea in framing the clause as it stands is to make* the law more elastic. But the supporters of the amendment wish to ignore experience and return to the wretched state of affairs which the Governments of the States found unworkable. We hope some time to have a vessel like the <inline font-style="italic">Mauritania</inline> visiting our* ports. She carries a crew of eight or nine hundred men. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot be said that there is much crimping at any other port than Newcastle, and we have no right to penalize the whole of the shipowners of the Commonwealth, because we wish to put down. this evil at one port. If my honorable friends will draft a few clauses with the object of putting down crimping, they will, no doubt, receive support; but this is not the way to do it. </para>

                    <para>. - It is easy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to urge the supporters of the amendment to draft clauses to put down crimping, but as soon as a proposal is made with that object in view he announces his intention to -vote against it. I am disappointed at the attitude of the Committee in reference to this subject. During the second reading debate, I hoped that a serious effort would be made to deal with the crimping evil. The only way to cope with it effectively is not to allow signing on to be done at any other place than the shipping office. It is utterly impossible to abolish crimping by any other method, because it is in consequence of signing on being done at other places, that crimping takes place. </para>

                        <para>- Newcastle is the most notorious place in the Commonwealth in this respect, but to insist on signing on being done at the shipping office will result in abolishing nine-tenths of the evil. If we allow a master to engage his hands on board his ship, perhaps only a few moments before she goes to sea, it is easy for him to do whatever he likes, and there is no means of getting at him once he is outside the Nobbies. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister cannot control an official for something done on a ship that has gone to sea. How is proof obtainable when nine-tenths of the vessels I am referring to are foreign bound? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has said that we should prohibit signing on at &#39;public houses. Very little is done at public houses. But it is a fact that sailors are filled up with all kinds of &#34; snake juice,&#34; and taken on board sometimes in such a state that they do not know where they are, and do not even know that they are on a ship at all. By rejecting the amendment we shall simply be playing into the hands of the men who do these things. I am surprised at a man who poses occasionally as a Christian Socialist, lending himself to any such scheme. I am also disappointed at the attitude of the Government. It is not to their credit. The evidence taken by the Navigation Commission shows the evil that is going on, and that it is widespread, at all events, so far as Newcastle- is concerned. The traffic has been a monstrous outrage for many years. Yet here is a Government that is prepared to allow it to continue. I shall be very much surprised if the Committee rejects the amendment. </para>

On clause 6, a large number of honorable senators made a strenuous effort to cut down his powers. They tried to destroy the power of the Minister, even to the extent of taking the administration of the law out of his hands, but when it is a question of compelling him to see that the shipping of crews shall take place in a mercantile marine office, they are prepared to extend to him the utmost liberty. They are very inconsistent indeed. </para>

Now this clause was specially designed to stamp out crimping. </para>

                        <para>- My amendment was submitted in the hope of stamping out crimping&#39;. I do not say that it is a perfect one. I recognise thai, even although crews may be shipped at a shipping office, still the crimper will have plenty of elbow room in which to exercise his perverted ingenuity. It will place an obstacle in his way if we call upon every shipmaster to get his crew signed on at a shipping office and not at an out of the way place, or even on board the ship. I am astonished that my simple proposal has not met with more support at the hands of honorable senators, who declare their anxiety to stamp out a manifest evil. </para>

If, for instance, a ship were lying at anchor or at any inconvenient place, say five or six miles away, I should not call upon the shipmaster to go through the formal proceeding of signing on men at the shipping office. But I think that the shipping office should, as far as possible, be used for the purpose for which it was erected and intended - the signing on of crews. </para>

                    <para>. - I can heartily indorse the concluding remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> that the shipping office was primarily designed for the purpose of crews signing on. That is what the clause contemplates. But it also recognises that there may be circumstances in which some additional convenience is required, and it enables the Minister to create that convenience when and where it is required. The honorable senator is prepared to unbend to a slight extent. He says that if there was no shipping office within a distance of five or six miles he would allow the shipmaster to exercise this power. If he admits that there is a point beyond which it is unreasonable to ask seamen and ship-owners to go in order to meet these facilities, he concedes the point of the clause, and that is that every facility should be created in order to lessen the trouble to men required to sign on. The only question is whether the Minister is likely to exercise the power conferred by the clause in a reasonable or unreasonable way. I cannot help smiling when I remember that only a few days ago this hall rang with flowing praise from honorable senators opposite as to the integrity and business-like capacity of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- -I am npt showing faith in the Minister, but pointing out to my honorable friends their inconsi&#39;stency. Having affirmed only last week their unqualified faith in the Minister, and a great belief in their own power to bring him to book if he did not do the right- thing, they now come along and say, &#34; We said that on Friday on one clause, but to-day is Wednesday, and we are dealing with another clause.&#34; A great deal has been said about the facilities which this clause will give for crimping. If I could be convinced that it was essential in order to stop or to minimize crimping, I should vote for the amendment at once. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says, &#34;As a proof of your <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> you must do what I think,&#34; although my own judgment tells me that it is wrong. He says, &#34; I am to be the judge as to what is the right provision to enact, and any one who ventures to exercise his own. independent judgment and to differ from me is in favour of crimping.&#34; Both Senators Lynch and Guthrie speak of this as a convenience, but they say that crimping can take place under the facilities proposed to be given, and that what we should try to do if we wish to prevent the abuse is to withdraw the convenience. In all our large cities we have great conveniences in the shape of tramways; they kill a few persons every year, but do we ever propose, because they do a little or a great injury, to stop them from running? What we should do is to look round and see if we cannot devi&#39;se means by which, while the convenience is conserved, the abuse is prevented or stamped out. I think that this clause represents a considerable convenience, and one which can only be exercised by Ministerial sanction, and under the review of Parliament. We should do a great wrong if, in order to stop the abuse, we also stopped the convenience. I propose, therefore, to vote for the convenience, but when we reach clause 26, I shall go just as far as my honorable friends want us to go to stamp out the evil of crimping. </para>

I take up the same position? to-day as I did then. I prefer the Minister to an irresponsible body. I think that honorable senators do not quite realize the position of a man signing on and being, discharged from a ship. Senators Dobson and Macfarlane have exhibited ignorance of the whole matter. Three different classes of agreements are provided for in this Bill.- First of all, there is an agreement for a foreign-going ship trading to some place beyond the Commonwealth, and finally returning to a port in Australia, the voyage not exceeding three years. Men who sign such an agreement need not go on board the ship for the purpose at all. As  1  rule, such agreements are made before the men ever see the ship. As soon as the ship returns to the port, the men are discharged, and within twenty-four hours after her  return  the master is compelled&#39; to give them their account of wages. </para>

                        <para>- If the clause be agreed to, what will happen will be that a general regulation will be framed under which the superintendent&#39; will be given power, if he pleases, to sign men on, and see that they are paid off on board the ship. I remind honorable senators that if men are dissatisfied with their account of wages they will be on board when they are being paid off only on sufferance, and will have no one present to see that they get fairplay. </para>

                        <para>- I know more of the matter than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> and I say that such cases are occurring continually. Another agreement provided for is a running agreement for a single voyage or a succession of voyages extending over six months. Such an agreement would cover trips between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and between the Commonwealth and the Pacific Islands. I should&#39; like to say here that I am very sorry that honorable .senators did not see their way to accept my suggestion for the inclusion of such voyages in the definition of Australian coast trade. Such an amendment  would  have been acceptable to owners and seamen, and would in no way have affected&#39; the interests of the public. In the case of these running agreements, the seamen will be  engaged  before they enter upon their duties on board the ship, and immediately upon her arrival at her port of destination after the six months&#39; period has elapsed the men can be discharged at a shipping office in the same way as men signing a foreign going agreement. A third agreement provided for is one which would affect a vessel like the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana,</inline> to which Senators Dobson and Macfarlane have referred. Hut honorable senators appear to forget that this Bill provides in such a case an agreement lasting over two years. No doubt provision is also made for the shipping of substitutes in such a case, and&#34; such men may be signed on on board the vessel. 1 am, however, dealing with the case of the men originally signing the agreement, and under this Bill if what we propose were adopted the only inconvenience to which the owners of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> and the seamen engaged on the vessel would be put would be in having to attend the shipping office twice in two years - once that the men might sign on, and the second time that they might get their discharge. Seamen require protection in this matter of signing on and paying off, and it should 1&#62;j afforded to them in public. We know that honorable senators opposite are accustomed to describe as &#34; Star Chamber &#34; practice the making of agreements in secret. What is proposed in this Bill is to remove the business of the making of these agreements from a public office to a star chamber. It must not be forgotten that many of our seamen are foreigners, who have very little knowledge of English. In the circumstances, it is not difficult to understand why a shipmaster would like to be able to discharge them on board a ship, where he might, if he thought fit, take advantage of them. I say that it is to the interest of the fair owner, of the men, and of the general public, that this work should be done in the light of day, and not on board a ship or in any private office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is aware that for a long time labour engagements were entered into in private labour bureaux instead of authorized Government offices. When I am told that the Minister would not consent to the signing of agreements or to the granting of discharges on board a ship, the answer is that a regulation will be framed under which a superintendent, at his discretion, will be able to witness these agreements  and the discharge of men elsewhere than -fct a shipping office, and, having made the regulation, the Minister could not interfere. The provision in the Bill is that which appeared in the Merchant Shipping Act of  j. 864,  away back in the dark ages. We know the practices which have been resorted to under such a provision in the existing law, and we have no right to expect that the practice adopted in the future will differ from that which has prevailed in the past. I point out that the mercantile marine offices in all the States have been to some extent self supporting. The ship-owners pay a certain amount for the men shipped, and the seamen pay something every time they sign articles, and every time they get a discharge. The seamen in this matter are willing to pay for protection, and it can be afforded them by insisting that these agreements shall be made in public. </para>

                    <para>- - This question is so important that I do not care to give a silent vote upon it. I believe that there is a time and place for everything, and the shipping office is the proper place in which to make these agreements. We have in this Committee honorable senators who possess a technical knowledge of the questions involved in this Bill, who have worked before the mast, and understand the position of the seamen. They strongly advocate the making of all these agreements at a shipping office, and where they are earnest and sincere it is wise that we should listen to th&#187; advice of experts. We have evidence of th* earnestness and sincerity of Senators Guthrie, de Largie, and others, who have had shipping experience, and they advise us that this provision is a dangerous one to pass. It is necessary that it should be amended as proposed, in order that seamen may be protected from crimping. I was a member of a Royal Commission appointed in South Australia to inquire into the way in which the blacks were treated by the whites in the Northern Territory and other places, and I can inform the Committee that it was proved before that Commission that one blackfellow, who had worked for a long time for an employer, received for his labour a- race-card instead of a cheque. He was perfectly satisfied, because he did not know any better. When honorable senators who stand behind the Government sixty times out of one hundred move an amendment, the Government get under the wing of the Opposition to fight labour. How long is this going to last? </para>

                        <para>- That was practically the honorable senator&#39;s contention when he interjected just now that there were only a few any way, either at Fremantle, Sydney, or Melbourne. I do not wish to be hypocritical over this Bill. I have no wish to tell honorable senators or the people outside that I am in favour of preventing the committing of a certain crime, whilst at the same time I do all I can to facilitate the operations of the people who commit that crime. I would not go to a place like Newcastle and advocate the very thing which would assist the operations of the crimper. I very much doubt whether any other member of the Committee would do so. But, while honorable senators opposite say that they are totally opposed to crimping, they also say that they cannot see their way to adopt a suggestion which has been supported by shipping masters and others who gave evidence before the Navigation Commission, and who were agreed that to compel men to be signed on and discharged at a shipping office is the best means to put a stop to the practice. That evidence was collected by Senators Macfarlane, de Largie, and Guthrie. </para>

It is idle to suggest that that evil will be suppressed merely because we employ a Government official to witness the signing on and discharge of men. As a matter of fact, we employ a Government official at the present time. Yet more crimping takes place at Newcastle than at any other port in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No. A Customs officer employed on the wharfs has to work in the open light of day. A ship is required to pay the Customs Department certain fees for his services. The Department knows exactly how much overtime he may work. I contend that the shipping master ought not to be encouraged to perform outside of office hours work which might be done just as well, if not better, during office hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has declared that he regards this question in much the same light as he views a tramway service. He urges that a tram service is conducted for the purpose of conveniencing the, public, and that though it may kill a person, it is not discontinued. That is perfectly true. But what would be said if those responsible for the conduct of such a service declined to adopt a certain method by which fatalities could be prevented? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has suggested that the Bill contains a clause - with which we shall be called upon to deal at a later stage - which provides that it shall be an offence to carry on crimping. But I would point out that at the present time it is an offence to induce people to desert their ships. </para>

                        <para>- I maintain that if we permit seamen to sign articles anywhere outside of a public office, we shall be offering facilities for the continuance of crimping. Sufficient evidence is contained in the report of the Navigation Commission to satisfy any unbiased man of the necessity for stricter regulations in this connexion, and for doing everything within our power to suppress the evil. Only a week or so ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie quoted the testimony of a number of witnesses who gave evidence before the Commission at Newcastle. There was not an honorable senator who did not condemn the villainous system under which seamen are frequently signed on at that port. Naturally I welcomed their protestations. But if there is one thing that  1  detest, it is a man whose daily actions do not harmonize with his professions. Yet that is the unfortunate position which some honorable senators appear to me to occupy to-day. Not a valid objection has been urged against the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> It has been said that in. a particular instance it would inconvenience a few people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> cited the case of one ship, the crew of which sign on at the shipping office every six months. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;4.13&#93;. - I recognise that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline>
                    is actuated by a beautiful desire in the direction of morality ; but I quite agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>
                    that his amendment does not go far enough ; nor will it achieve any useful purpose. Take, for instance, the case of a &#34;tavern,&#34; which is not defined. Under his amendment, my honorable colleague might ex- ? elude those cheerful establishments known as coffee taverns. But apart from that, the man whom it was sought to entrap into a kind of illicit bargain with a shipmaster might be speedily made drunk in a tavern and signed on next door. The amendment, while it certainly aims at a praiseworthy result, is not calculated in its present form to produce that result. What we have to consider is not the place, but the condition of the man whom it is proposed to sign on. If my honorable colleague would move that no person who was &#34; the worse for liquor &#34; should sign on anywhere, and indicate that he proposed to recommit Clause 6 in order to give a definition of what he meant by that term, I would support him. An old sea captain - one of those persons who inveigle men who are not quite themselves to sign on - wa.s once asked, &#34;What is moderation?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Well, you know, it all depends. It is somewhere between a glass and a barrel.&#34; Some men get knocked over with a glass and some can carry a barrel. So that if is the condition of the seaman which should be considered rather than the place in which he should sign on. A drunken man might be signed on under the shadow of a cathedral, but the sacerdotalism connected with the building would not make him sober.

                    <para>.- I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that this amendment is quite unnecessary. Immediately before it was moved we had a division in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> voted with the Government in favour of providing facilities for crimping, and this amendment is absolutely necessary in order to salve his conscience. For that reason, if for no other, I contend that it is very necessary, and I shall support it. I have also to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> and others that the amendment in its present form is really useless, although it may be very necessary as a salve to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> conscience. If he wants to enumerate all the places in which he thinks it would be undesirable to have seamen signed on he might as well have supported the original amendment, and confined this work  exclusively to shipping offices. </para>

                    <para>. - Senators Turley, Givens, and Neild have sought to turn this discussion along a line which, from want of knowledge, I cannot follow. It seems to me that honorable senators have overlooked a very important fact. They have pointed out that it is not the place in which a man signs on, but his condition at the time which should be considered, and that, therefore, it is not desirable or necessary to permit signing on to be conducted in licensed houses. One would think that this was the first time we had placed a bar against the use of licensed houses. Have they forgotten the terms of the Electoral Act? Every argument which they have used against this proposal would have applied equally well when it was proposed to place in the Electoral Act a prohibition against the use of licensed houses. </para>

The only doubt I have in my mind is created by an interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who affirmed that the amendment would include ships, many of which, if not all of them, were really licensed houses. After the recent vote I gave I am not in a position .to vote for an amendment to do a thing which we have just said that we are not prepared to do, and therefore I should like to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> whether the amendment can be construed so as to include ships as well as licensed houses. </para>

I am quite satisfied that if we set ourselves to the task of fixing a scale of the number of officers to be carried in any ship, we should not, later in the Bill, give anybody else the power to undo our work. There is a side reference to section 92 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, but the reference is entirely misleading, in so far as the words &#34;or as prescribed&#34; do not appear in the Imperial Act. If they were not necessary in the control of the great  shipping industry pf the United Kingdom, they can scarcely be necessary in the control of the smaller shipping industry of Australia. </para>

As the Minister has explained, that can only be done after the Advisory Committee has been consulted, and made a recommendation to the Minister. Otherwise the manning schedule must be complied with.

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has raised the question whether we ought not to strike out of this clause the provision for a number of officers differing from the number provided for in schedule 1. The Minister&#39;s reply was that it might be necessary to make some departure from the schedule, and he assumed that clause 416 was designed to meet such a case. I take the view that if that contention be correct, the schedule might as well be struck out altogether. If clause 416 is to apply to officers as well as to men, and the Minister must appoint a Committee which is to advise as to the number of officers required for every ship going to seal, what is the good of the schedule ? </para>

                    <para>.- When we come to deal with clause 416, it will be necessary to determine whether we shall include in it officers as well as crews. The underlying idea of the Bill is that there shall be a particular scale of manning applicable to all ships. If it were a cast-iron scale which was applicable to all ships, I admit at once that it would work strange injustices, and inflict a great deal of unnecessary hardship. But we lay down the principle that there must, at all times, be a manning scale. Of course, we know that from day to day, alterations in shipping are taking place. Different classes of ships are coming forward. Take the case of a ship, in the stoke-hold of which it has hitherto been necessary to employ a certain number of men. Latterly, a machine has been invented which automatically removes the ashes from the furnaces, and thus does away with the necessity for employing some four or five hands. In such a case, it would be obviously unjust to insist that the vessel .should comply with this manning scale. That is just one illustration of what is taking place year by year, and as this measure - when it becomes an Act - will be &#34; always speaking,&#34; we lay down as a principle that at all times there shall be a manning scale. But we make that scale sufficiently elastic to meet the changing conditions of ships from day to day and year to year. The same scale cannot be applicable to all vessels, and, therefore, we say that it will be necessary for the Minister to obtain the expert advice of an Advisory Board, having special knowledge of the subject-matter. Consequently, the Minister is given power to make regulations from time to time. </para>

                        <para>- -All classes of ships must comply with a scale ; but there may be vessels to which a special scale will be applicable. Having regard to the fact that an Act of Parliament must be &#34; alwaysspeaking,&#34; the provision in this Bill would: inflict serious hardship if we did not make the manning scale accommodate itself to varying conditions. Hence we have provided for the framing of regulations,, which will at least have the indirect sanction of Parliament, seeing that they will have to be framed by the Minister, and laid upon the table of the two Houses, and&#39; that it is competent for Parliament to agree to, or differ from, them as it may think fit. Further, if the Minister takes it upon himself to disregard the recommendation of the expert Committee to which I have referred, he will assume a very serious responsibility, and will have to justify his action. I am rather surprised at the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> which, if adopted, would be calculated to inflict very serious hardship. </para>

If we pass this &#39;Bill, we announce that there shall be a. manning scale; but that scale may be varied in the way I have indicated, either in regard to classes of ships or particular ships. It is &#34; a very wise scheme, and one that is calculated to meet emergencies and variations in ships-  as they arise. Reference has been made to the manning scale prescribed by the Merchant Shipping Act. It is quite true that that Act prescribes a manning scale, the object of which is to insure the seaworthiness of vessels. But I would point out that that scale is of such a reduced character- </para>

Clause 37 of this Bill gives the Minister power to ignore schedule 2 and to prescribe the complement which any ship shall carry.

The honorable senator&#39;s argument is that because in another portion of the Bill provision is made whereby, should 20 per cent, of the crew fail to put in an appearance, the ship may proceed to sea; should 50 per cent, of the officers of a vessel fail to turn up. she should be permitted to proceed to sea. Is such a proposal fair upon the face of it? The scale prescribed in the case of officers is the minimum required for the safe working of the ship. </para>

                        <para>-And the probability is that some of them will do so. Some Australian trade ships will have more than the prescribed number, and at the present day have more. But is it to be seriously argued that where not only property, but the lives of individuals are concerned, a ship should be allowed to go to sea carrying only one officer, when two are prescribed. Suppose that the voyage of such a ship were to occupy twenty-four or seventy-two hours. Are we going to say that only one officer is necessary for the whole of such a journey? If anything like this proposition could be entertained, the whole scale would have to be largely increased. </para>

                    <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would study his own amendment a little more closely he would see the absurdity of it. A ship is bound to carry a master. It is not proposed that ,a vessel shall be allowed to go to sea without one. But the honorable senator suggests that where only two officers are carried under certain circumstances a ship may be permitted to proceed to sea with only one. If the engineer did not turn up, the ship would be permitted to go to sea without an engineer at all. &#39; There would be no qualified man in the engine-room to take charge of the engines and boilers. I know that honorable senators have been misled by a statement which has been put into their hands, wherein it is alleged that the Merchant Shipping Act allows what is now proposed to be done. That Act does not permit anything of the kind. A vessel must have a master, an engineer, and a mate. The persons who drew up the circular to which I refer were evidently thinking of sailing vessels, but we are dealing with steam-ships as well. Take the case of a vessel compelled under the scale to carry two mates. If one of those did not turn up, is it contemplated that the ship should be allowed to go to sea with only one mate, who would have to navigate the vessel during the whole time, with no navigating officer to relieve him? The ship-owners suggest that it might be in the public interest to adopt such an amendment. I hold that it would not be in the public interest for a ship to go to sea under such circumstances. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Bega,</inline> which went down on the south coast of New South Wales, the engineer on watch had never seen salt water until a fortnight previous to the voyage. The ship-owners want power to send their ships away short-handed. Under such circumstances a vessel might get to her destination, but under other circumstances there would be a great probability that she would not. I look at the matter from the point of view of public safety and the safety of the crew. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> after giving further consideration to the subject, will recognise the wisdom of withdrawing the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I (jo not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that this amendment has been put forward at the instance of the ship-owners, merely with the desire to enable them to send their ships to sea without a sufficiency of officers. I cannot think for a moment that they have any such desire. To do so. would be a losing game in the long run. A ship-owner who followed that principle would soon require the services of an accountant to draw up a statement of his affairs for presentation to the Insolvency Court. The object of the amendment is, I take it, that ship-owners may be free in an emergency to decide for themselves. We all like as much individual freedom as we can get. But the reason why I cannot support the amendment is principally this. I think that we may assume that the officers represent the brains of a ship ; and whilst it is a very serious thing to let a ship go to sea undermanned, so far as manual labour is concerned, it is much more important that the head directing the manual labour should be there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> made a very strong point when he said that a vessel might require to carry a  mate and an engineer, and that if either were away it would be possible for the ship to sail without the engineer necessary to look after the engines, or without a navigating officer necessary for looking after the ship&#39;s course. So that, whatever the object may be, I think that the amendment would be rather unworkable. </para>

It has been said that we might have a vessel with two officers, and&#39; that the amendment would enable 50 per cent, of them to be taken away. But nothing has been said about the fact that vessels that carry so few as two officers are very limited in number, and that the great bulk of, the shipping trade is done in vessels which carry five or six engineers and mates. The argument about shipowners desirous to under man their vessels. will not bear examination, because the last words of my amendment are, &#34; If it is proved that the breach was not occasioned through any fault of his own.&#34; I propose to make an alteration in the amendment which will largely meet the objections. I propose to strike out the words &#34; where two officers are required to be carried or not more than two.&#34; The amendment will then read as follows - </para>

                <para class="block">The clause provides for the granting of certificates for three different classes of ships, namely, foreign-going ship, limited coast-trade ship, and river and bay ship. I do not know why the Australian-trade ship has been omitted, because the schedule provides for four different classes of ships. I think that the omission must be due to a printer&#39;s error. It is such an obvious mistake, that it cannot be accounted for in any other way. I wish the same standard of certificate to be prescribed for the Australian-trade ship as for the foreign-going ship. It will be generally admitted that many waters round our coast are quite as dangerous as any waters to be found elsewhere. Some of us know, to our sorrow, that we can experience as stormy weather in the Australian Bight as in any part of the passage between Australia and the Old Country. I do not think it is necessary to say more in favour of my amendment, because it only seeks to correct what I regard as a printer&#39;s error. </para>

                    <para>. - I can assure my honorable friend that this clause contains no printer&#39;s error. Its whole design is to keep up a high standard for Australian officers. Wherever we can, we use well-known British terms, and when an Australian officer gets to London, he can be appointed to a foreign-going ship, because our standard of qualification is recognised by the Board of Trade. We do not want to ear-mark any particular class of Australian certificate, and to make it applicable to ourselves alone. It is important to the officers themselves that we should prescribe a high-class qualification which will be recognised in the Old Country. If necessary, I can show .subsequently how, according to British law, it will be possible for an Order in Council to be made recognising our foreign-going certificates. In sub; clause i, we provide for certificates of competency to be granted for certain grades of officers, which are enumerated, and in subclause 2 we practically say that when a foreign-going certificate is granted, it shall qualify a man for an Australian-trade ship. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is not desirable to ear-mark a particular class of Australian certificate. At the present time we are dealing with only foreign-going ship certificates, and we use a recognised Board of Trade term, so that if a man with a certificate entitling him to become an officer on a foreign-going ship goes to :the Board of Trade he can be appointed to such a ship in the same way as to an Australian-trade ship. In the interests of the officers themselves, it is desirable to adhere to British terms. What we do in this clause is to declare that an officer holding that high-class and recognised certificate throughout the Empire shall be qualified for an Australian-trade ship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will be well advised to leave the clause as it is. We want our certificates to -be of such a high-class character that they will be recognised throughout the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friend&#39;s amendment is inserted, it will provide for a new class of certificate. He wants to earmark another class of certificate. Although it might be just as good as a foreign-going certificate, from the qualifying point of view, still it would not be of the same value to an Australian officer who was applying in London for a position on a- British ship. He would be told: &#34;We know nothing about your Australian-trade certificate, but we do know about a foreign-going certificate, because that is recognised throughout the Empire.&#34; It would be unwise to make the amendment, because there is nothing to be gained by doing so. </para>

                    <para>. - When I first took up this Bill, I thought that the Australian-trade ship was not mentioned in this clause as the result of a mere omission, but on looking into it, I found that it provides first for the issue of a foreign-going certificate, and then goes on to say that no one shall trade either as master or mate on an Australian-trade ship unless he has a foreign-going certificate. That is virtually what the clause means. If the clause, had provided for the issue of an Australian-trade certificate, that certificate would only have been valuable to a man here, and once he had left our coast, it would not have been recognised in any other part of the British Empire. If it was possible to recognise a grade for vessels propelled by other than motive power, surely it was also possible to provide that what applies to a foreign-going ship shall also apply to an Australian-trade ship? It is not the ship with which we are dealing, but the certificate. I am satisfied that we cannot do more than is done in that regard. But there ought to be some amendment introduced. I notice that in the regulations for the examination of masters and mates, the Board of Trade put the following footnote to foreign-going certificates -  &#34;A foreign-going ship&#34; includes every ship employed in trading or going between some place or places in the United Kingdom and some place or places situate beyond the following limits, that is to say, the coast of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man, and the Continent of Europe between the River Elbe and Brest included. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the definition of a foreign-going ship in Great Britain, and if a man takes his ship outside that limit, he must hold a foreign-going certificate. We should require nothing less than a foreign-going certificate for an Australian-trade ship. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie intends to introduce another grade. </para>

                        <para>- The Board of Trade issues, in addition to a first mate&#39;s and second mate&#39;s certificate, an &#34; only mate&#39;s &#34; certificate, but the qualifications required are as high as those required for a first&#39; mate. The certificate is not of the same value, since the holder of an only mate&#39;s certificate could not go to sea as. a chief mate, but could only go as &#34; only mate&#34; on a ship carrying one mate. I have carefully studied the examinations required to be passed to secure a certificate as first mate and as only mate, and they are practically the same. Many years ago the examination for an only mate&#39;s certificate was much easier than that for a first mate. Now that they are practically the same, the position of only mate has become obsolete, because when a man knows that he must pass practically the same examination he prefers to apply for a first mate&#39;s certificate. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to propose that the words &#34;Marine engine-driver&#34; be left out of this clause. I believe that their inclusion would have a tendency to lower the status of men at present employed on a large number of our river and bay steamers. Many men, who are at present engaged and recognised as engineers by law and in the shipping industry, will have their status reduced in the estimation of the public if these words are retained. I am satisfied that it is not the desire of the Committee that a man should be disrated from the position of third class engineer to that of marine engine-driver. I do not say that it is a reflection on any man to say that he is a marine, engine-driver, but the insertion of these words in this clause seems to indicate a desire on the part of the Government to&#39; lower the standard of men at present employed as third class engineers. Men holding certificates as third class engineers have charge of harbor and river steamers in New South Wales up to  100  nominal horsepower. The same applies in South Australia. </para>

It is not right that by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament we should seek to lower the professional status of any body of men. I shall, later, have something to say about providing means to enable the third class engineer to reach the top of the ladder in his profession. But my object now is to secure the elimination of words which can only have the effect of disrating a large number of men employed in each of the States who are at present recognised by law and amongst their fellows as engineers. If honorable senators will search the recommendations of the Navigation Commission they will not find a sentence suggesting any necessity for the creation of such a class as marine engine-drivers.

                    <para>. - I think that my honorable friend has quite misconceived the object and meaning of this clause. In the first place, it deals with the certificates which shall be held by officers on foreign-going ships, limited coast-trade ships, and river and bay ships. It then proceeds to deal with the certificates granted to engineers. It provides for the issue of first class, second class, and third class certificates, grade A in the case of steam-ships, and grade B in the case of vessels propelled by any motive power other than steam. It then proceeds to deal with &#34; marine enginedrivers.&#34; That term is intended to cover all those men who know how to drive the engines which are installed upon the innumerable small craft which potter around our rivers and bays. </para>

                        <para>- Not in all cases. They do not possess qualifications which approach those held by third class engineers. If we strike out the words &#34;marine engine-driver,&#34; the small craft to which I have alluded will be obliged to carry third class engineers. Consequently an agitation will at once be promoted to fix a very low qualification so far as third class engineers are concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> contends that the clause in its present form would inflict injustice upon marine engine-drivers. I maintain that the amendment, if adopted, would impose hardship upon third class engineers, in that it would bring about a lowering of the qualification. Practically that qualification would become equivalent to that of a mere marine engine-driver, and the now well-recognised third class engineer, who possesses a much higher qualification than do marine engine-drivers, would suffer accordingly. </para>

As a matter of fact, we are not now discussing men possessing different qualifications, but men who are grouped under different titles. In Victoria we have no third class engineers, and never have had. The third class marine engine-drivers in Victoria are really third class engineers. But they labour under the disability of not being recognised under this Bill on an equality with the third class engineers of the other States, although they hold similar certificates of competency. </para>

                    <para>- To-day they are designated as third class marine engine-drivers. They cannot rise above that rank, because there is no such thing as a first class marine engine-driver. It is provided that if they hold the necessary qualifications they can come in under this measure. But if a Victorian wants to come in under the Bill, he must pass a third class examination before he can offer himself for the second class examination, although a man holding a similar qualification in New South Wales would simply have to present himself forthwith for the second class examination. The fact is that we have in the two States men with similar qualifications under different designations. We are told that the Bill protects them. But those who turn to the part dealing with the power of engines, will notice that the Victorian marine engine-drivers are going to be reduced to the extent of 15 horse-power. I understand that persons in Tasmania are in the same position, but that it does not apply to the other States. I can see no reason why any disability should be placed upon men because they happen to live in a State where the law was so absurd as not to allow them to rise to a higher grade, even if they possessed ability. I hope that a guarantee will be given that their rights will be preserved. It is certainly doubtful whether under the present Bill the certificates they hold will retain their validity. </para>

                        <para>- But under the system of defining horse-power under the Bill, the divisor is altered from 30 to 25 ; and I understand that that will reduce the Victorian certificates to the extent of about 15 horse-power. I think that two things should be done. The men holding these certificates should be given their correct status, which is equivalent to that of third class engineer in the other States. In addition, they should be given the right, if they are capable of passing an examination, and possess the necessary ability, to rise from the position of third class engineer or marine engine-driver, to that of&#39; second class engineer by examination. Under the Victorian Act they are debarred. I trust that justice will be done to them under the Bill now before us. </para>

                        <para>- Merely striking out the names would not accomplish our object. The general principle adopted when it is found necessary to make a change in order to secure greater efficiency in a service is, so as not to injure those who are getting their living under present conditions, to issue service certificates. It seems to me that this clause has in it the spirit that prompts the issue of such certificates; and if we wish to accomplish more completely the assertion of that principle, we shall have to do it, not by striking out the provision, but by making some other provision in another part of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The ground that I take up in arguing for the amendment of this clause is that it would do great injustice. The retention of the words &#34; marine engine-driver &#34; in the clause simply means making a double inroad upon, the welfare and interests of men who are now acting as engineers on board small steam-ships, and are recognised as engineers. Take a case in New South Wales of a steam-ship with 50 nominal horse-power. Under this Bill a marine engine-driver will be competent to take charge of such a boat. The present law of New South Wales requires a third class engineer to take charge of her. It is possible that there is merely a difference in words, but I am informed that the conditions in New South Wales are of so exacting a character as to be the means of turning out a body of men who have .given every satisfaction as third class engineers. This Bill proposes to shut down hard on vessels over 50 horse-power that go outside Sydney Heads, and only carry a marine engine-driver. </para>

                        <para>- River and bay steam-ships are not at present very clearly dealt with in the classification. As far as the schedule is concerned a steamer of over 50 nominal horse-power will have to carry a third class engineer. But at present third class engineers are employed on board such ships. If these words are retained it simply means creating a body of men called marine engine-drivers, who can present themselves to ship-owners and take positions in place of third class engineers. I feel sure that that is not the intention. The intention is to conserve the rights of those who are at present employed as third class engineers. We cannot attain that object by creating marine engine-drivers. </para>

                        <para>- It seems that the clause requires recasting. In New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia three classes of engineers are specified. But here we have this fanciful invasion created by the draftsman of the Bill. T think it is an unfair proposition. The Minister has referred to little steamers that potter about.&#39; If he means little vessels of less than 50 nominal horse-power he is welcome to his description. But when it comes to assessing the value of the work of men who have been doing responsible work I think that the passing of the clause in its present form would involve an invasion of their rights. There is no reason why we should rigidly adhere to the clause, especially as it will make a double inroad upon the interests and welfare of those third class engineers who are at present engaged in other States than Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- No; because they were the most suitable men for that class of vessels. The Bill institutes a grade of third engineer, and provides that a third engineer can pass to the grade of second engineer, and that a second engineer can pass to the grade of chief engineer. In&#39; the past a third engineer has been debarred in South Australia from doing that, no matter how high his qualification was, unless he had served four years in an engineering shop on the construction of boilers, and without touching an engine at all. If a man had served that time in <inline font-style="italic">3</inline> shoo, he was allowed to go up for examination ; but not otherwise&#34;: Another condition was that he must -have served for twelve months - a thing which was impossible - as a watch-keeping officer in a steam-ship of over 66 nominal horse-power. That prevented a third engineer on a ship under 50 nominal horse-power in South Australia from ever becoming a watch-keeping officer in a ship of over 66 nominal horse- power. I know many men who have had charge of boilers and engines for the last twenty years, but who, although competent in every way, were debarred from becoming second engineers, and afterwards chief engineers. That is not right. If a marine engine-driver is able to pass- a practical examination, and to show that he is competent to handle the tools, and do all the work in connexion with boilers and engines, why should he be prevented from rising to the grade of chief engineer? Apparently, the Government want to assist the persons who have tried to keep back those men in the past. On a ship, we have, as a rule, three mates, but the Bill contains no provision for the issue of a third mate&#39;s certificate. Why should a. certificate be issued for a third engineer? That is what I cannot understand, unless it is intended to provide for a third class engineer, as was done by several States, and to allow him an opportunity to qualify for the higher grades. On a large ship there is a number of engineers and mates, but the Bill only provides for the issue of certificates for first and second mates. </para>

                        <para>- The third mate has to keep the same watch as the chief mate, and when a third mate is being engaged by a ship he is told that he must have a second mate&#39;s certificate. The third class engineer I have referred to in South Australia has had more responsibility thrown upon him than has the second or third engineer on a large steamer, because the latter has a- supervisor in the person of the chief engineer. During thirty years a third class engineer&#39;s certificate has been issued in that State, but during that period there has not been one accident or one case investigated by the Marine Board in which the holder of such a &#34;certificate has been concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said that the holders of those certificates are to be allowed to retain them as long as they like, but that they will be at liberty to change them for other certificates, lt is not likely that a man who holds a third class certificate will change it for a certificate with a lower qualification. If the qualification is reduced, it will bring down the status of these men, because competition will ensue. I ask the Minister to ascertain from the experts whether it is not advisable to drop the provision for a third class engineer, otherwise I feel certain that this provision will require a man to have the very shop qualification which has prevented third engineers from rising in the past. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that honorable senators will review the position from the Commonwealth standpoint and try to realize the difficulties which have to be solved somehow or other. If there were corresponding grades in all the States we should have no difficulty in dealing with the matter. In all the States first and second class certificates have been issued, but in some States third class certificates are also issued. South Australia, for instance, issues third class certificates. In Victoria we have what are known as third class engine-drivers&#39; certificates. </para>

                        <para>- A qualification for the third class will have to be prescribed, but in preparing that qualification some regard must be had for the present qualification required for third class engineers&#39; certificates. If we struck the provision out altogether, we should have people in South Australia and in some of the other States complaining. So far from seeking to do any injustice, we are preserving all existing rights, and we say that if the qualification for any certificates at present held are equal to the qualification which will be required under this Bill, and the authorities are satisfied on tha point, those at present holding certificates will be able to secure a corresponding certificate. We hope ultimately to bring about uniformity. </para>

                        <para>- No. In order to bring about uniformity, we propose to fix a qualification for a third class certificate. We say that if a man holding a South Australian third class engineer&#39;s certificate satisfies us that his qualification is equal to that for which! we provide, we will give him a certificate* under this Bill. In the same way, on similar conditions, we shall be prepared to make an exchange with a man holding a third class certificate in Victoria. But in the meantime we do not propose to in any way interfere with the individual. He can continue his work under the certificate which he holds. Could anything be fairer? </para>

                    <para>. - We are dealing in clause 13 with a very troublesome and difficult question ; but it is for the Committee to adopt a provision which will give effect generally to what honorable senators desire ; and that is that there shall ultimately be uniformity in the matter of certificates of qualification. I have pointed out that at present there are third class engineers&#39; certificates issued in New South Wales and in South Australia, and third class engine-drivers&#39; certificates issued in Victoria. We know also that the owners of a very large number of small craft, by which they earn a decent livelihood, hold no engineer&#39;s certificate at all. The question before the Committee is how we shall bring about uniformity without doing any injustice. I wish honorable senators to realize that the Government are most anxious that no injustice whatever shall be done to any present holder of a certificate of qualification. We provide, first of al! that for the first and second class, the certificate must be the Board of Trade certificate. Honorable senators are agreed as to that. Then we say that it is desirable to issue a third class engineer&#39;s certificate. The qualification for that certificate must be prepared with due regard to the qualifications required for existing third class; engineers&#39; certificates, or certificates equal to them. In New South Wales, a certain qualification is required for what are called&#39; third class engineers&#39; certificates. In Victoria, third class engine-drivers&#39; certificates are issued, the qualification for which is in some respects higher than that required for a third class engineer&#39;s certificate in New South Wales. Then there is a third class certificate issued in South Australia,, which  1  am not in a position to compare with the others. We desire to provide for a Commonwealth third class certificate to  represent, as nearly as possible, the third class certificates I have mentioned. If it is proved to the satisfaction of the authorities that the qualification required for the  existing certificates is equal to that required for the Commonwealth certificate, all that will be necessary will be for those who hold those certificates to exchange them for a Commonwealth certificate. It is true that it will be necessary to prescribe certain conditions governing the exchange. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the matter is substantially one of administration. I have said that we are most anxious to do no injustice, and that is why the clause is submitted in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that some of my honorable friends should confuse this clause with the schedule. The clause deals -only with the names of the certificates, and does not affect the schedule in any way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has pointed out that under the schedule, it is provided that a marine engine-driver may take sole charge of a ship of 50 nominal horse-power ; but it will be time enough when we come to deal with the schedule to decide whether a ship of 50 nominal horse-power should be in the sole charge of a man holding a certificate as a marine engine-driver. We do not desire to do any injustice by making it necessary for the owners of the small craft 1 have referred to to qualify themselves as third class engineers, by providing that such craft shall be taken charge of only by persons possessing a third class engineer&#39;s certificate. We say we shall have a class of marine engine-drivers by itself. In the next place, we have no wish to do any injustice to persons holding third class engineers&#39; certificates by including amongst them marine engine-drivers, because that would involve a lowering of the status of third class engineers. It is obvious that if we strike out the words &#34; marine enginedriver,&#34; we shall have to make the qualification attaching to third class engineers&#39; certificates so low that marine engineers will be afforded a chance of obtaining them. We wish to avoid these two injustices. Hence we provide for the creation of a fourth class. I desire to impress upon honorable senators that engineering work is growing in importance year by year, and that the general tendency is to prescribe high qualifications for important positions. It is recognised that the higher the qualification which we fix, the greater will be the possibility of its possessor being well paid. If we are going to issue third class engineers&#39; certificates, by all means let us avoid making the qualification attaching to them a very indifferent one. On the other hand, let the fourth class man have his separate existence, and we shall then be able to accommodate ourselves to the existing conditions. </para>

During the course of this debate, reference has been made to the injustice which would be inflicted if we compelled the qualification for a third class engineer&#39;s certificate to embrace of necessity workshop experience. May I point out that there is nothing in the Bill which suggests anything of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- The fixing of the qualifications attaching to these various certificates must necessarily be determined by regulation. When those regulations are laid upon the table of the Senate, if the Government provide that workshop experience shall be necessary, exception can be taken to their action. Engineers throughout the Commonwealth will doubtless have their eves closely riveted on any procedure respecting their qualifications. It is very unlikely that the regulations will prescribe workshop experience. Probably they will follow the Board of Trade custom, by providing either for workshop experience or sea service. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sure that the Government only desire to do what is fair. But we must recollect that the provisions which we have been lately discussing will affect a very large number of men throughout the various States. Their position is an extremely anomalous one, and their future is very uncertain. The importance of this question is such that it ought not to be left for decision to regulation. The position of these men should be specified in the Bill so that they may realize exactly where they stand. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is well aware that whenever attempts have been made to deal legislatively with certain classes, such as accountants and dentists, existing conditions have always been most liberally construed. The measures dealing with them have provided that to persons possessed of a certain amount of knowledge - so long as the public interests were protected - the door should be kept as widely open as possible.I ask that the same rule should be followed here. At the present time a most anomalous condition of affairs obtains. For instance, in Tasmania, what are known as fourth class engineering certificates are issued, whilst in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, third class certificates are granted, which entitle their holders to work engines up to 50-horse power. In Victoria there are no third class engineers,)&#34; but what are called engine-driver&#39;s certificates are issued, which enable their holders to work engines double the power of those which third class engineers in the other three States are permitted to work. </para>

                        <para>- No. In the other States third class engineers&#39; certificates enable their holders to work round the coasts. Of course, the man who works the engine of a vessel is not responsible for the navigation of that vessel. But the certificated engine-drivers of Victoria must be possessed of a certain amount of experience upon salt water. They work upon salt water because the type of engine used is different from that used upon fresh water. They are compound or condensing engines. The certificates held by these men allow them to operate the same class of engines as the sea-going engineers are operating. So that as far as experience goes, they are entitled to the same certificates as those that are held by engineers who go to sea. The qualification demanded of them is that each must have served for two years as a fireman and one year as a leading fireman and assistant engineer, _ making three years&#39; service; or must have had such service as in the opinion of the Board is equal to the service first mentioned. These men are at present quite uncertain as to what their position is going to be under the Bill. The Minister has not made that position more definite than it was before. He says that the matter is to be decided entirely by regulation. It ought not to be left for regulation, but ought to be set out in the Bill. I claim that the holders of these third class engine-drivers&#39; certificates should be classed with third class engineers in the other States. Their work has been the same, and their class of experience is the same, except that perhaps they have not made the same length of journeys. As a matter of fact, the engines which they operate are double the power of those operated by the holders of third class engineers&#39; certificates in other States. They desire to be allowed, when they exchange their present certificates for Commonwealth certificates, not to have simply marine engine-drivers&#39; certificates, but. in lieu thereof, third class engineers&#39; certificates, if they can show that they have had the necessary experience. </para>

                        <para>- The mere fact that they are not allowed to run along the coast is a matter of indifference, because they are not responsible for the navigation of the ship, but only for the management of the engines. Whether they manage those engines on coastal journeys or outside the heads, their work is the same. It is, therefore, a fair claim that they should be allowed to exchange third class enginedrivers&#39; certificates for third class engineers&#39; certificates under this Bill. The Government cannot refuse to the third class engineers of South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland, third class certificates under the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The position is , anomalous, and we should make it plainer. If the Government allow third class engineers&#39; certificates to be granted in the other three States they will be in duty bound to allow them to the engine-drivers in Victoria, many of whom have had fifteen or twenty years&#39; experience. I trust that the Government will later accept an amendment providing that this shall be done. It may appear to be a small . matter, but a measure of this kind has to be construed liberally. </para>

I understand that the position is practically the same in Victoria. The position of a marine engine-driver in Western Australia is equivalent to that of a third class engineer in States where certificates are granted of that nature. If we are going to continue the certificates to the third class engineers, why should it not be understood forthwith that we are going to include marine engine-drivers within the same grade? </para>

                        <para>- I should like to have an intimation as to whether the present marine engine-drivers will receive the third-class engineers&#39; certificates mentioned in the Bill. Unless we know something about the examination that is to be held we shall be acting in the dark. 1 do not think that any one of us wishes to foist an unqualified man into a position in which he should not be placed. But we should proceed very cautiously, and do nothing to reduce the status of any engineer. I think that the better way to get out of the difficulty would be for the Minister to give us some idea as to the examination which would have to be passed by a man in order to qualify for a third class engineer. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the object of the amendment is to strike out words which provide for the recognition of an engine-driver&#39;s certificate. There is a great difference in status between an engineer and an engine-driver, and there is generally a difference in the remuneration of those two classes of men. It seems to me that whatever difficulties may arise - I can appreciate them quite well - with regard to what we may define in the future as a third class engineer, we must perpetuate a class of men who will be found necessary for the local commerce of the States, and who need not such high qualifications as are necessary for a qualified engineer. About Launceston and Hobart we have very many miles of comparatively smooth water, and a very large amount of carrying is done by small steam vessels. We do not want to saddle the management of those boats with unnecessary expenditure. I am glad that the Government intend to perpetuate that class of men, and to acknowledge in the Bill that they will be entitled to drive a certain class of engine. But the difficulty which I see with regard to those who have acquired a status is that in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia they hold one title, and in Victoria a totally different title. In New South Wales and Queensland these men are called third class engineers, but in Vittoria, men with the same qualifications are called engine-drivers. In South Australia there is issued a third class engineer&#39;s certificate, but the qualifications are not stated in the publication handed to honorable senators, and from which I am quoting. While it is quite proper that we should take away no right from those per- sons, is it intended to confer a Commonwealth status on the third class engineer&#39;s certificates of New South Wales, and leave Victoria and the other States with their engine-driver&#39;s licences? That point has not yet been made clear to me by the Minister. I can understand his ideas with regard to the future status of third class engineers. I know that he wishes to have a certain prescribed status, which, after the existing men have died out, will be attained bv all persons holding a uniform certificate. But are we going to perpetuate a distinction in title as regards men who are doing the same work in the various States? That is what seems to me to be their grievance. </para>

                    <para>. - It occurs to me that there would be no trouble if we were starting with a clean sheet. No one would object whether the Bill provided for four or forty grades, if it did not affect certain vested interests. For the present we may leave the question of the number of grades, and confine our attention to those who hold certificates under State laws. The Minister has affirmed that the Bill does not contemplate taking away from a single man one jot or tittle of the rights which he now enjoys. I cannot read clause 22 in any other way than as an absolute guarantee that all existing rights will be faithfully respected by the Commonwealth. But it seems to me that an effort is being made on behalf of marine engine-drivers to obtain a little more than they now hold. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what effect it may have. I think that it should have a very important effect. Let us see what might happen to these persons. It is proposed in the Bill to grant a certificate for a third class engineer and one for a marine engine-driver. It might happen that the qualification prescribed for a third class engineer was a little higher than that which the holder of a State marine engine-driver&#39;s certificate could show. In that case, he could choose between taking a marine engine-driver&#39;s certificate under this measure or retaining his present certificate : he would not be injured. On the other hand, it might happen that the more capable men would be able to claim certificates of a higher value in the open market than those which they now possess. That would be an advantage to them. The only thing I want to be abundantly clear about is that there is no bar or impediment to a man who holds an inferior certificate presenting himself, and, if he can show the necessary qualification, gradually obtaining a higher status. The Minister has said that in prescribing the qualifications for third class certificates an effort will be made to average the standing of the present State certi-ficates. I wish to draw his attention to a great danger underlying a procedure of that kind. If that course is taken, it is quite evident that the men below the Commonwealth standard will be shut out. On the other hand, the men who were above that standard will be brought down. I admit at once that it is entirely a matter of administration, and will call for a considerable amount of thought. I do not think that in the Bill we should lay down any hard-and-fast rule to meet that case. I desire now to refer to a matter which occurred to me when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was speaking. If we were to exclude, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> a class called marine engine-drivers, what would he do with the men who are following a useful occupation, but who are not qualified enough to become engineers? Surely it is not desired to stand between any man and his means of livelihood? I would much sooner err in the other direction, with a little liberality. </para>

                        <para>- It is possible that as regards future certificates, there might be a demand for workshop experience; but in the Bill there is nothing which says that a man who is a marine engine-driver to-day shall&#39; not, if qualified, pass on until he becomes an engineer. If it did contain such a provision, I should be prepared to throw it under the table at once. I should be the last to say that a man, no matter how humble, should be barred from obtaining more lucrative employment. So far as I can see, every possible facility is afforded by the Bill to a man to proceed&#39; to the next rung on the ladder, provided that he has the necessary qualifications. 1 do not think that we can ask any more than that. I certainly cannot indorse the claim put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that, because a man has a certificate vouching for the fact that he possesses certain qualifications, and entitling him to certain privileges, therefore we are bound to give him something more. I take it that in administering the Bill, an effort will be made in every case to give a man, the benefit of any little doubt, even to the point of generosity. But if we are protecting their rights and privileges down to the last letter, it would be a serious mistake to provide that <inline font-style="italic">if so facto,</inline> those men should receive certificates of a higher grade- than that for which they are qualified. The Bill seems to me to hold the balance fairly true. We say to these men, &#34; We offer you a Commonwealth certificate in return for one of equal standard issued under State laws. If you cannot show that you possess a certificate equal to the Commonwealth certificate, we shall do nothing which will destroy your opportunities for work. We shall not interfere in any way with the rights and privileges you enjoy.&#34; I cannot see that they have any right to ask for anything more. </para>

                        <para>- One or two have done so. I believe that in Victoria there is one man who did so. He was given a position as engineer on a tug-boat, and managed to get through in that way. Every third class engineer&#39;s certificate issued in the States to-day bears on its face an intimation that its possession does not qualify the holder to go up for examination for a higher grade. We propose to alter that by this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- If that means anything, it means that no man can get a Board of Trade certificate for second class engineer unless he is the holder of a third class certificate. That is dead against all Board of Trade regulations.  I believe it was never really intended that Holders of third class engineer&#39;s certificates under this Bill should be eligible for employment  in foreign-going ships at all. I believe it was intended that they should be confined to the limited coast trade ships. If they were so confined, all the trouble would be at an end, because the men who hold third class certificates in Australia to-day would be satisfied if permitted to continue in the limited coast trade. </para>

                        <para>- Then the Minister&#39;s suggestion that the third class certificate provided for in this Bill is to be a substitute for the certificates issued in Australia to-day is absolutely wrong. I say that no man holding a third class engineer&#39;s certificate in Australia to-day, unless he has had shop experience, or has been a watch-keeping officer in a vessel of over 66 nominal horse-power - a class of vessel into which he could not get under this Bill - will be able to get a second class certificate. He can pass any theoretical or practical examination he pleases, but unless he has complied with the other conditions to which I referred, the Board of Trade will not recognise his certificate. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what I have been saying all the time. The contention of the Minister is that the third class certificate should cover practically the qualifications required to obtain third class certificates issued in Australia to-day. In the meantime that is all right, but by-and-by a man holding one of these certificates may wish to improve his position, and go from third class to second class or chief engineer. He may be in a ship going to New Zealand when he gets his certificate as chief engineer, and when he arrives in New Zealand he will find that his ticket is worthless. </para>

                        <para>- The Navigation Commission went into this matter fully, and heard the evidence of all sections of the marine engineering profession. Not one of the witnesses advocated third class engineers for foreign-going ships. This is really a question between what are called &#34; mechanical engineers &#34; and &#34; shovel engineers.&#34; The Government have taken up the position of the mechanical engineer as against the shovel engineer. The whole matter is a dispute between these two classes of engineers, and that dispute has been behind the legislation on this subject in every one of the States. There has been a continual dispute. </para>

                    <para>. - The leader of the Opposition has stated that if the words &#34; marine engine-driver &#34; be not retained in this clause the provision will press very harshly upon those who are at present engaged in marine engine-driving. The Vice-President of the Executive Council also declared that it would inflict hardship upon the owners of innumerable small craft which are engaged in pottering about our harbors and rivers. May I remind both of those honorable gentlemen that under existing State laws all vessels which ply for hire are required to be in charge of a certificated person. By eliminating the words to which I have referred, and fashioning this Bill upon the New South Wales model, we shall not inflict the least injury upon the owners of these small craft. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s argument is that if the words &#34; marine engine-driver &#34; are omitted, men who work their own vessels will be very unfairly dealt with. But I would point out to him that under existing State laws these same individuals are required to possess certificates of some kind, so long as their boats ply for hire. Consequently my amendment will not press more severely upon them than do the existing State laws. That is one point which I have cleared up. </para>

                        <para>- I would allow them to qualify under this Bill in the same way that they are eligible to qualify under the States Acts. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has declared several times that under this Bill there will be no interference with existing rights. But when he was asked whether he would insist upon a third class engineer possessing shop experience, he declined to give a straight answer. He said that that matter would be dealt with by regulation. In the absence of any definite assurance from him, I take it that under this Bill an applicant for a third class engineer&#39;s certificate may be required to produce shop indentures. </para>

That is not the kind of craft which is to be found pottering around our bays and harbors, as was stated by. the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Perhaps some of the Manly steamers would come within that category.

                        <para>- Except in Victoria there are no marine engine-drivers in the Commonwealth. Under my proposal, their rights will be preserved. The proposal of the Bill is an innovation. It is one that will not inspire third class engine-drivers with any special love for their calling. It will mean the positive disrating of them, for the simple reason that it will bring into competition with them a number of men of a lower status and qualification. Considering that they have given such satisfaction in the past, as is clearly attested in the Royal Commission&#39;s report, I feel that it is the duty of the Committee to aid in not interfering with their status, and reducing their chance of earning their livelihood. </para>

                    <para>. - The argument of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> from beginning to end, simply touched the necessity or otherwise of reducing the 50 horse-power provision of the schedule. Of course, that will be a matter for consideration when we come to it. My honorable friend, to my surprise, referred to some of the Manly ferry-boats being under 50 horse-power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says that some of them are over 500 horse-power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is under a complete misapprehension as to third class certificates. The object of preserving the qualification for first and second class certificates is that we may have the advantage of the Board of Trade recognition. But third class certificates are merely a local creation. Nothing that we can do will cause a third class certificate to be recognised by the Board of Trade. We create that grade simply .for our own purposes. I &#39;refer my honorable friend to the schedule of the Bill. He will observe, in the manning scale, that the minimum number of engineers to be carried holding first class certificates is mentioned in the first column. In the second column, the minimum* number of engineers to be carried holding second class certificates is mentioned ; and, in the third class, we have the total number of engineers to be carried in single-screw vessels. I wish to disabuse mv honorable friend of the idea that, even if we desired to do so, we have the power to make third class certificates applicable to foreign-going steamers. </para>

                        <para>- I attach no importance to that point, and if any reasonable objection can be taken when we come to it, well and good. The qualifications for the various grades of certificates are set out in the Board of Trade regulations; and it is extremely unlikely that the qualification under this Bill will be confined to shop service. If it were so, my honorable friend would be one of the first to object, and he would gain much support for his objection. What is likely to be provided foils either shop service or an alternative sea service for a period to be fixed. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that the Bill does exactly what we all desire. It meets the conditions prevailing in some of the States, where there are third class engineers, whilst in other States there are men holding very much the same qualification who are called marine engine-drivers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> would class engine-drivers with third class engineers, but I think that that is hardly right unless they have the necessary qualification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> on the other hand, is so prejudiced in favour of the engineers, strictly so called, that he would absolutely shut out all the marine engine-drivers. That is not my idea of justice. My honorable friend is unconsciously suggesting something which is unjust. The Bill does justice, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council lias explained, over and over again, that the qualification for third class engineers will not be fixed without taking into consideration the present qualification of the men who are now third class engineers. The whole matter must be one of qualification and of administration ; and until we know what the qualification is to be, we are, to some extent, without the means of being precise. I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> whether there are men in the Commonwealth who hold their ert !ficates as marine engine-drivers, and who are nothing more, but whom he desires to have the privilege of getting third class engineers&#39; certificates? The Bill conserves all their rights. My honorable friend talks about competition, and engineers&#39; wages being reduced; and he gave us the impression that he wanted to shut out tha men in the humbler grades. The Bill provides for both. It says &#39;that the man who has a third class certificate is not to be reduced.  His  rights are to be conserved. What more is wanted I do not know. I come from a State where we have a large extent of still water. A man drives his little steamer out of the harbor in the morning and comes back at night. If anything goes wrong, he does not repair his engines himself, but takes his vessel to a repair shop. The Bill leaves in their . proper grade engine-drivers who are nothing but engine-drivers, and who ought not to hold the certificates of third class engineers. The men of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has been, talking have only to possess the qualification and they will get into the third engineers&#39; class. But we must recollect that we are dealing with property, and may be affecting the lives of passengers and crew. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council points out that he intends this qualification for marine engine-drivers to apply to those who are plying small craft for hire, and who, if we make no provision for them, may be left without any certificate at all. It may not be possible to provide for all of them in the third class, and consequently they may be deprived of their living. But that does not settle the question as to the future of the third class engineers in New South Wales, Queensland; and South Australia, and the engine-drivers who hold certificates in Victoria. I think that we should not leave that point indefinite. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> amendment is disposed of, I think that we might effect an improvement by adding after the word.&#34; ships&#34; in sub-clause  5,  the words &#34; as are within the limited coast trade.&#34; The limited coast trade is defined in clause  5  as meaning - </para>

                    <para>. - I know that my honorable friend has not intentionally sprung this amendment upon me, but it is very difficult for me to see in a moment exactly its effect if carried. It is rather a serious limitation which is proposed. I think that the words &#34; for such voyage, and in such capacities as are prescribed,&#34; answer all the purposes which my honorable friend seeks to achieve. </para>

It just comes back to the old argument that what the Government mean is that the third class engineer is to be an engineer employed on a ship on which two other engineers are carried, and not a third class engineer who has a ship under his care. 1 am quite satisfied now as to what the Government mean, and that is that the present holders of a third class engineer&#39;s certificate are not to get a certificate under the Bill, and have to come down to the grade of a marine engine-driver. </para>

He knows that he is steeped up to the neck in admiration of and faith in the Minister. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> seeks to limit the use of these certificates to certain work, I think that it is provided for in sub-clause 5. But if that is not so, I should like him to state wherein his proposal differs from that set out in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator McCOLL</inline> (Victoria) &#91;9.36&#93;.- By my amendment I am not limiting, but rather extending, the provision. It is plain from the definition what a limited coast-trade ship is. The Minister has stated time after time that these third class engineers&#39; certificates are only intended for the Australian trade, and&#39; that is what I propose to limit their use to by my amendment. </para>

At the present time, the holder of a third class certificate in Queensland is entitled to take a steamer to any part of its coast, and so it is in New South Wales. In South Australia these men are confined to the home-trade and to the inter-State trade by river. In Victoria  they  are confined to ports and harbors. But if mv amendment is carried they will be able to go from one Australian port to another, n.nd at the same time will be confined to the Australian trade, to which the Minister said it was intended to limit these men. </para>

I should like to have his definition of a long voyage on the coast of Australia. I think the honorable senator has made a mistake in assuming that, &#34;from and to any port&#34; means between any ports in Australia. In framing the regulations, the Government will probably confine coast-trade ships to short voyages between ports fairly close together. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> does not wish to limit the holders of these certificates to ships engaged in that trade. </para>

                <para class="block">I am aware that this amendment raises an issue which has already been discussed. My object is to insure that in all examinations to be held in future for the granting of marine engineers&#39; certificates, the examining Boards shall not be entitled to demand any indentures from candidates. We have in these matters slavishly followed the Merchant Shipping Act and the Board of Trade regulations, under which it is necessary for a man to serve a certain length of time in a shop, and get his indentures before he can present himself for examination for an engineer&#39;s certificate. It is about time we got out of this groove and. gave some chance to men who have served lengthy terms at sea in charge of engines of high capacity, to secure engineers&#39; certificates without being required to have shop experience. There is a belief amongst some of the castes in India, that if a man is the son of a shoemaker, he should be content to make shoes all his life, and if he is the son of a weaver, he should be content to continue weaving. Under the Acts at present in operation in all the States, an absolute barricade is set up which prevents any ambitious Australian youth from advancing any further than the third class grade of engineer. There are second, first, and extra chief grades to be reached but a person holding a third class certificate is absolutely debarred under existing legislation from reaching any higher rung of the ladder. My amendment, if agreed to, would remove an obstacle which has been so long placed in the way of bright youths who are earning their livelihood at sea, and who might, if given the opportunity, secure a second or a first grade certificate on any vessel afloat. I do not see why we should confine ourselves to the practice of the United Kingdom in this matter, when, if we look further afield, we shall find that in a country like the United </para>
                <para class="block">States of America there is no statutory provision requiring that an applicant for an engineer&#39;s certificate shall have shop experience. Under the laws of that country, a man may go to sea as a fireman, and, if he industriously applies himself to study, there is nothing to prevent him mounting to the top of the ladder in his profession and&#34; becoming a chief engineer. </para>

                        <para>- We had a very good example of the benefit of my proposal in this port only recently. The <inline font-style="italic">Ajax,</inline> a fairly large steamer, which honorable senators will remember was attending upon the American Fleet, when here had as third engineer a man who comparatively recently was employed on the Australian coast as a Fireman. Is it right that by slavishly following Board of Trade precedents we should continue to enact provisions which will place so many obstacles in the way of Australian youths who desire to advance in the marine engineering profession? I admit that the amendment I have moved is one of a radical character, but I know that many bright Australians will be prevented from securing a first or second class engineer&#39;s certificate if shop experience is insisted upon as one of the necessary qualifications. I have been asked to consider what would happen in the case of a breakdown of the machinery at sea? That is a bogy which is frequently raised in discussing this matter. Honorable senators must not forget that marine engineering has so far advanced in these times that in almost every ship going to sea duplicate parts of the more important portions of the machinery are carried. It does not require a great deal of technical skill on the part of the engineers to put these parts info position and set the engines going again after a break-down. Let me say, also, that breakdowns may occur which engineers fresh from the engineering shops could not remedy. For instance, when a ship breaks her tail-shaft, or one set of eccentric rods, the best engineer in the world can only attempt to get her engines under way by the best means in his power. Honorable senators will recollect that when the <inline font-style="italic">Monowai</inline> broke her shaft, she could not be brought into port unaided. The work was beyond the capacity of any engineer. American experience conclusively proves that young men in that country who are filled with ambition are able to reach the top of the tree, whereas, under our laws, they are debarred from so doing. I submit the amendment in the belief that we should no longer lag behind America in that respect. </para>

                    <para>- I shall be very glad if we can at once dispose of this amendment. I must confess that my honorable friend has proceeded upon an entirely wrong assumption. There is nothing in the Bill to warrant his doleful forebodings. As a matter of fact, I have already intimated upon more than one occasion that there is not the remotest intention on the part of the Department to insist upon indentures of shop service. On the contrary, I have told the Committee that the probability is that the precedent established by the Board of Trade will be followed, and that the substitute of sea service will be provided. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable senator affirms that they should be. regarded as of no value. I appeal to him to allow the clause to pass in its present form. It would be idle to insert a hard-and-fast provision such as he proposes. The regulations framed under the Act must have regard to Australian conditions, and if they arc not sufficiently practicable, Parliament will have the power to take exception to them. </para>
