                            <para>- The matter to which I desire the attention of honorable senators has been recognised by the Ministry and by Parliament as of very serious import, affecting, as it does, one of the great divisions of the Public Service, and a division more intimately connected with the business and lives of the people than any other, because failure in the certain and speedy transmission of postal or telegraphic messages often inflicts serious inconvenience, and, in many cases, positive loss on the public. This has been recognised in many speeches which have been delivered ' in this chamber, and is now admitted by the. Cabinet. The action of Ministers in appointing the Committee whose constitution I wish to discuss is an admission that the condition of affairs in the Post and Telegraph Department is more than unsatisfactory.I shall not use stronger language, because the matter has already been commented on in lurid terms from time to time. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the proposed Committee must be regarded as eminently unsatisfactory, not because of the personal character of its members, but because, in the first place, two of the Ministers appointed are already over-burdened with work, and cannot, while piloting the Customs Bill through Committee here, attend meetings to investigate the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department. If the Committee is to do useful work, it cannot stay in Melbourne ; but must visit each of the States, and how can Ministers attend to their duties here, and, at the same time, visit Brisbane and Perth, and the intermediate capitals? We should have to terminate our sittings, if they were to do so. We all feel the strain of this session, and it is no discourtesy to the Ministers concerned to say that they must feel it very seriously. To 'ask them to undertake, in addition to their present work, the tremendous task of investigating the affairs of the Post and Telegraph Department is to ask them to do the impossible. Therefore, one objection I have to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee is that some of its members have so much to do at present that they cannot give the time, and are not in fit condition, to attend its meeting's. My second objection is based on the maxim that no man should be a judge in his own cause. It would be eminently more satisfactory to Parliament, and to the public, if there were  upon'  the Committee persons having no official or personal responsibility for the alleged disorganisation. The Postmaster-General is being asked to sit in judgment on-</para>

                            <para>- Yes, and to criticise his own laches. He is officially responsible for all that happens' in the Department over which he presides, and, therefore, he should not be asked to report upon, perhaps, his own failure as an administrator. Senators Best and Keating have their hands full of work, and their minds equally burdened. Like the rest of us, they are a bit run down, and are in no condition, physical or mental, to tackle the huge task that lies before the Committee, if its  work  is to be done properly. Of course, if it is to be a mere surface inquiry, a mere official frivolity, the Committee as constituted may  do  very well ; but if  there  is to be a genuine and searching investigation into the grounds for the many complaints which have been made; and, if remedies are to be found for the evils alleged to exist, the Committee, as constituted, cannot undertake thework.I do not object to the Postmaster-General, or some other Minister, being on the Committee ; but all who are appointed should be able to attend its meetings, and there should be appointed to it persons having no official responsibility, to look after the interests of the business men and private correspondents who use the Department. Over and over again it has been stated in Parliament, and in the press, that serious injury is being inflicted on the community by the present state of affairs, and a member of the public who has been, or' may be at any moment, brought into the meshes of the official blundering, should take part in the inquiry. I thought of giving notice of a motion expressing dissatisfaction with the constitution of the Committee, but, recognising that it was hopeless to get an opportunity for its discussion, I saw no other way of bringing the matter forward than by the unsatisfactory course of moving the adjournment. That is' a course which I do not like to take; but I felt that some one should take action to give honorable senators the opportunity to express their views, and, therefore, I have moved the adjournment this morning.</para>

                            <para>- I can quite understand that that was so. I take no exception to the terms in which my honorable friend has dealt with this matter. Statements alleging serious . disorganization in the Post and Telegraph Department have been made in both Houses of Parliament, and in the press. As to their truth I cannot at this moment speak ; but the Cabinet felt it to be its duty to take immediate steps to investigate the matter, with a view, if disorganization exists, to put things on a proper footing. We have all had experience of Select Committees and</para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Royal Commissions, some of which have pxOved very useful, while others have not afforded the assistance which we should have been glad to receive. Ministers are responsible for- the proper conduct of affairs by their Departments, and allegations against the Post and Telegraph Department involve not merely that Department, but the Department of Home Affairs, the Treasury, ism so far as it is alleged that the expenditure should be greatly increased,, and the administration of the Public Service Act. As to the personnel of the proposed Committee, the Cabinet insisted - I think wisely - that the Minister of Home Affairs and the Postmaster-General should be members of it. They also saw fit to insist that I should become a member o'f the Committee. Now, it cannot reasonably be suggested that the Postmaster-General is responsible for the condition of affairs which exists in his Department. He has been in office, so to speak, only about five minutes. </para>

                            <para>- If a state of disorganisation exists in the Posit and Telegraph Department, it has been brought about by no act of the Postmaster-General. Consequently, the Cabinet felt that this matter was practically one of administration, and that the Postmaster-General should have the assistance of two of his colleagues in bringing about some substantial reform if that ' were needed. The Committee possesses this advantage: In the. first place, charges against the Department have been frankly and freely made in- the- press and by honorable senators;' and, secondly, the. Committee! know almost exactly the charges which are to be investigated. That is something for us to start with. . These charges have been specifically made, and it is for the Committee to ascertain their truth or otherwise. We have to investigate these charges, and to consider the Post and Telegraph Department in its relationship to the other Departments to which I have already referred. It is not the Post Office alone which will come under review by the Committee, but 'the Post Office in its relationship to other Departments.</para>

                            <para>- By reason of the magnitude of the concern, that may be the ultimate result. But it was because of the relationship of this Department to other Departments that the Government felt it was desirable - as the first responsibility attaches to them - that they should accept full responsibility, instead of doing, as is too frequently done, shunting this work on to others. It must be within the recollection of honorable senators that when Select Committees or Royal Commissions have been proposed by Governments from time to time, they have been taunted that they did not possess the requisite courage to undertake the responsibility which properly belonged to them. That probably would have been the taunt levelled against us if -we had appointed a Royal Commission, as is now suggested. But we preferred to accept our full responsibility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> also dealt with another aspect of this matter. It is true, as has been stated, that my colleague and I are at present overworked. The task which is about to be super-added to our other duties is one of magnitude, if it is to be undertaken with any degree of satisfaction. Of course, during the next few weeks - and I trust that it will be very few weeks before this session ends - we can only do what a Royal Commission would have been able to do if it had been appointed, namely, attend to the preliminary work of the inquiry by appointing a secretary, by formulating the charges which will have to be considered, and by laying down the general lines upon which the investigation shall- proceed. That is all that we can hope to do, and if a Commission had been appointed during the parliamentary session it could have done little more,</para>

                            <para>- That is a matter upon which a very considerable difference of opinion exists. I do not think that is the general view of honorable senators, and certainly it is not that of members of another place. In the long run, Parliament is responsible for the administration of this State-owned Department, and Parliament would not be satisfied if it were not represented upon a Royal Commission if such were appointed. Thus, even if we had appointed a Commission constituted in the manner I have referred to, it could have done no more during the few remaining weeks of the session than a subCommittee appointed by the Cabinet can do. Under the circumstances, we preferred to grapple with the very difficult and important task ourselves. . The result of the labours of the sub-Committee will, in due time, be reported to the Cabinet, which will then have to accept responsibility for its subsequent action. I submit that, having regard to the fact that the matter involved is purely one of administration, which affects not one Department, but several Departments, the- proper course to take was that which we have adopted.</para>

                            <para>- Not at all. But the disorganization of the Postmaster-General's Department and its .relation to the other Departments are involved in the inquiry that is about to be instituted. The difficulties as to permanent employment, which form an important feature of the charges that have been made, naturally concern the Public Service Commissioner, and' some of the main principles of the- Public Service Act. Under all the circumstances, honorable senators will, I think, on reflection, come to the conclusion that the Government have acted wisely in themselves undertaking responsibility in this matter rather than in shunting that responsibility on to a Select' Committee or to a Royal Commission, as has been suggested</para>

                        <para>- Everybody will admit that there are two members of the sub-Committee appointed by the Cabinet, who - even if Parliament were not in session - have quite enough to do in attending to the routine work of  their Departments. There are no two Federal Departments which have more routine' work to perform than have those of the Postmaster- General and the Department of Home Affairs, and no two Departments command' the constant personal supervision of Ministers more than they do. Yet it is now proposed that these Ministers shall devote their attention to an inquiry into matters of administration as well as into matters of- policy. It is obvious that they can only undertake such an inquiry at the expense of the .routine work of their Departments.</para>

                            <para>- I am merely speaking of the ability of Ministers to undertake this inquiry whilst attending strictly to the routine work of their Departments. I maintain that, the latter will necessarily be interfered with while the Committee is engaged in its investigation. The Vice-President of the Executive Council lias seen fit to go out of his way to disavow responsibility oh the part of the Postmaster-General for the disorganization which exists in his Department. I am not prepared to say that he is not responsible, because it does seem to me that any- Minister who accepts that position, knowing that there is a large amount of dissatisfaction in the Department, would -be much better employed in re-organizing it than in  Tuning  round the country devoting himself to matters which are outside of it.</para>

                            <para>- Certainly. In these respects alone the Postmaster-General has justified criticism of his administration. I think that the Government have appointed a Committee which will not have time to thoroughly investigate the position of affairs which obtains in the Post and Telegraph Department, and which' must necessarily stand by the Postmaster-General no matter what may happen. On the other hand a Royal Commission, if it thought fit, might point out that some of the disorganization of that Department was due to lax administration. But does anybody in his wildest dreams imagine that the  Chairman  of the Committee appointed by the Cabinet will report that such disorganization is due to his own lax administration ? We certainly should have a body which would report to that effect if it were justified in doing so by evidence. In speaking upon the reduction in the number of telegraphists the other night, I pointed out that it was either due to the Treasurer, the Postmaster'General, or the Public Service Commissioner that the telegraphic branch of the Department was disorganized. Now, can we expect the Committee, which has been appointed by the Cabinet, to report that the Postmaster-General is responsible for the lack of telegraph operators in the Commonwealth? But I desire to secure the appointment either of a Select Committee or a Royal Commission which will determine, upon the evidence tendered to it, exactly who is responsible. By appointing a Committee of the Cabinet to inquire into this question of postal administration the Government are not acting wisely to themselves. The action which they have taken is certainly unfair to Parliament, and I trust that they will reconsider their determination and appoint a Royal Commission or Select Committee. I am prepared to accept a Committee consisting of members of either House. If such a tribunal be-appointed there will be members prepared to justify, on the floor of the</para>

                        <para>- Some little time since, when a Supply Bill was before us, I expressed the hope that the Government would appoint a Royal Commission, upon which men of large business experience, outside Parliament, would find a place. I said then that if an inquiry was to be held it should be carried out by persons absolutely outside parliamentary circles, and entirely independent of political considerations. I still think that a Commission so composed would be the only one to solve the problem that confronts us. Having regard to the trouble which has occurred, it is impossible to assume - and I say this without any disrespect to the members of the Cabinet Committee - that they have, in the first instance, the qualifications necessary to enable them to inquire into all the complaints against the Department." Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in speaking, dealt with the trouble from only one stand-point. That, perhaps, was due to the brevity of his speech, but the fact remains that he considered only the position of the employes of the Department.</para>

                            <para>- That statement shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has already formed an opinion, and I have also done so, clearly proving how absolutely unfit any member of Parliament would be to conduct an impartial inquiry. What I have said in regard to members generally applies particularly to members of the Ministry. Is it to be supposed that Ministers will sit in judgment on a colleague, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> is prepared to sit in judgment on himself? A man of that type has not been bom, or, if he has, the electors have failed to appreciate him to the extent of mating him a member of Parliament. The first consideration is whether any member of the Cabinet Committee has the necessary qualification, from a business stand-point, to inquire into the working of what the Vice-President of the Executive Council himself described as a vast business undertaking-. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will admit that if the Department were his own private property and he wished to know what was wrong with it, he would seek the guidance of men skilled in the organization of big business enterprises. The Government, however, have handed over the inquiry to gentlemen whose qualifications in their own particular line I will willingly recognise, but not one of them has had intimate connexion with ordinary commercial enterprises. That being <inline font-style="italic">so,</inline> in the course of the inquiry they are bound to become, consciously or unconsciously, mere channels for the stereotyped views of the Department.</para>

                            <para>- I do not; but I hold that Parliament is the worst possible machine to conduct an inquiry. When honorable members speak, as they have by way of interjection, about delegating the authority of Parliament, I feel disposed to ask them what happens when we provide for the appointment of a travelling inspector for each State to inquire into the working of the Department. In doing so, are we running' away from our responsibilities ? All that I contend is that we should remit this work to those best qualified to tell Parliament in what respect the postal machine has gone wrong, and what is necessary to put it right. It is necessary that we should do so, because there is to some extent 'a conflict of opinion as to whether the trouble is due to the undermanning of the Department, or to the fact that its employes, whilst working at their full strength, have their labours largely wasted by the want of organization and the overlapping of duties. What has been our own experience? Is it necessary for me to relate cases in which there have been bundles of correspondence over a proposal that the Department should spend a few shillings? That system has been going on under the  Deputy  Postmaster-General and the Postmaster-General himself. How can they be expected to see its faults, and to see best how they can be corrected ? As they are responsible, they will find no fault in it. but will fall back on the very simple and disastrous expedient of asking for large and unnecessary grants ito carry oh _ the work. There is another reason why Ministers should have been barred from the inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> affirmed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> could not be held responsible for the position of ' affairs in the Department. There is some measure of justification' for that statement, but the attempted justification loses force by reason of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> has never shown an aptitude or inclination to set to work to correct the abuses that have grown up.</para>

Whilst the Vice-President of the Executive Council was right to some extent in his references to the Postmaster-General, I would point out that the  1?ost  . and Telegraph Department, whatever it is, is the product of the Ministry now occupying the Treasury benches. Almost without interruption, the same Ministry has been controlling the Department since the establishment of Federation. The Post and Telegraph Department has been built up, developed, and demoralized under . it.</para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's remarks suggest that in his opinion, the Reid-McLean Administration ought to have reformed the Department. If he thinks that step should have been taken during the few weeks which that Administration held office, with how much greater force does his contention apply to a Ministry which has been in office for six years? Not only is the present Government responsible for the Department, but it has absolutely allowed it to drift into its present ppsition, and has done nothing- to improve it until public opinion has forced it to take action. An inquiry by a Cabinet Committee must be eminently unsatisfactory, for the reasons I have given, and also for the reason that it will not carry any measure of confidence on the part of sui expectant and indignant public.</para>

                        <para>- The Minister, in dealing with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Cabinet Committee, ignored one very important feature. He certainly dealt with the necessity of inqui.ring into the administration of the Department, but did not emphasize the fact that one of the most serious complaints against it relates not to its internal working or its relations with other Departments, but to its relations with the public generally. I admit that the Government have a perfect right to put their own house in order, ' and that if the Postmaster-General blames the Treasurer, and the Treasurer blames the Postmaster-General or the Minister of Home Affairs for the present situation, the matter is one that the Ministry should settle amongst themselves. We do not wish them to bring their Cabinet grievances before us. The proposed Committee is eminently suited to settle any. Cabinet difficulties that may exist ; but we did hot ask the Ministry to appoint a Committee to do that work, or to apportion the blame between the Postmaster-General, the Treasurer, arid the Minister of Home Affairs. What we did ask was that they should appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the relations between the Department and the public. ' We desire to find out where the fault lies, and what is necessary to' place on a satisfactory footing the relations of the Department with the public. The Cabinet Committee which has been appointed might, and very properly could, deal with any internal differences in the Department, or with disagreements between it and other Departments, but the Government should have appointed men outside its own ranks to consider the numerous complaints from outside. We all know that when complaint is made as to the non-delivery of a letter, or delay in sending a telegram, weeks and weeks are occupied by the Department in writing stereotyped replies, and that in the end the person aggrieved is usually informed that there is no cause for complaint. That is what is going to happen in this case ; we are to have an official inquiry into complaints made by the public against the Department. However fitted the proposed Committee may be to deal with the internal administration of the Department, it is not one that should deal solely on its own responsibility . with the relations between the Department and the public generally.</para>

                        <para>- I have listened with some degree of interest ' to the discussion, and have come to the conclusion- that the dissatisfaction which has been expressed may be grouped under four headings. 'We have dissatisfaction with the Department; dissatisfaction in regard to the proposal of the Government to inquire into the defects of the Department by the appointment of a Cabinet Committee, dissatisfaction with the appointment of any one connected with Parliament to inquire into such a question as this, and, lastly, the view that men of great business capacity outside Parliament should alone be selected to do this work.I have often heard the same cry. Let us deal first of all with the dissatisfaction with the Department. There may be very grave grounds for it, but where are they? We must have definite cases ; because people continually grumble without knowing exactly what they are grumbling about. Difficulties have been presented to me as existing in the Post and Telegraph Department; but from my experience, not only in this Parliament, but in the Parliament of South Australia, I think the great difficulty is that the administration has not. advanced as rapidly as the requirements of the people. The Department, in its administration, is as good, if not better, than it was ten years ago - to my mind, it is infinitely better.</para>

                            <para>- But the desires arid requirements of the people are ten times greater than they were ten years ago; they expect more, and if they do not pet what they wish they are dissatisfied. And long life to that discontent, on which the progress of the world depends. I hope that something will be done to bring the Department up-to-date. I do not" mean that the Department should be brought up to the level of the best institutions of the kind in the world, or in accordance with absolutely the best business arrangements, but so advanced as to give the general satisfaction which there ought to be in a Commonwealth like ours. A Committee appointed by the Cabinet may be all very well as a preliminary canter; and if we have 'patience until that Committee reports and recommends, we shall be able to judge whether it has or has not done good work. We cannot tell what ability those gentlemen may show in their investigations. And now I come to the suggested appointment on any Committee of Inquiry of " great commercial authorities." At election times I have known a loud cry raised by certain sections for commercial representation in the Parliament of the Commonwealth ; and men, who are said to possess the necessary knowledge and ability, are put forward as candidates. Well, we have those great commercial authorities " in this Chamber and another place; and, that being so, are they not the men to appoint to any Commission or Committee of Inquiry ?</para>

                            <para>The more intelligence a man has derived from a variety of occupations, the better he is as a man of action. A man who is absolutely confined to commerce is no better in experience and knowledge than a man who has been absolutely confined to any other walk of life. A man may be good behind his counter, but of absolutely no use anywhere else, unless, of course, he is of very superior calibre. I always maintain that, as representatives, we have no right to shirk the responsibility which rests on Parliament in connexion with postal, defence, or any other national question. The people elect members of Parliament for the very purpose of having those Departments properly administered; and it is our duty to show that ability which we may pretend to have when we are seeking election. I have never had any faith in the appointment of outsiders to such Commissions or Committees of Inquiry as that suggested. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> showed that he had already made up his mind ; indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> admitted that he himself had already made up his mind. But can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> find me a commercial man in Australia who, in reference to the administration of any Government Department, has not, long ago, made up his mind ? Such a man is either a Socialist or an anti-Socialist; and, if the latter, he has no right to sit in judgment on a socialistic institution.</para>

If the investigation, report, and recommendation of the Committee appointed by the Government are unsatisfactory, let us appoint the best men from both Houses to undertake an inquiry. If that is done, it will not be necessary to appeal to the "great commercial authorities" who, in Australia, as well as in every other part of the world, represent more immorality than can be found in any other section of the community.</para>

The Opposition contend that a Committee composed of men of business would, owing to their experience, be able to investigate this matter much better than could members of Parliament. If it were only the business aspect of the postal administration that had to be inquired into, there might be something in that contention, always supposing, of course, that we could obtain the services of men with experience in this particular kind of business.</para>

                            <para>- Quite so. "Captains of industry," to use the phrase of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> may be, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out, perfectly competent in their own particular line of business; indeed, unless men specialize, they seldom are successful. But can any outside business man be expected to know as much about the Post and Telegraph Department and its administration as do business men who are members of Parliament, and. are, therefore, more or less constantly concerned with the administration of the public departments? As a business concern, I hold that there is very little fault to be found with the Post and Telegraph Department; indeed, I regard it as a thorough business success. We know that since the passing of the Federal Postal Act, the departmental business has been conducted at a cost of 200 or 300 per cent, below that which prevailed previously..</para>

                            <para>- I grant that there are complaints; and I hope there always will be, because it is only by means of complaints that we can expect reform and improvement. But the complaints are not what we might call of a business, character; they refer more to such questions as to whether sufficient or proper appointments have been made to various positions.</para>

                            <para>- I dare say. We can only ascertain whether there is any ground for complaint when we have the particular cases before us. I am not satisfied with the idea of a Cabinet Committee. It would have been much better had the Committee been composed of members of Parliament representing all shades of opinion.</para>

                            <para>- I am asking the honorable senator. I challenge any member of the Opposition to show that the complaints made indicate that the Department has not been successful from a business stand-point. There may have been faults on the part of those who may be described as not directly connected with the Department. There are those who have a great deal to do with the success of the Department, but who are not actually within it; and an investigation in this connexion may have to be made. What I desire to say is that we cannot expect a Cabinet Committee to condemn their own administration. I desire to know whether the Government intend to publish the evidence collected by this Committee, so that members of the Commonwealth Parliament may be placed in the position to form an opinion. Unless the evidence be published, a Committee might as well save themselves the trouble of taking it. I Hope that for the benefit of all concerned - the public as well as the Department - the Government will see that the evidence is published, so that members of Parliament may be placed in the position to form an independent opinion.</para>

If it is said that a huge business which is catering for the: public, which is evoking universal condemnation, whose employes are universally grumbling and : growling, as is constantly made known to each House, and about which there are numerous complaints in the press, is properly managed, I wonder at any honorable senator having the temerity to make a statement of the kind.

                            <para>Evidently some honorable senators do not like criticism. When this sacred Government is being attacked they are prepared to jump jim crow on their previous strong convictions in regard to the administration of this Department. For what reason do the Government propose to appoint a Cabinet Committee? Honorable senators may profess to think that the Department is well managed or otherwise, but what is the real state of public opinion? It is that we are appealing from Caesar to Caesar, and that all is futile.. I do not say whether, in my opinion, the inquiry should be conducted by members of Parliament or not. But it is very evident that when the Government! are appointing persons to inquire into al huge Department, they should select persons who have expert knowledge and systematic methods of dealing with business on a large scale.</para>

                            <para>- Yes ; certainly the Department is not capable of handling routine matters on a large scale. There is. endless confusion in regard to the delivery of mails - causing, I am sorry to say, any amount of bad language to be used - and in connexion with the telephone exchanges, not merely in Melbourne, but everywhere. With regard to almost every branch of the Department there are loud complaints. We all admit that an inquiry is necessary, but it is to be carried out by those who are immediately concerned, and who are asked either to condemn or to commend themselves. The real fact is that incapacity is rife throughout the Department, and has been conspicuous since Federation. I was very much surprised recently to learn that the head, had been allowed to remain at his post after he had reached the retiring age, in order to administer a Department which he has never administered rightly or well.</para>

No doubt new post-offices are being opened, but new post-offices in outside places were being opened prior to Federation. Each State was trying to give the best postal facilities at its command. I guarantee that an inquiry by a Cabinet Committee will not be satisfactory to the public, and that it will not produce that comprehensive report to which both branches of the Legislature are entitled.</para>

Senator de Largie has stated that, so far as he knows, no lack of business capacity is shown in the Department.

Whether that is justified or not can only be ascertained by a Committee properly constituted and free from political bias.  1  realize that since Federation an extraordinary amount of accumulated work has had to be done, and that, apart from routing business, great developments have had to be taken in hand.

                            <para>- It is not fair, of course, to discuss the details which will have to be inquired into by Ministers; but since a challenge has been thrown out, I may mention that the heads of Departments have not had that proper control over their employes which prevails in all large business concerns. For instance, the head of this Department could not get rid of -a washerwoman, who for eight months had received her full pay of 25s. per week without doing any work for it. In another Department it took six years to get rid of a man who was known to be thoroughly incompetent, and who was under the influence of drink for a long time. Again, a man was charged with embezzlement in a post-office, and he had to go before a Board. The embezzlement took place in November or December, and his case has not yet been dealt with. In the meantime, he could have easily slipped away to South America. He could not be prosecuted before the Board had given its decision. These cases show that there is iri vogue an absolutely rotten system which has deteriorated and is deteriorating the qualities of the employes.</para>

                            <para>- That may have been owing to other circumstances, and not to the calls of equity and justice. In New South Wales there has been one continuous outcry 'of want of oversight in this Department, want of sufficient employes to do the work thoroughly, and want of management in regard to the telephone system. From almost every business stand-point, the Department has come in for a great amount of public criticism. It is simply absurd to suggest that the public are all wrong and that the Department is all right. Of course, no one can say a word personally against the Ministers who have been selected to hold an inquiry. I believe that they will make a thorough inquiry as far as they can. But we must all realize that it is absolutely impossible for any Ministers to overhaul a Department over which they have control without showing bias. The public will not have that confidence in the inquiry, or in the Ministers by whom it is conducted, however estimable they may be, that they would have if it were conducted by a number of commercial men of standing and experience, who would be able to state the result of their researches without exhibiting political bias. I do not suggest that in this Parliament there are not men who could conduct an inquiry of the kind with credit and thoroughness, but it is well known that, from a practical point of view, the value of inquiries by Royal Commissions and Select Committees, has been affected by political bias. I believe that f am voicing the feeling of the people when I say that they will not be satisfied with an inquiry when it is made by those who Have had political control over the Department. This Government have been six years in power. The Postmaster-General is well aware of the public outcry against the manner in which his Department has been conducted. I assume that some inquiry has already been made as to whether the complaints were justified. If so, Ministers are surely not the men from whom we can expect a fair judgment. It would have been very much better if they had appointed a Committee from the two Houses of Parliament rather than a Committee which the public, from all we can glean, will not be satisfied is sufficient to cope with the serious nature of the charges made against the Department.</para>

                        <para>- I have .been very much surprised  at  interjections from honorable senators opposite to the effect that no serious charges have been made against the Post and Telegraph Department. On one occasion I was sitting in another place, when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> of New South  Wales,  make the most damaging statements that it was possible for a man to make against the Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> as  a  member of the Labour Party, and a representative of New South Wales, surely did not make those statements without good grounds. They were so strong that they surprised me very much indeed. The general feeling is that the business of the Post and Telegraph Department is too much centralized. Not sufficient power is left in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster- Generals. They cannot do anything without referring to Melbourne. The smallest details have to filter through to the head office. If a new chair is wanted for a post-office in the bush, and if a contractor in Melbourne will make it for 13s. 6d., whilst a contractor in North Queensland charges 15s., the chair will be made in Melbourne, although the cost of sending it to the post-office where it is required may run up the total expense to more than the Queensland contractor's price. That is the way the Department is managed. It will never be properly managed in the interest of the public until we have some Board in charge of it.</para>

But I am certainly of opinion that it would be better to take a great deal of the work connected with the Post Office out of the hands of political parties. I am not now referring to the political party in power. I refer equally to the Opposition Party.</para>

                            <para>He should be responsible to the Postmaster-General, who is responsible to Parliament. Of course, the Cabinet Committee will hear its evidence in camera. Parliament . will know nothing about it. The evidence will be submitted to the Cabinet, which will take action. That is all that we shall know. Had a Committee of both Houses of Parliament been appointed, the evidence would have been given in public. We should have had the report to guide us. But in this instance we shall have no evidence to assist us in forming a judgment. Such an inquiry will not satisfy the people of the Commonwealth, who have been . complaining. I am satisfied that other steps will have to be taken. We shall have to obtain an independent report from a body whose proceedings will be open to the members of the Senate and of another place, and will be conducted in the open  light of day. We are well aware that the coming recess will be .1 very short one. It may last a month or six weeks. It will, therefore, be impossible for the Ministers to take any evidence except such as they can obtain in Melbourne. They will be unable to ascertain where the root of the evil lies. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> expect that he and his colleagues will be able to go to Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania to get evidence? I do not suppose that they will have time to do so. But that is what the people want. I am satisfied that the action of the Government will not meet with the approval of the people as a whole. Further than that, I hope the" Vice-President of the Executive Council will excuse me when I say that I do not think that the members of the Cabinet Committee have sufficient knowledge to grasp the situation. From his interjections it would appear that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has already made up his mind that a number of the complaints do not deserve to be inquired into. He interjected that there were many complaints that were all moonshine.</para>

                            <para>- I accept the honorable senator's statement that such an idea was not in his mind. But I . wish to know from the representatives of the Government whether it is their intention, as a matter of fact, simply to take evidence in Melbourne, and on that to report to the Cabinet? If so, what good will it be? It certainly will not be what honorable senators have been asking for - a free and full inquiry into acknowledged defects in Post Office administration. The hands of the Government have been forced in the Senate and in another Chamber, but the Committee which they have appointed will not meet the public demand. Whether the Government are prepared to take any action at present or not I am sure that Parliament will insist on having an open inquiry into the whole subject.</para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was perfectly justified in submitting a motion for the adjournment of the Senate. A very important principle is involved. . It must be admitted that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the public with regard to the work of the Post and Telegraph Department. It is only right that some inquiry should be made. The question is, therefore, who should make the inquiry ? The members of the Government propose to make it themselves. But if, as a good many people believe, the head of the Department is lacking in administrative capacity, we shall not find that out as the result of an inquiry by Ministers. It was not a wise thing for them to appoint a Committee simply and solely from amongst themselves. Neither do I think that Parliament ought to shirk its responsibility in any way whatever when a subject of this kind has to be inquired into. It would have been very much better if the Government had made up their mind to appoint a Royal Commission, which could have been constituted of members of both Houses of</para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament, with the addition of one or two prominent business men. I am well aware that there is a great deal of discontent, and I believe that there is a considerable amount of disorganization in the Department. There is some degree of sweating. I do not say that the Department has not command of some amount of business ability with regard to many of the functions 'which it discharges. But take, for instance, the method of calling for tenders for Post Office work in some of our country towns. The present practice is simply an invitation for a number of small storekeepers to cut one against the other to get the Department's business. I do not think that that is a business-like course to adopt. But I have no wish to enter into details respecting the complaints. I take it for granted that it is generally admitted that there is need for investigation. The only point is as tei who should make that investigation. It is not fair to the Ministry that they themselves should make it. It is fair Jo the public that they should know whether there has been any failure in administration, and whether the men at the head of the Department have been incapable of properly carrying it on. That could be ascertained if the Commission were appointed from members of both Houses, and perhaps strengthened a little by the inclusion of one or two prominent commercial men. If that course had been adopted inquiries would have been made, complaints investigated, and practical recommendations made to Parliament which might well have been adopted-, and which perhaps would have! led to a much better state of affairs than seems to prevail at present. </para>

                        <para>- I have not listened to a great part of this debate, because I think that the Tariff is far more important than any other matter which we can discuss at present, but I desire to say a few words in defence of the Post and Telegraph Department. I am not at all in accord with the general clamour against) and hostile criticism of, the Department. To use a common phrase, I think the newspapers have "got their knife into" the Department, and a number of honorable members of both Houses seem to be taking up very much the same attitude. The work the Department does, and the fewness of the mistakes it makes, are perfectly marvellous, in view of the difficulty of pleasing everybody, when every man and woman in the community, and sometimes children, are interested in the Department. I believe that half of the complaints that are made have no foundation in fact, that in a large proportion of the remainder the fault lies with those who complain, and that in an enormous Departs ment of that sort, with about 12,00c* officers, there may easily be a little neglect of duty, a little want of knowledge and intelligence, and possibly a little carelessness now and then. My advice to the Ministry is to have no inquiry whatever. I do not believe in the agitation which has been got up. I do not believe that the inquiry will do any good. There are two kinds of inquiries that might be made - one a departmental inquiry, and the other an outside inquiry by Royal Commission. I do not think that the departmental inquiry as proposed by the Government will do an atom of good in satisfying the public. It isa most extraordinary form of inquiry to adopt. It is in this instance like making a man a judge in his own case. I take it that an inquiry such as the Government propose is proceeding now. Are we to understand that, with all these' complaints - half of which I do not believe are well founded - with all this agitation and hostile criticism, nothing ir» the shape of an inquiry is going on ? Has: not the Postmaster-General written to every  deputy,  calling his attention to the criticism, insisting that he shall satisfy himself that every officer in his Department is efficient and doing his duty, and that every man who is careless or responsible for any of these complaints shall be fined, reprimanded, or otherwise punished? I take it that that inquiry is going on, and therefore I do not see what good it will do for the Government to appoint a chosen three .of their number to go into the matter. The Postmaster-General ought to be going into it every hour he is in his office, because that is his duty. When I say that no body should be appointed to make an inquiry, I think that honorable senators are on this occasion, as they do on many others, greatly exaggerating the importance of Parliament, and of what an Act of Parliament, politicians, or Royal Commissions, can do. Responsibility should be put upon every head and every officer in that great Department. The  Deputy  Postmasters- General ought to be written to now, if it was not done months ago, to tell them that they will be held absolutely responsible for the efficient working of their branches of the</para>

It is a perfect shock to me to know that because the temporary capital' of the Federation is in Melbourne everything has to be issued from Melbourne. Are not the great Post and Telegraph Departments in Brisbane and Sydney carried on as they were before? Has all authority and responsibility been taken away from them? </para>

                            <para>Then it is a great mistake, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council, instead of conducting an inquiry, would use his common sense, and urge that there should be more decentralization, more local authority and administration, and that the officers should be held responsible for their work, far more good would be done. If a Royal Commission is appointed, where is it to begin and where on earth is it to end? Its report would be a long one, and none of us would ever read a quarter of it, while nine-tenths of it would be taken up by little suggestions about trumpery matters that the head of the Department, if he is worth his salt, could attend to in twenty-four hours. Let me give one little personal experience. I do not quote it to show that the. criticisms of the Department are well founded. It is so simple that it does not require a Royal Commission or departmental inquiry to find the remedy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has done good work in getting our parliamentary letters sent up here, when the Tasmanian mail arrives, some hours sooner than they used to get here. The <inline font-style="italic">Loorigana</inline> arrives at 8 o'clock or about a quarter to 8 a.m. Previously it was often just on luncheon time before we got our letters. We now get them at about 11 o'clock. But what happens at the lodging house across the way, where I live? I expected a letter on one occasion; The <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> got in at a quarter to 8. I looked for the letter here at 12 o'clock, and again at 2, but it had not come. I slipped across to mv lodging house at twenty minutes to 3, but it was not there, so I wrote, catching the mail at 3 o'clock, to say that the letter had not arrived, and asking for a duplicate to be sent. I went across to my dinner at half-past 6, and the letter was there. I found the explanation when I asked the landlady how many deliveries there were daily. I knew there was one at 8 o'clock in the morning, and a very prompt delivery it is, but I was told that there is none between then and 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I believe that that is a fact, because the letter was not there at twenty minutes to 3 when I went across. It appears to be a great blunder to have no delivery between 8 o'clock in the morning and 3 in the afternoon The deliveries in Tasmania are at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, 12 noon, and 4 -in the afternoon. Whilst (this debate has been going on, I have been dipping into the review of a little book called <inline font-style="italic">Sixty Years Protection' in Canada,</inline> with a sub-title :  - <inline font-style="italic">When Industries Lean on the Politician.</inline> Are we. coming to the ..time when Departments are to lean on' the politician ? Are we to go back to try to manage the Public Service by Parliament and political influence? I . believe that some honorable senators would vote to get rid of the Public Service Commissioner and allow Parliament to manage the whole thing. A more atrocious blunder could not be committed. The administration of the Departments should be kept, away from Parliament. I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray's</inline> suggestion to have an inquiry by a Board consisting of members of both Houses. That would be a most disastrous mistake. My view is that there should be no inquiry, but that the Government should see that every officer in the Department does his duty.</para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council spoke of the Postmaster-General's irresponsibility, stating that he had been in office, relatively, " only  about five minutes, ' ' but I find that the present Postmaster-General will have been in a week's time a solid eight months in office, that is, from the 30th July last. I do not sympathize with the remarks that have been made on this side of the Senate objecting to rr.embers of Parliament investigating matters of the kind. I recognise that there are, outside of Parliament, men of much administrative ability and experience, but I recognise also that there are in Parliament the men whom the people trust, and if they can be trusted in one respect they ought to be capable of being trusted in another. I shall not enlarge further- on that aspect- of the question. But one thing that strikes me about the proceedings for many a long month past is that the Department has been, spending its energies in fighting the public. There has been too much of an endeavour to prove the public wrong on every occasion, and not enough energy devoted to showing that the Department was in good working order. One important point, which has not so far been touched upon, is the fact that the Cabinet sub-Committee cannot take evidence upon oath, and. that' its evidence will therefore be only departmental chatter, and statements that can never be proved to be right or wrong. There will be no obligation on the part of any one to be accurate, and, therefore, the evidence will be most unreliable. The Senate has already had experience of at least one Select Committee which did not take evidence on oath, and every one connected with it knows how intensely unsatisfactory that was. I am perfectly satisfied that the evidence taken by the proposed 'sub-Committee of the Cabinet will never come before Parliament. The evidence to be taken by it as to the disputation between the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer with regard to the spending of public money can never be a subject to be brought before Parliament. If we are to see any evidence at all, it will have to. be carefully edited ; and we shall only see a bit here and a bit there, and I. take it that what we shall see will be infinitesimal. In fact, I doubt if we shall ever see a word of it, for the very reason that Ministerial disputes cannot be made publicly the subject of an inquiry of this kind: There are two inquiries necessary, one ' into the position as between the Department and the public that is the one that a Select Committee could inquire into - while the question of disputes between one Minister and another is a very fitting" matter for inquiry by Ministers themselves. Upon that phase of the matter I do not think that we want any Royal Commission or Select Committee. I believe that I did not mention that question when introducing the motion. My whole object is to arrive at some finality in the disputes between the Department and the public, and on behalf of the public I claim a more satisfactory . form of inquiry on that phase of the question than the inquiry promised. As the oBject with which I moved the motion has been fully achieved, I ask leave to withdraw it.</para>

                        <para>- I have consulted in this matter the manager, of one of the principal coach factories in Melbourne, and he is not ashamed to have his name associated with the opinion that York gum is quite as good as the best elm imported for the manufacture of hubs.' The only objection to it is its price, . and that is all that has so far kept it out of the market. Sen ator Millen is concerned about the weight of . this timber, and I am able to inform him that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woods,</inline> the manager of the firm to which I refer has authorized me to state that the best elm is as heavy as the best York gum, and that an expert in the business, in order to be satisfied of the quality of his material, would, if using elm for this purpose, prefer the weightiest timber of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- Primarily I admit that it is, but we hope that as the industry is developed in Australia there will be such a reduction in prices as will justify the increased price in the beginning. The Melbourne firm to which I have referred have had samples of York gum in stock which they have been able to dispose 'of very gradually, because of the price of the timber. . The manager holds that that- is the only objection at present to its use, and the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on the score of its weight does not hold good. </para>

Since the question of the weight of York gum has been raised, I say that the objection on that score does not hold good, because on the authority of an expert it is not heavier than the best quality of elm used for the same purpose. In Western Australia we have one firm giving attention to hubs made from York gum, and I have lately received a letter from them on the subject in which they say - </para>

                    <para>I beg to inform you that I have posted to you as instructed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Phaw,</inline> Secretary of the Chamber of Manufacturers, one pair of York gum hubs as a sample to show what Western Australia can produce in this line, and as a protest against elm or any other hubs being admitted free into the Commonwealth. If the eastern States cannot produce hubs to take the place of the imported article, Western Australia can in the sizes which are mostly imported in Australia, namely, from the smaller size to about 7^ in. It has been said that there is no timber suitable for these sizes in the East to any quantity, but above these sizes they have a good supply. In the sizes mentioned we are overstocked with timber, and to get the larger sizes for our local demand we have to fell the trees and leave a lot of small timber to go to waste. It has been admitted in the East that they are a splendid article, but the difference of is. 6d. a pair prevents the sale of our goods - the imported being the cheapest. I have a plant here capable - if I could get the demand - of producing at least 120 pairs per day of 8 hours, but, unfortunately, it only runs a few days a month ; and there are others the same as myself. It has been recommended by; the Chamber that a duty of 2s. 6d. a pair be put on imported hubs. </para>

                    <para>I will not hesitate to say they will get  a  far superior wheel. If we could get the demands to keep our plants going, no doubt we could produce cheaper, but till we get  a  duty put on the imported article, so as to give us  a  market, we can never hope to produce cheaper. I may say that there is no market here for the imported hubs. ... I do not think that I need say any more about hubs at present, but will conclude by saying that the local articles have stood the test here for years. Wheels that were built twenty years ago are still as good as ever. </para>

                <para class="block">In a very small compass, that is the case for the colonial hub. On the authority of this firm, there is no market in Western Australia for the imported elm hub. The writer has a plant which is capable of producing 120 pairs a day, but it is only run for an hour or so. An increased duty is required in order to enable him to get his article into the market. Messrs. Keep Bros., of Melbourne, who are not interested in the timber of Western Australia, assert that, with the exception of a patented wheel, the York gum hub is quite as good, for all classes of work, as is the best imported hub. In the western State this firm holds the market, but it is not able to get a footing in the eastern States owing to the freights from Perth. In the interest of our native timbers, I ask honorable senators to agree to the deletion of these words from the item, especially in view of the fact that, in point of quality and durability, York gum hubs are equal to imported "elm hubs. The Western manufacturer is only asking for a chance to compete with the imported article until such time as he is in a position to work three shifts, when he expects to place a cheaper article on the market. </para>

                    <para>. - In paragraph  n  of this item we are following the previous classification in regard to hubs. Under the old Tariff prepared hubs not made of elm were dutiable at 20 per cent., and it is now proposed to have a fixed duty of is. each, as recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. It will be noticed that under paragraph  y  it is proposed to make "elm hubs, with or without metal bands," free. That is the proposal which we submitted to another place. It was based on the previous Tariff, and also on. the recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the Minister's view. I do not wish for a moment to question what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said as to the quality of the Western timber. He has a specimen which shows that the hubs are of excellent quality. But the real foundation of his desire to eliminate these words is that the rate of freight to the eastern States is so high that it increases the price of the hubs to such a degree that they are unable to compete with the imported elm hubs. If that is the case the remedy . is not by increasing the Customs duty, but by some method of breaking up the combination which results in the imposition - of exorbitant rates of freight from Western Australia.</para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is. I consider that the greatest burdens on Australia to-day are the freights which result from the combination amongst the coastal shipping firms, who are simply making enormous profits out of the people and trade of the Commonwealth. They are the greatest antagonists to our oversea trade at this moment. Certainly I shall assist my honorable friends opposite in every way possible to break up a combination which rests like a great shadow upon the carrying industry of the Commonwealth. From what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said, I think that that is the mischief which he is trying to combat, and I shall be glad to assist him in getting rid of it, because he sees quite plainly that the great difficulty which oppresses this manufacturing firm in Western Australia is the enormous rate of freight.  That is due, not to any unreasonable competition on the part of the imported hub, but to this combination, which is a system of organized extortion. </para>

                        <para>- Where-ever it is obtainable, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has complained that a particular firm cannot compete in the eastern States because of the very high rates of freight. That ought to be stopped, but the proper way is not by imposing a heavy import duty on elm hubs, which are greatly desired, and are, perhaps, best fitted for the particular purpose in view, but by some other method. I protest, as I have done before, against the Tariff being made use of to adjust the rates of freight on coastal steamers and other difficulties of transit, which arise, not by reason of difficulties of importation, but by reason of a combination which admittedly exists throughout the Commonwealth. I intend to support the Government in resisting this request. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the argument on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> relied for securing the omission of these words was that, at the present time, the demand for the hubs in Western Australia was so small that the local manufacturer could not keep his machinery going. He also pointed out that the manufacturer intended to work three shifts, and that when he did he would be able to supply hubs at. a cheaper rate than the imported elm hubs. </para>

                        <para>- The argument used by honorable senators who oppose Senator/ Lynch' s request was that these goods cannot be manufactured in Australia, and supplied to the eastern States because of the freight. Freight has nothing to do with the case. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was mistaken as to the amount of freight from Western Australia to the eastern States. Of course, there are high freights in Australian waters. Our standards of living being higher than standards in other countries, wages are naturally higher, just as the fees paid to professional men . are higher. </para>

                    <para>. - I am somewhat disappointed at the attitude of the Minister. I thought that he would have recognised that at present there is practically no protection on hubs. Whilst the item provides for a duty on imported hubs, it takes away the protection by providing that elm hubs shall be excepted. But elm hubs form practically the only competition in our markets. Therefore the item might just as well not appear in the Tariff at all, so far as the protection it- gives is concerned. Inasmuch as nearly every other kind of interest in the country is receiving some encouragement under the Tariff, we might very well extend the same principle to the manufacturers of hubs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> says that the kind of timber from which these hubs are made can be produced in any of the Australian States. If that is so, all the States will get the benefit of the duty. If it were confined to Western Australia, this would be the only item with which we have dealt up to the present in regard to which Western Australia would receive any benefit whatever. But we find from the very wording of the item that it is of no protective value. </para>

Some evidence was taken by the Tariff Commission on this subject in South Australia and Victoria. I am somewhat disappointed that no evidence was obtained in Western Australia.

                <para class="block">That recommendation is made on . the strength of evidence by Victorian and South Australian witnesses, whose names are given. If we are going to make no more than a pretence at giving a protective duty by making it operative with regard to all' hubs except elm, the duty will be useless. This is really a nonsensical way of doing things. It is the most disappointing item in the schedule. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will look into the matter again, with a view of considering the advisableness of striking out the words indicated1 by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> If this is to be a protective Tariff, let it protect. But' if it is framed in such a way as to exempt from duty the only real competitors with whom our manufacturers have to contend, we might as well not have such items at all.

                <para>SenatorMcGREGOR.- We have timber in Australia suitable for making hubs of a superior quality, though it might be at a slightly increased cost for a short period. When I was in Western Australia, I saw hubs made, not only of York gum, but of another material, of which I challenge any One to find the equal in the world, but it is not adapted for the making of hubs so small as this. I refer to the ssstewart of Western Australia. I have seen, away in the timber districts of the "West, those immense j linkers 'for the haulage of big logs with wheels composed of steel from the hubs to the rims, and I have seen them discarding those steel wheels altogether, and manufacturing the wheels of Western Australian timber, with tewart hubs. That shows the superiority of the timber for that purpose. Knowing these things, knowing that for heavier vehicles in Western Australia they have a timber that is superior even to steel itself, and that for the manufacture of small hubs they have the York gum, which I am convinced there is nothing in the world to equal, I am sure that in a short time, if the industry is encouraged in Australia, this timber will be employed with advantage to the manufacturers and users of even the lightest vehicles. Is it, therefore, . any wonder that I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> proposition to leave the word "elm" out of this paragraph,, and thereby give encouragement to the 'use of our own timber, although it might cost a little more at the beginning? We know that it is more durable, and in the near future we may be in the position to supply an elm which would give even the lightness that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> so much desires. What sort of horses- must the honorable senator, drive when a pound difference in the weight of a buggy is going to kill them? </para>

That simply means that we are asked, in order to give this one individual a better prospect of carrying on his industry, to put an intensely heavy duty on hubs - how heavy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would not state. Honorable senators can see at once that a duty of is. on a simple block of wood of that kind is as heavy a rate as is borne by nine out of ten articles under this Tariff. -I warn the Committee as to what they are asked to do in regard to the lighter vehicles. 'By putting a duty on the imported wooden hubs, we shall encourage the use, not of the locally-made ones, but of the patent iron ones. </para>

                        <para>-  I know the honorable senator's sincere regard for those matters. What he does is to look out the growers -of dried herbs- and the isolated manufacturers of other articles in his State. Any one who takes hold of the wood produced will see at once that, whilst it may be an excellent material, as I believe it is, for hubs for heavier vehicles, its weight is altogether against it for the light vehicles which are so largely in use on the unformed roads of a country like New South Wales. The constant struggle there of the manufacturer and of the man who has to make journeys day after day is to get lightness combined with strength. Whilst I admit the durability and strength of the sample, its very weight, to any practical man who has to use the vehicle and find the horses to drag it, is its strongest condemnation. </para>

It  is in the interests of one man who is carrying on a relatively small industry, and the honorable senator says that the duty is to enable that one individual to levy toll upon every user of a vehicle in Australia. I congratulate him on coming forward for once with unblushing audacity, and making no secret of the fact that he is asking Parliament to put that one individual in the position of a legalized tax gatherer,' lo levy toll to the extent of is. upon an article which is worth hardly a trifle more. I am not prepared to support such a proposition. </para>

                        <para>- My only grievance in that regard Is against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> because, although he is held up as the paragon of protectionists, yet when it came to a question of a duty on steel rails he voted only for 12 J per cent., to be outdone afterwards by the leader of the FreeTrade Party in this Chamber, who voted for 15 per cent. My grievance against the leader of the Labour Party is that he was not as staunch a protectionist on that article as was the leader, of the Free-Trade Party. It is enough to make the bones of respected old Cobden rattle in his coffin, to think that the) man upon whom in this Chamber his mantle has fallen should outdo the representative of the protectionists to the extent of 2| per cent, upon steel rails ! </para>

I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> will forgive me if I urge the claims of one case from my own State, for in so doing, I shall be doing no more than the representatives of the other States have done.- The stock argument of tha opponents of every form of protection in this Chamber is " the burden on the taxpayer." In this case the burden is not a heavy one. About the durability of this timber there is no question. I have here a sample, that has been twenty years in use in Western Australia. The proposal is to put 2s-. on an article that lasts for twenty years in active service. It would amount to a penny and a fraction per year; and. that is the burden of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> speaks. I have moved my request in order that a Western Australian timber may be given a show, which it has not had up to the present time, and that it mav receive the same treatment which the Committee has already accorded to timbers grown in other States of the Commonwealth. Although the timber to which I have specially referred is grown in Western -Australia, there should be no discrimination made between it and timbers grown in. other parts of the Commonwealth that have already received consideration from honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the request. I do not believe that the timber referred to is confined to Western Australia. I have no doubt that similar timbers are to be found in each of the other States. From the sample produced, I judge that York gum is very much like the ordinary salmon gum which is found in different parts of Queensland. There are many timbers grown in Queensland which can be used for the same purpose as that for" which York  gum is used in Western' Australia. What is asked for is the imposition of a tax upon a few hubs used in the manufacture of- light vehicles. No heavy hubs are imported. The users. and builders of the heavy waggons used in the inside districts of Australia would never dream of importing their hubs. The waggon builder in the country goes "into the scrub, and cuts his own timber, coolibah principally, which he fashions into a hub for himself. We have evidence that hubs are being made from York gum in Western Australia, but we all know that there is very little difference between many varieties of gum to be found in the different States, and very often practically the same timber goes by a different name in each of the States. If,' in the matter of ' weight, a hub made from the Australian timber should be J lb. Or I lb. heavier than the imported article, that should not be allowed to stand in the way, and in every case we should do what we can to encourage the use of Australian timbers. Reference has been, made to the hubs imported from America, but, like the Sarvern hub, the majority of them are patented, and it seems to me that people who must have a patented imported hub should be prepared to pay for it. </para>

                        <para>- That the imported hub may be  2  lbs. lighter than a hub manufactured from Australian timber is no very strong reason in its favour, especially when it is quite possible that the heavier Australian hub might last five or six years longer than the imported article. It should not be forgotten that Australian timber has no natural protection so often referred to by honorable senators opposite, because I suppose that the freight on timber from one part of Australia to another is about as high as the freight on timber imported from America. Where we can give any advantage to our own people to encourage them in the use of Australian timbers, we should do so, and for that reason I support the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to support the request. It would seem that any excuse is good enough for honorable senators opposite to indulge a prejudice against Australian industries. During the discussion, I- got into touch, not with a manufacturer of hubs, who might .be considered personally interested, but with certain importers.' I made inquiries as to the weights of timber used for this purpose. I was given the information that the lightest elm hub weighs about 5f lbs., and the average weight of elm hubs is 6 lbs. . A difference in weight of &amp; lb. or  1  lb. in a hub for ari ordinary vehicle should not be allowed to keep the Australian hub out of. the market, though it would do so if some honorable senators had their way. The particular hub which has been produced for our inspection is not an ordinary light buggy hub, but is such as would be used in the manufacture of a spring cart. My inquiries show that the average weight of an American elm hub used for spring carts would be from 8 lbs. to  10  lbs. This proves that a hub made of York gum- is no heavier than ari imported elm hub used for the same class of vehicle. If that be so, the only point left to be considered is the relative durability of the two articles, and we have had produced . a sample of a hub made from Australian timber that had been in use for over twenty years. When it is proved that the Australian timber will stand wear and tear, and is not heavier than imported timber used for the same purpose, we have a right to give a preference to the Australian article. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> may not know that timbers grown in all of the States are used for this purpose, but honorable senators from New South Wales must have heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cummins,</inline> who builds as fine a vehicle as was ever seen on a road. To my knowledge, he has been a manufacturer of hubs and of buggies and spring carts for many years. We are not dealing with a (question which affects only one manufacturer in Western Australia, .but with a matter which concerns manufacturers in each of the States. Why should we encourage the importation of elm hubs when we know that Australian timbers can be used with advantage for the same purpose? We have heard that a prophet has no virtue in his own country, and we know some people who are imbued with the idea that any article manufactured' in Australia is not half as good as something which might be imported. These are the people who must have an imported elm hub despite the fact that equally good hubs are manufactured in Australia, not only from York- gum, but from a score of other Australian timbers. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> argument with respect to the eastern States was a very strong one, because I think it will be found that in each of the States the local industry has secured the local market, excepting the imported elm hub. But .the honorable senator's argument is strong as applied- to the manufacturer of hubs from Australian timbers in all of the States. We might as well attempt to stem the tide with a broom as to prevent a lighter mechanism displacing a heavier, and I think it will be generally admitted that for the lighter class of vehicles wooden hubs are fast becoming .t thing of the past. It will' not be long be fore they are entirely dispensed with; but for the heavier vehicles it is not too much to say that wooden hubs will be used for generations to come. . </para>

                    <para>- - I hope that this discussion has demonstrated 'to the Government the advisability of agreeing to this request, because unless the words ".elm hubs " are omitted from the item, practically no protection or encouragement will be given to the local manufacturers of hubs. Undoubtedly the elm hub is the only real or dangerous competitor with the native-made article. To grant in one item a protection of is. per hub to the local manufac*turer, and to exempt in another item elm hubs, from duty, is a sham kind of protection which should not be tolerated. ' Whatever may be said about our defective softwoods, it cannot be disputed that Australia grows every imaginable kind of hardwood which one can reasonably expect to find in a country. It is our duty to do what we can to promote the conversion of our hardwoods into -useful articles. To what uses is the greater proportion of our hardwood turned at the present time? A large quantity is used as firewood; and' a -large quantity is also used as sleepers and for paving our streets. I am sorry to say that very little of it is applied to the more valuable purposes to which hardwood timber can be turned1. When we have a splendid kind of timber, such as this so-called York gum is, but which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> states is- common to many of the States, we ought to see that some encouragement is given to persons to apply if to a more useful purpose than that of making fires. I have a grievance against the Government in connexion with the weight of the hub which  has been exhibited here. We have been told that it weighs more than the ordinary imported hub. One honorable senator stated that the exhibited hub weighed 6J lbs. I have taken the trouble to ascertain- its weight When it was received by the Post and Telegraph Department for transmission to the eastern States, it was declared to weigh 6 lbs. i£ ozs. From that stand-point, it will com-. pare favorably with" imported elm hubs. An expert witness assured the Tariff Commission that only the inferior kind of elm hub is lighter than the York gum hub. He added that if the better qualify of elm hub were compared with the York gum hub it would be found that the former is, if anything, heavier than the latter. I think that it will be admitted now that, as regards the relative weights, there is very little indeed to choose between the two articles. In view of the arguments which have been advanced I trust that the Government will recognise the advisableness of agreeing to the request, and that the Committee will give some reasonable encouragement to the local manufacture of this article. </para>

With regard to paragraphs c,  d,  and  e,  the duties passed, in another place were higher than those which prevailed under the old Tariff and the duty on this paragraph was raised proportionately from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not care merely to call attention to a thing. I think that the duty under this paragraph is a great deal too high. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> explanation does not make the position much better. He has said that because the duties on paragraphsc,  d,  and  e  were made so much it became necessary to increase the duty on paragraph  t.  The assumption underlying such an argument is of course that the wood which, is going to be used for picture and room mouldings is to be imported and to pay this duty. There is no room left for the possibility of the high timber duties imposed under paragraphsc,  d,  and  e  bringing into 'the market a sufficient quantity of our own timbers. </para>

                <para class="block">There is no reason to increase the protection on picture and room mouldings that are made out of our own local timber. If the argument with regard to paragraphs c,  d,  and  e  was good, that the duties created a demand for Australian timber, the other argument that we must increase the duty on picture mouldings falls to the ground.

                    <para>. - I understand that the timber available in the Commonwealth under present conditions for picture and room mouldings is being rapidly used, and that extensive orders have been placed for other timber for the purposes of ' conversion into picture and room mouldings. I believe that in Queensland alone orders up to 500,000 feet for timber suitable to be converted into picture and room mouldings, have been placed. Those orders cannot be satisfied for a considerable time. In the meantime, mouldings are being made out of timber imported under paragraphs c,  d,  and  e.  It is because this Tariff in respect of those items is higher than it was under the 1902 Act, that it was thought that the duty on picture and room mouldings should also be increased from 20 per cent., as it was in the 1902 Tariff, to 30 per cent., as it is now. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out, in addition to the reason urged for an increased duty, that there is the fact that we have in our midst industries producing genuine, reliable enduring mouldings, in contradistinction to the trumpery plaster of Paris compositions that are . being imported. I have had placed at my disposal a large number of patterns, typical of some 400 altogether, being picture and room mouldings of various kinds and sizes, made of solid Australian wood, so that when the housewife takes them down to dust them she will not find that pieces come out in her hand 'as we are accustomed to in regard to cheap imported mouldings. This industry has not reached the degree of . development to which it ought to have, attained. </para>

                <para class="block">I had an interview yesterday with a framemaker who is also an importer. He was urging, as a framemaker, that these mouldings should be duty free, or nearly so. I elicited from him, however, that he was also an importer, and he showed me a moulding - a very trumpery thing indeed, with a gilded plaster of Paris figure moulded upon it - that he can import for us. per 100 feet. I said to him, " Suppose you were not in so large a way of business as you are, and you had to buy this material from an importer, what would it cost you?" He said, "About 16s." So that what he, importing directly, gets for us., would cost 16s. if he had 'to buy it from an importer. I had brought under- my notice a picture moulding which, before the manufacture of mouldings commenced in this country, fetched 50s. per 100 feet. It is now, in consequence of the local competition, selling at 17s. I have no hesitation in saying that it is a desirable thing to develop that competition which gives to our people cheaper commodities, and those of a more enduring character. I ask honorable senators to look at these things for themselves - to put the putty patterns to which we have been accustomed, in comparison with these finely carved and embossed woods. Those of us who wish to see the homes of our people decorated with something that is really tasteful and artistic - not cheap and nasty - something that is enduring and made by Australian labour out of Australian timber, will, I think, find pleasure in inspecting these specimens of workmanship. Surely they affofd a reason why we should maintain this duty at the standard proposed. It is not a very high duty. Probably it will not entirely kill importations. But it will encourage some other lines that . are not being made, and1 will maintain that local competition which has brought down the . price of an article from 50s. per 100 feet to 17s. </para>

This work will furnish opportunities for developing the artistic taste of our people. We cannot make all our boys miners, and all our girls domestic servants.

                        <para>- When these manufacturers first started, they found that the dust and chips were injuring the health of their workmen. They went to an expense of nearly  £20  to provide exhaust pipes to draw the dust and chips away. "They have been carrying on business for six years, and they now have on hand a million feet of stock, that, up to the present, they have not been able -to sell. They get an order for, say, 100 feet. It does not pay to make 100 feet only ; they must make 1,000 feet. Consequently, 900 feet accumulate in stock. This business, although it has been conducted for six years, has not yet paid a dividend to the enterprising people who are carrying it on. We ought to do something to create such an assurance against the operations of the dumper, as will give these people, not only the satisfaction of being able to make a good article, but, at the same time, of receiving a reasonable profit on their capital. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator's policy is one which is calculated to bring about a reign, not of cheap and nasty things, but of dear and nasty ones. He would make everything so dear that people would have to buy things that are more or less nasty, and have to pay more or less long prices at the same time. Surely 20 per cent, is a substantial duty. If the manufacturers of the commodities exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> cannot hold' their own with such a help as that, it is time they retired altogether. </para>

But I wish to offer a word of comment upon one statement which I am sure no individual who understands the A B  C  of business could accept. I cannot believe that a business firm can- import direct goods at 11s. per 100 feet, whereas if they went to an importer they would have to pay 16s. for the same goods. I have never known an importer who would not be only too delighted if he could get a profit of 10 per cent, upon his goods.  1  am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> stated what he believed, but I am afraid that he hap " had his leg pulled," or he would not. have told such an extraordinary story. </para>

I heard von, sir, when declaring " The ' Ayes ' have it," and I immediately said, " What is that " ? - not being sure. If you intended to declare that the " Ayes " had it - for the reduction - I proposed to challenge it, but I heard nothing further than that you were putting the question and declared that somebody had it - whether the " Ayes " or " Noes " I did not for certain know. It has never been the practice of the  Chairman,  when there is a misunderstanding </para>

                        <para>-  I do not want to carry anything on a snap vote, and even if I wanted to I could not. This is not the final determination of the Committee on this question. I suggest to you, sir, that we should respect our Standing Orders. It will be easy to recommit the item and then there will be no chance of a snap division. Other items have to be recommitted. If you gave it for the "Ayes" when there happened to be a majority for the " Noes." let us correct it at the proper time and in the proper manner, and so respect our Standing Orders. When you put the question there was a response on the side of the "Aves," and not even one voice on the side of the " Noes." You then declared the request carried, and proceeded to the second column. You were half-way through your sentence - " Are there any requests on the second column ?" - before anything was said. There is no way of going back if we are to observe our Standing Orders, except by a recommittal. </para>

                        <para>- It was because the question was not heard that we have arrived at the present position, and in accordance with standing order 122 the Temporary  Chairman  is perfectly justified in putting the question again. I remind you, sir, that you did that when putting the request  moved on paragraph n to the Committee. You said at' that time that you heard only one "-No," and' on division when the question was put again it was found that there was more than one. If we have a division on this question it will be demonstrated that there is more than one " No." </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest desire to snatch a vote, but I do say that if should be obligatory on honorable senators to attend to the Chair when a question is being put. In this case, when the question was put, honorable senators who were opposed to the request were so indifferent to the whole thing that they allowed it to go without dissent. It would be a good lesson to honorable senators on both sides if the decision which has been given were adhered to. In order that we may not commit a breach of our Standing Orders,' and that we may . at the same time overcome the present difficulty, I suggest that you, sir, should put the question again, by leave of the Committee. If that is done, I promise that I shall raise no objection. </para>

                        <para>- But suppose some other honorable senator does. I do not wish it to be taken for granted that the question can only be put again by leave, because I have no hesitation in saying that that is not so. Whenever any confusion exists in regard to a question, or whenever the Chairman's decision is challenged, there is no practice more well-defined than for the  Chairman  to put the question again. I am sure that in this case honorable senators opposite do not desire to take advantage of a snatch vote. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to repeat what took place. The question was put quite plainly, and- a number of honorable senators called " Aye," but when I asked for the " Noes " there was not a single call of " No." There was then no other course open to me but to declare the. question carried. Then, in accordance with the practice invariably adopted throughout, the discussion upon the Tariff where there has been any dispute concerning a vote, I said I would put the question again. That was objected to. In the face of that objection, and there having been no " Noes " called when the question was first put, I can only put it again if there is no objection on the part of any honorable senator. I therefore propose now to put the question again. </para>

                <para class="block">If this request is carried, I shall move a request to make the duty on imports from the United Kingdom 25. per cent. My object in moving this request is to give to the broom-manufacturing industry the measure of protection which I think it deserves, and also to secure uniformity in the Tariff. If honorable senators will look at item 308 they will find that duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, are imposed on brushmakers' woodware, and, as honorable senators must see from the articles I produce, brushmakers' woodware and broom-stocks should be placed on the same footing. The reason which I give to the Committee for making this request is that whereas there is a duty of 30 per cent, on brushware, there is a duty of only 20 per cent, on broomware or broom stocks. Why is that' invidious distinction made? The man who makes the kind of ware which I hold in my hand is entitled to as much protection as is the man who makes brushware, and very frequently it happens that a man is engaged in both lines of business. In respect of this industry, evidence was given before the Tariff Commission by Tnen who have been engaged therein for many years, and they proved conclusively, at any rate to the protectionist section, that not only in Victoria, but in almost every other State, their business is very seriously threatened by the excessive importations of these articles. </para>

                        <para>- It as dutiable at 20 per cent., whereas the brushwork is dutiable at 30 per cent. Many witnesses pointed out to the Tariff Commission that they had to pay high duties on some of their raw material, and that it was a slight handicap to them. They said that when they were insufficiently protected they found it very difficult indeed to carry on their business. One of the largest employers and makers of this kind of work informed me the other day that, owing to the excessive importations and the inadequate protection he was getting under the present Tariff, he was employing only about one-half of the hands whom he had previously engaged. I am sure that his lot is not different from that of other men in his line. I trust that the Government, who have always expressed a desire to secure uniformity in the schedule, will  support this request, because it will convenience the Customs officials, and also give that measure of protection to the local manufacturer, to which I think he! is entitled. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that there is a very grave misunderstanding on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> There is a very great difference between broom stocks and brushmakers'  woodware. The article I hold in my hand is  brushmakers'  woodware, which is dutiable! at 30 per cent. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and other honorable senators who know a little about woodwork will agree with me that a broom stock is a square, rough -sawn piece of wood, cut to a definite length, of which a broom handle is made.  I would be very foolish indeed if, after having been on the Tariff Commission for so long a period, I did not understand the difference between broom stocks and brushmakers'  woodware. Now broom stocks occupy exactly the same position in respect of  brushmakers'  woodware as door stocks occupy with respect to the manufacture of doors. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> does not want a duty of 30 per cent, placed on the square pieces of wood out of which broom handles are made. The reason why broom stocks are not admitted free is to induce the use of Australian timber in the manufacture of broom handles. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Clemons</inline> suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> as Temporary  Chairman,  the desirableness of waiting until honorable senators had returned to their places after a division be fore putting a question to the Committee, and' it came somewhat as a surprise to me when I returned to my place to find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was moving this request,1 inasmuch as some time back the Government had given notice of their intention to propose a duty of 30 and 25 per cent, under paragraph u of item  303. That notice was given .because under item 308' brushmakers'  woodware and turnery is dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent., and we wished to make the duty under paragraph tj of this item uniform with the duty on the latter item. Since the duties have appeared in the schedule as they are, importers have repeatedly alleged that certain importations which the Department have regarded as  brushmakers'  woodware and turnery were broom stocks, and- should come in at the lower rate .of duty. A considerable amount of confusion has arisen, and many articles which are obviously  brushmakers'  woodware and turnery, which are dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent., have been claimed by the importers to be broom stocks, and dutiable at only 20 per cent. I was under the impression that the article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was showing to the Committee, and which he is now holding in his hand, was a" broom stock, and, according to his statement, it is marked as a broom stock. Whether that is the usual practice or not I do not know. Whether it is done for the purpose of making its identification more complete at the Customs House I cannot say. But I' know that it is eminently desirable that the confusion which exists should be terminated. After what I have heard in this discussion, I shall be prepared not to proceed with the request of which we gave notice, but to have the words " broom stocks " amplified by the addition of some words which will clearly identify what is intended to be made dutiable at 20 percent.,  and so prevent other articles which are  brushmakers'  woodware and turnerybeing confused with broom stocks, and" being claimed by importers as coming in at the lower rate of 20 per cent. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> object would be met, and the departmental objections to the present system of classification overcome without an injustice being done to anybody, if we made a request for the insertion after "broom stocks"1 of the words "being squared timber, rough sawn into sizes, for the manufacture of -broom handles." </para>

He is trying to do two things by means of one duty. A duty of 20 per cent, is iniquitous as a revenue duty, but it is of no use as a protective duty. From

In the case of rims there is a considerable amount of dispute, because rims appear elsewhere in the schedule. I propose to alter the wording . so that, the paragraph may read as follows - </para>

This is one of the mysteries that I want to understand. When I see the honorable senator taking up the attitude that he does from time to time, and being so inconsistent, even coming down to the level of others, I want this action of his explained: I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would not have taken that course. I cannot understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> our fighting friend for freetrade principles, could so far forget himself as to allow that recommendation to pass without recording a protest in writing. </para>

                    <para>. - I have answered this sort of thing dozens of times. Can I make any more effective protest than by a vote recorded- in this Chamber to make items free, no matter what the honorable senator may. read in that printed paper? I am perfectly willing to admit that- ninety-nine times out of a hundred I do not get my own way. If the honorable senator expects me to do wonders, he expects more than I have been able to perform. He knows how I vote. I am prepared to give an effective answer to his . question by voting to make free everything that I can. </para>

                <para class="block">That definition was in the Tariff as originally introduced, though it was not in the old Tariff, and was recommended by the Tariff Commission. It is accepted in the trade from one end of Australia to the other, and I believe from one end of the world to the other. It is understood and has been acted upon by the Department up to the present. Any man in the timber trade in Australia understands by a superficial foot a superficial foot of one inch or less in thickness. I fail to see why that definition should not be inserted here. If it is not inserted, all sorts of disputes will be caused, and timber, on which all the work has been done outside Australia, will be allowed to come in here at a considerably lower rate than this Parliament anticipated. </para>

                        <para>- Accepting the honorable senator's assurance as correct, is it not wise to have a uniform standard in Australia? Why should importers be allowed to bring in two half -inch boards for the same duty as an inch board ? You cannot make two half-inch Boards out of an inch board, as the thickness of the saw cut has to be taken into consideration. Without this definition, all the work of cutting with the saw will be done outside, when it could be' done here, and our object in allowing timber of certain sizes to be admitted at a certain rate will be defeated, because it will pay better to get the timber cut into smaller sizes and then import it, than to bring it here in larger sizes. I ask that this almost universally accepted definition should be embodied in the Tariff. </para>

Having abandoned that definition under the schedule as it stands a superficial foot would be regarded as one foot square one inch thick. I believe that that is generally recognised as a standard superficial foot. I have heard it said by way of interjection that that is not the standard of measurement adopted in some of the States, but I ask any member of the Committee to say whether, if the question were put as to the number of superficial feet contained in a log 27 feet long with a girth of 7ft. 4in., the answer would be different in the different States. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Assuming that 1 inch is the standard thickness, the measurement of 12 x 12 would remain the same, and then, in so far as the board was above or below an inch in thickness, it would, in the same proportion, be above or below one superficial foot. I think that we have proposed the fairest standard of measurement. </para>

As the schedule now stands the duty is chargeable by measurement calculated in the ordinary way on timber 1 inch thick. The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> request, first of all", would be to double that duty, but as we should not at the same time double the quantity of timber imported, it is clear that the additional duty would be imposed as a protection for the little extra labour involved in the preparation of the timber. </para>

I say that the-' extra 3s. would be the duty charged for the extra labour involved in dressing the timber on one side. So that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> asks the Committee to affirm that as much duty shall be imposed for the planing of timber on one side as we have decided shall apply . to the timber with one planing.

                        <para>- The honorable senator wants to provide protection for the timber, and for the dressing as well, and' the protection sought to be" provided for the dressing is out of all proportion to that provided for the timber. We have decided' that the duty on timber dressed on one side shall be 3s. per 100 superficial feet. Assuming that the Committee is of opinion that of that 2s. should be imposed' for protection on the timber and is. for protection of the labour involved in dressing it on one side, I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> does not ask the Committee to impose an additional is. because of the extra work involved in dressing the timber on the other side, as we might expect, but he desires to impose in respect of the simple operation of planing the timber on the second side as much duty as we have decided shall be charged in respect of the first planing and of the timber as well. That is out of all proportion, and I agreewith <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that if the Committee is disposed to agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> request, there should be a readjustment of the duties to which we have already agreed. The Minister of Home Affairs will confirm my statement that in New South Wales timber is sold according to the actual quantity. </para>

                        <para>- I have not purchased timber in every remote hamlet in New South Wales, but I have purchased it In Sydney, and in at least three fairly large country towns, and in each case I have found that the practice which prevails is to charge for ½-inch stuff as ½-inch stuff, though, of course, the saw-millers cover the extra labour involved by charging a somewhat higher price for the cut stuff'. One hundred superficial feet of weatherboarding £-inch thick would be charged for as ½-inch stuff, but of course the price would be relatively a little higher than for the same measurement of inch timber. That was recognised by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne when he withdrew the definition originally appearing in the Tariff. The honorable gentleman stated that he introduced the definition because he understood that it was in accordance with the usual practice, but when he subsequently found that it . was not he withdrew it and reverted to the practice under the old Tariff. We have already decided to increase the duty on timber from 6d. to is. per 100 superficial feet, but under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> request the duty would be increased to 2s. or 4s. </para>

I am not suggesting that there is any unfairness in submitting the request, but I' certainly think it would have been more open and above-board if honorable senators who support the request had, when we were deciding the duty to be imposed, moved a request that it .should be 4s. per 1 00 superficial feet. </para>

                    (South Australia) [6.15}. - I am very sorry that any delay 111 the consideration of the Tariff should be caused by an item of this kind, because, like every one else, I desire to complete the work as rapidly as possible. It does not seem to me that a number of honorable senators thoroughly understand the position in which they are. I wish that there was a more practical man than myself to explain it to them. It could be well explained by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    or
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline>
                    who have had some experience in connexion with not only the timber trade but also the working of wood. The first portion of the request deals with undressed timber, and the second portion with dressed timber. On undressed timber we have different rates of duty.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    has said that we should have considered those rates if we wanted to define anything. But we have considered different rates. For instance, on undressed timber measuring 1: inches x 6 inches and over we have requested a duty of is. per 100 superficial feet, and a superficial foot in that case undoubtedly means a piece of timber 12 inches square on the surface and an inch thick. On the next grade - that is, timber measuring 7 inches x 2 J inches and up to 12 inches x 6 inches - the duty is 2s. 'per 100 superficial feet. On this undressed timber, measuring 7 inches x
                    <inline font-style="italic">7.\</inline>
                    inches or 9 inches x 3 inches, or 4 inches x 9 inches, in fact, up to 12 inches x 6 inches, the duty is 2s. per 100 superficial feet, and a superficial foot in that connexion means a piece of timber 12 inches square on the surface and an inch thick. We next come to the grade below 7 inches x
                    <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline>
                    inches, and going, down to  t  inch x 1 inch or
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    inch x J inch. Honorable senators will observe that, just as labour has been employed on the timber in foreign countries, so the duty will be increased. In the different States there has been confusion in connexion with the meaning of a superficial foot of timber when it measured less than 7 inches x 2J  inches.

                        <para>- Yes, in every trade in the different States. In some States it was all right so long as the timber was imported in the rough, but V l when the size fell below 7 inches x <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline> inches and came to 3 inches x 2 inches or 3 inches x 1 inch or 2 inches x 1 inch or 1 inch x 1 inch, the cutting gave a certain amount of increased labour to our workers. In New South Wales, in fact, in any one of the States, if a man saw a piece of timber measuring 9 inches x 3 inches x 12 feet, and wanted it cut up, probably that would amount to one farthing per foot. He would have two cuts put in the- width and one cut in the depth, and would be' charged a farthing a foot for the cut each way. That would increase the cost of the timber. What we want to prevent is the excessive cutting up of the timber before it is imported. We desire the timber to be imported in the larger sizes, so that labour may be employed upon it here. We have to a certain extent done that until we come down to timber measuring 7 inches x 2^ inches, or, I might say, until we come down to what would be 12 inches x 1 inch, or what might be 2 inches x 6 inches or 3 inches x 4 inches. All these are. equivalent to  a foot in the lineal measurement of timber. We say to a man that if he goes below the superficial measurement to the lineal measurement, he is going much too low to suit the interests of our workers. If, for instance, a board measuring 12 inches wide by an inch thick, and cut into four thicknesses of £-inch, bs imported, we say that each thickness of ¼-inch shall be measured as an inch superficial, or, if not, let it be imported as 12 inches x 1 inch or in the larger sizes. It. is. for the purpose of preventing the lineal measurement that will give a superficial foot of timber- being imported in a lesser size than that, that we want this definition in connexion with timber in the rough. That has been urged not only here but in other places in connexion with the measurement of timber. . I think I have said enough in connexion with rough timber to show what is our object in seeking to insert this, definition regarding the smaller, measurements. As regards dressed timber there is a. duty of .3s. per 100 superficial feet. Suppose that we. take a board measuring 12 inches wide and 12 inches long and planed on one side. We say by this definition that the duty on that board shall be 3s., no matter whether it is 12 feet or 20 feet long. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The whole object of this Tariff is to promote the employment of Australian workmen. If foreign timber is allowed to come in at all, it should be imported in the rough, and when it is so imported employment is found for Australian workmen in the dressing of it.. That was the reason why we have gradually raised the duty from is. per 100 superficial feet to 3s. when it is dressed on one side. Then, if an inch plank is cut into two or three boards and the latter are dressed on both sides, we say that that is a detriment to our workmen, and we shall do all we can to stop the importation of such boards. Take a board which is 12 inches wide and 1 inch thick - a lineal foot will be a superficial foot - and dressed on one side. The duty on the board will be 3s. If a carpenter in Norway, Sweden, or America turns a board over and dresses the other side the duty will be 3s. more. We go further and say that if it is dressed on two edges as well as two faces it shall be regarded as measuring 2 inches more - that is, 2ft. 2in. We also say that if that board is sawn into two pieces and the inside faces are dressed the duty will be 12s. That is why the expression " per .100 feet super, face " is used in paragraph s of this item, and the object of this request is only to give a clear definition of what it means. </para>

                        <para>- Because my request in that regard merely contains a definition of "super, face" and. paragraph s is the only one in which that word is used. I think it is desirable, in the interests of an Australian . industry, to discourage as far as possible these timbers being imported in an almost manufactured state; and if my definition were adopted, it would accomplish- tha-, good end. It would not increase Mie duty in any way. whatever. It only means that instead of timbers being imported in the state in which they would come in as defined in. paragraph s, they would be imported in the rough, and the process of" manufacture would be completed in Australia.' That is an object .which nearly every honorable senator has at heart. It is exactly the same with regard to the definition of the term " superficial foot." It. would no': increase the price of timber, -or have any other effect than to prevent woodwork of a lesser thickness than t inch coming into Australia ; and would thereby give a large amount of work to Australian timber workers without increasing the price to the consumer one iota. What has been the result' of the departure made in a former Tariff with regard to this definition? Queensland has one of the largest timber industries in Australia, largest of all with the exception, perhaps, of that of Western Australia, which has ah enormous timber trade on account of its  jarrah  forests. Prior to the adoption of the interim Tariff after the accomplishment " of Federation, and while the old Queensland Tariff was in force, trie definition that I now ask to be inserted was in operation in that State. The result was that our Queensland saw-millers- were kept far more fully employed than they have been at any period since". They put up and placed upon the market many millions more feet ot timber under that system than they did under the. Federal Tariff, because the protection afforded to the Australian industry under the old Queensland Tariff was removed by dropping the old definition. It is true that the Queensland saw-millers during the last two years have perhaps regained to some extent their former prosperity, and have risen almost, if not quite, to the level of the amount of timber they formerly cut up and put upon  the market. But that has been because of the demand for timber in Queensland, and not for any other reason - certainly not because the Tariff was less injurious than it was in previous years. I trust that the Committee will agree to my request. It simply means the adoption of an universal standard in the Commonwealth - a standard which is almost universal now, which I believe no one will cavil at, and which will have no adverse results. I desire to  amend my request by inserting after the word " Note" the words -  " to come into force on and after 1st September, 90S." </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to point out that statistics show that the total quantity of timber imported in one year reached 248,000,000 feet. Of this total, no less than 200,000,000 feet or 8o| per cent., was undressed. Of the balance, only <inline font-style="italic">19½</inline> per cent, was dressed timber.

                    <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has included two different definitions in this request - one of " superficial foot ' ' and one of " super, face." With regard to the definition of " superficial," I may say that the Government introduced a similar definition elsewhere, but before the matter came up for discussion, for several reasons then given by the Treasurer, the other practice was reverted to, namely', that of taking <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> inch as the standard thickness of a superficial foot. Regarding the term " super, face," I pointed out that the practice that has been followed' b" the Department in estimating the Super, face measurement of imports coming in under paragraph s of item 303 has been to take, irrespective of the thickness of the material, the superficial area of the two surfaces that have been planed. If the two sides have also been planed, the superficial contents of the sides have not been calculated at all. As far as that practice differs from the proposition of my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> the difference is very slight in regard to matters like timber cut into shape and dressed or partly dressed for making boxes or doors ; because the thickness of that timber would preclude the superficial contents of the sides being of any great dimensions. They would- indeed, be a negligible quantity." I should not object to the honorable senator including the surfaces of the planed edges in addition to the surfaces of the planed sides, except that it would involve a considerable amount of difficulty in administration, because it would be necessary in every instance to check the actual thickness of every importation of timber, say, for the manufacture of doors and planed on the sides. Suppose that a given piece of timber was 1¼ inch in thickness and  9  feet in length. The superficial contents of the two sides would be very small. It was thought bv the Department that it was hardly worth including- in the measurement. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend's definition would achieve, in amount, very little difference from what the present practice of the Department is - that is, taking the two surfaces ; but for that little difference a great amount of trouble would have to be incurred on the part of the Customs officers to carry out the administration. In any case, with regard to " super, face," I point out that it would be better, instead of the words used by my honorable friend - " of that part of the timber dressed " - to use the words " the superficial measurement of the surfaces of the timber dressed." </para>

                        <para>- If the timber was dressed on both sides and also on each of (he edges, all those would be regarded by the honorable senator as surfaces. The honorable senator seems to think that the Government are causing difficulties-, but if his definition of " super, face " is carried a considerable amount of difficulty will be caused to the officers in administering the Act, while the result achieved will be proportionately small. The honorable senator wants to add to the superficial area of the two sides the area of any edges which are planed. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that in cases of that sort, where the width is not much greater than the thickness, there might be some justification for including all the planed surfaces, but whichever way is adopted there will be very little difference in the actual 'measurement. I do not object to the proposed super, face definition so much as I do to the proposed superficial foot definition. The contents of the planed edges of the great bulk of the importations under paragraph s are, as I understand from the Department, practically negligible, although it is quite possible that in the case quoted by the honorable senator the planed edge would have almost the same measurement as the planed face. As there are two distinct propositions involved in the request, I ask that it may be divided. If the Committee decide to adopt the request regarding super, foot, it is only reasonable that it should come into operation at some future date, so that due notice may be given to persons interested in the importation of timber. I am glad that the honorable senator has recognised that. </para>

                    <para>. - It is true that as the Tariff was first introduced the duties proposed on this "item were  45  per cent, under the general Tariff, and  40  per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. The' duty under the old Tariff was  20  per cent, in the case of item  299  covering general furniture, duties representing a . corresponding increase on the previously existing duty were also" submitted, but that item was recast, and put into a different form on the  5th  December,  1907.  The duties were then made  35  and  25  par cent., and subsequently, in dealing with item  306,  to. which duties of  40  and  30  per cent, were originally attached, honorable members in another place agreed that the articles covered bv that ' item should be dutiable also at  35  and  30  per cent. It will be remembered that on Friday last in order to bring the item covering " Wood, all articles made of, n.e.i.," and general furniture, on the same plane, we agreed to a request raising the duties on general furniture to  35  and  30  per cent. When these matters were being discussed in another place, it was stated that the Government considered that wicker, bamboo, and cane articles, included in item  304,  should be dutiable at the rates attaching to general furniture, and consequently the duties on this item were reduced from  45  and  40  per cent, as the Tariff was originally submitted, to  35  and  25  per cent. Since then, on Friday last, as I have said, we agreed to request the House of Representatives to make the preferential duty on general furniture the same as that on item  306,  " Wood, all articles made of, n.e.i.," viz.,  35  and  30  per cent. I am, in the circumstances, prepared to go with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to the length of imposing a duty of  30  per cent, instead of  25  per cent, on imports, under this item from the United Kingdom. If that course were adopted, we should have duties of  35  and  30  per cent imposed on item  299,  general furniture, item  306,  "Wood, all articles-made of, n.e.i.," and on this item,  304.  That would provide for something like uniformity, and I do not know of any reason why the duties imposed on the articles included in this item should be higher than those we have decided to impose on the articles included in the other items to which I have referred. I know that there is a certain amount of competition from the East in respect of articles included in item  300,  lounges and settees, and  301,  chairs, made of bamboo and cane, and we dealt "with those items on Friday. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to be satisfied with an increase in the duty on imports from the United Kingdom, under this item, from  25  to  30  per cent,, and so equalize the duties oh this item with those on items  299  and  306. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister says that he does not see any reason why there should be any difference between the duties on general furniture. under item 299, and the duties on articles of wicker, bamboo, and cane, included under item 304. But surely the honorable senator must recognise that the competition of . the East is more acute than that of any other country that one could cite. Labour in the East is paid at poorer rates than in any other part of the world, whilst the labourers have to work longer hours and under worse conditions than those in any other part of the world. We have declared definitely, and I hope for all time, in favour of a white Australia. We keep out Japanese, Chinese, and natives of the Straits Settlement, and surely to be consistent we should shut out the goods made by these people when they come into serious competition with articles made by Australian workmen under Australian conditions? It is impossible for Australian workmen to engage in this industry successfully unless they receive the highest measure of protection. Referring to some of this class of work which finds its way into Australia, I mentioned on Friday last that, when in the East, I bought for 9s. 2d. articles which I might have purchased for 8s. - if I had tried to 1beat down the Chinaman from whom I got them: - and which are retailed here at  3  7s. 6d. The rates of pay obtaining in the East run from 4d. to is: a day, and is. per day is considered a very high wage in Japan and China. It should be remembered that the persons engaged in this industry in Victoria and possibly in all of the States do not work for more than eight hours per day, and they receive a wage which in many of the States is fixed by statute. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, because in Victoria the Chinese workers in this trade must comply with the conditions of Victorian legislation, and their hours and wages are fixed. They are chiefly engaged in manufacturing the furniture which is included under item 299. I have not seen any wicker-work furniture made by Chinese in Victoria, but if they are making it here they are doing so under conditions totally dissimilar to those which apply to their countrymen in China. T hope that the highest measure of protection will be given to all engaged in this industry in Australia. No analogy can be drawn between the furniture included in item 299 and that included in item 304. The general furniture included in item 299 is made in different parts of the world, But in no part of the world under such conditions as prevail in China, Japan, and the Straits Settlements. For the reasons I have given, I cannot understand why the Government cannot see their way to make an exception in the case of the articles included in this item. </para>

                    <para>.- This item affects an industry which we should encourage as much as possible. It is one that is peculiarly adapted to the country, as this class of furniture is more suitable to our hot climate than is the ordinary furniture included in item 299. It is an excellent industry for the employment of our young people, and a large number are at present employed in it. The competition in the industry locally is quite sufficient to insure reasonable prices, even though the higher duty suggested should be imposed. The raw material required is abundant in. Australia. Willows grow along our streams, and, like weeds, along our irrigation channels, and they may be looked to for an addition to the income from other sources of settlers on irrigated lands. I am prepared to support the proposed increase of duty, and though the bulk of these articles are imported from the East, there should be a reasonable preference in respect of baskets and similar small articles imported from the United Kingdom. </para>

As a matter of fact, I find that the total value of the imports of articles included in items 304 and 305 does not amount to more than £4,896 for the whole of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that they are very carefully invoiced, as we have a number of lynx-eyed Customs officers who know the value of these goods. No one would imagine from the speeches that have been made that our imports of these articles are really so insignificant as they are. The figures show that a duty of even  20  per cent, under the old Tariff was sufficient to keep the importations within bounds. I should like honorable senators to bear in mind that the duty of  35  per cent, proposed in the schedule is really a duty of  38½  per cent. The  20  per cent, duty collected under the old Tariff really represented  22  per cent., because whatever be the rate one-tenth is added under the Customs Act. One-tenth of  35  would be'  3½,  and therefore the duty proposed under item  304  on imports under the general Tariff really represents a duty of  38½  per cent. I daresay that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was not aware of the fact. </para>

The thing is protection run mad. Why have not honorable senators the manliness to propose straight away the prohibition of the importation of these goods? I could admire a protectionist who stood to his guns and made such a proposal. But to propose a duty of this extravagant character, which is practically prohibition, does not seem- to me to be an honest way of dealing with the matter. </para>

I was pointing out that the honorable senator's proposal is to impose a duty of  45  per cent, which, plus one-tenth, would make the real duty  491  per cent. The duty, as it is submitted to us, is  38!  per cent., and if that is not enough, especially in face of these trifling importations, what can be? I am certain that if a duty of  60  per cent, had been proposed, very much the same speeches would have been delivered. We should have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> declaring that in order to protect our workmen we must have a duty of  70  per cent., and so on. There is no satisfying honorable senators when they get thoroughly inoculated with this protectionist theory. The imports are almost invisible - only  , £4,800  - when - spread over the whole Commonwealth, and . yet we have an outcry as if it were being deluged with these articles from outside countries. Surely there can be some little  reason  even in our madness ! </para>

                        <para>- That, is another element in the consideration of a. Tariff, and in relation to articles on which duties are sought to be imposed in order to encourage local industries. We are also told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that one reason why we should have encouraging duties on these articles is that, as they are suitable to the climate, they are greatly used here. He has stated- that wicker chairs are very comfortable and. airy to sit upon, . and that for that reason we ought if possible to impose this higher duty. If that is the ca.se, surely we ought to reduce the duty? I quite admit that wicker and cane furniture - whether it be chairs or sofas or anything else - is very suitable to our climate, particularly in summer, and very much better and healthier, than the furniture which is stuffed and upholstered. But if that is the case, why should we penalize its use by raising the duty from  38  or  40  to  45  per cent., with all the added percentages bringing it up to really  50  per cent, on the value of the article? My protectionist friends admit that their object is, up to a certain point,- to add to the cost of the articles, because otherwise there is no protection to the local manufacturer. I do not say that they go' quite to the length of affirming that proposition, but they go to a sufficient length for my purpose. If that is the case, is it not very much fairer and better for the consumer that we should keep the duty down- I am putting now the view as it may present itself to a protectionist - to a sufficient level not to be an extreme burden upon the consumer, whilst at the same time preserving that encouragement to the manufacturer which they wish to give to him? The total importation of these articles from all countries during  1906  was   £4,896  worth. I do not know what the local production is, or what the extent of the purchase of these things in this country may be, but I do know that, under a duty of 20 per cent., the lighter kinds of furniture have been made to -an infinite degree more largely in Australia than they used to be. Why should we more than double that duty ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> takes credit for supporting this increase, because he says that in the next column there will "be a fine opportunity for giving a British preference. It is a very small unction that he is laying to his soul in this instance, because the total importation of these articles from the United Kingdom ih 1906 was £238 worth. Yet he hopes to console himself 'in voting for an enormous duty by the reflection that he is going to give a preference ' to the United Kingdom. Is it not ludicrous? I am sure that, on reflection, he will not feel that British trade is likely to benefit very much from the enormous increase which is proposed. I hope that he will reconsider his position, and say that he will not support such a huge increase in the duty.  1  trust that the request will not be seriously pressed. </para>

If we did trade with a 20 per cent, duty, why should we double the cost of these cheap articles to every poor woman ? I hope that honorable senators will take a reasonable view and will not allow their minds to be diverted from the real question by considerations of a White Australia policy, great as that may be, or by considerations of the possibility of introducing diseases from the countries in which this furniture is made. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators who first supported this request seem to me to have fallen into an error. When they urged this request as a means of protecting Australian labour from the cheap labour of the Straits Settlements they could not possibly have ascertained the countries from which wickerware has been imported, otherwise they could not have made such statements as they did. On page 637 of their report the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission give the imports of these articles and the countries from which they came. It must be remembered that we are not now dealing with the item of lounge-chairs and settees, which I believe do largely come from the Straits Settlements. We have fixed a duty of 45 per cent, on those articles, and I voted for its imposition because I recognise that they came largely from the Straits Settlements. We are now dealing with " Wickerware n.e.i." In 1904 - the last year for which any figures are given in this report - we imported wickerware to the value of £120,527, and one significant fact is that £101,000 worth, of this amount came from Great Britain, Germany, and the United States. The detailed figures are as follow: - The United Kingdom, £30,312 ; Canada, £584; Hong Kong, £3,184; India, £2,649; New Zealand, £384; Straits Settlements, £7,198; other British Possessions, £319 ; China, £469 ; Germany, £6,658 ; Japan, £3,047 ; Norway, £593 ; and the United States, £64,190. Out of a total importation of £120,527 worth, over £100,000 worth came from white-labour countries, and the greatest exporter to Australia was the United States, with £64,190 worth, as compared with japan,, which sent £3,047 worth, and China-, which sent only £469 worth. This shows that our chief competitor is not the cheap labour of the East, but the high-paid labour of the United States. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will read the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission he will find that they do not say so. They do say that lounges, settees, and chairs come largely from the Straits Settlements. But that is not an argument that ought to be used in connexion with a totally different item. We have already fixed the duty on those goods at  45  per cent. But that is no reason for imposing a duty of  45  per cent. on a totally different article. </para>

                        <para>- No; the item with which we are dealing is included in the figures which I have quoted, and the large imports which come from the Straits Settlements are, as I have already said, included in a totally different item, upon which we have already fixed a duty of  45  per cent. Not only is it a fact that our chief competitors are white labour and high- wage countries, but it is also a fact that Victoria was not only able to compete in this State itself under a  25  per cent, duty, but was able to export. On page  36  of the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission I find this statement - </para>

                        would make the Committee believe that the bulk of the imports came from countries' . where the conditions of labour are better than those observed in the East. It is perfectly true that he quoted correctly from the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, page  36.  But I am informed bv the Customs officials that the figures which he quoted referred to wickerware and woodware.

Returning to the imports, I find that in 1906 £[4,800 worth were imported ; in 1907 the imports were £.6,800 - a clear increase in wickerwork alone of £2,000 in one year. The fact that there was an increase of £[2,000 worth of imports in wickerwork alone is sufficient warrant' for an increased duty. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot fill us with any great degree of delight to see an increase in one year of £[2,000 worth of wickerware from the Straits Settlements, Japan, and China - work which our own people  can  do here. That increase of importation clearly indicates that the 20 per cent, duty was ineffective. I ask the Committee to place these articles on the same plane with chairs, lounges, and settees at a reasonable duty that will give our workmen a chance to supply our own requirements, and, if possible, to compete in foreign markets. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Committee will not be carried away by any special pleading with regard to this item, because if there is any item in the whole schedule which should appeal to every man who understands the facts and is animated by any humanitarian feelings at all, it is this. It deserves and should get the highest protection which Parliament can give it, because the industry covered by it provides the bulk of the employment for the unfortunate blind, deaf, and dumb people of Australia. Honorable senators may sneer and laugh, but that is a fact which there is no gainsaying. It is no laughing matter for the people who depend almost entirely on this industry to get ai living, not only in one, but in several of the States. It may seem extraordinary to people not acquainted with the facts that blind people should excel in making wickerware, but they make excellent frames for perambulators, and many other articles. This is one of the industries on which the blind mainly depend for profitable employment. Just outside Brisbane there is an institution largely subsidized by the Government for blind, deaf, and dumb people. They are taught a trade there. The two trades chiefly carried on are basket making and brush making. Mat making and one or two other occupations are also taken up. </para>

                    <para>. - For six years this industry has been working under a 20 per cent. duty. Another place has nearly doubled that rate in the first column, and increased it by 5 per cent, in the second. That ought to be sufficient . protection for any industry that is worth carrying on in Australia. There must be added to it the immense cost of freight, so that it becomes practically a prohibitive duty. It is perfectly true that this work is carried on by blind people. There is in my own State a fairly large establishment where work of this sort is done and which is able to dispose of the whole of its product without any difficulty. It is really beautiful work which any one might be proud to have in his house. I have purchased a good deal of it myself. Those people do not require any higher duty, and therefore there" is no necessity to impose the prohibitive rate now advocated. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen but for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> humanitarian appeal . in regard to the sufferings of the blind. I protest against statements of that sort being levelled against this side of the Chamber to influence us in our votes. We are all proud to know that there is a means by which the blind can put the senses which they have to so useful a purpose, but if honorable senators opposite will go to the blind establishments and purchase the goods that are made there, they will be doing them far more benefit than by attempting here to teach us how we should conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth in regard to those institutions. It is outrageous that such a prohibitive duty should be proposed, without the tiniest evidence in support of it. The whole argument for it centres round the fact that in one year there was an increase of £2,000 in the imports for the whole of Australia. But so far as we know the industry has been healthy for six years under a 20 per cent, duty, and the blind institutions have been carried on profitably. Not a single request has been made by those institutions for an increase of . duty, and there has been no statement from them that any such increase would assist them. If they did make such., an appeal to Parliament, I am sure that it would meet with a sympathetic reception, but to ask the Committee to increase the duty from 20 to 45 per cent, on the strength of such statements as we have just heard is almost a reflection on the sanity of members, who were not sent here to vote for such absurd and prohibitive rates. </para>

The reason given for the increase of this duty is in order to bring it into conformity with item 299, covering the bulk of our imports of furniture. When dealing with that item the Government asked us to agree to an increase of the duty on imports from the United Kingdom in order to bring it into conformity with item 306. . In another place <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne moved to reduce the duties on the item we are now discussing in order to bring it into conformity with item 299, but the Government themselves broke away from their proposal under item 299 and increased the duties attached to that item, because they said they wished to bring it into conformity with item 306. Now that we have reached item 304, we are asked to increase the duties on imports from the United Kingdom in order to bring the item into conformity with item 299, which the Government themselves endeavoured to raise.

                <para class="block">The moving of this request, if it serves no other purpose, will give the Government an opportunity to return to the path of consistency. Last Friday the representatives of the Government in the Senate thought fit to vote for a duty of 45 per cent, on chairs, lounges and settees. Why they have abandoned their attitude on that occasion is for them to say. It is not clear to me why they should to-day abandon a position they took up on Friday last. </para>

But we did not consider  that  it was necessary to subject " Basketware n.e.i." to the same rate as furniture. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that, although he has referred to the difference in the conditions of labour in the East and Australia, the column with which we are now dealing refers to imports from the United Kingdom. So far as I know, no one has suggested that " Basketware n.e.i." should be taxed at the same rate as furniture. </para>

I am not going to say .  that it cannot be made in Australia, because I know that it can; but I point out that within the space of fourteen days a sufficient number of wood rules of this description could be made to supply the local demand for the next eighteen months. No carpenter, joiner, of other mechanic would use a bevelled wood rule of this description for any trade purpose; but his child does. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> would best attain his object if he would move a request to amend this item by inserting the letters "n.e.i." after the words " Wood Rules," and afterwards, if he succeeded in getting a majority, a request to make this particular kind of rule free. The Tariff would then stand in regard to other rules just as it is. He must bear in mind that wood rules of greater length than the sample he has shown are imported. I presume that he would only want his request to apply to wood rules  1  foot long. </para>

                        <para>- Wood rules of greater length, as long as a yard I think, are imported, and many of them are used for advertising all kinds of articles. It would be unwise to allow such rules to come in duty free. I . observe that the sample rule which the honorable senator has handed to me was made in Germany. I do not know that we cannot make these articles satisfactorily in the Commonwealth. </para>

I am not saying that it is a desirable request, but that, I think, is the form in which it should be moved. </para>

I understand that these goods can be produced within the Commonwealth, and that it has been considered that a measure of protection should be afforded. As to Senator Chataway's remarks, the rulers dealt with in item  364b  are round rulers, and are different in character from the flat rules used for measurement purposes referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I do hot know whether these rules are being- manufactured in the Commonwealth at present. </para>

                <para>This is a subject about which I know something. If there" were any possibility of an industry for the making of these goods being established and profitably conducted I should not be -averse from giving it some protection. But,- as a matter of fact, practically the English-speaking world is supplied with wood type by Day and 'Collins, of London, and the Hamilton Wood Manufacturing Company, of America.. It would be an utter impossibility, for any man to establish a profitable business in this line in Australia. I have been in business for a great many years, and no one has ever called upon me to say that he was making wood type in Australia. But, of course, I have seen a . quantity of wood types made. </para>

I have seen excellent wood letters cut by apprentices employed by a well-known firm of printers in Melbourne. Some of the best artistic work seen on our hoardings is 'the result of printing done from wood type artistically drawn and cut in Victoria.

If this measure of protection be given, it is probable that somebody will embark in the industry, because there is an ever increasing demand for large wooden letters. Just as good a result is obtained from wooden type as from metal. I do not see how printers can be seriously handicapped, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> knows, in the very big establishments they can make their own large wood letters. </para>

                    <para>. - It is admitted that this is a purely. speculative duty, as there is no person carrying on the business in the Commonwealth, and the duty is to be imposed to encourage somebody to undertake it if possible. I appeal to the Committee not to impose a duty of that character. As I said previously, if there were a manufacturer here doing the work, I should be willing to give him some protection. The demand1 will be too small in Australia for many years to come for a man to lay down the necessary plant and produce these articles profitably. If that were not so, I would not oppose the duty. It is to be imposed in the hope that somebody by-and-by will take up the industry, but in the meantime the printer is to be unjustly penalized by being made to pay J55per cent, on some of his tools of trade. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not prepared to say that I altogether disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> remarks about wooden rules. I am under the impression that they are made in Australia. It not, they ought to be. If there is any difficulty in the matter, if is only a question of the timber of which they are made. It has to be wood of a particular varietv, but there should be nothing to prevent the obtaining of that, and then it would be a very small matter to manufacture wooden rules in the form in which printers use them. But the small and decreasing amount being used in the world makes it highly improbable that the industry of manufacturing wood type will ever be established in Australia in a form worth dignifying with the name of an industry. Many of us have had at different times to make shifts of one sort and another, but that is no reason why we should impose a heavy duty with the idea that it will compel a lot of those people who make shifts to join hands in the endeavour to establish the work as a permanent business. The printing trade is developing along lines which clearly show that the wood type is doomed almost to extinction. A lot of display and fancy type which,  ; i  short time ago was set by hand, is now set up by the machines. </para>

It is not reasonable to impose a duty of 35 per cent, in the case of an industry which is not established in Australia, and not likely to be except in the dim and distant future, when politicians sprout angels' wings, while a duty of only 20 per cent., to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> figures, is agreed to in the case of the metal-type industry already established in Sydney, which has every prospect of increasing, and of extending to other parts of Australia. To be logical, we should give the higher duty to the industry which is not only necessary, but established here, instead of to an industry which even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who has the greatest faith in the early establishment of trades so long as a duty is put upon imports, admits is not in existence in Australia yet, nor likely to be for a considerable time. </para>

To be consistent we should- impose a duty on wood type proportionate to the duties imposed on other manufactures of wood. </para>

If my request were accepted, the duty on cigar boxes containing cigars, would be 35 per cent., which would probably amount to 2d. or 2¼d. per box, and how is that duty to be passed on and added to the price of the cigar? How could any one spread the extra cost of 2d. over 100 cigars? </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the honorable senator's argument that his boxes have to be made out of taxed material. I wish to point out to honorable senators that the local manufacturers have an enormous protection,' and can easily afford to pay a trifling duty on the timber which they require for making their boxes. To upset all trade usages by adding to the enormous duty on cigars a small duty on the box is really carrying the idea of protection to such ultra lengths that we shall become more than a laughingstock to the universe. </para>

As a matter of fact, it is provided in the Tariff that where bottles containing goods which are the subject of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty are imported, the value of the  bottles  shall be added to the value of the contents, and the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty assessed on the total sum. Where bottles contain goods which are the subject of a specific duty or duty free, or which contain nothing, a specific duty of so much per dozen, according to their she, is levied on the bottles. The same applies to other containers in the forms of demijohns and vessels of larger capacity, so that in relation to other provisions in the Tariff there is nothing extraordinary about this proposition. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is confusing two different things. This request has nothing to do which the duty on cigars. It- simply proposes that the box containing cigars should be dutiable as an article made of wood. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has pointed out .is that the manufacturer of cigar-boxes imports certain classes of woods for that purpose, and that on such imports he has to pay a certain duty. Again, he may have the parts cut abroad and faced, and import them just ready for assembling. In that  case he has to pay at the rate of 2s. 6d. " per 100 feet super, face." On the other hand, as was represented to the Tariff Commission, quite a large number of boxes come annually into each State, and pay r.o duty, and in very many instances are used afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- If they come in empty they have to pay duty. If they are imported in parts to be assembled here, they are dutiable. But if they come in filled with cigars they do not pay duty, although the cigars do. Many cigar-boxes after they have been emptied have  been  turned to other uses here, to the great detriment of the local makers of cigar-boxes. In these circumstances, and seeing that it is more than probable that  already  they are covered by the provision for articles made of wood n.e.i., there is no reason why the Committee should not make  the matter absolutely certain by agreeing to this request. </para>

If the principle ' enunciated by the Minister is to take effect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> having succeeded in securing a duty on cigar-boxes, may seek to impose a duty on every  other small box used in our commerce.

I think that his request will fail to achieve his object. On the one hand we are taxing smokers very heavily, and, although the honorable senator says that a duty on the cigar-box cannot be passed on, I believe that it. will be passed on to the smoker. On the other hand, if a duty is imposed upon the box cigars will be imported in bundles. </para>

                    (TasmaniaMinister of Home Affairs) [10.55J. - The Government would like to retain the hern as it stands, that saddle-trees be made dutiable at the rate specified. Evidence was submitted to. the Tariff Commission on the subject, and one witness pointed out that one-fourth of the saddle-trees used in Australia were made locally, and that with adequate protection the whole of them could be made in the country.. The interests of Australia from a defence point of view also require that we should manufacture these things for ourselves. As to the form, of the request, if it is to be persisted in, I do not think that it is necessary to specify any saddle-trees in particular, but I hope that the Committee will adhere, to the item as it stands.

Prior to the introduction of the 1902 Tariff,, when saddle-trees were made free, there were four or  five firms manufacturing saddle-trees in Adelaide. But since that Tariff was passed those firms have disappeared. They are prepared to. commence again if we give them a duty. As the Minister has pointed out, from the point of view of defence it is important that we should manufacture everything of that description. </para>

                    <para>. - I was asked to take this matter up, but I see a difficulty in differentiating between the various kinds of saddle-trees. I am aware that the lighter kinds are sometimes made of iron. 'We have a great variety of woods, some of which are suitable for making saddle-trees, though we have not the lighter kinds in Australia except in small, quantities. In one sense a saddle-tree is a tool of the trade of a saddler. But whether that is a sufficient  argument for making the goods free I should not like to say. </para>
