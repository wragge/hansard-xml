                    <para>.- I feel sure that, the Committee will not accept the request which has been moved, and I think I should not have risen to speak at this stage were it not for the fact that on Friday afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> worked himself into a state of frenzy in an . effort to prove, from his point of view, that high duties mean increased burdens on the consumers. The facts and figures are against the honorable senator in respect of hats,  and of almost every other item in the schedule. Prior to the imposition of what might be considered protectionist duties in Victoria, imported hats of inferior quality, as compared with the locally-manufactured article, brought much higher prices than are being realised by imported hats of similar quality to-day. As a matter of fact, the establishment of the Denton Hat Mills at Abbotsford has led to an improvement in the quality of the hats sold to the public, and also to a considerable reduction in the price. Recently, in Western Australia, the importers, particularly of English hats, were asking for and receiving higher prices for their hats than they asked for or received for the same goods in Victoria, the reason being that there is no hat factory in Western Australia, whilst in Victoria the importers have a 'very important competitor in the Denton Hat Mills. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred to some remarks made in this Chamber by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, and I ask the honorable senator to listen for a moment to what I have to say with respect to the remarks quoted'. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood,. in the speech to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred, claimed that he was largely interested in the hat business in New Zealand, and that in that Colony the duties imposed on hats were much lower than those proposed in the Commonwealth Tariff, whilst the local industry there was in a flourishing state. According to the Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 8th May,1902, page12405, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood said - </para>

                <para>SenatorFINDLEY. - It was started, probably, in the belief that with the measure of protection represented by a duty of 221/2 per cent., it would be possible to establish a profitable business. But after the factory had been established only a short while, those interested in it were convinced that the duty was inadequate. Because of the insufficiency of the protection afforded, the factory had a struggling existence and remained for a period of only about six years. As a matter of fact, the inadequacy of the protection afforded by a duty of 221/2 per cent., absolutely killed the hat manu"facturing industry in New Zealand.

                    <para>The industrial dispute between the Otago Felt Hatters Union and the Felt Hat Manufacturers of Dunedin was proceeded with in the Arbitration Court at Dunedin. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> appeared for the D.H.M. Ltd., Ross and Glendenning, and the Otago Felt Hat Coy. (Messrs. Sargood's). <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Scott said "that this was a case which should never have been brought before the Court, and certainly not at the present time. Thousands of pounds had been spent and lost in endeavouring to develop the felt hat making industry, which should have been one of the foremost in the colony. That the industry had been disastrous to the employers was shown by the fact that the mill in Auckland had to be shut down. In Wellington he would be surprised to hear that there were three men engaged ; and in Dunedin, the largest factory (Messrs. Sargood's), had practically closed its doors, and of the other two mills one had never declared a dividend, and had not got anything like the number of men employed to-day they once had, and the other had not declared a dividend for three years. Fifty per cent. of the men who had been engaged in the trade had had to leave New Zealand. The Union had taken a time when the bottom had fallen out of the industry to come to the Court and endeavour to tie the employers down to rates of payment and conditions of labour that would only be justified were the business on a sound financial basis and thoroughly established." </para>

                <para class="block">This gentleman, who I assume was solicitor for the employers before the Arbitration Court, said, in effect, that if the business had been thoroughly established, and on a sound financial basis, there might have been more justification for the union hatters' application to the Court for better rates of payment and conditions of labour.

I shall not weary the Committee by going into figures and details in- connexion with this industry. It is sufficient for me to know that whilst it is in a better state to-day than perhaps was the case some years ago, there are numbers of hatters in Victoria and New South Wales who find only partial employment during each year, and at the same time Customs statistics and official figures prove that over a very considerable period  our importations of hats have been on the increase. I wish to cut. the importations down as much as <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> possibly .can. Personally I do not care how high are the duties we impose for the protection of this industry. From my point of view the higher they are the better and the greater . the advantages to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- There is a certain amount of truth in that. Owing to the small wages which the Italian workmen receive, and the long hours they work, those who are interested in the importation of such hats could land them in Australia cheaper than they could be manufactured in any one of the States. Anterior tq the establishment of hat factories in Australia, imported hats, notwithstanding these low conditions from a labour view point, were retailed at a higher price than is the case to-day. The absence of local competition always gave the importers a better opportunity of exacting a higher price from the wearers of hats than is. now the case when we have the competition of the local industry. Not only in this, but in connexion with every other protected industry, it can be shown conclusively that the establishment of local manufactures has had the effect of reducing the price of commodities, and has, in all cases, as far as I am aware, improved the quality of the goods. I know that the opinion which I hold in respect of these duties is shared by every protectionist in the Senate; and, for reasons which I have given, I do not care how high the duty is made. </para>

                    <para>. - I indicated on Friday that when the request now before the Committee was disposed of I should move to request the House of Representatives to add the words "or 35 Per cent., whichever returns the higher duty." Three or four objections have been raised to the proposal at present before us. First of all, the fixed duty has been objected to on the ground that it is inequitable, and also because it is applied to this item 'differently than to others. That there is no force in that objection can be seen . at once by referring to the schedule, in which there are quite a number of fixed duties. We have already passed duties per lb., duties per cental, and other forms of fixed duties. </para>

They do vary, though not, of course, in the ' degree that the quality  of hats varies. But the- argument that we are treating this item differently from others is not effective, because it is not correct. Fixed duties are not at all novel. In the United States of America, which may be said to be the pattern protectionist country of the world, fixed duties are the rule. It is an exception to see a variation from them; whilst fixed and ad valorem . duties together are very numerous. The same applies to France, and other protectionist countries. A fixed duty is pre-eminently a wise one from a protectionist point of view. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator likes. I see no offence in the term prohibition, as applied to goods which we can produce, and that are natural to us. It has been urged that this is a heavy tax upon the poorer classes of the community. In pursuance of that argument <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> on Friday, said that the duty 'had the effect of enabling the local manufacturer to charge for his goods as much as the importer charges, plus the duty. If that were so, his argument that this is a tax upon the poorer sections ot the community would have great force. But fortunately the facts disprove that statement. As I pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> just now, in response to his interjection, we had for some years in Victoria a duty of 3s. per hat, or 36s. per dozen. If his argument were correct, no Aus.tralianmade hats would have been sold except at a penny or two less than the importers would have sold them, plus the duty.  Certainly no Australian-made hats could have been sold for less than 3s. per hat if the duty were 3s. But as a matter of fact, during that period I myself bought Australian-made felt hats for my own boys for is. 6d. each. The regular price retail was is. 6d. each when the duty was 36s. per dozen. </para>

                        <para>- It was  not. I am pleased to be able to say that the hat industry in Victoria, and I believe in the rest o.f the States also, is the best paid industry in the Commonwealth. The . minimum wage for skilled hands is <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 7s. . 6d. a week. There is not- much sweating in that. Clearly these facts dispose of the assertion that the duty is added cn to the cost of the local product. But there is another and more striking instance of how the duty benefits the consumer. There is a hat that is, I suppose, very well known to most honorable senators. It is manufactured by Woodrow, the celebrated English maker, whose product is admitted to retain a high-class standard all over the world. In ' Victoria, before . the State Parliament imposed a duty of 3s., Woodrow hats' were1 retailed at 1 6s. each. ' If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> contends, the duty is added to 'the cost, those hats, with the imposition of that duty, should have been sold at 19s. each. As a matter- of fact, however, the duty developed the local production of a very excellent imitation of the Woodrow hat, which was sold at 10s. 6d. each, with the result that the price of the genuine Woodrow was reduced to 13s. No one pretended that the imitation was as good as the Woodrow hat. </para>

                        <para>- The competition was of such a character that the public purchased the locally-made hat, selling at 10s. 6d. each, in preference to the Woodrow hat, formerly sold at 16s., with the result that the importers were induced to sell the Woodrow hats at 13s. each, instead of 16s. each, as before. Instead of paying 1.6s. for his "Woodrow," the individual paid only 13s. for it,' and kept in his pocket 3s., which, but for the imposition of the duty, he would have had to pay. But that was not the only advantage that he reaped. After making such a purchase at a shop he left with the knowledge that the importer had paid into the revenue 3s. to help to carry on the government of the State. Thus every Woodrow hat sold at 13s., within a week or two after the imposition of the duty, benefited Victoria to  the extent of 3s. - it meant 3s.' less out of the pocket of the purchaser, and 3s. paid into the revenue. Those who are considering the poor consumer ought to be delighted to know that a fixed duty of 3s. had the effect of benefiting the consumer directly to the extent of 3s. per hat, and of benefiting him and other consumers indirectly to the extent of 3s. - the amount paid into the revenue in respect of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The Customs officer simply charges on the number. If the fixed duty is applied in relation to weight, he simply weighs the goods; if it is applied in respect of measurement, he measures the goods and charges according to their measurement.' Obviously, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will reply, " In these circumstances we do not want a duty of 3s. on hats selling at is. 6d. .If the local industry can make hats in competition with imported hats, why is such a duty necessary ? . If the local manufacturers do not want to raise prices, why do they want it?" My reply is that in the production of a profit, an extended market is far more important than are high prices. We have often .known business men who appeared to be, so to speak, " on their last legs." Although they were charging high prices their business has appeared to be vanishing.  Suddenly they have commenced to advertise what they declared to be alarming sacrifices, and have . thus drawn crowds to their shops, and, as the result of low prices, have put themselves on their feet once. more. What is wanted to insure success is not necessarily high prices, but a large market, and completely effective protection secures a large market to the local manufacturer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proved on Friday that- the hat trade of Australia is extending. We are delighted that it is, but we must not forget at the same time that  the imports are increasing, so that the expansion of the local industry is not as large as it ought to be. The trade of an industry of this kind ought to. embrace the whole of the Commonwealth. We produce the wool and the fur required in the production of hats, and we have workmen as skilled as are .to be found elsewhere. That being so, the hat industry of all others ought to be absolutely our own. </para>

                        <para>- I was dealing with the question, "If you do not want to raise prices, why do you want this duty? " Let me give a simple illustration of the point that I have in view. Let us  assume that a hat manufacturer is turning out every week 1,000 hats at. a profit of 6d. each. That gives him a weekly profit of ^25, which may not be sufficient for the maintenance of his whole establishment. His factory may be running half time, or be working at half its capacity. If he can enlarge his market, and sell 2,000 hats per week without charging an additional price, he has a weekly profit of ^50 instead of .£25, and that may be sufficient for his requirements. If his  factory is running at half time, or at half its capacity, and he is able to double his output, he also reduces the cost over the whole area. If, for the sake of argument, when his factory was working at half its capacity, his interest on capital, buildings and managerial expenses represented <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> per hat, by enlarging his output to  2,000,  he would reduce the cost by  3d.,  and by having obtained twice as large a market as he had before, he would secure twice as great a profit. </para>

                        <para>- I say that by means of a duty which gives him the whole market, so far from having to raise prices in order to get a larger profit he can reduce prices by  3d.  per hat, and thus give to the public£25 per week in the shape of savings on the hats which they purchase, whilst at the same time doubling his profit. That illustration is so simple that any person can grasp it. I may not have used the exact figures applying to the hat business or any other industry, but the illustration completely shows the principle that operates to reduce cost, and thereby increase profits, and render possible a reduction of prices to the people. The hat industry in Australia has already achieved three very desirable results. In the first place it has provided a considerable amount of employment at extremely liberal wages. All will admit that that is a very desirable thing. The industry has also returned substantial profits to the manufacturers. Surely that is not a bad thing so long as the hats which they produce do not cost the public too much. The Denton Mills, which are the most successful hat mills in Australia, have generally paid dividends of  10  per cent. Their last dividend was only 8 per cent., but, roughly speaking, they have returned to their shareholders  10  per cent. upon the capital which they have invested. Surely that is not an exorbitant profit. But what profits are the importers getting? Only the other day I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Draper,</inline> a journal which is published in the interests of the softgoods trade, that Messrs. Buckley and Nunn had paid their shareholders a dividend of  10  per cent., had granted their employes a bonus of  21/2  per cent., and had placed a sum of£30,000 or£40,000 to the credit of their reserve fund. At a meeting held at Finsbury recently, Messrs. Robert Reid and Company also declared a dividend of  10  per cent., voted a bonus of21/2 per cent. to their employes, and carried forward an enormous amount to their reserve fund. </para>

The duty originally proposed by the Treasurer was an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, but at a later stage a fixed duty was substituted. Now, as the result of the arguments urged by honorable senators upon this side of the chamber, the Government pro pose, to some extent, to climb down. They ought to climb down entirely, because, not-" withstanding the specious plea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who is a most persistent and able advocate of protection, the fixed duty will, under some conditions, be highly oppressive to the man who can afford to buy only cheap hats, and much less oppressive to the man who can afford to purchase the best hats. There may be conditions of local competition under which, even with a high duty, hats would be much cheaper than the duty imposed, but the history of manufacturing throughout the world shows that those conditions are very exceptional, and that, as a rule, the price of goods in protected markets tends to rise gradually right up to the level of the duty.

If we were merely to speak to one another, many of us could afford not to speak at all. We wish the public to be clearly informed as to who is responsible for this utterly unjustifiable taxation. I have taken out other striking figures with regard to the progress of the hat industry. I do not know that they will do much to convince the leader of the Labour Party, or the Government, but -it is as well " that they should be published, because they make the position remarkably clear. .There is no answer to them. There is no answer to the position as it has been laid down, from this side, so ably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> except the off chance which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has indicated, that severe competition amongst the local manufacturers may reduce prices to below the level at which the importer can sell. But now-a-days, when manufacturers are concentrating their operations as well as their capital, it is not likely that the hat makers of Victoria will suddenly become, in the case of cheap hats, a set of inspired philanthropists, manufacturing hats only for the good of the people. They will not enlarge their capital for the manufacture of cheap hats simply to benefit the public. Does any one think that they will not consider how much they can make out of the public by every variety of hat, cheap or dear? </para>

                        <para>- There is every incentive under high duties to form a combine. With duties amounting practically to  200  per cent, upon cheap lines, the temptation to the hat makers to form combines in order to keep up prices is almost irresistible. They always have the high wall of duty to lean against. With high duties, the large capitalist with the command of the market can crush out any small  man who sets up against him. With low duties the small man has a chance, but with a high wall of protection the big man fires at the consumer with a double-barrelled gun. He puts up his prices to the level of the duty, and can crush out any other manufacturer who tries to lower prices. Before Federation, Victoria exported to the other States only  £603  worth of felt hats. I take these figures from the report of the Tariff Commission, as given by a witness, who quoted the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year-Book</inline> as his authority. .In  1903,  Victoria exported to the other States  £28.000  worth of hats, and in  1964 £32,270  worth. Before Federation, in  1899,  there were in Victoria, according to the reports of the Inspector of Factories, thirty-three hat mills in operation. In  1905,  the number had fallen to twenty-seven, but whereas in  1899  there were only  896  hands engaged in the ' industry, there were  1,047  hands employed in  1905.  A similar tale of progress in the hat industry is told in New South Wales. In that State, in  1901,  just before the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff, there were ten hat factories. In  '1904  there were eighteen - an increase of nearly  100  per cent, under the operation of the Tariff of  1902.  In that State, in  1901,  there were  330  hands employed in the hat factories ; in  1904  there were  729.  In  1901  the value of the plant and machinery was  £7, 034;.  in  1906  it had risen to  .£26,117.  New South Wales produced in  1901 £54,698  worth of hats, and in  1904, £95,442  worth. The wages from  1901  to  1904  increased from  £15,055  to  £29,496  - that is in thr.ee years.. The Queensland industry, consequent upon the Commonwealth Tariff, and the competition of New South Wales and Victoria, had been temporarily damaged, but, when things had settled down, it recovered to such an extent that it is now in a fairly healthy condition. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Queensland manufacturers, who were in the weakest position, set to work, when matters settled down under the  1902  Tariff, to work up their industry  and have, as I say, in a measure succeeded in doing so. In  1899,  there were in Queensland three factories, with only twenty-seven hands, and  £5,290  worth of plant, whereas in  1904,  after an interval of five years, there were six factories, with  128  hands - an increase, of over  400  per cent.- and plant worth  £12,621,  representing an advance of considerably over  200  per cent. The Victorian hat mills, of which those of the Denton Proprietary are the most striking example, have done so well that in  1907  they could not supply the market; and in this connexion I shall read a copy of a letter which was quoted in another place. A. M. Kirkland Limited, of Brisbane, wrote to the Denton Proprietary in  1907,  asking for a' quotation, and received a reply, the date of which I am not able to give, but which is as follows - </para>

                <para class="block">If that has been the result of the Tariff on the hat industry of Victoria, it becomes at once apparent that the factories are working to their full power, that there is machinery enough to supply gradually the whole market of Australia, and that, under ordinary circumstances, they are likely to be confronted with competition by means of which prices may be kept down. But if we raise the duty as proposed, and the Victorian mills are not able to supply the market - and probably the same conditions prevail in New South Wales - then the market is absolutely at the mercy of the manufacturers. If the Denton Proprietary and Messrs. Anderson, as has been incontestably shown, cannot supply the Australian market, what becomes of the chances of purchasers of Australian hats? Although, as an incidental fact of high protection, the consumer may, for a time, get a cheaper hat, the chances are ninety-nine to one against such a result. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and they clamour for more and more protection. If the Denton Hat Proprietary, which is probably the most successful in Victoria, and possesses the largest plant, were dissatisfied with the Tariff of 1902, why did they not straightforwardly tell the Tariff Commission so? There is nothing but conjecture as to the reason why this higher duty is proposed. Is it a sort of sop to the Denton Proprietary? On these points we ought to have an explanation from the Government. Why should the Tariff be changed from the original form in which it was introduced by the Treasurer? How is it that the Government, forced to some extent by the criticisms from this side, have offered to meet us half way ? Why should they not come the full way ? An <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, at whatever rate, would be just as powerful an aid to the manufacturers as would a fixed duty. I hope the Government will abandon the fixed duties, and follow the example of the Treasurer who, wisely advised by his officials, made the imposts <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that there are three bases upon which duties may be fixed, an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, a fixed duty, or a composite duty. It must, therefore, be competent for honorable senators to propose three separate forms of requests in respect of each item according to the form of duty sought to be imposed. The Committee in this instance has dealt with a proposal for an <inline font-style="italic">ad valoremduty,</inline> and it is therefore competent for requests still to be made for a composite or a fixed duty. I therefore rule the request in order. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the raw materials required in the hat manufacturing industry include pull-over hoods, velvet, plush, galoons, and hatter's calico. In the circumstances, I ask why some of these raw materials should have to pay this enormous* duty of 35 per cent. under paragraph  d  of item 121? I made some inquiries in Sydney on the subject, and, although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne said that pull-over hoods can be made in the Commonwealth, the hatters assured me that they could not, and the suggestion was made that they should be included in the free list. </para>

                        <para>- It is my intention to suggest that there should be an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, with an alternative duty - 35 per cent. or 7 s. per dozen - on imports under the General Tariff, and 20 per cent. or 6s. per dozen on imports from the United Kingdom. The reason why I move in this direction is that the industry of manufacturing sewn hats and caps has not been upon a satisfactory footing under the old Tariff. The importations have been going up by leaps and bounds. In 1903 the imports of hats and caps were valued at £8,200; in 1904, £11,000; in 1905, £21,900; and in 1906, £29,500. The figures indicate that the measure of protection that this industry has received in the past has been most unsatisfactory. My purpose is to single it out for special treatment. I do not propose to alter the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, but I do propose to institute a fixed duty against the foreigner of 7s. per dozen, and against Great Britain of 6s. per dozen. It may be noticed from the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission that a variety of shoddy hats and caps is imported from the Old Country. One witness named Borchardt stated that they could be imported for1s.9d. per dozen, and. that the charges, ashe calculated, amountedto221/2percent. He said that these, hats and caps were sold in Australia for 3s. 6d.  a dozen!  So that the principle obstacle in the way of that manufacturing in the Commonwealth in the past has been the . easy access which these cheap low-class hats and caps have had to our markets.I wish to give effective protection to the people engaged in the industry. The makers of apparel under this Tariff are getting a difference of 10 per cent. between the raw material and the manufactured article. That has been agreed to under items 106 and 107. But in this item, as it stands, the protection is only 5 per cent. Why make a distinction between those engaged in making sewn hats and caps, and those who are making other forms of apparel ? </para>

                        <para>- Some materials that are used in the manufacture of hats and caps  are  not made in Great Britain at all. Felt cloth, which is a favorite material for cap-making in Australia, is made entirely in Germany. At present it pays 30 per cent. So that the manufacturer of caps from felt in Australia has to pay 30 per cent. on his raw material whilst the manufactured article pays only 30 per cent. Practically he is given no protection at all. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no difficulty in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> request, because there can be no doubt that we have a very large sewn hat and cap industry in Australia, and there is equally no doubt that there is imported a large quantity of inferior caps,whicharesoldindirectcompetitionwithourown.Firstofall,Icertainly am desirous of having our caps made out of our own wool. But the fact has to be reckoned with that a considerable portion of the caps used in Australia are made our of imported material. Various classes of persons require various classes of caps. Consequently the manufacturers cannot supply the whole demand simply by making caps out of our wool, but they should be encouraged to make as large a proportion as possible of Australian material. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> proposal they will be encouraged to do what I have described as desirable. We have to reckon with the facts that a large quantity of these cheap hats are imported, that the cap industry is thoroughly well established, and should' essentially- belong to this country, and that we are quite capable of making the whole of the caps required in this country. The importations in 1906 were no less than £29,000. ' Is there any just reason why we should not make the whole of these caps here? For the very same reason that weighed with me in supporting the fixed duties on hats of 16s. and 12s. per dozen, I feel no difficulty whatever in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> proposal. </para>

                        <para>- Upon my word, some protectionists seem to have got into the habit of thinking that so long as there is a single import it is necessary to impose a higher duty. Of course there are imports. But the Minister did not go further and tell the' Committee that, while the imports in 1906 amounted to £29,000, there had been a very large expansion of local manufacturing, and that, as a matter of fact, the increase in the output of the manufacturers was greater than the increase of imports. Does the Minister  suppose that it is possible to establish industries in a day, so that the local manufacturers will be able to overtake the whole of the demands of the country at once? So far as this industry is concerned, the fact is that whilst the imports only increased 15 per cent. the output from the factories increased by 85 per cent. Those figures show that though the imports may be considerable the local manufacture is increasing at a much more rapid rate. The local factories are overtaking the local demands, so that there is not only no reason but no common sense in the proposal to place a higher duty upon these articles. Let protectionists say what they like, it must be obvious to everyone who has to buy anything that duties do not reduce prices. Another remark made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, which struck me as unusual, coming from that side of the Committee, was that the manufacturers of these commodities used imported materials. The answer to that ought to be that the duties on those other good's should compel the manufacturers of hats and caps, who are securing a large measure of protection, to use the local productions. If they do so they have no duty to pay. If there is any man for whom I have a wholesale contempt it is the individual who asks for a high measure of protection and at the same time objects to. protection being granted to those who produce his raw material.I have an utter contempt . for the man who asks that the duty on his raw material shall be cut down, whilst at the same time he demand's increased duties in respect of his own productions. If there is anything in the contention of protectionists that duties do not raise prices the cost of the raw material cannot be great, and it they compel people to use local productions, the hat manufacturers need not buy any imported material. They can buy everything they want from the local manufacturers, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and. those who think with him, they will not have anything added as the result of the duty to the cost of their material. Under the Tariff, as it stands, the makers of these goods are protected to the extent of 35 per cent. . That, I think, is more than sufficient, and I shall therefore vote against this request. </para>

                    <para>. - The Committee a short time ago agreed to a request to increase the protection to the makers of hats, and I think that that decision should be followed by a request that increased protection be granted to the makers of sewn caps. I would go so far with my honorable colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> as to support a proposal for fixed duties of 7 s. and 6s. per dozen ; but I would not vote for the latter part of his request relating to the imposition of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. No <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty could be made high enough to protect the sewn-cap industry here. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer a fixed duty, because the Customs returns clearly show that our imports are increasing. . Under the old Tariff, they increased from year to year, and we find that this industry has been going down. The number of hands employed in it has not increased, and in some of the factories to-day machines are standing idle whilst the shoddy material of other parts is being dumped on the Australian market.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has put very fully before the Committee the case for his proposal, and I rose only to say that. I should support the request for fixed duties, provided he did not press that part of his proposal relating to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I was altogether opposed to the imposition of fixed duties on the hats and caps dealt with in the several paragraphs of this item. I should have preferred to support a request for a duty of 40 per cent, rather than a fixed duty, which, I think, presses heavily on the articles used by the poorer classes. The Committee, however, has adopted the principle of fixed duties, and I, therefore, feel bound to vote for this request that fair protection should be given to the industry. Having decided to request that fixed duties be imposed in respect of the larger items dealt with in paragraphs a and is, I think we might fairly make a similar request in respect of the very small items of caps. </para>

                    <para>.- When in Sydney yesterday, I interviewed two hat manufacturers and two importers of hats, and the evidence I gathered was that an increased duty was unnecessary. We have, in this case, a repetition of the old, old story of a Ministry with a majority behind it prepared to pass an ultra-protectionist Tariff, which, I am confident, will be prejudicial to the Commonwealth. I venture to say that our industries will not flourish under this Tariff as they did under the Tariff of 1902. The more I study the question, the more convinced I am that, except in regard to a few -anomalies, there was absolutely no reason for amending the old Tariff. We are now working in the direction of considering only those who deluge honorable senators with circulars and indulge in lobbying with the desire to secure increased duties. The evidence which I obtained in Sydney yesterday was that the present duty of 30 per cent., which amounts really to 33 per cent., is sufficient to protect the industry. The progress of the Denton Hat Mills, the dividends which they have paid, and the capital they have accumulated, go to show that the old Tariff was more than sufficient to protect the industry. No representative of the Denton Hat Mills Company appeared before the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>- But, sir, the item also covers hats. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said that, probably, he had conversed with- representatives of the Denton Hat Mills after I had seen them. It would appear that the has been conferring with them in regard to these duties. They did not dare to go before the Tariff Commission, or to produce their books to it; they have gone to Ministers and others, and worked behind the back of Parliament to secure what they were afraid to urge before the Tariff Commission. I give the protectionists of Victoria credit for honor and integrity of purpose, but I think that the system of protection is a rotten one. It breeds men who do not speak the truth, who deceive and mislead- themselves, and, therefore, mislead others. </para>

                        <para>- They do not. They show that with an increased population, and with magnificent seasons during the last three or four years, our imports of these goods have slightly increased. Had we experienced bad seasons, I feel sure that our imports would have decreased. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> however, can see nothing in the world save protection. If one were to put before him a mountain of gold and a claim for protection, which almost required microscopic examination, he would miss the gold, and see the other almost at a glance. A protectionist friend of mine said the other day that it was nonsense to dogmatize about these matters; that good seasons would vary the Customs returns apart altogether from the duties which we impose. Even if our imports have slightly increased, the output of our mills has greatly increased, showing that the protection given under the old Tariff must have been sufficient; that the industry has been firmly established, and is making substantial progress. What more do we want? I understood the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in submitting this Bill to the Senate, to say that he hoped we should agree to the imposition of such protective duties as would make good the difference between wages here and elsewhere, with a trifle to spare. We now find the Government availing themselves of every opportunity to induce honorable senators to increase the duties in the schedule. I hope that another place will not agree to one request that, has been made for an increased duty, because the evidence shows that nothing is wanting to protect and stimulate our industries. I have been told that there are anomalies in this Tariff, and that the raw material of the manufacturer is being very heavily taxed. </para>

                        <para>- I was told in Sydney that pull-over hoods were not made in Australia, although I must admit that I thought we ought to be able to make them. I wish now to refer to another matter which is dealt with in the report of the Tariff Commission. I allude to the fact that the Government are proposing protective duties sufficiently high to establish our hat and cap manufactories, and to enable them to distribute their goods only through the medium of merchants and retailers, who secure a profit of from  25  to 33&amp; per cent. I have no quarrel with the middleman. I make use of him every day of my life ; but, at the same time, I think I may fairly ask whether we are justified in imposing protective duties so high as to enable our manufacturers not only to do well themselves, but to say that the retailer shall purchase their goods only through the agency of a merchant - that the merchant shall obtain out of them a profit of from  25  to  33  J per cent., that the retailer shall secure a further profit of  25  per cent., and that the consumer should bear the whole burden. The Denton Hat Mills Company has declined to sell any hats - to supply even an order for fifty or  100  dozen - direct to a retailer. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that the present duties enable this to be done. I did not think that the retailer could purchase half-a-dozen or even a dozen hats direct from any of our mills, but I certainly believed that he would be able to buy five dozen, ten dozen, or fifty dozen direct from them. I am told that both .in Sydney and Melbourne such a thing is impossible.  If a retailer endeavoured to place an order with Anderson's mills he would be told at once that every parcel must go through York-street. These facts show .the enormous extent to which our protective duties have been worked up ; that they have been raised to a point far in excess of what is necessary, to make the hat and cap industry a progressive one. However, the numbers appear to be up, and it is therefore useless for me to further occupy the time of' the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- This is one of those items in regard to which there is a decided anomaly in the Tariff. The articles specified in it are dutiable at 20 per cent., and there has been a considerable increase in the imposts levied upon the raw materials used in their manufacture. Consequently the manufacturer has no margin upon which to work. It is true that a request has been carried to reduce the duty upon silk from 20 per cent. to 15 per cent., but I would point out that as bands and buttons are dutiable at 20 per cent., leathers at 25 per cent., and sticks valued at more than 7s. 6d. each at 25 per cent., it is clearly necessary to slightly increase the rate upon this item. The industry is an excellent one; it affords employment to a large number of young girls, and, therefore, we ought to encourage it. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has anticipated me in the request which he has moved, but I scarcely think that he has gone far enough. There are 400 employes engaged in this industry, and the annual wage bill totals £18,000. The duties levied upon the raw materials of the industry range from 20 to 25 per cent. In 1905, the imports of parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas were valued at £17,000, and in 1906, at £14,000. Seeing that we have increased the duties levied upon the raw materials of these articles, I scarcely think that the additional 5 per cent. protection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> proposes to extend to the industry will prove sufficient. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- We have done nothing of the kind. As a matter of fact, instead of having increased the duties upon those raw materials, we have carried a request to decrease them. Consequently there is no necessity either for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> amendment or for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> request. Even the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of only 20 per cent., and I cannot understand why we should increase taxation without some reason being assigned for our action. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> make out a good case for a larger measure of protection being extended to this industry ? Certainly not. If it were merely a question of whether any duty should be levied upon this item. I admit that his arguments would stand. But that is not the point. The point is whether 20 per cent. affords the industry a sufficient measure of protection ? Personally, I think that it does. </para>

                    <para>. - I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> the wisdom of withdrawing his amendment, which he evidently moved under a misapprehension. It is quite true that some umbrellas are made from silk and some from cotton. If they are made from silk, the raw material is dutiable at 15 per cent. If they are made from cotton, the cotton is admitted free. As a matter of fact, the majority of umbrellas are made from silk, and, as the Committee have decided to request the other Chamber to reduce the duties upon silk to 15 per cent. under the general Tariff, and to 10 per cent. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom, our umbrella manufacturers will have a clear margin of 10 per cent. As that is the mar-' gin which has been recognised in other items between the duties levied upon the raw materials and those imposed upon the made-up fabrics, I would suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> should withdraw his amendment and support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> request. </para>

There has been established in Victoria for a considerable time an industry turning out wadding and cotton wool. The firm, which is located at South Melbourne, is not wholly and solely engaged in turning out these articles, but is manufacturing them in a general way, at a price which has caused them to meet with a fairly  ready  sale in certain parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is unfair. This is an industry that ought to be assisted. I am reliably informed that the firm have for a considerable time utilized Queensland-grown cotton, and if they were assisted by the measure of protection asked for they would use ' Queensland cotton more extensively than is the case now. It is well-nigh impossible for the industry to be carried on if wadding and cotton wool can be imported free. .Every other industry in Australia rightly claims to be protected against free imports. The firm have to pay 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> on the gelatine which they use in their manufacture. They do not complain of that. They say they have to pay that duty because up to the present the particular kind of gelatine which they use ls not made in Australia. This item will not in any way affect medicated wool, which will still come in free under item 442. The firm, according to their own statements, have expended considerable sums in their endeavours to build up the industry, have paid and are paying reasonable wages, and have observed fail conditions of labour. But because of what they consider the unfair competition, caused by the absolute free admission of commodities, their business is being seriously affected. On this ground they ask for a small measure of protection in order that they may extend the industry, give further employment, find a larger market, and enable wadding to be provided for charitable institutions at probably a smaller cost than at present. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to urge, by accepting the proposal submitted, that further protection may be given to this industry, because, where an industry can be protected, it is our duty to protect it. In this case the original proposal of the Government was on all fours with that now suggested ; and the reason is that we know that wadding and cotton wool are manufactured within the Commonwealth. It is true that the production of this one factory is represented by only £3,500, whereas the total consumption in Australia is represented by something like £60,000. </para>

The firm already mentioned uses, as far as possible, a portion of the cotton produced in Queensland. We have decided to grant bounties for cotton cultivation; and what can be more reasonable or natural than to encourage an industry which proposes to utilize the raw material ? </para>

                        <para>- They proposed to bulk this, with a great many other items, under a duty of 10 per cent., items which the honorable senator has assisted to make dutiable at 35 per cent. I protest against this reckless increasing of the duties in a Tariff already sufficiently high. We have now had three attempts to increase duties beyond the Tariff as it reached this Chamber. It would not be- so serious if these fresh proposals were listened to by a reasonable proportion of honorable senators and discussed on their merits ; but the Committee is reduced to the condition that, no matter what the proposal is, so long as it involves an increase there are honorable senators prepared to come in and vote for it. Without rhyme or reason certain honorable senators have made up their minds to vote blindly for all increases, and if every free-trader in the Chamber walked out, we should be justified in doing so. </para>

If the free-traders did leave the Chamber there would be one of the biggest Kilkenny fights amongst the protectionists themselves. The free-trade senators believe that the Tariff should be kept within reasonable bounds, and all we can do in the face of tactics, the object of which is to make the Tariff even more protectionist than it is - in the face of a great dereliction of duty committed by those who vote for increases without hearing reasons - is simply to enter a protest and vote the contrary. </para>

Honorable senators on this side have beer* twitted with voting blindly, but it is a noteworthy fact that honorable senators opposite have been much more conspicuous by their absence. The benches on the freetrade side of the Chamber are almost empty, and yet honorable senators are found to come in and vote for a decrease in the duties every time. </para>

The Victorian woollen mills supply an ample market for all the cotton grown in Queensland. Speaking from memory, I believe that these mills purchase annually about 1,250,000 lbs. of cotton. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the analyses did show that, following the pernicious example of their older brethren, even the New South Wales mills were beginning to use cotton in the manufacture of their so-called woollens. But there can be no doubt, that the analyses made under the auspices of the Department showed conclusively that the big consumers of cotton were Victorian wool manufacturers. That should offer every guarantee to any one wishing to grow cotton in Queensland that, there is a ready market for it at his own doors, and the cotton-grower can always tell the woollen manufacturer that there is no need for him to face the enormous cost of sending Queensland cotton to England and fetching, it back in a manufactured form, and to be fleeced by half-a-dozen middlemen. He can buy direct from the cotton-growers in .Queensland, and so save all intermediate expenses. That being so, what particular necessity is there to put a higher duty on COttOn in this form than that which was recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission ? </para>

                        <para>- From the honorable senator's point of view, many of them are useless even when they are, inasmuch as they do not keep out all imports. The statement that £60,000 worth of the goods which come in under this head are used in Australia  is a pure assumption. ' There are no definite figures available. All that has been obtained has been an estimate made in respect of other items that represent £60,000 in value. If the officers of the Department were in a position to speak with any definiteness, they would have left a blank in the. column. It must be obvious that the thing was so indefinite that in preparing the document -they hesitated to give any figures. It is apparently only under the pressure of this debate, and probably a request for information, that they have put forward an estimate. Therefore. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has no right to speak of there being a local market for ,£60,000 worth of this material. </para>

                    <para>- - At the suggestion of an honorable senator sitting on the back bench opposite the Government propose to increase a duty. In my last speech I pointed out that again  the Senate had been asked, at the suggestion I think of private members of the other House, and, possibly, of private senators, to increase a duty. This is the first occasion when I have known a revising Chamber to ask for higher duties than have bEen agreed to by the people's representatives. </para>

                        <para>- It may be a reform. But I wish to accentuate the fact that when the Government cannot extract in the other House every sovereign out of the people they come here and, not on their own initiative but at the suggestion of honorable senators sitting "behind them, asked for higher duties. Last week, this week, and probably until the end of the chapter, the Government will come here and ask for more and more taxation, although the House of Representatives was quite satisfied with the duties contained in the schedule. On this item I take the opportunity of pointing out what I think ought to be emphasized. Although the House of Representatives, which is more directly responsible to the people than we are for imposing a- burden of taxation, has stated distinctly by large majorities that it was satisfied with the duties, yet the Government come down here and say, " We are not satisfied with the decision of the other House. The constitution of the Senate is such that, notwithstanding the fact that we are an indiscriminate force of two and a-half, we can rely upon those who profess to represent the workers, and call themselves Socialists, to screw more taxation out of the people." On a previous item I pointed" out in strong terms that, relying upon the votes of the Socialists, the Government were asking for higher duties. But I recognise that a speech, no matter how strong and reasonable it may be, is not likely to influence the vote of a single senator. The Tariff has now reached a very critical position. Through the forbearance of honorable senators on this side items have been allowed to pass which probably ought' to have met with stronger opposition. </para>

                        <para>- The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 10 per cent, on this item, and I am not satisfied with the reasons which the Government have given for asking us suddenly to double it. It illustrates a most important fact, and that is that the Senate is now being asked by the Government to carry the Tariff beyond the wish of the other House, and probably to bring it into accord with their own original intention, in order to screw out of the people every cent they can possibly get.

                    <para>. - I do not see eye to eye with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator bt.</inline> Ledger, and I propose to support the request, and I do so on the same grounds as I gave when I endeavoured to get the duty on cotton seed restored. First of all we gave a bounty upon the production of raw .cotton. I supported that proposal, and I have every reason to believe that the cotton industry will be a large and important one in Australia. When we reached the item of cotton-piece goods we promptly made them free. Next we came to two items dealing with cotton seed. In an ingenious sort of way the Government put a duty of 4s. per cental on cotton seed in one line and took it off in the next line by allowing the article free admission when imported for the manufacture of cottonseed cake and denaturated  cotton-seed oil. Now we have come to the item of cotton wool. This is the one ewe lamb which is left for the cotton industry, and I intend to support the request that the duty be restored. I have received a copy of a telegram which was sent by the Queensland Government to the Prime Minister, and in which they urged that the reconsideration of the cotton duties should be taken in hand, and that some protection should be given to the cotton industry of the State. </para>

                    <para>. - Although the Treasurer in the House of Representatives allowed this item to be free, the Vice-President of the Executive Council has announced that he intends to vote for the rate of duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> As there is a difference of opinion on the part of Queensland representatives on' the subject, I wish to know exactly how things stand. I feel that I cannot logically vote for fair duties in all cases where my State is not specially interested, and' vote for very high duties whenever Queensland interests are affected. I do not profess to have much knowledge of the cotton industry, but I wish to do what is right by the State which I represent and by the Commonwealth at large. My honorable colleague cannot be a more ardent protectionist than the Treasurer, who allowed the item to be made free; yet he, as well as Ministers, is going to support a rate twice as high as that recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, namely, 10 per cent. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> proposed a duty of 50 per cent., I, as a Queensland representative, would have been strongly tempted to vote for it in the interests of my State; but I have hitherto endeavoured to vote for what I thought fair compromises between the proposals of protectionists - or, more properly speaking, prohibitionists - and those of free-traders. </para>

                        <para>- The increase, if it benefits any State, will benefit Queensland chiefly ; but it seems to me that I should be inconsistent in voting for a high duty solely in the interests of my State, without regard to the welfare of the Commonwealth generally. Since the Vice-President of the Executive Council is not following the Treasurer, in this matter, he should give us reasons for what he intends to do. Usually when Tariffs are being considered it is the Government that take the responsibility for increases of duty ; and surely reasons should be given by Ministers when they leave it to supporters to move, instead of submitting straightforward proposals of their own, to explain their action. In this instance, the taxpayers are concerned to the extent of ^64,000. </para>

I am not quarrelling with the honorable senator for that, but I say that what is taking place in the Committee at the present time is an advertisement to manufacturers throughout Australia that if any of them desire the imposition of a duty upon any article not already taxed, or the increase of a duty, all they have to do is to interview a private member of the Senate, and get him to undertake the responsibility of proposing a duty or an increase of duty, and they will be able to rely upon the support of the Government for the proposal, whilst the majority of the Committee will readily swallow it whatever it is. </para>

But what has taken place here to-day shows that it is only necessary for any manufacturer to  get the ear of a private member of the Senate to secure the imposition of a new duty or the increase of one already imposed, because it is idle to say that in this matter there has been any attempt to make a thorough and impartial investigation into the conditions of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. If they had done so, the chances are that the article would not have been put on the free list. What is happening now has happened before, and when a manufacturer has prevailed upon some private member to move a request of this kind,itisimmediately approved by the Government and a majority of the Committee proceeds to swallow it. It would not be so bad if there had been any investigation, but it cannot be contended for a moment that there has been any examination of this industry, and yet we are asked, with our eyes open, to deliberately tear up the report of the Tariff Commission. I say with all respect to those who differ from me that in this matter the Committee, in my opinion, is not discharging the duty which devolves upon it. </para>

                    <para>. - I think I am correct in saying that the Tariff as originally framed provided for a different treatment in the case of socks made of wool and those made of cotton and other fabrics. For some reason that difference has apparently been wiped away, and socks and stockings of all kinds are now brought together in one item. The proposal is that the duty shall be 25 per cent, on the general Tariff, and 20 per cent, in the British preference column. The old Tariff did make a difference, woollens being charged 15 per cent., cottons ip per cent., and silks 25 par cent. Without wishing to see these figures repeated in the present Tariff, it seems to me that there should be varying rates of duty. It may be said that the Department finds a difficulty in ascertaining whether <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> sock is ma,de of one material or another. But that point was not raised when we were dealing with apparel, and I do not think it should be raised in this case. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the details of the trade to know how best a change might be made. But the suggestion that occurs to my mind is this. We should, I think, reduce the duty in the first column to 20 per cent, and make a corresponding reduction of 5 per cent, in the duty on British goods. A duty of 20 per cent, represents a compromise between what is now proposed and the duties in the 1902 Tariff. " The probabilities are that the mean between those duties would be somewhere about 18 per cent., so that my proposal is a shade higher than the average under the 1902 Tariff. I do not say that I look upon a duty of 20 per cent, as ideal, but I quite recognise the impossibility of looking for support for anything lower than the duty under the 1902 Tariff? </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> will not persist in attempting to differentiate between the goods imported under this item. Under the Tariff of 1902 hosiery was dutiable according to the materials from which it was made. When it was wholly cotton the duty was 10 per cent. ; when it was wholly wool, or made of wool and cotton mixture, the duty was 15 per cent. ; and when it was silk or silk mixture the duty was 25 per cent. That was found to be most unsatisfactory and a source of irritation and vexation. First of all, it was very difficult to differentiate between the various classes of goods, and, in the next place, it involved the opening of an enormous number of cases and no end of work and trouble in that connexion. In formulating this Tariff there was a desire to meet the wishes of the trade as well as of the Department by grouping the various kinds of goods together under one heading. Socks and stockings are, of course, made in the Commonwealth, woollen stockings particularly. While, of course, it may not be true that cotton stockings are made here at present, there is no reason on earth why they should not be, and this duty will give- a very substantial inducement for their manufacture in the country. The importations are exceedingly great. In 1902 they were £124,800, in 1903 £281,200, in .1904 £390,800, in 1.905 £422,200, and in 1906 £462,000. These figures do not include silk hosiery, which is grouped with apparel. To simplify the Tariff is one of our objects, and the duty as it stands will have that effect. We also have an opportunity of giving a substantial impetus to a most excellent industry. The duty of 25 per cent, will prove effective, and I do ask honorable senators to realize that there is a possibility of our having a very large industry in the making of woollen and cotton stockings and socks. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council urged that these goods should be grouped under one heading in order to secure simplicity. He said that it would save, not only the Customs officials, but the importers a great deal of trouble if the present system of grouping were adopted. I do not know that we ought to attach much weight to that plea. Whilst it is certainly desirable that we should endeavour as far as possible to simplify the Tariff, there must be some limit to the sacrifices we are prepared to make in order to achieve that object. If simplicity were the all-important consideration, we might obtain it by deter mining that one rate of duty should apply to every item. Then, again, we cannot attach very much weight to the contention that this grouping would save a great deal of labour. The object of a protectionist Tariff is not to reduce, but to increase, employment; and even if it gives increased employment to Customs officials or importers' clerks, I do not know that it is a violation of the principles of protection. Be that as it may, we must not overlook the fact that we have already differentiated between cottons and woollens. That being so, we should extend the principle to similar items in the Tariff. We have before us a case in point. I cannot conceive of any argument in favour of the free admission of cotton piece goods that does not  supply  equally to the free admission of cotton socks and stockings. I am therefore unable to reconcile the attitude taken up by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to this item with that which he has adopted in respect of other items. It has been our' endeavour as far as possible to distinguish between luxuries and necessities of life. We have imposed on all luxuries - whether they consist of silks, champagne, or anything else purchased chiefly by the man with more than the average purse - heavier duties than we have imposed on goods in everyday use, purchased principally by the poorer classes of the community. That being so, we have every reason for differentiating between the duties on cotton socks and silk or even woollen socks. We have heard a great deal as to the undesirableness of bringing cotton socks into competition with woollen hosiery. If we desire to foster the manufacture of woollen socks, we ought to place upon them higher duties than we impose upon cotton socks. I do not know that the result would be altogether what we should desire, but, having regard to the way in which we have distinguished between luxuries and necessities, I think that we ought to differentiate between these two lines. I therefore intend to support the request which has been outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- I believe that this is the first Tariff framed in Australia in which these lines have been grouped in one item. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie very properly asks, if we are to distinguish between cotton, linen, and woollen bodywear, why should we not differentiate between cotton, silk, and woollen footwear? This duty affects the poorest classes of the people. </para>

                <para class="block">Cotton socks and stockings can be purchased' at from 6d. per pair upwards ; but a pair of woollen stockings costs from  2s.  upwards. The Government proposal would be all very well if every one could afford to purchase woollen hosiery. Having regard to the climatic conditions of Australia, it would be a good thing if every one could ; but, unfortunately, the factory girl or a general servant, earning from ios. to <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> per week, cannot afford to purchase such expensive footwear, and has usually to be content with cotton hosiery. That being so, this duty would penalize them ; it would place them on the same plane as the rich, who can afford to pay for woollen or silken hosiery. In pre-Federation days, Victoria imposed a  duty  of  25  per cent, on woollen stockings, but cotton stockings were free. In New South Wales they were free; in Queensland a duty of  15  per cent, was in operation ; in South Australia and Tasmania a duty of  20  per cent, prevailed, and under the Western Australian Tariff there was a duty of  15  per cent. I find that this matter was very carefully considered by. the Tariff Commission, the protectionist section of which reported that - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Cotton socks and stockings were not at present manufactured in Australia. There was no immediate prospect of the successful initiation of this branch of hosiery production here, and therefore these goods did not require to be protected by a special duty. The hosiery manufacturers who appeared before your Commissioners were interested in securing an increased import duty upon  woollen  socks and stockings only, but some of them incidentally stated that if the present duty of 10 per cent, on cotton hosiery were increased to 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, and the raw material locally produced, they could compete with imported cotton socks and stockings. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That might have been an attempt on the part of the woollen hosiers to have the importation of cotton hosiery prohibited. But if that course is to be adopted in respect of hosiery or foot-wear, why should it not have been adopted in respect of body wear?  Why, for  instance, should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and I appear in the. Senate wearing light suits when, by reason of the imposition of a heavy duty, we might have been compelled to wear woollen goods? The recommendation of the protectionist section of the Commission was that the various lines' should be separated; that socks and stockings, woollen, with or without silk or other ornamentation, should be dutiable at 25  per cent. ; that socks and stockings, cotton, with or without silk or other ornamentation, should be dutiable at  15  per cent. ; that socks and stockings, silk or partly of silk, should be dutiable at  15  per cent., and that yarns should be free. That is a sensible recommendation, and I trust that the Committee will request that the item be divided. Tariff simplicity is desirable, but it is not so important that we should endeavour to secure it at the cost of penalizing the poor, while the rich go free. </para>

                        <para>- Those items were most wisely dealt with uniformly, that course being adopted to simplify the Tariff. Few items have been a source of greater anxiety, both to importers and the Customs Department, than has that of socks and stockings. As the result of many conferences, it was determined to group these lines together. It is all very well for my honorable friend now to attempt to differentiate between them, and to say that he has no objection to the duty in respect of socks, woollen or containing wool ; but he will discover that such a differentiation would at once give rise to an anomaly. What would be the position in regard to silk stockings? Would he make them free? </para>

                        <para>- Then, again, what are silk socks and stockings? Is it to be said that socks containing a thread or two of silk or having a binding of silk shall be classed as silk socks,; although with that exception they consist wholly of wool or cotton? Nothing is more usual than to have silk worked on socks and stockings. Hence in regard to all these matters it was found desirable to have these different line's grouped together. There is a cheap line of hosiery known as military socks, which are made entirely of cotton. Yet they are so got up by the process of dusting wool upon them that they have the appearance of woollen. hosiery, .and unfortunately are sold as such. If cotton socks are admitted free, I have not the slightest doubt that we shall have a very substantial increase in the importation of military socks. Apart from that point altogether, however, I would say that first of all in order to achieve simplicity - and the Committee has carefully applied itself to an effort to secure simplicity in respect of other items - we ought to agree to the present grouping of the item. Then, again, this is a protective duty of 25 per cent, as against the old duty of 10 per cent., so that there is no reason why the industry of making cotton socks should not be immediately started in Australia. The duty is a distinct encouragement to the manufacturers of cotton hosiery to set up an establishment here. It would be a great mistake to amend the -item, and I would urge that the present uniformity be maintained. Let us discuss the question of duty and fight it out on its merits, but if the item be amended in the way proposed, I feel satisfied that we shall have a continuation of the confusion that has hitherto existed. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has put forward as his principal argument the plea that by agreeing to the item as it stands we shall facilitate the work of the Customs officials, since simplicity will be secured by having all socks and stockings grouped under the one heading. That may be perfectly true, but we have to ask ourselves at what cost to the consumers this simplicity would be obtained. It is not contended, that the duty can be anything but an impost upon the users of cotton socks, seeing that they are not made in Australia.I am not in a position to say what proportion of the socks we import are cotton and what proportion are woollen. </para>

                        <para>- That makes it plain that in order to save the Customs officials, and possibly the importers of hosiery, some little trouble, we are asked to impose a duty of' 25 per cent, on an annual importation of £150,000 worth of cotton hosiery, which is not being made in Australia, and which even the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission admitted is not likely to be made here for some time. To that extent the Committee are now asked to sanction the imposition of a purely revenue duty. Under . the circumstances, one may reasonably inquire, whether 25 per cent, upon £150,000 worth of imports - nearly £40,000 annually - is not too high a price to charge the people of the Commonwealth merely to convenience the Customs officials and the. importers. </para>

                        <para>- That means to ease the work of the Customs Department - which has been established for the convenience of the public - and to simplify the passing of entries by importers. It seems to me that the price is altogether too high. If the difference were one as between 20 per cent, and 25 per cent., we might very well allow it to pass unquestioned in the interests of the attainment of simplicity, but it is a matter of 25 per ce.it., or one-fourth of the value of the goods. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that I incur a big risk when I say that there is something which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will not assert sooner or later. But I must take risks upon occasions, and I am taking one now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> himself read  a  paragraph from the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, which stated not only that the industry was not being carried on in Australia, but that  it was not likely to be. To the extent of our cotton importations this duty is purely a revenue impost. Therefore, the whole question that we have to consider is, " Are we justified in charging the purchaser of cotton socks and stockings 25 per cent. merely to facilitate the passing of Customs entries?" The difficulty might have been obviated if a less duty than 25 per cent. had been proposed. Had a 10 per cent. or a 15 per cent. rate been suggested, possibly we might have been willing to purchase simplicity at that price. But, merely to attain simplicity, I am not prepared to indorse a proposal to levy a duty of 25 per cent. I hope that upon every occasion the Committee will request the remission of revenue duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl'</inline> s attention to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. With regard to cotton hose, they recommend the wording :  - " with or without silk or other ornamentation." Men's cotton socks commonly have a little silk thread run up the side, terminating in what is technically called a clock. That would be simply a cotton sock, but that little silk thread would, if the Vice-President's friendly suggestion were adopted, bring it under the heading of " silk." It would be absurd for the Committee to undo the work which it has just done by charging cotton socks so ornamented as "silk." Ninety per cent. of the socks that have come out have a thread of silk on them. I am quite content in this case to accept the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission- </para>

                        <para>- It may seem astonishing and unwise to do so, but the circumstances are not ordinary. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> begins to recognise the absolute folly of accepting a recommendation from them in ordinary cases. But the Committee have decided upon a certain course, and, that being so, let us give effect to the last vote, which was distinctly to differentiate between woollen and cotton socks. If we adopt the suggestion to make cotton socks free, and later on the further suggestion - that gift from the Greeks - of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to make silk hose dutiable at 25 per cent., it will simply be another way of putting cotton socks back under the same duty as woollen ones, and we might have saved ourselves the trouble of the last and the next divisions. The Vice-President of the Executive Council suggests that any cotton sock, with the slightest piece of silk in it, should be made to pay exactly the same duty as it would have paid under the item as it came before us. </para>

                        <para>- My answer to that is the wording of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission - " with or without silk or other ornamentation." I believe that the Customs Department is fully possessed of the knowledge to enable it to tell whether a piece of silk or of any other material woven into a sock is an integral part of it, or merely ornamentation. I repeat and emphasize that if we adopt the suggestion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council we shall simply be determining that the vote we have just given shall be undone, and that a very large percentage of cotton socks shall, because of that little piece of silk ornamentation, pay exactly the same duty as woollen socks do, and continue to be, as they were designed by the Government to be, a revenue-yielding item. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is, I think quite unconsciously, misleading the Committee. The way in which it is proposed to divide the item gives the Committee the freest opportunity of deciding exactly what they mean. So far we have merely decided that woollen socks, or socks containing wool, shall bear a certain duty. We have next to decide as to cotton socks as now proposed in new paragraph  b.  The third question to decide is the rate of duty upon socks " silk or containing silk, but not containing wool, and n.e.i." When we reach that paragraph, it will be for the Committee to decide exactly what the duty shall be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> wants the Committee to believe that by voting for new paragraph  b  they will be undoing what  they have already done. My answer to that argument is that we have dealt only with woollen  socks and stockings. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> suggested, suppose that, instead of the silk ornamentation described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> a sock contained one, two, or half-a-dozen threads of wool, or 40  per cent., or any other percentage of wool. Undoubtedly it would then come under the 25 per cent, duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that a cotton sock may contain one thread of silk by way of ornamentation. Does he propose to move an amendment allowing cotton socks to contain one thread of silk? Where is the line to be drawn? What if a sock is ornamented by a man's initials in silk, or tipped at the toe with silk? It is quite impossible to differentiate as to the degree of ornamentation which will take it out of "cotton" and bring it under some other heading. It is all very well to talk in a light and airy fashion about a sock containing merely one thread of silk as ornamentation. But if we are to avoid confusion, we must draw the line firmly. We must ask, "Does it contain silk, or does it not?" We have already decided that if. a sock contains any wool at all it 'shall be liable to a certain duty. . Why should we fail in the case of silk to come to a similar clear, firm, and clean-cut decision? Let us vote distinctly as to whether it shall be cotton, or cotton and silk mixed. If it is to be cotton alone, let us vote accordingly. If, on the other hand, the question becomes the adoption of new paragraph c, as suggested by me, " Silk or containing silk, but not containing wool, and n.e.i.," it will be for the Committee to say what duty shall be imposed. That is the clear way of dealing with the item, and the only proper method of achieving complete simplicity. </para>

                    <para>. - If the duty on this item is to be reduced, my vote will go for making it absolutely free, because I am not in favour of imposing what' is merely a revenue duty, without protective incidence. But one aspect of this subject, which has been brought under my notice, is worthy of a little consideration, and has been so far entirely overlooked. I am informed that there is in this city a firm of manufacturers who do to some extent make cotton hose. Item  400  of the Tariff makes cotton yarn dutiable at 15 per cent, (general Tariff), and 10 per cent. (United Kingdom). If, then, cotton hose is made free,' those Melbourne manufacturers of cotton socks will be charged at the rates of 15 and 10 per cent, on the yarns which they use to make the socks - and there appears to be no chance at present of these yarns being produced here - while cotton socks manufactured in other countries will be admitted free of duty to compete with what they produce. I am prepared to vote to make cotton hose free if I am assured that there are no manufacturers of it in Australia at present, and that there is no probability of there being any. But my information is that there_,is already one firm making cotton hose in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am credibly informed that it is Messrs. Foy and Gibson. Why should there be a duty on cotton yarn, which is the necessary raw material, while the manufactured article is admitted free ? If the duty on cotton yarn is retained at 15 per cent., then a duty of 25 per cent, is not too much to impose on cotton hose. I shall therefore move, in order to test the feeling of the Committee - </para>

                    <para>. - I am unable, to understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> remarkable change of front. Not ten minutes ago he helped to take "cotton hose" away  from the 25 per cent. duty. Having done that, he now, like the good old Duke of York, proposes to put it back again. He was firmly convinced that cotton and wool socks ought not to be treated alike, and helped to separate them. Now, however, because of an intimation he has received from Messrs. Foy and Gibson - we shall get familiar with these names directly - he' has changed his mind. Messrs. Foy and Gibson have found that it is only necessary to get some honorable senator to move a new duty or an increase of duty, knowing that the Ministry will support it, and they have been quick to follow the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> interviewers. Why did Messrs. Foy and Gibson not tell the Tariff Commission that they were manufacturing these socks? </para>

This only illustrates the recklessness with which some honorable senators are prepared to impose duties; and we ought to refuse to go any further on the lines which honorable senators opposite are mapping out for us. If there is an industry worth protecting, the Tariff Commission would have ascertained the fact, because those interested, like those in the woollen industry, would have asked for legislative assistance. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must remember that only a few minutes ago he voted with me on the strength of the report of the Tariff Commission'. Honor able senators ought, in all seriousness, to ask themselves whether, because somebody has said that they think an industry exists somewhere, it is right and proper to impose a duty of 25 per cent., or one-fourth of the value of an annual importation of goods worth £150,000, which are used by every man, woman, and child, and which the members of the Tariff Commission tell us are not now being made here, and are not likely to be made here for many years to come. Quite apart from the rival principles of free-trade and protection, the proposal before us shows extreme recklessness, which does not redound to the credit of the Committee, or make the struggle for existence any lighter for the masses, and will cause the Tariff and its framers to stink in the nostrils of the citizens of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - Whether or not cotton socks are being made in Australia, I do not know; but there is no reason why they should not, except that there is not sufficient inducement. Surely cotton socks can be made as simply as woollen socks. It is only very recently that woollen stockings or hosiery of any kind was manufactured in Australia, although they have been made in New Zealand a good many years. Every protectionist should feel disposed to assist in insuring that this very simple manufacture shall be carried on in Australia. Cotton, we hope, will be grown here, and we desire to open out as many avenues as we can for its local use. Cotton stockings are made in England in very large quantities, although all the raw material has to be imported without the slightest prospect of its local production. We can obtain the raw material just as readily as can the manufacturers of Great Britain, and I hope that every protectionist will vote for a protectionist duty without regard to whether cotton socks are being made here now, but with the certainty that if the inducement be sufficient they will be made here in the near future. </para>

I dare say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> or some other protectionist or prohibitionist, could show that halos and wings could be manufactured by Messrs. Brown, Jones, and Robinson, or Messrs. Foy and Gibson, they could get a law passed that nobody should have Christian burial unless their next-world raiment were made by some Australian firm. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is always telling us that if a commodity is not being made here now, there is strong prospect of its being made here in the " sweet byandby." If in the next hour or half-hour anybody within a few hundred yards of the Senate can show the slightest prospect of something being manufactured at some time or other, we shall have a duty proposed ; Collins-street or Bourke-street has only to be represented at the lobby in order to secure a duty on cotton socks, halos, or anything else. </para>

Manufacturers of South Australia, New South Wales, or Queensland are not within call of the Senate lobby when protectionists send the word round. The proposals now being made are not the Government proposals, as has been shown over and over again to-night.

Foy and Gibson, and when, further, the Vice-President of the Executive Council sees no reason why firms should not come to the lobby, I think my remarks are particularly pertinent. I am pointing out the difficulties under which we are constructing a Tariff for the whole of Australia. . As a matter of fact, the Government know now that the Committee is in a state of "go as you please," and that they have no control. The proposition emanating from this side is, in my opinion, remarkably fair and reasonable, and I hope that it will be carried, because it is highly advisable in the case of a Tariff which is practically gorging the Treasury and screwing out of everybody </para>

I submit that the Treasurer . has screwed out ot them too many, and in connexion with their cotton stockings I will not allow one farthing more to be screwed out of them without entering an emphatic protest. It is downright and unjustifiable greed and tyranny on the part of the Government to heap these additional burdens upon the people, and I shall assist my leader with all the power I possess to resist their proposals. I wish to throw this responsibility upon the Government, who are a mere gramophone, a sort of organ which any one on the other side can grind. I protest against the imposition of this duty. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst I admit that the last vote taken might be considered a test vote, I feel that some honorable senators holding strong protectionist opinions were not fully seized of all the circumstances, and I include myself amongst that number. I shall give place to no honorable senator in my desire to protect to the highest extent all those industries which can be, are being, and have been established in any part of the Commonwealth. So far as I have been able I have been consistent, in common with most honorable senators belonging to the Labour Party, in desiring to strike out all the revenue duties. When the last division was taken some honorable senators, including myself, were of opinion that cotton socks 'were not manufactured in Victoria or any other State. We thought that this was essentially a revenue duty, and our opinion was strengthened by the extracts which were read from the Tariff Commission's report by Senators Millen and McColl' Taking that report as the best guide we could get we voted, although it was a test vote in a measure, for free cotton socks. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Since the division was taken <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has told us that in Collingwood an industry exists, and I think he said that it is carried on by Foy and Gibson. Whether that firm is making or intends to make cotton socks I am not in a position to say. But a gentleman who has no other object to serve than to fortify honorable senators - at any rate, protectionist senators - with all the information that will be helpful to them in connexion with the items, has taken the trouble since this discussion was initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to make inquiries on the subject. As the result of his inquiries he has informed me and others that Murray and Company, of Richmond, are making, and making extensively, cotton socks. What they are doing in Victoria probably many firms are doing in different parts of the Commonwealth. As a protectionist I cannot, therefore, vote for the free admission of cotton socks. </para>

                        <para>-No. I would sooner vote for no duty than vote for a revenue duty. I have no sympathy with any one who desires the imposition of revenue duties. I remind those who may be in a state of indecision that the raw material - cotton - is admitted free of duty. The imposition of a duty of 25 per cent. on manufactured cotton goods, particularly hosiery, will give to the industry a stimulus which it never had before, and with that stimulus, of course, additional industries will be created and further employment found for the people. The certainty is that with the establishment of the policy of new protection this State, and indirectly the whole Commonwealth, will be advantaged by the passing of the duty suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - We are getting a little more information now as to the source from which honorable senators draw their inspiration. Here is another gentleman who, a few minutes ago, believed - he had no other information available than the Tariff Commission's report - that cotton goods were not made in Australia, and, therefore, voted to separate them from woollen goods, with the ultimate intention of making them free. We did not start the discussion on this matter until 6 o'clock. Yet we find that when business and public offices are closed, and there is no opportunity to get information from a reliable and official source, some person comes along and whispers to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that somebody is doing something somewhere. </para>

                        <para>- No, but why was not the information placed before the Tariff Commission? Why was it kept back tor the private use of honorable senators? Why was it given through the medium of the lobby instead of in the open room of the Tariff Commission? It is indeed a crime to encourage the men who declined to go before that body to come here now. Was there any hesitancy on the. part of manufacturers generally to give evidence? None at all, and it is only in a case where, apparently, we can get no official information concerning any industry that these gentlemen suddenly dare, either by themselves or by agents, to come here and influence honorable senators. </para>

If I were to say that somebody had told me something, or that I had just heard, or had reason to believe, something, would they take me seriously? It is only when, apparently, a step is taken by some one in the direction of putting on a duty that the thing is entertained for a moment, otherwise it would be laughed out of court. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and others have any substantial proof that an industry exists, or has recently come into existence, surely they can find a trace of it in the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories or in the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year-Book.</inline> Let them bring forward some evidence to show that it does exist. </para>

                        <para>- I think that what has really determined my honorable friend's attitude is the mysterious message from the spirit-world to which I have referred. According to the report of the Tariff Commission, Australian manufacturers do not spin cotton yarn, and cotton spinning is distinct from wool spinning. As no manufacturer has yet attempted to spin cotton yarn in Australia, does the honorable senator think that a duty of 15 per cent. will bring the industry into existence? A duty of at least 25 per cent. would have to be imposed, and if such a duty were imposed, the duty on socks and stockings spun from cotton yarn would have to be made at least 40 per cent. </para>

The mysterious whisperings in the lobby are much more potent with some of them than arguments or statements of facts and figures. </para>

                        <para>- Ministers, having failed in their effort to disguise a revenue duty, are now seeking to frighten those who are anti-revenue tariffists into believing that it is really a protective duty. Not long since, Senators Findley and Turley, on what was practically a test vote, supported the making of this item free, believing the duty to be a revenue one; but now, because of the statement, which is not substantiated, that some one is making these articles, they put on one side an official document, the work of Commissioners who for months heard and discussed evidence on the subject. I do not think that any business man would place <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements, unsupported by evidence, before the clear and definite pronouncement of the Tariff Commission. If only for their own credit, honorable senators who have nothing more definite to go on than what has been put before us to-night should insist on the postponement of the item until it can be determined what truth there is in these lobby whisperings about a factory at Collingwood. </para>

                    <para>. - As I was a member of the Tariff Commission, it devolves on me to say why I have altered my views on this subject. In the first place, it must be recollected  that it is nearly two years since a great deal of the evidence of the Tariff Commission was taken, and many things have happened since then. It was at the instigation, or with the support, of a free-trade representative of South Australia that the three items relating to socks and stockings were consolidated, and it was at the instigation of a number of Queensland representatives that duties of 15 and 10 percent. were imposed on cotton yarn. Why was a bounty granted for the production of cotton? Was it only to stimulate the exporting of raw cotton ? Those who supported the bounty must have had in view the manufacture at some future date of cotton yarn. When cotton yarn is spun here, what are we to do with it? Export it? Surely much of it must be used here in the manufacture of cotton socks and stockings. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> could mention the name of the factory where these yarns are spun. Woollen yarns I know are being spun, but not for hosiery purposes. The evidence of competent witnesses engaged in the manufacture of socks was that no woollen yarn was spun in Australia for the manufacture of socks, and that a special process was necessary. One witness said that the matter required careful looking into, as it involved the expenditure of a considerable amount of capital on a plant entirely new to Australia. The evidence generally was to the effect that the industry was not likely to be established in Australia for some time to come. I am speaking now of woollen yarn, and clearly the manufacture of cotton yarn for hosiery purposes is still more remote. If honorable senators are willing to be fooled into believing that this is a protectionist duty, I cannot help it. </para>

                    <para>. -  When the item cotton stockings was being discussed in another place in the consideration of the Tariff of  1902,  we heard just the same stories that we are hearing tonight - that they were being made here and there. If they were being made at that time those who were making them must have struggled along under a  10  per cent. duty, but not one of them came before the Tariff Commission to say that they were struggling, or to ask for a higher duty. Now we are told that because we have decided to give a bonus for the growing of cotton, we must impose a duty on cotton socks because some one in the sweet by-and-by will start an industry for their manufacture in the Commonwealth. Let me tell honorable senators that the industrial conditions in Australia at the present time are not favorable to the investment of capital in industries. It is all very well for men who would not put 6d. into an industry to reckon on the chance of others doing so. In the meantime, the poor people who must buy these goods are to be asked to contribute  £40,000  a year to the revenue in order that in the remote future some one may start this industry. The whole thing is a hollow sham. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know anything about this item, but I have noticed that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of  5  per cent., that the duty under the old Tariff was  5  per cent., and that the Government have submitted in paragraph  a  a duty of  15  per cent. I do not know why this duty should be increased by  200  per cent. </para>

                        <para>-Ishouldliketo point out, as I have done before, on behalf of the absent members of that section of the Tariff Commission, that they classified all fabrics and textiles under certain main headings - cottons, woollens, and so on. They put down a duty which represented an average in order to simplify the Tariff. They said : "We know that this duty is very low on some articles, whilst it may be high on others, but for simplicity's sake, we are going to group articles under one heading." That is why they recommended  15  per cent. But the protectionist section did not adopt that course. They found that a duty of  5  per cent. was quite sufficient. But the Government have proposed  15  per cent. I do not think 1 am doing anything unreasonable when I ask the Committee to agree to split the difference. </para>

                    <para>.-I do hope that the Committee will not agree to make paragraph  a  free. This is not a revenue duty at all. It is quite true that those who make tents, tarpaulins, and sails get their raw material in free, but it must be within the knowledge of every honorable senator that a large number of men are engaged in the manufacture of these goods throughout the Commonwealth. To suggest for one moment for the purpose of catching votes, that this is a revenue item is simply too absurd. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not reduce this duty. We have passed the item admitting canvas and duck free. This item is similar. The duty is purely protective. Its purpose is to permit the making of tents, tarpaulins, and sails in the country. No costly machinery is required to make them ; it is all hand work. This is a very fair duty - in fact it is rather low, if anything -and might fairly stand as it is. </para>

                    <para>- I have how received a little information from the Government. I moved my request, because I had a right to assume that the Government, in (riving no reason why they had raised the duty by 200 per cent. above the proposal of the Tariff Commission - which only recommended 5 per cent. - had no reason to give. It appeared to me that this was a revenue duty. But after the explanation of the Minister,I quite recognise that it is a protective duty, and I ask leave to withdraw my request. </para>

                    <para>.- We have decided to request the House of Representatives to make the duties in respect of paragraph d of item 123, which relates almost wholly to trimmings, 15 per cent. and 10 per cent. In pursuance of that policy, and with a view to secure that simplicity and uniformity so eagerly desired by Ministers and the Customs officials I move - </para>

                        <para>- The remaining goods covered by the item are the raw materials of other manufactures. They are not made here, . and a duty upon them would therefore be merely revenue producing. Trimmings, ruffling, pleating, and ruchings on the other hand may properly be subjected to a duty because they can be made in Australia. The other lines are not at present being made here, and there is no reasonable prospect of their being manufactured in Australia in the near future. I desire that goods that are the raw material of other manufactures, and which are not being made here, shall be free from taxation. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be observed that item no includes " Feathers dressed," and. makes them dutiable at 30 per cent. Dressed feathers are, so to speak, practically the raw material of those who make imitation birds and wings, the imitation process involving a further manipulation of dressed feathers. That the duty on the raw material should be in excess of that on the more advanced manufacture is of course anomalous. If the request be agreed to, imitation birds and wings will be dutiable under item no at 30 per cent. This is one of the lines challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Givens, who is under the impression that many of the articles enumerated in the item are not manufactured in Australia. As a matter of fact, badges are made here, and the local manufacturers have entered into a contract with the Government for their supply. They have been carrying on the work for many years. The position is the same in regard to buckles and slides. " Natural birds and wings " have been included in this item in-order to discourage their use. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon a close investigation of this item I find myself so to speak between two fires. In the first place I do not feel inclined to go all the way with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in his proposal that a request be made that almost all the articles in this item be made free. At the same time, I do not think that the request proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council goes far enough. The inclusion of buttons in the item is somewhat anomalous. I should like coat, vest, and dress buttons - in fact I think all of these buttons - to be placed on the free list. </para>

Whilst we have duties of 25 per cent. and 15 per cent. upon bone buttons, trouser buttons have been placed in the list of special exemptions. Why this differentiation? Why should not all buttons be included in the' same category and admitted free? </para>

                    <para>. - There appears to be an important omission from this item. I see nothing about the free admission of the roosters' tails used to ornament helmets, or of the yards  of chiffon which military men wear occasionally. If all the other ornamentation is to be free, why should those articles not be free also? Surely they are an important part of the accoutrement? Instead of enumerating all these articles, why not say " All articles required for military uniforms may be admitted under departmental by-laws free"? What do military men want lace for? Does it increase their warlike qualities, and make them more formidable opponents? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is admitting my whole point. The Committee is at liberty, so far as he is concerned, to carry the duty as high as it likes, but let it attempt to go back a single point and he becomes a mass of indignation. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> if carried would still leave the duty 10 per cent, higher than it was before, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is not satisfied with that. If he will look at the evidence given by the two witnesses who appeared before the Tariff Commission he will find that . the highest duties they asked for were 30 and 33 per cent., and then they referred. to the fact that they had to pay certain duties on their raw material. We have made some portions of the raw material free, arid if honorable senators will allow for that difference they will find that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway's</inline> proposal be adopted it will give a higher measure of protection on the bulk of the things than was asked for. Let me show that the industry has been doing fairly well under duties of 15 and 20 per cent. When the Tariff Commission took evidence there were only two factories in existence, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has assured us that now there are seven factories in existence in Victoria and New South Wales. </para>

Surely we may assume that the larger measure of protection afforded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway's</inline> proposal will stimulate the industry still further, and that the progress will be much more rapid. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not see any necessity for the Government to- depart from the duty as fixed by the other House, nor can I see any occasion to reduce the duty for the purpose of simplification. I see no more need to take that course with this item than with another item. There is a great deal of difference between many of these articles. It is unquestionable that the industry has been established, because I hold in my hand some flowers which were made locally. I think that after inspection of them honorable senators will admit that they compare very favorably with the imported articles: It must be a satisfaction to every one to know that they were made by Australian women receiving  reasonable  rates of remuneration. Necessarily such work must be much more pleasant to them than are many other occupations. For that reason I would like to see. the industry extended as far as possible. ' According to the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, there is a very large importation of artificial flowers from foreign countries, chiefly from Germany, France and Austria. If we desire to secure a protectionist Tariff we should extend the measure of protection which is necessary in order to put the industry on a. fair and sound basis. In view of the fact that we import annually from £15,000 to £20,000 worth of artificial flowers, there must.. be' room for the local industry to expand very considerably if encouraged. No reasons have been advanced by the Government for departing from the duty as fixed by the other House. I really cannot understand their attitude in not standing by their own proposals. </para>

                        <para>- Not so far as I am concerned. On the ground of simplicity and in order to expedite the working of the Department, the Minister agreed to bring the two items into line. The duty on the first line which we have passed stands at 25 per cent, in the general Tariff and at 15 per cent, in the preferential Tariff.

Otherwise it would not simplify matters ; . it would simply make confusi on  worse confounded.

                    <para>. - I made a mistake in endeavouring to show a little consideration in this matter. We were discussing items 134 and 136, the rates of duty being talked of, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> knows, being 30 and 25 per cent. I found, on consulting the departmental officers, that it would be desirable to amalgamate the items, and as at the first glance I thought it was merely a question of 30 and 25 per cent., I said that I had no objection to it. ' But, on considering the matter further, I discovered that, in item 134, there was a preferential duty of 15 per cent. The moment I did so, I indicated that I had no intention of extending it to item 136. As the proposed alteration to apply a duty of 25 per cent. to the two items will not secure the simplification originally aimed at, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it is advisable to let things remain as they are, and that I propose to do. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council was going to meet "us at first; but he backed down directly a supporter objected. </para>

I heartily indorse what has been said by Senators McGregor and Trenwith. The industry provides an opening for the employment of a class of people for whom it is very difficult indeed to find a suitable occupation. It finds employment for indigent persons who wish to be independent, and object to have to depend upon charity, and it affords to such persons perhaps the only means by which they can make a living. It is also an industry to which our young Australian girls with their quickness of hand and eye and general nimbleness might very well apply themselves. It would bring them into close touch with nature, and should provide for them not merely a profitable but also a refined occupation. </para>

                <para class="block">I move this request with a view to giving further encouragement, and I hope adequate protection, to the wig-makers of Australia. For some considerable time past, wigs invoiced at from 8s. 6d. to 13s. 6d. each have found their way into Australia, and have come into serious competition with wigs locally made. I understand that it would take an up-to-date wig maker between four and five days to make one of these wigs. </para>

                        <para>-  I do not know that it is ridiculous when we compare the wages paid in Australia with those paid in the countries from which these wigs are imported. I believe that in France and Germany these wigs are made chiefly by child labour, paid at the rate of 4s. or 5s. per week, and that in England they are largely manufactured by indigent aliens, who are paid a sweating wage. Even the average Britisher who engages in this occupation in the Old Country gets a wage that we should consider inadequate for a boy in Australia. To prove the correctness of that statement, I have here an advertisement taken from an English newspaper. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that a large quantity of it comes from England, but a large quantity also comes from France and Germany. We know very well that there are more ways than one of killing a dog, and there are more ways than one of getting stuff into this country through Great Britain, although it has been made in France.

                <para class="block">It is evident from that advertisement that in many places where this kind of work is done the wigmakers work on Sunday. At one time there were a considerable number of wigmakers employed in the different States of the Commonwealth. But owing to the introduction of cheap wigs and fringes the wig men have been driven out of the trade and forced to become barbers. Many who were formerly in receipt of  45s.  and £3 a week are to-day working for30s. and  35s.  a week.  I  hope that the Committee will agree to the measure of protection proposed. </para>
