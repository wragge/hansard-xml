                <para>Minute Paper for the Executive, 2S1I1 .July, 1896. </para>
                <para class="block">The matters to be inquired into being specified in the first paragraph, the second, paragraph reads thus-: -  " It is understood that, with the authority of  His Excellency  in Council,. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> is willing to prosecute the above inquiries without remuneration for travelling expenses." </para>
                <para>This paper bears the approval and signature of the then Governor,, the late Lord Hampden. The Commission issued to me was dated 31st July, 1896. My report was presented to the Governor on 5th July, 1898. The payment of a portion of the travelling expenses for which I was out of pocket was made to me on the 19th January, 1899 - or- two years and six months from the date of my Commission. I will only read two extracts from the sworn evidence of the then Premier of New South Wales Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Reid,</inline> giving evidence on 26th August, 1899, said -  " I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> was going to England, and knowing the great interest he had taken in this matter (old-age pensions) I invited him toad for the Government in obtaining for us some information upon the subject during his visit to Europe ; but I made it distinctly clear that in inviting him to take this position he was not, under any circumstances, to expect, as at- ' taching to his office, emolument in any shape or form ; but he was lo have his Commission free from any liability on the part of the Government to pay him anything in connexion with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> accepted the Commission upon these terms." </para>
                <para>In answer to question 293, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> said - speaking of a rough copy of my report, which he had read -  " I was simply astounded at the amount of labour and research which must have been thrown into the work. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> that in my opinion the Government should certainly put a sum of money upon the Estimates in recognition of his work." </para>
                <para>The evidence goes on at question 294 -  " Did you make that statement voluntarily ? - Decidedly." 295. "There was no approach from him? - Absolutely none. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> in no shape or form, in the most remote or indirect way, hinted to me that he was looking for a single penny." 296. "Did any one do so on his behalf? - No human being approached me - neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> nor any one else - to suggest in any way that any sort of reward, recognition, or payment should be made to him." 308. " I felt so impressed with the enormous labour, trouble, and inquiry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> must have been put to in the Old Country to begin with, and concluding his report out here, that it was a sort of impulse on my part to tell him that so far as I was concerned he was entitled to some vote in recognition of this work and for his expenses." </para>
                <para>I thank the Senate for permitting me to read these extracts, which so completely refute the allegation made that I was desirous of having a trip to London at the expense of my State; and, sir, I am particularly pleased that I am able to make this statement while you are in the Presidential Chair, seeing that you, of your own personal knowledge as a member of the Ministry that appointed me, are thoroughly well acquainted with the circumstances detailed by the then Premier whose particular act my appointment was. </para>

First of all, the statement about me is a misrepresentation, inasmuch as I never said that I found it difficult to live on my salary as a member of Parliament while I was receiving a salary as Chairman of Committees; as I am doing to-day.

The whole tenor of the article is calculated to convey to the people of Western Australia the impression that I do not pay my grocer's bills, because it has the preamble- </para>

                        <para>- Then I am willing to accept the statement that neither section of the Commission made a recommendation in regard to this item. Mustard seed was free under the first Federal Tariff, so that those who desire to be guided by that Tariff in determining what' the duty should be may rest assured that they will act rightly by supporting this request. I cannot find in. the statistical returns any figures showing what the importations of mustard seed have been ; but if, as we are informed, it is the raw material of an industry, it is obvious that, in" order to encourage the manufacture of mustard here, we might very well make this item free. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a small item, but furnishes an excellent example of the length to which protectionists will go; and the contradictions in which they invariably find themselves landed. Mustard seed is the raw material of mustard, and we shall be told presently, no doubt, that mustard is not manufactured here. We have to recognise, however, that in order to carry out the scheme of protection, it is necessary to go on adding to the cost from the very bottom rung of the ladder, until we reach the top. If there were half-a-dozen semi-stages of manufacture between the production of the mustard seed and the manufacture of the complete article I suppose we should find that there was a graduated protective tax- </para>

                        <para>- Under a protective Tariff the Commonwealth has been waiting six years for articles to become cheaper. But, as a matter of fact, they are becoming dearer. It is positively farcical to impose a tax upon mustard seed. Of course, I recognise that if we place this item in the free list we shall probably be adding to the profits of the manufacturers, and I do not wish to do that. But, on the other hand, I do not see why mustard seed should be taxed. When I am called upon to choose between the two alternatives, I prefer that mustard seed should be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - I need scarcely remind the Committee that this is one of those items which have been removed from the category of oilmen's stores, because of a desire to protect it. But I do not think it can be questioned that the proposed duty of 3d. per lb. is a revenue impost. I am satisfied that a large proportion of the mustard  that we purchase in Australia is imported, and always will be imported. As 3d. per lb. is an exceedingly heavy revenue duty to levy upon an article which is to be found upon almost every dinner table, I move - </para>

                <para class="block">That is the rate which appeared in the former Tariff. Beef is fairly cheap, but from this article, which to most people is almost a necessary concomitant, we derived, with a duty of 2d., a revenue of between £6,000 and £7,000 in 1906. Surely that is enough revenue to get out of this little article. Another reason which should commend itself to every one who has any serious regard for preference is that the great bulk of the imported mustard comes from the United Kingdom. Out of a total importation in 1906 of 756,925 lbs., about 740,000 lbs. - practically all - came from the United Kingdom. . We, therefore, have an opportunity, without any pretence or cloak of a preferential rate, of encouraging trade with the United King dom by levying a uniform duty of 2d. a lb., without troubling ourselves to differentiate between one column and another. </para>

However, whether that be so or not, it is an article in universal use, and its quality greatly depends on the manufacturers in England, who are recognised as the largest and best in the world. </para>

My reason for proposing this request is that, if it be adopted, a factory will, I am informed, be established in Sydney by a company with a capital of  £10,000.  Employment will be found immediately for at least  100  men, and it is anticipated that this number will be increased with the growth of the business. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to affect my honorable friends, then, from a fiscal point of view, seeing that they desire to secure the free admission of commodities. I understand that desiccated cocoanut comes mainly from Ceylon; and is subject to a duty of about 2d. per lb. If the duty on the whole cocoanut were is. a cwt., roughly it would amount to about id. a lb.  011  that part of it which the company required, and they would be indisposed to engage in the industry. I am informed, too, that experiments have been made, and all arrangements completed, to establish a factory in the course of a few months. That is, of course, conditional upon the free admission of the whole cocoanut. They also say that, in addition to desiccated cocoanut, there are several subsidiary lines which they intend to produce. There are. not many cocoanuts grown in Australia : the production is so small that it need not be seriously considered. The bulk of the cocoanuts used here come from  the various islands in the Pacific. Let me repeat that, as copra comes in free, there is a stronger argument in favour of the free admission of the cocoanut, seeing that it is required for the purpose of giving encouragement to an industry which in the course of time may become extensive, and perhaps employ a considerable number of Australian workmen. </para>

But though we grow cocoanuts here, . he argues that we should allow them to be imported free in any quantity if they are to be manufactured into something or other.

                    is in error. The necessity for bringing in the cocoanut to use its kernel is met by item  87,  which allows copra to be admitted free. Now, copra is simply the cocoanut dried. It retains all the oil. One would not get an infinitesimally larger quantity of oil from the whole cocoanut than he would get from the copra. I think that the argument which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    adduced in support of his request falls to the ground. I. will vote for every proposal to reduce the duty on an article or to allow its free admission where it is required for purposes of food.

                    <para>. - Attention has been drawn by some honorable senators to an apparent inconsistency between this proposal and the decision of the Committee with regard to paragraph  a  of the item.

                <para>Honorable senators will remember that only last year the Government submitted to Parliament a proposal designed to encourage the production in the Commonwealth of cocoanut oil. It provided for a bounty for that purpose as part of a general scheme of bounties. That I take it would be one of the productions from whole cocoanuts to be admitted free in the circumstances suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> I am informed by the officers of the Customs Department that, should the request be adopted, the oil would be expressed from the kernels of the cocoanuts admitted under departmental by-laws, and that the residue would be used for the manufacture of desiccated cocoanut and cocoanut in other forms in which the article is used. In' the circumstances I see no objection to the proposal in view of the fact' that the free introduction of whole cocoanuts would be regulated by a departmental by-law. </para>

The first witness examined by the Tariff Commission on this subject was a confectioner, and he stated that he did not wish the duty on almonds to be increased, because the effect would be to increase the price of one of h:s raw materials. The confectioners told us that, although they buy Australian almonds, they are never likely to obtain enough in Australia 'to meet their requirements. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, the confectioners look upon the duty on almonds as a duty on their raw material which increases its price, and they therefore asked for higher rates on confectionery. But, while the confectioners glibly stated that, given sufficient protection the prices of confectionery will come -down, as buyers they say that duties increase the prices of their raw material. To whom should we lean, to the almond-grower or to the confectioner ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but it will take four or five years for new trees to come into bearing, during which time the manufacturers of almond paste and meal will have to pay duty on their imported raw material. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schumacher</inline> told the Tariff Commission that before he commenced to manufacture almond paste the price of the imported article was is. 4d. per lb., but that as soon as he started the price dropped to is. a lb., his selling price being nd. Therefore, the establishment of the local industry had the effect of reducing the price to the consumers. I am satisfied that if the duty is .increased to 6d. it will give that encouragement to the local manufacturer that the Protectionist Party of this country intend. </para>

I received a circular from a gentleman who said that he could not fry his fish in cotton-seed oil, because there was none to fry it in, and therefore he asked that peanut oil should be made free.

I do not suppose that they proposed a bounty without ascertaining that peanuts could be grown here. If they can, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> proposal must obviously be in antagonism to the growers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has introduced to the Ministers notice a phase of this matter which he ought to consider. The request means that peanuts are to be introduced for the purpose of making oil. For what purposes is that oil to be used?

One of the tenets of protection is that not only must you exclude the actual article which competes with a local article, but, to encourage the local manufacturer, you must exclude substitutes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> proposal is practically that we shall let in free a substance which may be converted into oil, which oil may be used in substitution for some other oil that we can make in Australia without introducing peanuts from abroad.

Now we have an industry in another State producing a very much larger output of another commodity, and we suddenly find the Government absolutely running away from all their professed protectionist principles and seeking to let in free an article which is grown in considerable quantities in the Commonwealth. </para>

But what is surprising to me is that the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> - who, if he has one plank in his platform at all of which,  he  is certain, professes to be quite sound in his desire to establish industries by means of protection - should now be found supporting a request to let in free a. commodity that is already being produced in the country. I really cannot understand it. As  . 1  free-trader, I should like all these goods to be made free. But I cannot see  why  we should let in peanuts free when we  put  a tax on all other nuts. It is not long since the Government brought clown a Bounties Bill in which they asked the sanction of Parliament for the expenditure of  public  money to encourage the growth of  peanuts.  I am not sure that that was not  the  one item about which the Government said that they would stake their existence. They were determined to foster this great industry of growing peanuts. But they lost their bounty, though the Government still goes on. I should have thought, however,  that  they would have retained some kindly feeling for this great industry. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not.  It  is an application of it that already finds its place in the Tariff as it found a place in the Tariff of1901. We have agreed that linseed shall pay a duty of 2s.;butunder item 72 linseed for the manufacture of oil and cake under departmental by-laws is free. That is not a departure from  the  principle observed in the previous Tariff. Linseed is grown to a considerable extent in the Commonwealth. I do not know  whether  it is grown in Queensland, but certainly it may be grown in Victoria and Tasmania. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  [4.21].  - There is no novelty iii admitting free of duty raw material to be used within the limitations of departmental by-laws ; but there is a great novelty in the application of this principle in order to destroy the protection that we profess to have given to a primary industry. -It is true that there are in this and the first Federal Tariff instances in which we have strained it, perhaps a good deal more than we ought to have done.

                    in regard to mustard seed, which the Government and the Committee refused to free. Even from a protectionist stand-point it is all a matter of comparison of benefits. The Committee refused to agree to a request to admit free of duty New Zealand blue cod because it was supposed that its free admission would take away some of the protection granted to our fisheries. With great respect to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline>
                    I should say that this is really a proposition to reduce" the Tariff to a farce. With one hand we grant protection - I am speaking now from the point of view of a protectionist - to a primary industry which every one admits ought to be fostered, whilst with the other we propose to take it away. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    has explained, the production of pea-  nuts in Queensland has been developed to the extent of  71,000  lbs. in a year, and I recollect that when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration there was a good deal of debate as to whether they ought to be dutiable. The protectionists then fought strongly for a duty in order to encourage local production. If peanuts are largely grown here it must be with the object of converting' them into oil. Ale we to take away the duty in respect to the great bulk of peanuts that are put into consumption ? No consideration was extended to the man who fries fish - alluded to by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    - who made a pathetic appeal to the Senate for the reduction of the duty on cotton seed oil. So far as my recollection goes, he said that peanut oil was inferior, or at all events that if we did not reduce the duty on cotton seed oil he would have to fry his fish in peanut oil. Despite the testimony of the- gentleman who fries fish, we are asked to-day to do an injury to the peanut-growers in order still . further to encourage the production of an inferior oil for the frying of fish. If there is one oil suitable for the frying of fish it is olive oil. Olive oil is the only oil in which fish to be eaten by human beings should be fried. Australia can produce it in any quantity, and I hope that we shall have a production that will render us independent of outside supplies. When we examine these ramifications -
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Clemons</inline>
                    spoke of them as the first step in the ladder - we see what difficulties confront us when we attempt to do this kind of thing. We get a ravelled scheme, and I do not wonder at the difficulties of the officials of the Customs Department in dealing with such matters. We have had 'a duty on peanuts which has been successful, and yet it is proposed to grant special f facilities for the free introduction of peanuts to make an inferior oil. My vote is not to be influenced in favour of a proposal simply because it contains the word "free." -I have to look at the result. My desire is that a proposal to free any import shall be beneficial to the consumer, and I think that the result of this proposition, would stultify what we have done in regard to other duties.

If we are to encourage commercial relations with any one, it ought to be with the people who live within our own boundaries rather than with the inhabitants of some other country. I have seen' acres and acres of peanuts growing in . Queensland. The peanut grows luxuriantly in portions of that State, and I am certain that with a little encouragement all that are required within the Commonwealth could be very easily grown there. That being the case, I do not see the slightest necessity for attempting to encourage a trade in this commodity with the Pacific Islands or any other portion of the world. This Tariff is admittedly one for the creation of industries. Peanut growing in Queensland-- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows as well as I do that no portion of the Commonwealth has benefited more largely from the Tariff than Sydney has. Many think that an industry, because it is small, is not worth encouraging; but a large number of small industries, in the aggregate,, give employment to a very considerable number of people. We ought more especially to give encouragement to such industries as lead to the settlement of people upon the soil. Although I believe in the encouragement of manufactures, I believe still more in doing anything that will assist the people to settle on the land.

                        <para>- I would point out that these nuts are grown' on the Darling Downs, in the Moreton, Burnett, Wide Bay, and Port Curtis districts, and it is said that a small quantity is produced as far north, as Rockingham Bay. This1 area, it will be conceded, embraces a great variety of climates, and as peanuts can be produced throughout it, it is patent that they, can be grown practically all over Australia. I. hope that those who have the interests of the farming industry at heart: - and we must recollect that it is the farmers who grow these peanuts - will support the duty. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is very much annoyed because we will not admit peanuts from China free. I cannot help that. I am here- </para>

Many of the articles which would ordinarily have fallen under this item have been specially removed from it in order that heavy protective duties might be imposed upon them. The result is that the item covers practically nothing which is produced in Australia. Consequently the duty proposed upon it is purely a revenue impost. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. The proposed duty is absolutely a revenue impost. It is a tax upon every woman who purchases from a grocer any of the articles included in it. When we were framing the first Commonwealth Tariff it was excusable for honorable senators to vote for revenue duties. But we all recognise that the revenue which will be derived from this Tariff will be enormous - far in excess of what is required for the purpose of government. Under these circumstances, why should we not remove the burden of taxation which will otherwise be imposed under this item? By so doing we shall not harm a single industry. Of course, it is an old illustration, but it frequently occurs to me that if every time a person bought groceries an official at his elbow said to him, " You have purchased groceries of so much value, and you must therefore hand over to the Government one-fifth of their cost," the effect of this Tariff would be much better appreciated. The duties levied under it average 20 per cent, upon foreign imports and 15 per cent, upon imports from the United Kingdom. If we were to translate this sort of taxation into our land and, income taxes there would be a revolution. The income tax amounts to one shilling in the £, or 5 per cent., and yet we regard it as a pretty stiff impost. But if a man upon drawing his income were informed by a Customs official that he must hand over one-fifth of it to the Government, what a nice hubbub there would be. I move - </para>

They include Bird foods, Black lead (for household use), Bakers' egg,  Brilliant-shine, Borax extract, Culinary essences (non-spirituous), Custard powders, Cloudy household ammonia, Condition foods, Dyes packed for household use, Flowers of sulphur in i-oz. packets, and Fruit crystals, Flavoring essences (non-spirituous), and Fire kind.ders- all of which are made here.

                    <para>. - If there were any items in the whole of the list which the Government and protectionists thought worthy of giving protection to, they would not allow them to be here at 20 per cent. They cannot even pretend that 20 per cent, is a protective duty from their point of view. This is a grab-all item. It includes a few things that may possibly be made here, but those in the opinion of the Government are so unimportant that ..there is no particular reason for applying protection -to them. It includes any amount of things that are not made here. It is not really a revenue duty, because 20 per cent, is far too high for that purpose. It is simply a grab-all duty, mixed up with a mild form of  casual occasional protection, in case it should be wanted. </para>

                    <para>. - The duty on this item is really only 15 per cent. That is the rate proposed in the second column, with a view to having such of these things as we must import imported as largely as possible from the United Kingdom. It is practically the old duty of 15 per cent., which is the recommendation, so far as there has been a recommendation in this case, of both sections of the Tariff Commission. From a protectionist point of view, the duty is in the nature of a prevention of fraud. It is a sort of drag-net item that catches quite a number of things not specially enumerated. If it were not there, some things which ought to be otherwise described might be introduced by a subterfuge under the head of oilmen's stores. I therefore suggest to protectionists at any rate, that the argument that this is a purely revenue duty is incorrect. Very objectionable results might follow if some such general provision were not included. In some instances, of course, it will prove to be a revenue duty, but in those cases we hope that it will be, not 20 per cent., but 15 per cent., on goods coming from the United Kingdom. </para>

But there are a number of articles which it is very difficult to separate, and we have in some general way to cover them, in order to prevent the escape from the protectionist principle - which the Senate has adopted, and many of us believe that the country has adopted - of a large number of items that are not otherwise enumerated. </para>

If that is the only reason why the duty has been increased to 20 per cent., then, if the request now before the Committee is negatived, we should at any rate put the duty back to 15 per cent. It is not fair to increase the duty against the housewife on approximately half in value of these oilmen's stores, which are absolutely required for household purposes. Certain articles included in this item do not come from England, simply because they are not made in England, and never would come from England as the country of origin, with the so-called 5 per cent. preference or any other preference that could be offered. In 1906 £1,555 worth came from Canada; £2,475 worth from Germany; and £26,351 worth from the United States of America. Perhaps the Vice-President of the Executive Council can tell us what particular goods are covered by those figures. At any rate, they are articles, so far as we can form any general opinion, which are not likely to come from England, and in respect of which the 5 per cent. preference is of no value whatever. The duty is simply being put up to 20 per cent. with the effect of increasing the cost to the ordinary householder. As these are things used generally in all households, I shall support the request to make them free. </para>

                    <para>. - I see from the schedule issued by the Government, under the column " Value or quantity of imports," that of the imports for 1906 £70,000 worth were dutiable, and £58,000 were free. Will any of those imports which were free under the old Tariff be now dutiable under this item ? </para>

                        <para>- That is satisfactory, but still some items which were previously free have evidently been transferred to this item, and will become dutiable. Therefore riot only is an increased duty proposed, but a number of articles which were previously on the free list are to be made dutiable. It is, of course, impossible to have all these articles enumerated . in a Tariff, but it makes it rather difficult for an ordinary member to know exactly what he is doing. I am quite prepared to support the old duty of 15 per cent, oh articles which were previously dutiable at that rate, but in this case I am also asked to put a duty of 15 per cent, upon a number of articles which were previously free. I have either to vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to retain on the free list things previously free, and also to take off the 15 per cent, duty which previously prevailed on a number of other articles, or I- must go to the other extreme, and vote to make dutiable articles which for the last six years have been free. </para>

The principle which is followed is to impose this duty on oilmen's stores in the case of groceries which are not specifically mentioned in the Tariff, and which are made up in packets, the idea being to induce their importation in bulk and their making up into packets here. So far as the Customs officers can remember, the only additional article that will be subject to duty under this item will lie invalids' foods.

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Government on their ability in embracing such, a large number of articles in one item, so as to  obtain the support of certain honorable senators on the Opposition side. Some honorable senators, who sit in opposition, were extremely strong in the statement that they would vote for no revenue duties, but only for such imposts as would be the means of encouraging manufactures. In respect of the major portion of the commodities embraced by this item, the duty will be absolutely a revenue duty; but seeing that some may be manufactured here, certain honorable senators are likely to be induced to put aside their principles and vote in favour of the Government proposal. I hope, however, that those honorable senators who were so strong in their denunciation of revenue duties will rise to the occasion, and vote for the request which has been proposed. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [5.10]. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council referred to what he called the main object of this item; but it strikes me that the main point for our consideration is that, under cover of this drag-net item, we are asked, in the absence of any information, to impose a duty on invalids' foods which have hitherto been admitted duty free. We are told that the. total quantity of oilmen's stores previously dutiable was represented by £70,000, while infants' and invalids' foods represented , £58,000 or £60,000, nearly as much as the general stores. We have no information as to the proportion of infants' foods to invalids' foods, and no word of reason or explanation is given for the proposed duty. If there is any argument which ought to impel us to make the whole item free, it is the proposal to make the duty 5 per cent. more than under the old Tariff, without any information being forthcoming as to how the imposition will affect either the revenue or the consumer. In view of the list of goods which are produced here, and which come under oilmen's stores, where is the necessity for raising the duty ?

                    <para>. - I appeal to the Ministry, and to every honorable senator, in reference to one commodity covered by this item. There is a very serious disease known as diabetes, and a Sydney doctor has in a letter drawn my attention to the fact that the special and necessary foods in such cases of affliction will, if this item passes, become dutiable. I am sorry I forgot to bring the letter with me, so that I cannot give the names of the particular preparations to which he refers; but, according to him, they are made by only one or two firms - I believe only one - in the world. They have previously been free, and now we are asked to impose on them a duty of 15 per cent. The doctor to whom I referred is the author of several books on the subject of dietetics, and while I cannot give particulars, I can say that these preparations are all marked by the absence of the sugar and starch found in the ordinary flour. Under the circumstances I do not think it necessary to make any further appeal to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the commodities to which I refer are substitutes for the ordinary flour, and are necessary because the presence of sugar or starch is most injurious to the sufferer from diabetes. Various efforts have been made in the past to secure a substitute for the ordinary flour, such as flour of nuts, but the latter was found unpalatable, and the preparations which I desire to be made free have been brought under my notice as supplying the want. These preparations are sufficiently dear, costing in some instances several shillings per lb., and while the duty might not add seriously to the price, still it ought not to be made more difficult to obtain the means of recovery. </para>

                    <para>.- One of the dangers of an item is that it throws enormous power into the hands of the departmental officers, and 1 think that a list of the commodities involved ought to be placed before us. An item of this . kind enables the Customs officers to vary duties week by week if they so choose, and it destroys uniformity as between different ports: The Tariff ought to be so' framed  that he who runs may read. The Customs officers are there to get as much revenue as they can for the Commonwealth, and to that end, of course, make dutiable every possible commodity. It appears to me dangerous to group articles together in this way, and I suggest that the item be postponed with a view to having a list of them placed before us. There are, for instance, aniline dyes, which, in my opinion, ought to be included , not in oilmen's stores, but with other dyes under item 239. </para>

                    If we pass this item we may find before long that certain articles which we have fixed at lower rates may, by some Ministerial or official hanky-panky, be included in oilmen's stores. The Ministerial decisions under the old Tariff are contained in a volume of the thickness of a family Bible, and the Minister spent more than one-half of his time in inventing taxation by certifying that goods not known to the Parliament when the Tariff was passed were something which could be taxed under one head or another. Here is an opportunity of the most' drag-net character afforded to the Minister. When we are dealing here with matters more or less indefinite or contentious, do we not always insist upon having an interpretation clause? Where is an interpretation clause provided for this item? We are asked positively to legislate in the dark. A larger power is given to the Minister under this item than under any previous item, and perhaps under any item with which we shall have to deal. Not out of any opposition to the Government, or to rational taxation that) will accord with previous items, but on account of its utter indefiniteness, I shall feel it my duty to oppose the item, and to support the request.

                <para class="block">Under the old Tariff the duty on oilmen's stores was 15 per cent., and that rate was recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission. We have not heard from the Government any reasons why it should be increased. The Minister is anxious no doubt to remove anomalies in the Tariff. Under this item soap dyes are made dutiable at 20 per cent. when not imported from the United Kingdom, but under item 239 dyes of different kinds are made dutiable at only 5 per cent. I do not know whether the Minister can offer any explanation for imposing two duties on the same article. He will observe that item 239 includes " dyes, dry or in paste, in bulk for manufacturing purposes." </para>

Another point is, why should the proposed provision be governed by departmental by-laws?

I thoroughly sympathize with what has been said with regard to invalids' foods, but I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> intended to cover all such foods. There is no more reason for the free admission of what are described as diabetic foods than for the free admission of other invalids' foods. It seems to me monstrous that one kind of invalids' food should be admitted free and other invalids' foods made dutiable.

                        <para>- Yes, the Department has experienced considerable difficulty, and there have been endless disputes with importers as to whether certain imports were or were not invalids' foods. It is quite understandable that some such preparations might be very suitable foods for invalids and equally suitable for persons who are not invalids. The request proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> provides for something specific, which is to exempt from duty invalids' diabetic foods. That honorable senator, when speaking on this subject some little time ago, in connexion with previous items, indicated that information supplied to him, and which he gave to the Committee, went to show that certain imported  preparations in the nature of foods were required for invalids suffering from diabetes, and that from such food preparations the elements of starch and sugar had been eliminated. It would be a very easy matter for the departmental officers to ascertain what preparations of that kind were being imported for the use of invalids, and by by-law to specifically prescribe that they should be exempt from duty under the item suggested by the honorable senator. Then if it were found that the list of such foods exempted from duty did. not comprise special foods which should be included in it, the Department could extend the list of specific articles exempted. It would be advantageous also in tending to  avoid the  disputes that would arise at the particular time the importations were made. Preparations have been imported in connexion with which the claim has been made that they should be duty free, because they are largely used by invalids, and this has led, as I 'have said, to endless disputes. </para>

                        <para>- We have already under other items of the Tariff imposed protectionist duties upon food preparations which can be manufactured in the Commonwealth, and which, though used by invalids, are also in general use, and to admit the claim that because imported foods are used by invalids they should be admitted duty free would be to undermine the general  prin.ciple  of the Tariff. Under the heading pf "Meats - Poultry and Game" we dealt last night with several preparations of foods which are used generally by the public, and especially in certain circumstances, by invalids, and it would be wrong if we were to say that foods which might be used by invalids should be admitted duty free when we know that they are in general use and can be manufactured within the Commonwealth. If the request were amended as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> desires, it would practically place the Customs revenue and the 'Tariff policy of the Commonwealth in the hands of the importers, who might designate many an article as an invalid's food. With regard to the use of the phrase " as prescribed by departmental by-laws," honorable senators will see that is necessary, because if the' request be carried it' would be for the Department later on to lay down what particular articles came within the designation of invalids' diabetic food. That would not be putting the Tariff policy, as declared by Parliament, into the hands of the Department to be varied, but merely giving administrative effect to what we desire to provide for by our legislation. It is also in accordance with the usual practice, and I ask whether it is not better to leave it tb officers of the Customs Department to administer the wishes of Parliament in this regard than to carry a request in the wide terms suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and thus lea.ve in the hands of importers the determination as to whether a particular imported article is or is not an invalid's food? I hope the Committee will not extend the request, submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to the length suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline></para>

With respect to invalids' foods we have it suggested that they should not be admitted free because they might be made here. A principle like that is in my opinion a disgrace to any ordinary civilization. I consider the request, as moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> a miserable pretext since it would limit the free admission of these foods, which are purely medicinal, to what the Government for the time being might decide could not be made here. What a miserable thing it would be for us in this Tariff to say that the members of our Buffering humanity afflicted with the one disease of diabetes should be. allowed to get the medical preparations they require free, whilst every man, woman and child suffering from any of the other innumerable diseases should not be included in the beneficent category sought to be established for the benefit of people suffering from diabetes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has told us that " as prescribed by departmental by-laws," means that " the matter will be left in the hands of the Department, but we know that it means that it will be left in the hands of the Ministry of .the day, and. what is. proposed is that the Ministry for- the time being shall say that certain classes of invalids' foods shall not be admitted free because they would be in competition with some preparations made in Australia. I object to departmental by-laws, and' still further to the ' Ministry being allowed to make the Tariff. That is the duty of Parliament. The more provisos we have in this Tariff for limitations to be decided by departmental by-laws the more completely Parliament will be abrogating its own powers and functions and handing over to the Government of the day the power to frame the Tariff. </para>

                            may find it in accordance with his views on Tariff reform to joke on the subject of invalids, but I cannot. The honorable senator is prepared to impose the highest possible duty on medical foods. He has done so already, and no doubt will do so again. He is 'ready to attempt a sort of joke now when we are dealing with the foods required as remedies for a particular kind of disease. I congratulate the honorable senator upon being able to smile at another man's suffering.

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that a certain kind of invalids' food should be admitted duty free; but I am also of the opinion that we should ascertain what other manufactures properly come under the term " invalids' food," and allow them to be admitted free. We might well put our fiscal opinions on one side in this matter, and let our humanity have full play. The special preparations manufactured to be used by invalids could be defined if the Minister would consult one or two reputable medical men, and it behoves him to take the matter into his serious consideration. I think that a list of invalids' foods should be supplied, so that we may know what preparations are so designated, and allow such as we may deem fit to be admitted free, or at a very low duty. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend will find a vast number of diseases set out in any medical dictionary, and he must know that there are thousands of persons in the Commonwealth who suffer from them, for whose treatment certain special preparations are required. The fact that imported invalids' foods are largely needed is evidenced by the importations of  1906.  I have moved to amend the request by leaving out the word " diabetic," so that it may apply to all invalids' foods, which were free under the old Tariff. There is no reason why we should discriminate. But after what has fallen from the Minister of Home Affairs I am convinced that it would be unwise to omit the words " subject to departmental regulations," and therefore I shall not. move, their elimination. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.Colonel</inline> GOULD (New South Wales) [6.5].- I sympathize very much with the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and still more with that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I certainly think that it would be a wise thing to allow invalids' foods to come in free as they have done hitherto. I should like to point out that if the Senate is strong enough to insist upon striking out diabetic foods there ought not to be much difficulty in carrying the request as amended. If there are honorable senators, however, who vote for the amendment with the intention of afterwards voting to negative the request altogether, well and good. It has been suggested that it would be well to have a schedule of the various articles which we desire to have admitted free. But as there is no prospect of obtaining the schedule, the next best thing is to provide that invalids' food shall be admitted free under departmental bylaws. Then we shall know exactly what kinds of food receive the benefit of this provision, and there will be no difficulty as to foods coming in free that it is desirable to tax. If any honorable senator considers that the list is too large or too small, it will always be open to review, and the wishes of Parliament can at any time be made known. It has been said that we have already agreed to tax certain invalids' foods. Malt extract and peptonized  foods have a certain duty imposed upon them. It is argued that a difficulty will arise if we treat other foods differently. But I am at a loss to see how any difficulty can occur if the foods to be admitted free are prescribed by regulation. </para>

                        <para>- That being the case, there will be no difficulty in dealing with it. When the list is being made out . by the Department the officers will naturally look round and see what articles Parliament has already declared taxable, and whatever Parliament has determined shall bear a duty will be omitted from the list. By that means the decision of Parliament with regard to duties on certain goods will be maintained. The list will only contain those foods which are not mentioned in the Tariff as taxable. I intend to vote for the omission of the word " diabetic," in order subsequently to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> proposal that invalids' foods as a whole shall be admitted free. It may be that the Committee will decide that these foods shall not be admitted free at all. All that I can say is that if Parliament is so negligent in the interests of invalids it must take the responsibility, but it will be an unfortunate decision not to give invalids the opportunity of obtaining the foods that they require as cheaply as possible, as they have done in the past. </para>

                    <para>. -  In venturing to say few words, I may remark that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> leads the Opposition I always understand his attitude. But this afternoon there are two leaders, who apparently are aiming at a determination as to which of them shall be the greater. I am therefore a little bit confused as to what they mean. I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> proposal, but I will not go further. Let me give an instance as to what might happen if we declared all invalids' food free. I had been a teetotaller for about twenty-five years or over. But some years ago I suffered from an attack of inflammation of the lungs. I was attended by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. -</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> - Cockburn, who prescribed something that was practically unknown to me, namely, brandy. It was a case of life and death. It was with the greatest difficulty that I was pulled through. During that time, my wife tells me, I consumed a gallon of brandy. In that case would brandy have been considered an invalid's food? I feel sure that if a medical man had given me a certificate to the effect that brandy was necessary to keep me alive, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> if he had happened to be Minister of Trade and Customs, would have recognised that I had a claim to have my brandy duty free. After the brandy treatment ceased <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cockburn</inline> prescribed porter for me. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> contention both brandy and porter in such circumstances would be invalids' food. I do not mention these circumstances to advertise myself, but to show the inconsistency of those honorable senators who appear to me to be marking time this afternoon and contending amongst themselves as to which leader shall be the greater. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proposes anything I do at all events understand what he means, and I give him credit for being honest and straightforward. But when others come into the field and jump the claim, and give us evidence of their plausibility in debate after having been two days away from the Senate, it seems to me a bit peculiar. I do not want to kill time, but I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to answer this question :  Are they prepared to maintain that brandy, porter, and other liquors of that kind, when prescribed by a doctor, shall be considered invalids' foods? If that be so, from what source are we to get our revenue ? </para>

                    <para>. - I think it will be admitted that on the. ground of humanity it is desirable to admit invalids' foods duty free. The first objection made to that is by the Minister, on the ground that it would be very difficult for the Customs officers to discriminate between certain kinds of invalids' foods. It is quite true that there would be difficulty, but the officers are appointed to get over such difficulties, and unless the Minister can assure me that they are insuperable I shall be inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in his effort to get all these foods placed on the freelist. </para>

Honorable senators on this side who have held office in States Administrations, have not found an insuperable difficulty in the way of administering Tariffs providing for the free admission of invalids' foods. I should like some clearer explanation as to the alleged impossibility of giving effect to this proposal, without conflicting with our previous decisions, by calling to our aid the scientific knowledge of the Department, and embodying it in departmental by-laws.

I do not think that a majority of honorable senators would support such a proposition, but I believe that a majority of the Committee, having listened to the debate, are prepared to agree to a. request providing for the free admission of invalids' foods which cannot be manufactured in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the desire of the majority, surely we ought not to allow our feelings, and perhaps our prejudices, to reject the opportunity to obtain at least something in the direction that we desire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made a statement which has been accepted, that a certain food most valuable to those suffering from diabetes cannot be made in Australia. Will any honorable senator say that there is no food equally valuable in the case of persons suffering from other diseases to which the same statement will not apply? If it can be shown that there is no other food coming within the same category, we may safely carry the request in its restricted form. We have to remember, however, that this Tariff may stand for years; that science is always being applied to the investigation of diseases ; that at any time a food product which may be most useful in the case of persons suffering from some other diseases may be discovered, and that if the request be restricted, as proposed, such a food would be dutiable. We know, for instance, that consumption destroys the tissues of the body, and that scientists are aiming at the discovery of some food which will build up those tissues more rapidly than they are destroyed by the disease. If, after we have dealt with the Tariff, such a food is discovered, the position will be that by agreeing to the request in its restricted form we shall shut the door against its free admission. I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council would be doing himself justice if, because of certain statements made at the outset of this debate, he shut the door on the possibility of other invalids' foods being treated in exactly the same spirit as he is prepared to treat diabetic foods. If the request be accepted in the limited form proposed, it will shut out some other foods fulfilling all the conditions in respect of other diseases which this food fulfils in the case of persons suffering from diabetes, and which cannot possibly be manufactured in Australia. If, on the other hand, we pass the request in the form suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> the Government will have the power to say that a certain diabetic food is the only food whose free admission can be prescribed. </para>

                        <para>- I understand then that the Minister has sufficient confidence in the present Minister of Trade and Customs to believe that under this provision he would not allow any food that could be made in Australia at a fair price to come in free. If he fears that some future Minister of Trade and Customs might allow all sorts, of things to come in free under a provision of this kind, what is the position ? The Minister, who had behind him in Parliament a majority willing to allow him to let all sorts of things come in free under a provision of this kind, would, have a majority to support an amendment of the law allowing for their free admission. That being so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and those who think with him are really fighting shadows. They admit the value of the food referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ; they know that it is so valuable that it should be admitted free, and that being so, why should they not be prepared in the same spirit of. reasonableness to open the door to other invalids' foods, leaving the key in the hands' of a protectionist Minister of Trade and Customs. </para>

                    <para>. - When the sitting was suspended, we were discussing an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> upon a request by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to the effect that the word " diabetic ' ' should be excised, so that invalid foods might be admitted free under departmental regulation. I should like to do all that I can to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in the direction in- which he is endeavouring to lead the Committee; but at the same time, I wish, if possible, to satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and those who regard this question from a similar point of view. I therefore ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to accept a suggestion which I believe will meet the views of all those who have .the interests of Australian industries at heart, and will at the same time test the sincerity of those who desire that invalid foods shall be admitted duty free under any circumstances. But, before offering this suggestion, I wish to point out that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment Be agreed to a great deal may happen that we do not desire to happen. . In this matter we have to guard against what may be as well as what has been. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment be accepted by the Committee, the time may come when <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Minister may have sufficient influence to admit almost any invalid food under departmental regulation, irrespective of whether it was manufactured in the Commonwealth, or whether it could be profitably manufactured here. Of course, our idea is that no Minister would so act, in view of his responsibility to Parliament. But wo know what 'has been done in the past. We are all familiar with the difficulties that have arisen when Ministers have had almost uncontrolled power. That is the reason why many of us who desire to preserve and encourage Australian industries consider it is necessary that we should always be. on our guard. The suggestion which I make to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is that after the word " diabetic" the words "and other invalid foods not manufactured in the Commonwealth," be inserted. If his proposal were put in that form, I do not think that a single member of this Committee would oppose it. If, in the future, any food should be. manufactured in - any part of the world that would facilitate the recovery of invalids, I think that we should all be anxious to make it available to them at the cheapest possible price. That is the reason why I offer the suggestion to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If he is prepared to accept it, I shall vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's'</inline> proposal. I should like to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has to say upon the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - Before dealing with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> I should like to make a few comments upon previous criticisms of my proposal. I was both surprised, and a little bit hurt, at the tone of some of those criticisms. Several of the speeches delivered almost made it .appear that I had put forward a proposal, the effect of which would be to exclude certain invalid foods. Now, the true position was. that as the Tariff stands it excludes all invalid foods unless they pay the duty. Up till the time that I submitted my amendment no definite proposal had been made to admit invalid foods free. The door was- barred against them. I asked the Committee to open the door in respect of one class 'of foods, and I was immediately attacked for not attempting to admit the remainder* I merely asked the honorable senators to join with me in opening the door to let in some invalid foods which ought to be admitted free. It is unjust, therefore, to criticise my proposal as if I had been guilty of shutting the door against other articles of a similar character. If the Committee will adopt the proposal to allow of the freest importation of foods required by invalids I shall be delighted. It was not from any desire to oppose a proposition of that kind that I limited my amendment. But I do not profess to think of everything, or to know everything. My attention having been particu-larly directed to one class of invalid foods, I simply moved in the direction of placing them upon the free list. I quite recognise that there are a great many invalid foods being made in Australia, and it was not unreasonable that my protectionist friends should demur about admitting them free. I know that the particular class of foods specified in my proposal are not manufactured within the Commonwealth, and, therefore, it. seemed to me preferable to make certain of securing their free admission, than to risk gaining nothing by  overloading my proposal. If the Committee will join me in still further opening the door for the admission of invalid foods I shall be delighted. What is the best way of achieving that result? The question which arises is, " Can we devise a suggestion which will enable us to give fairly free entry to goods of this kind without exciting the' opposition of those who hold protectionist principles " ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> suggestion seems to me to possess the merit of being practicable. As a free-trader, I should like all invalid foods to be admitted free. But the protectionists in this Chamber, who, unfortunately, are in a majority, say, " We will meet you to the extent of agreeing to request the other House to limit your proposal to invalid foods which are not made in the Commonwealth." That is not the suggestion which I made, but it is one which will give me more than I shall get if I decline to accept it. Now, I want to obtain as much as I. can, and because I cannot get all that I want, I am not going to be so foolish as to refuse to take what I can get. Therefore, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> moves to amend my  proposal in the direction he has indicated, I shall be found supporting him. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> seemed completely to misapprehend the purport of my remarks when I was addressing the Committee prior to the suspension of the sitting. He declared that I was prepared to leave the admission of invalid foods to departmental by-laws.  What I advocated was that we should agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> proposal, and that we should then allow the Minister an opportunity to make inquiries amongst those who have most knowledge of this matter, with a view to his bringing up, at a later stage, a list of articles of which we might approve. I did not propose to leave the admission of these foods to departmental officers. I objected to the admission of the articles covered by the previous portion of this item being left to departmental officers, because it might include hundreds of commodities. But, in the present instance, only a limited number of articles will be affected, and we should be able at once to know what can be done. </para>

It does not seem to  me  that there is very much difference between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> proposal and the suggestion thrown out by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> because whatever departmental by-law may be made will be subject to revision and approval by the Senate. There are scarcely any invalid foods which cannot Joe made in Australia.. The question is, " At what cost can they be made ? " In considering this matter, we have to recollect that invalids frequently suffer great stress from a pecuniary stand-point. Consequently, every consideration should be extended to them, and they should* 'be permitted to obtain needful remedies as cheaply as possible. Whilst I am quite in favour of allowing the use of invalid foods manufactured in Australia where they can be produced of as good a quality and at as cheap a price as can the imported article, I am not going to allow my fiscal opinions to stand in the way of the recovery of any afflicted person. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not accept- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment. It would be an exceedingly dangerous provision to put on the statute-book. We have already passed several important items in the Tariff, including such items as potted or concentrated meats, extracts of meat, and meat jellies, soup in tins or other air-tight vessels, malt extracts, and similar articles which it is recognised are made in Australia. We have imposed in each of those cases a specific duty with the object of encouraging their manufacture in Australia. My first objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> proposition is that it opens the door far too wide. It places great responsibilities in the hands of the Minister upon whom devolves the duty of duly administering this Act, and who is necessarily subject to pressure in the discharge of his duties. If a proviso of this sort were inserted, the Minister would be at once deluged with applications from various firms claiming that the foods which they sought to introduce were invalids' foods. I wish honorable senators to deal with this question from the Tariff standpoint - from an essentially practical stands point - and to eliminate all that sympathy which we must necessarily feel in discussing a subject in which invalids are concerned. The Minister would have to recognise that it was the desire of Parliament that invalids' foods should be admitted free.  His  first difficulty would be to ascertain who are invalids. The condition of being an invalid is more or less a matter of degree. You cannot say that one man is an invalid while another, who may be a little better in health in some directions, is not. The broad generic term of " invalid " embraces an enormous number of foods. Take for instance the well-known meat extract called Bovril. </para>

                        <para>- But it is undoubtedly an invalids' food. Suppose some Minister in the exercise of an honest discretion regarded Bovrilasan invalids' food. He would then be admitting free an article which would come in direct conflict with certain items in the Tariff, and affect an industry that we are anxious to cultivate and develop. Take as another instance that of Nestle's invalids' food. Suppose it were rumoured that Nestle's people intended to start that industry in Australia, and some one else with greater power and influence secured the free admission of a similar invalids' food. That at once would discount the enterprise of the individual who was seeking to start the local industry. By those means the items of the Tariff, one after another, could be defeated. I admit at once that it is necessary in certain cases to allow the Minister some degree of elasticity in the administration of the Tariff. But we have to limit that as far as possible, and to make known in the terms of the Tariff exactly what we mean. If, however, we give to the discretion of the Minister so wide a range as is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> it is quite possible that in the honest discharge of a Minister's duty many leading and important features of the Tariff would be defeated. That would be most undesirable. I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment regarding a particular food which is specially useful for diabetic patients. When we know exactly what the limitation is, we have no hesitation in accepting such a suggestion, if we are sure also that the particular food cannot be manufactured here. There is no objection to the admission of that particular class of invalids' food. But it would be impossible to give a wide range of exemption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has suggested that we could arrive at what was intended, consistently with what we have already done in the Tariff, by the admission of those recognised invalids' foods which are not made in Australia. As our main object is to cultivate industries, such as the making of particular invalids' foods, there can be no reasonable objection to the admission of others which are not made in Australia. The Government have no hesitation in accepting ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> suggested amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment. Unless we have limitations such as are suggested by those two honorable senators, we shall subject the Tariff to menaces and dangers to which we are not justified in exposing it. We should not open the door so widely as has been suggested, but can well express what we intend by means of the two amendments I have mentioned. </para>

Who is to define an invalid ? Is the definition to be left to the departmental head? If it is, the door will be opened 'so far that honorable senators will be sorry they opened it at all. The Department evidently had this matter under serious consideration long before the Tariff reached this Chamber. The opinion of

                        <para>- I do not know of any doctor's evidence to the effect that these goods Cannot be manufactured in Australia. There is a disposition on' the part of some medical men to prescribe certain prepared foods or medicines, whereas more highly scientific practitioners have a preference for natural foods free from any adulteration. I feel sure I am speaking for every member of the Labour Party when I say that we do not desire to impose any burden or hardship on the invalid, but, at the same time, if there can lie made in Australia foods which are considered by scientific men to be more suitable than the imported foods, even . though the local variety may be a little higher in price, it would be wise to encourage the establishment of the industry in Australia.' However, I promise that .when requests are submitted later, rio vote of mine shall be cast in the way that will place any disability on the sufferer. </para>

                    <para>. - We listened for some considerable time to- the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who elaborated an argument to the effect that in dealing with the Tariff we must make known what we mean ; that we must avoid any wide range, and take care that, in the discharge of our duty, we do not embarrass or place Ministers in an inconvenient position. The honorable gentleman went on to say that unless we are very careful the policy of the country can be defeated, and, further, that unless we know with fair precision what the limitation is, we should not hesitate to provide against the possibility of these foods coming in, and. so on. I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> what is meant by the very next item, which places infants' foods, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, on the free list how he proposes to apply his argument to that item. There is an infinite variety of infants' foods which are made all over the world ; indeed, I venture to say that the item covers a far wider range than that of invalids' foods. We have been told that the Government are determined to adhere to the Tariff as presented, but with what appearance of consistency - though ' I suppose we shall hear some sort of plausible argument - can the Minister defend the item of infants' foods, and refuse to subject invalids' foods to the same departmental by-laws ? I am sorry there has been such a lot of hypocrisy displayed over this item. No hypocrisy could be more evident than that of a man who declares that he will not permit invalids' foods to come in free unless it is clearly proved that they are not made in Australia, while, at the same time, he is prepared to admit infants' foods free under departmental by-laws. Is the policy of protection so sacred that it outweighs every other consideration? In fear of a remote chance of something toeing imported for invalids which is made in Australia, the interests of invalids are to be thrown on one side, with the paltry contemptible exception that if it be proved the foods are not made in Australia - and I know that that means also any substitute - they shall be allowed to come in free. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> talks about promoting peace ; but I ask him whether, after the closest scrutiny, not only by Parlia1ment, but by Ministers and the whole of the officials of the Department, it is found that an article is not made in Australia, it is not the common custom to allow it to come in free? What extra concession then is proposed for invalids' food ? None at all. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will adhere to his request; and, guarded "as his motion is, I hope that, even at this late hour, protectionist senators will see their way to place this commodity on the same footing as infants' foods. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [8.25]. - This proposal of the Government is on all-fours with proposals that have already been accepted by the Committee. The Government are wilfully and persistently insisting on taxing sickness and ill-health - are seeking to decimate the population by duties on the food of the sick. Infants are to be  destroyed wholesale bv this Ministry. I say deliberately that the policy of the Ministry is a direct menace to infant life ; and I hope that what I say will be remembered. This is a wicked Ministry. I do not know whether I should be ruled out of order if I described such doings as  approaching criminal acts; but, if I were, the statement would still be uncommonly near the truth. It is criminal to place difficulties in the way of the rearing of young infants or of the healing of the sick. All through the Tariff are to be found penalties on infant life - on having children and on being sick; the Tariff bristles with assaults on infant life and on invalids.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    has told us that the proposed request would involve the Ministry determining whether or not a person was sick ; and I am not sure that the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not say something of the same sort. But, as a matter of fact, the proposal is not that the degree of sickness should be determined, but the suitability of the article to repair the ravages of ill-health.

                    <para>. - Partly in response to direct questions from this side the Vice-President of the Executive Council has given an explanation. It confirms our contention. It amounts to this : that because the Minister may make a mistake in determining what is or is not an invalid's food, therefore the Government will exclude all invalids' foods. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is trying to extricate them from an absurd position by a sort of side-track. The more the matter is discussed, the more apparent it seems to be that the Minister has at his command sufficient scientific and medical skill to guide him in framing departmental by-laws. If one thing has been made clearer than another, it is the untenable and, it may be, unfortunate position into which the Government have got themselves by their obstinacy and, if I may use the phrase, their want of appreciation of the real difficulties of the situation. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> succeeds in getting specifically named foods included in the request it will be entirely out of harmony with the item as it stands, because the latter is general in its significance. </para>

                        <para>- There is no particular food mentioned. The word " diabetic " covers a variety .of different classes. The request speaks of a class, but the honorable senator proposes to include particular preparations, which are specifically mentioned. If the Committee negative his amendment it may afterwards be taken by the Department that its desire in sending the request to another place was that those particular foods should not be added. If on the other hand my honorable friend will not press his proposal it is quite possible that they will come in under the general designation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> proposes to insert in the request. </para>

Are all foods of that sort to be admitted free under this item, or is it possible that many of them will be excluded, because it may be said that similar articles are being made in Australia? In what way will the provision be administered? </para>

                    <para>. - Senators Clemons and Neild have raised a question which requires a little consideration. In the next item covering infants' . food Ministers have preferred to have regard for the necessity for infant nourishment to enforcing their great policy' of protection, but in this case they propose to prefer their policy of protection rather than make, provision for the comfort and nourishment of invalids. Why cannot protectionists on the other side give invalids and sick people the benefit of the doubt? Is the protectionist policy to dominate the view they will take of every appeal made to them," no matter for whom we plead ? We are pleading now for invalids in asking that the foods they require shall be admitted free of duty. I wish to ask the Minister what is exactly the effect of the use of the expression ' ' as prescribed by departmental by-laws'" as used in the next item. Would it enable the Government to prevent the free admission of  Mellin's  Food on the ground that it was manufactured in the Commonwealth? </para>

What I .am dealing with now is an effort which is being made to permit the free importation of foods considered necessary for invalids-, whether similar foods are made in Australia or not. If a desirable food for invalids is not made in Australia, we, on this side, are prepared to agree that it should be admitted1 free, but if it ' is being" manufactured in Australia, as protectionists we say' that there is no need to admit it free. </para>

The honorable senator has said that under the next item the Government have preferred infant life to their protectionist policy, but that in this case they are preferring their protectionist policy to invalid life. I cannot see the slightest practical difference in the wording of the next item and that proposed to be introduced into the request which I have moved. Honorable senators will see that under the next item infants' food is not admitted free, but subject to the policy of the Government of the day. </para>

I paid  2s.  6d. for an imported preparation recommended by a chemist for an invalid, and when I showed it to the doctor who was attending the invalid-, he said, " It is very good stuff, but if you took one pound of flour, and let it rest on a griddle for a little time, you would get exactly the same thing for about twopence." According to the schedule; it is proposed to put a tax of  15  per cent. on all medicines, although they surely are as necessary for invalids as are the so-called foods. </para>

                        <para>- No; and if we wish to deal with the whole matter comprehensively and properly, we should postpone this item until the duties on medicines come before us. I think those duties are too high, and am willing to reduce them. It would be mischievous to give to the Customs Department the right to say what shall and what shall not be dutiable. The Minister must have certain administrative powers ; but we should not unduly enlarge those powers, or put him in the invidious position of having to say what foods can and what -foods cannot be manufactured in Australia. Cod-liver oil is an article which might very well come under the description " Invalids' food." </para>

But if it was to be amended we wanted it to be altered in as unobjectionable a form as possible. The original proposal of the Government with respect to infants-' food was to put a tax upon it. That was altered by the House of Representatives, with the effect of placing the item in the form in which it is now. With the object of safeguarding the public in the way I have explained, by an assurance that these infants' foods, whenever they come into the Commonwealth, shall be under close examination, I 'think the provision is really unobjectionable. But so far as invalids' foods are concerned, I should prefer that no amendment whatever was made. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to ask the Vice-President of the ' Executive Council whether it is intended that the list of the foods to come in free shall be published? "When the Tariff was introduced in another place there was a heavy duty on all these goods, and the consequence was that the sellers increased prices to the amount to which the duty was put up. I know as a fact that in spite of this item being amended in another place some sellers are still charging the additional price for these articles that they commenced to charge when the Tariff was  introduced. </para>

When, however, it is imported n.e.i., it is to be dutiable at 15 per cent. That is no answer to the question which I have asked. I want to know why, whether it is classed as oilmen's stores or not, it is' dutiable at 15 per cent, unless it is imported in sheets? Surely we are entitled to an answer to that question. . </para>

The reason why I ask that question is that apparently, from the statistics we have before us, the only isinglass imported was under one heading. The Unite8 Kingdom supplied 18,504 lbs., whilst the total imports were 50,183 lbs. According to those figures isinglass does not seem to have been imported in any other shape than in sheets.

If the item is carried' in the form in which it is presented the Customs will continue to administer it in respect to isinglass as they have done since 1901. Isinglass in sheets has "been admitted duty free, whilst isinglass in strips - imported generally by grocers and sold for domestic uses - paid 15 per cent, as oilmen's stores. That is the difference that we are endeavouring  to preserve. Isinglass imported in sheets is, I understand, used in various trades and occupations. It is used to some extent in photography. </para>

The honorable senator was a member of the Tariff Commission, .which- made, no recommendation with regard to this item. I take it that the onus of proof is upon those who want to disturb existing conditions.  So far from the proposed alteration simplifying administration, it will cause complication by taking isinglass in strips out of the category of oilmen's stores, in which the Customs has been in the habit of dealing with it. I hope the Committee will not support' the honorable, senator's request. </para>

The Commission was appointed to take evidence and report upon it. We took no evidence as to isinglass, and. from my point of view, if we had made any report on this subject we should have been departing from the terms of our commission. I should have considered, if we had reported on any item about which we had no evidence, that we should simply have been saying, ' ' These are only the individual opinions of such and such members of the Tariff Commission." </para>

                        <para>- I do not attempt to rival or approach the honorable senator in sheer hypocrisy. If isinglass is used as an article of food, we who are attempting to rectify anomalies are asked to tax it at 15 per cent. Does any one want it to be taxed because it is used as food; while it is allowed to be imported duty free if it is to be used in a factory ? Of course, the Committee may decline to bother about such a thing, but I venture to say that we shall not be doing our duty, which the public expect of us, if when we come across an error like this we do not alter it.. It will be only natural for a member of the public to say, " What kind of a Parliament is this? When the Senate had isinglass before them they decided that when I use it in the kitchen it shall pay 15 per cent., whilst my next-door neighbour who has a factory gets it free. Is that the way Parliament deals with the Tariff?" Why does the Minister hesitate? I think he ought to accept my request at once, and be glad to remove such an anomaly. </para>

I shall not, however, take the responsibility of moving it. A duty of 25 per cent. is surely sufficient. It is the recommendation' of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission; it is 10 per cent. higher than the recommendation of the free-trade section, and 10 per cent. higher than the duty under the old Tariff. I am therefore moving a request of the most moderate character, and hope that it will receive support. </para>

                    <para>. - The duty which we levy upon this item will determine the price that we shall have to pay for the rice that we eat. The impost proposed represents decidedly more than 50 per cent., which I really think is too much. I admit that we have already authorized the payment of a small bounty which must not exceed £1,000 in any one year, to encourage the production of rice in the Commonwealth. But I venture to say that that item in the Bounties Bill was the one to which even Queensland representatives attached the least importance. Everybody must admit that for many years we shall not be able to produce sufficient rice to meet our own requirements.. I am satisfied that the duty proposed cannot be required for protective purposes. If any honorable senator is desirous of reducing the" price of rice as an article of diet, this is the item upon which he ought to vote for a decrease of the duty. In the Commonwealth, the only industry carried on in connexion with rice is the cleaning of it. This Tariff is evidently designed to promote the cleaning of rice as a serious industry in our midst, and the way in which it is proposed to accomplish that result is by taxing uncleaned rice at 3s. 4d. per cental, and rice, n.e.i., including rice meal and flour, at 6s. per cental. Despite the fact that by my action I may be assisting an industry such as the starch industry, I move - </para>

                    <para>. - In proposing this duty, the undoubted intention of the Government is to assist, by means of a protective policy, the production of rice in the Commonwealth. Honorable senators will recollect that last year a proposal was embodied in the Bounties Act to encourage the production of rice in Australia. In the schedule of that measure provision was made for the payment of a bounty of 20s. per ton, though the amount in the aggregate was not to exceed £1,000 in any one year. The bounty is to continue for a period of five years. At the time that the bounty was proposed, the duty operative upon uncleaned rice was that which we now propose, namely, 3s. 4d. per cental. It was thought that the duty and the bounty conjoined would be a sufficient inducement to some of the land-holders in the northern parts of Australia to devote a portion of their holdings to the cultivation of rice. A majority of members of the Parliament having assented to the principle contained in that Act, I hope that this Committee will not, during the period of the operation of the bounty, abolish the import duty upon rice, which was an important factor that was taken into consideration at the time. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is aware that the Bounties Act only came into force from the 1st of July last, and that its operation is limited to five years. It would be idle for us to enter upon an experiment of that character, if, within twelve months of sanctioning it, we were to remove some of the conditions which were regarded at the time as most important factors. I hope the Committee will not disturb the arrangement then come to, because it is only by the combined operation of those two provisions that we can expect any attention to be given to rice culture on a commercial scale in Australia. Provision is made later on in the Tariff for the importation under departmental by-laws of rice for conversion into starch. Those who take advantage of that, and make starch in the Commonwealth out of rice, have since 1 90 1 been subject to an Excise duty on a.11 the starch which they manufacture. It is not proposed to alter that provision. The duty paid in respect of this item is no insignificant amount so far as the States revenues are concerned. It amounted to £33,528 on uncleaned rice in 1906. </para>

                        <para>- A loss" of £33,000 per annum spread over the Commonwealth is of no mean consequence, to many of the States. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to say that that tells against us because it amounts to a duty upon food, but if it is shown that the amount received in duty on any item is very small, honorable senators opposite rise one after another to say, " The Government are asking us to impose this duty for the trifling sum of a few pounds." When, on the other hand, the amount collected happens to be of considerable consequence to the States revenues, my honorable friends cry, "Look at the amount of taxation imposed upon the people." The abolition of this duty would mean a sacrifice of over £"30,000. We have to get revenue from somewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - Had the Minister said, " We are trying to get revenue from everywhere," I should have regarded- his remarks as more aptly describing this Tariff. This great industry of rice-growing was responsible last year for some 700 bushels of rice being produced in Australia. The Customs publication gives the value of rice as 9s. a cental. Assuming that the weight of .a bushel of rice corresponds somewhat to that of ordinary cereals, it is clear that the rice raised in Australia last year cost the taxpayer about £140 or £150 per cental. </para>

                        <para>- -Then I am exaggerating the value of last year's Australian crop. The duty paid upon undefined rice in 1906 was £33,528. I do not say that is a reason why we should remove the duty, but if, - to foster an industry the production of which is quite nominal, the taxpayers have to pay over £33,000, it is clear that that is hardly a protective duty in the ordinary sense. The question then' is whether it is desirable to continue it as a revenue duty. </para>

                <para>Cleaned rice, which pays 6s. per cental, was imported in an even greater quantity. As the difference between the duties on cleaned and uncleaned rice is 2s. 8d. a cental, it is evident, as a larger quantity of the cleaned. rice came in, that those who imported uncleaned rice and cleaned it here must have put on the full measure of the difference. If they bring it in at 3s. 4d. uncleaned, and their competitors pay 6s. for bringing in cleaned rice, they will certainly raise their price, after cleaning it, to the same figure as is charged by the man who pays the higher duty. If the whole of the rice was imported uncleaned by different warehousemen, and they were able to supply the whole of our rice requirements, I admit that .that argument would fall to the ground. But, as the bigger proportion comes in cleaned, it is clear that those who import uncleaned rice must be getting the full measure of the benefit represented by the difference between the duties. So, as the Tariff stands to-day, we are making a present of 2s. 8d. to the cleaners of rice for every cental they import and clean. That is an argument for bringing these two duties more into harmony. The difference between the two is out of all proportion to the infinitesimal benefit which can be given to the labour market of Australia by the simple operation of rice cleaning. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly they did. But the Bill would not have affected their judgment or evidence. No rice is being produced' here. It may be eventually produced, but in the meantime the Government ask every consumer to pay an uncommonly heavy burden of taxation. In respect of the rice they eat, the people have to pay at least £80,000 a year in duty. That is made up of £33,528 duty on uncleaned rice which is subsequently cleaned and eaten - because rice for manufacturing purposes comes in free - and £47,613 duty paid on cleaned rice imported and also eaten. </para>

                            says in effect to the consumer, " I know that you are paying this enormous revenue duty, but at some time or other we shall produce enough rice for our own consumption." There was no item in the Bounties . Bill that honorable senators conversant with tropical products thought less of than rice. Some honorable senators from Queensland, who were extremely keen on bounties on tropical products, cared very little whether there was a bounty on rice at all, and I believe some of them voted against it. They said openly,' "The proposal for a bounty on rice is nonsense; you will never by that means get much rice grown in Australia." This heavy duty which, from one aspect - if rice could be produced here in large quantities - represents a big protective duty, has so far given the magnificent result of a production of 700 bushels in Australia in six years.

                            is,. I hope, a sane protectionist; and if I tell him that during the next six years the duty will operate just as heavily, he will not deny the fact.

                        <para>- I am delighted to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is not a revenue tariffist, and that he favours some other method of raising taxation. Speaking for myself, when a duty is purely a revenue duty, unless it is on some article of luxury that might properly be taxed, whether made abroad or locally, I am in favour of freedom. This is a revenue duty, it is true, but it is a duty which is incidentally protectionist, as shown even by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen. Senator Clemons</inline> tells us that some years must elapse before a rice crop can be obtained after the initial work has been undertaken. </para>

                        <para>- But not as a staple article of diet. The great point is that this duty results in considerable revenue; and we must get revenue from somewhere. I have yet to learn that my friends opposite are in favour of direct taxation in the shape of a land or income tax; although that is not what we are discussing now. The States have been depending on this revenue for some considerable time; and if they be deprived of it, they may be put in a position of distress. Tasmania has been complaining bitterly that, in consequence of the operations of the Commonwealth, her revenue is not sufficient to meet her requirements. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that ; but, even so, it is protective, and, therefore, I am not wrong. However, it would be very absurd in one session to grant a bounty to encourage the cultivation of rice, and, in the next session, to remove the protection enjoyed in the past. I am sure that honorable senators who desire to act rationally, and not to ruthlessly and unnecessarily deplete the revenue, will vote for a duty which, if revenue-producing, is incidentally protective. </para>

                        <para>- And if I choose not to do so I shall not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> spoke very strongly from the revenue point of view ; and I may remind the Committee that, in this connexion, I called for a return which we obtained yesterday. I find from the cai- culations made that the revenue likely 'to be derived by the Treasurer from the Tariff is nearer £13,000,000 than £12,000,000, if the purchasing power of the community be sustained. In face of these figures <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Trenwith's</inline> appeal from the revenue point of view is too late. I -asked for the return because, according to the original estimate, I thought Queensland was going to lose some £70,000, but, in view of the probable revenue, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith's</inline> argument is gone. In the whole of the Commonwealth an insignificant production has been the result of the duty during the last six years; indeed, I regard the duty as having absolutely failed, and, rice being an article of food, there is fair justification for freedom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has told us that rice is eaten mostly by Chinamen ; and if that be so then we are getting a revenue of some £30,000 from those foreign residents. </para>

                <para class="block">General cannot get sufficient funds to administer his Department effectively. I know that the Treasurer is grasping every sovereign that he can screw out of the people. My honorable friend cannot argue against the revenue returns, which show that the Commonwealth is getting an unparalleled revenue from Customs and Excise duties. When the revenue is so buoyant and there is not the slightest indication that anything can be done to establish a rice industry, surely every protectionist, unless he is a prohibitionist, will agree that this article of food should be made free, because if we were to impose a duty of £1 a cental instead of 3s. 4d. it would not affect the industry <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> industry at all. As I voted against the grant of a bounty upon the production of rice, I feel that I am in duty bound to vote against the imposition of a duty upon the article; firstly, because if imposed it will not help the industry at all, and secondly, because a Customs revenue of over  £12,000,000  is quite enough for present Commonwealth needs. </para>

                <para>SenatorFINDLEY.- I think that it matters a lot. Tasmania is always wailing about the loss of revenue which she has sustained since Federation. The pathetic appeals which have been made here have almost moved the Government to do something on her behalf. </para>

It was believed, and I think rightly believed, that with the aid of a duty and a bounty there would be established within a short period a fairly profitable rice industry in different parts of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I am taking quite an interest tonight in the Northern Territory. I understand that it is a place with a soil and a climate. It must .be. an attractive and interesting place for one to go to. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has been there, and seen the wonderful possibilities of rice production. I have nothing to say about that. I should like to see it used to grow rice or anything else which can be produced. I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to the cost at which this incidental protection is being given. To-night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was guilty of about the first outburst of candour of which I have been a witness. He said that this was a revenue duty with incidental protection, and I invite the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell particularly to that admission. .1 want to show to what extent it is revenue producing, and the extent to which it is incidentally protective. In 1906 the duties on rice yielded a revenue of £81,000, and the quantity of rice produced in Australia in that year was 700 bushels. So that the amount .with which we tax the people of Australia in order to convey that incidental protection to the growers of 700 bushels was £115 a bushel. </para>

                        <para>- In a place with a soil and a climate. Whatever may be the merits of the protectionist policy, surely, there is a point beyond which even protectionists will not go ! . In the prosecution of national industries, there must surely be some games which are not worth the candle. I ask honorable senators whether it is worth while to tax the people of Australia £115 for every bushel of rice locally produced. There is no justification for the tax, viewed as a protective impost. That being so, we have to fall back upon -the only reason for the duty, and that is that it is a' revenue duty. I do not intend to argue now the merits of a revenue duty, but I ask honorable senators, free-traders and protectionists alike, if there is any justification for imposing a revenue duty when the Treasurer does not want the money. To-day he has more money than is required for Federal purposes, and he is returning to the" States a larger amount than they ever had before. Four, if not five of the States had a surplus on the completion of the last financial year. What justification can there be, then, for taking £81,000 a year out of the pockets of the people in the form of a duty on rice? The money is not wanted for the purposes of Government, because the figures already show that, generally speaking, the States Governments have a surplus. Under this Tariff, the Federal Treasurer will have command of a larger revenue than he ever had before, and consequently will be able to return to the States Treasurers a larger sum- than he previously did. </para>

                        <para>- Because every one who comes here is supposed to have some slight businesslike regard for the interests of the people whom he represents. If the honorable senator had wanted to put forward a businesslike proposition to encourage the growing of rice at a fair price, and within reasonable limits, then, instead of taxing the people to the extent of  , £81,000  a year for the sake of producing  700  bushels of rice locally, he would have quadrupled the bounty, and taken off the duty. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has the power now by joining with other honorable senators in reducing this duty. If that is done and the Government are sincere in the desire they have professed to encourage the growth of rice in Australia by means of a bounty, it would be better that they should ask Parliament to double or quadruple the bounty which has been voted for its production. We have agreed to give a bounty of  20s.  per ton for its production, and under this form of taxation we are paying  £115  per bushel for all the rice produced in Australia. There would probably be  50  bushels to each ton of rice, and honorable senators will see, unless they desire to pass this duty for revenue purposes, that as business men it would be better that we should give rice-growers in the Commonwealth  10s.  per cental on all they produce in the form of a bounty than that we should tax the. whole of the people to the extent of  £80,000  a year. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  [10.49].-  In1886 as a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I opposed the imposition of a duty on rice. I remember that on that occasion some wonderful  stories with respect to rice cultivation in New South Wales were trotted out. One honorable member said that there were  30  acres of rice growing in the electorate he represented in a north coast district of New South Wales. But it turned out that the  30  acres of rice were  30  acres of lucerne. I should not be surprised to learn that the rice cultivation which we hear is taking place in the Commonwealth at the present time is really the cultivation of lucerne or thistles or something of that kind. So far as a duty on rice involves the taxation of Chinese, it is a very fair charge, because they do not pay duty on nearly as many articles as do white people, while they are given the advantage of our laws and all the trade they are able to do. But a proposal to impose a heavy burden of taxation upon over  4,000,000  of white people in order to get at the pockets of about  20,000  Chinamen is too absolutely preposterous for me. I shall vote for the request.

                    <para>. - When we were considering the Bounties Bill I opposed the proposed bounty on rice for reasons which I need not now state. I intend on this occasion to oppose the imposition of a duty of  3s. 4d.  per cental on this article because I believe that if there is any virtue in the attempt made in the Bounties Bill to encourage the production of rice in Australia, it will be made apparent in the course of a few years. I am not by any means sanguine that the Bounties Bill will be followed by successful results in this connexion. There is. some evidence that the production of rice has been attempted in the Northern Territory. It is said that about twenty-five years ago some  8  tons of uncleaned rice were produced in Australia and brought the excellent price of  £20  a ton. If we have land in the Commonwealth suitable for the production of rice, such a price as  £20  a ton for the crop should foe sufficient to induce our agriculturists to go into the industry. I venture to say that they are growing many crops for which they receive considerably less than  £20  per ton. Until we know whether the Bounties Bill will lead to the successful cultivation of rice, it would be irrational on our part to compel the whole of the people of Australia to pay a duty of  3s. 4d.  per cental on this article. I am satisfied that the whole of the evidence we have on the subject is against the probability of a successful result from the operation of the Bounties Bill, because even the agricultural experts who suggested that rice-growing was worthy of some encouragement lent were sufficiently conscientious to admit that it is open to doubt whether the industry can be successfully carried on under Australian conditions. That admission is in my opinion a substantial reason why we should relieve the people of this enormous duty upon a household necessity. The Chinese are said to bc lovers of rice, but there are very few white people in Australia who are not just, as fond of rice as . are the Chinese. We have heard from 'time to time of the desirability of cheapening the cost of living to' working people, and .we know that there are many thousands of white people in Australia to-day who are compelled to use rice as a substitute for potatoes. This article should be admitted duty free until it is known whether the bounty offered for the production of rice will have .the effect we desire. If it does not, £ agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it would be better I hen for us to offer a bounty than to saddle I he whole of the people with the extraordinary d,itv imposed by this Tariff. </para>
