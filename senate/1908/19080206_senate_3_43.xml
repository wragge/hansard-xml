            <para>In face of misleading cablegram that German Government propose establishment of penal settlements in thePacific, I am instructed to inform you that this matter has been only spontaneously mentioned by a member of the Reichstag - neither were my Government in the least way concerned in that suggestion, nor do they intend to give it any consideration whatever. It might further be observed that the casual mentioning of the subject in Parliament passed entirely unnoticed by German public opinion. While thanking you for the reserved way in which you- pronounced your views, I should feel obliged if you would give publicity to this official communication. Viewing the great interest which your country naturally takes in the matter, this would certainly have a reassuring effect throughout Australia. </para>

            <para>- The proposed range is to be a rifle club range, that is to say, a range for a rifle club, not a range authorized in the first instance for. use by the Militia Forces generally. In all such cases the rifle club interested chooses the site, and constructs the range, subject to the approval and supervision of the Rifle Range Branch of the Defence Department. As soon as a club has chosen its&#39; site, the Inspector of Rifle Ranges reports upon it, and the construction of the range depends upon the nature of his report. In this 7842 <inline font-style="italic">Painting of</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph Poles.</inline> instance, several sites have been under consideration by the club, and more than one has been inspected, opinions having favored first one site and then another. The Departments of Home Affairs and of Defence did all they could to assist the club in obtaining from the State Department permission to use the Crown lands comprised in some of the sites, and on the  29th  of last month the Defence Department informed the captain of the club that the site finally selected had been approved, and that the construction of the rifle range might be proceeded with. The captain was also asked to report when the construction was completed, so that an officer might be sent to pass the work, preparatory to giving to the club the usual grant in aid. </para>

            <para>I am glad you have taken up the question of the broken-down transport waggon, because it is another example of how, whenever the system is tested, it breaks down. </para>
            <para>I was present at the moving camp on Foundation Day, and it was a good example of how the department seems quite unable to provide transport for about 250 men. What it would do it a war broke out, the mother ot  confusion  only knows. </para>
            <para>There is one fact, though, that has at present been concealed. When it was found that the spare wheel sent out to the broken-down waggon would not fit, and the troops had consequently to go without their tea and  equipment,  a departmental waggon was sent along. It is a deplorable fact that this waggon was. short of bolts, and so much in danger of falling to pieces that it had to be tied together wilh ropes, whilst the nut of the wheel, which needed oiling, in order to get the men to drag it along, could not he unscrewed. </para>
            <para>The Minister has promised an inquiry. He will probably get reports from the State Commandant, &#39;who is hardly likely to adversely criticise his own arrangements, but no whitewashing inquiry should satisfy the Parliamentary questioner who inquired into this scandalous slate of things. The camp was held  largely  to lest fitness and efficiency. The men showed themselves all right, but the little part which the men are permanently paid to prepare broke down. As was said in the Crimean war, &#34; Someone wants hanging.&#34; </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South ment, and take the opportunity to call attention briefly to . the unnecessary and undesirable method of rushing through the reports of the Printing Committee without affording time for the least consideration of them. I again urge that the  Chairman  of the Committee, instead of seeking and obtaining the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable these reports to be adopted forthwith, should pursue the usual course of giving notice of motion and moving on the next day. I &#39;do not desire to delay the&#39; adoption of the report, but I quite agree with the amendment that has been moved, and which I am now seconding. I think that the matter is of far too grave a character, even though it may be only the breakdown of a waggon, to pass without further notice. The breakdown of a waggon may have the most&#39; serious consequences even in peace manoeuvres, and still more so in time of war. If the papers in question are not to be printed, what shall we know about them ?  </para>

            <para>- Oh, no; I did not say that, I am sure. Honorable senators will probably recollect that on the previous day I tabled a very important document - the annual report of the Public Service Commissioner - and in doing so stated that some supplemental correspondence would followthat report, which was already in print. I said then that I statedthat by way of explanation, because I intended, later on, to depart from the usual course of. leaving these matters to the Printing Committee by moving, when I tabled the supplemental document, that it be printed. I think that the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee will bear me out when I say that when I moved that the later document be printed, I expressly explained to the Senate that I did so, not out of any disrespect to the Committee, but because it had to be read in conjunction with the one just previously tabled and already in print. The Senate some time since decided that in all matters of this kind the Printing Committee shall determine whether or not a paper should be printed, and except in a case of special urgency, or where a particularly good reason for departing from the practice commended itself to the Minister presenting a paper, that course has generally been followed. I rose to make this statement lest any one should think that there was an objection on the part of the Government to this document being printed. I do not think that there is any objection. The honorable senator being seized, perhaps more fully than are other honorable senators, with the importance of this document, has moved that it be printed, and is well within his rights in doing so. </para>

              <para>- It is true that it does not qualify the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> which is an amendment to the original motion, but the original motion refers to Papua ordinances as well as to the report relating to the breakdown of transport waggons at Heidelberg. The  words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> could, therefore, be added to the original motion whether amended or not, after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Savers&#39;</inline> amendment had been disposed of. </para>

            <para>.- The Printing Committee were really influenced by the statement made a few days ago by the Minister with reference to this matter, and by the belief that the paper ordered to be printed on the motion of the Minister was in the hands of the printer, and was being circulated. Not being a military man, I cannot perhaps grasp the full significance of the report relating to the breakdown of the transport service near Heidelberg, but if any military or non-military man, after reading it, can convince me or any intelligent person that it is worth printing, I shall have nothing further to say. </para>

            <para>. - As I have already stated, the Legislative Council in Papua is really subordinate to this Parliament, which is responsible for whatever ordinances it may pass. Now the ordinances which have been presented to the Printing Committee may be of no consequence at the present moment, but in their relation to future- ordinances they may be of very great importance, I hope, therefore, that the Printing Committee will take no offence at an attempt on the part of any honorable senator to have these ordinances printed. I am sure that its members will not do so, because the printing of the ordinances is in the interests of good government. </para>

But I would point out that these ordinances have been tabled time and again. They have passed through the hands of the Printing Committee, and have been dealt with in its reports from time to time. As hithertono wish for their printing has been expressed, the Committee has dealt with them just as it has dealt with other matters, such as regulations under Statute, which come before it. </para>

Although its members do not think that these ordinances ought to be printed,, I suppose they do not object to that course being adopted if any strong desire in its favour is expressed. I think that the Committee acted rightly in this matter. These ordinances are not proper subjects for printing as papers of the Senate. They are the acts of the Legislative Council of Papua. They fall exactly in the same category as Acts of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that if the desire were expressed, the authorities of Papua would have no objection to forwarding copies of these ordinances for circulation amongst the members of this Parliament. That courtesy and. civility is always extended to us. If we ask for a loose copy of an Act of any of the States, we get it. We ought not to interfere with the Printing Committee in a matter of this kind. We might just as well ask that the Acts of Parliament of the States should be printed as parliamentary papers for our convenience. </para>

              <para>- It is unprecedented that printed Acts of Council, like printed Acts of Parliament, should, whether they -are laid -upon the table or not, be printed as parliamentary papers. Nothing so convinces me of the wise discretion exercised&#39; by the Printing Committee in the discharge of their duties as the decision they have come to in this case. In the other case it was a question of whether it was worth while. In this case it seems to be altogether unnecessary, and a waste of money, to print these documents. They are Acts of Council made under the authority of the Papua Act. They have to be laid before Parliament, and we can see them. If any honorable senator wishes for an additional copy, I suppose that there will be no difficulty in getting it. When they are bound at the end of the year they are to be obtained in the Library, like the Acts of Parliaments of the States. It is interesting to us to see them, and proper that we should familiarize ourselves with them, but we can do so without having them printed as parliamentary papers. </para>

            <para>. - Whether or not this action should have been taken earlier does not affect the question of the advisability of laying down a rule for the future. The question we have to consider now is : Is ft not advisable to follow precisely the same course in relation to these ordinances as we do in the case of an ordinary Public Service Regulation ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said that it would be just as reasonable to ask that the Acts of the Parliaments of the States should be printed and circulated, but. where is the analogy? In the one case we are utterly powerless, as the States are sovereign, but in this case there is a body of our own creation, for whose acts and ordinances we are responsible. If those ordinances dea.lt with, the subjects with which they are empowered to deal in a way that would reflect discredit, that discredit would be reflected upon this Parliament. If, for instance, in an ordinance dealing with the natives - a question which before now has brought the name of Australia into question in other parts of the world - anything were done that could be called in question, not the obscure Legislative Council of Papua, but this Parliament, would be discussed in other parts of the world, and&#39; have to bear the odium, of &#39; that legislation. We are responsible for the ordinary departmental regulations of the Public Service, as they are the product of persons who are the creation of this Parliament, and therefore those regulations are printed immediately and .circulated among us as a matter of course. They are not even submitted to the Printing Committee before they are printed. They are frequently referred to in the Committee&#39;s report as &#34;already in print.&#34; For the same reason these ordinances ought to be printed, because we are responsible for their effect. </para>

              <para>- Certainly. &#34;Under our system of responsible government, the Ministers responsible for Orders in Council are answerable to this Parliament. The ordinances should be furnished as a matter of course to honorable senators, so that they may study them and come to conclusions as to their probable effect. The amendment is no reflection on the Printing Committee, who have simply done as has been done before. It simply occurredto some of us that it was time a change was made in this respect. The particular ordinances now in question may have no bad effect, but there might come a time when they, with others, might have an effect detrimental to the good name of Australia, which effect this Parliament, if it had had an opportunity of supervising them, might have checked at once. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that they should all be printed and circulated among honorable senators as they are promulgated. It is absolutely impossible to do as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggests. At&#39; the end of a session we might go into a long recess. Before we got the ordinances twelve&#39; months might elapse. &#34;Unless papers of this sort are circulated, honorable senators will never go and inquire for them. They have sufficient to do now to keep in touch with the papers which are issued to them without looking for more trouble, or hunting for more papers in the library. Under present conditions, the harm would be done and the scandal out before we heard of it. It would be too late then to do anything. What is wanted is to give honorable senators power to check any trouble that might be imminent. </para>

            <para>. -I quite agree as to the desirability of these ordinances being printed, but since the debate started I have had the opportunity of inquiring into the matter, and will, I think, be able to make a suggestion that will meet the views of both sides. It is most desirable that the documents should be printed and circulated amongst honorable senators. As a matter of fact, they are printed by the Government Printer. I propose to consult the Prime Minister, and request that he should have them circulated amongst honorable senators when they are printed in the ordinary way, under the direction of the Department of External Affairs. That will meet the object which honorable senators have in view, and with that understanding perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will withdraw the amendment. . </para>

I communicated with the Public Service Commissioner this morning, and found that he had received a petition or protest from a number of public officers in Tasmania in reference to this matter, but that the communication had reached his Department only yesterday, and had not yet been considered or dealtwith by him. The Commissioner, however, said that when he had considered and dealt with the communication he thought there would be no objection to placing copies of the correspondence on the table. He pointed out, however, that the correspondence could not be produced until probably a couple of weeks hence, but I thought it desirable not to delay placing this report on the table. </para>

            <para>- The answers to the honorable senator&#39;s questions are as follow -  1 and 2. Representations were made to the Government from various sources, and, in addition, Lieutenant Shackleton personally laid before the Prime Minister the character, resources, and purposes of the expedition. 3 and 4. The Government were aware, from notices in the press and from information supplied by Lieutenant Shackleton, Professor David, and others, of the natureand character of the expedition. </para>

              <para>The Government were not, at the time of making the grant, nor are they now, aware that the expedition is of the character indicated in the question. The Royal recognition of the enterprise at the time of the departure of the <inline font-style="italic">Nimrod</inline> from England appears to preclude the possibility of the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion being correct. Moreover, the Prime Minister was informed by Lieutenant Shackleton that the bulk of the funds had been subscribed by himself, his relations, and personal friends. 6 and 7. The Government have not at any time regarded Lieutenant Shackleton&#39;s courageous enterprise in any other light than that of an attempt to add to the scientific knowledge of  the world by the exploration of a region in which, owing to our comparative proximity, Australians naturally take special interest. 8 and9. The Government are aware that the New Zealand Government have assisted the expedition financially, and presume that they were equally satisfied of the scientific character of the expedition before doing so. </para>

It is also understood that special attention will be paid to the scientific problems which particularly interest Australia, especially those connected with the study of meteorology. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I have not been able to ascertain the quantity of bananas imported in 1002, but the importation in 1903 was 47.641 centals, in 1904 12,290 centals, in 1905 11,732 centals, and in 1906 - the year of the cyclone - 146,250 centals. Except for a decrease of 1,549 bunches in the Logan district, in 1906 the whole decrease occurred in the northern parts of the State affected by the cyclone. Had the northern districts- produced in 1906 as much as they produced in 1905, the total output of the year, owing to an increase in banana production in other parts of the State, would have been 2,615,000 bunches, an increase of 106,000 bunches. These figures disprove the statement that banana growing is a miserable industry. </para>

It is impossible to say what proportion of the production of bananas is due to Chinese industry, though it may be admitted that in the northern parts of Queensland banana growing is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, and in the southern districts chiefly in the hands of white persons, 33.5 per cent, of the total acreage under bananas being situated in the south. Honorable senators who have visited Cleveland Bay and other districts in the vicinity of Brisbane know that bananas are cultivated there in large quanties, the industry&#39; being a. profitable one, enabling the white men engaged in it to bring up their children in comfort. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; but while he was willing to admit that a certain proportion of the bananas produced in Queensland is grown by white labour, he would hot admit that the same proportion of the bananas exported is grown by white lat)our. If the Brisbane market were not supplied with bananas grown at &#34; Cleve land Bay, and in the southern parts of Queensland, the demand would be met with the bananas grown in the northern districts, before any would be sent to other parts of Australia. The production of bananas is gradually passing out of the hands of Chinese. The Queensland RegistrarGeneral of Pastoral and Agricultural Statistics in a recent report says that - </para>

          <para>Subsequent to the destruction of the plantations by the cyclone in 1906, a considerable number of Chinese deserted their old holdings, and either left the locality altogether, or for some reason delayed replanting. Some recovery from the catastrophe has, however, been made in the affected districts; whilst taking advantage of circumstances, an increased area was planted under this crop in the Maroochy and Redcliffe districts. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Maroochy and Redcliffe districts are in the south of Queensland.- If the growing of bananas were wholly in the hands of Chinese, the industry would still be of great importance to Australia, because of the large number of white persons to whom it gives employment. During the year ended 30th June, 1906, the bananas shipped from the northern ports of Queensland amounted to 1,350,000 - bunches,  on  which the freight actually paid to shipping companies was no less than &#163;56,250. This money, of course, contributed to the .upkeep of a number of vessels, and found employment for the crews connected with them, as well as for lumpers, agents, and others engaged in the distribution  of  the fruit. A number of local authorities are also concerned in the maintenance of the banana industry. According to a recent Queensland Treasury return, the balances due on loans &#34;borrowed for the construction of tramways, for the transport of sugar and bananas to northern ports were as follow : - Johnstone ShireCouncil, &#163;49,000 ; Cairns Shire Council, &#163;95,000  ;  Douglas Shire Council, &#163;34,000; total, &#163;178,000. In connexion with the visit of the Colonial Secretary of Fiji to Australia last year, I received from the secretary  to  the Cairns Chamber of Commerce the following telegram, dated 26th July, 1907 - </para>

          <para>Banana growers understand Colonial Secretary from Fiji now visiting Melbourne with object having duty removed off bananas imported from Island. Please inquire into matter, and protest against such alteration in fairness to Queensland growers, and those councils that have borrowed from the Government to build tram line to bring produce to port. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Whilst some honorable senators may think that they are doing something very clever in bitting at the Chinese, I would impress upon the Committee that the Chinese employed in banana growing will, probably, continue to get along very well if the duty is removed. But as one-third of the acreage under bananas is in the hands of white persons, they, together, with many other white persons engaged in the transport and distribution of the fruit, as well as the local authorities which have borrowed money partly for the furtherance of the industry, will be seriously injured. It is admitted that the abolition of the duty would not be likely to reduce the price of bananas. Banana growing is an industry which is helping to settle people in the northern parts of Queensland, where the number of white employes is increasing every day, and a blow aimed at the industry will therefore recoil upon, not merely a few Chinese, but many of our own race and colour. . </para>

          <para>-As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has practically exhausted the subject, I cannot profitably add much to what he has said ; but my personal observation enables me to indorse his remarks in regard to the banana industry of Southern Queensland, with which I am acquainted. The evidence that banana growing is passing more and more into the hands of white persons, especially in the south, of Queensland, is conclusive. The importation of bananas from Fiji will tend to make it unprofitable to white persons to grow bananas in Queensland. But if the industry is encouraged, it will, in the course of time, become wholly a white man&#39;s industry. The Chinese are gradually becoming fewer. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, the excess of departure&#39;s of Chinese over arrivals was  369  in  1904, 813  in  1905, 1.036  in  1906,  and  754  in eleven months of  1907,  making a total decrease of  2,962.  If to that we add the natural death rate, which may be averaged at about  500  a year, we have a further decrease of  2,000,  making, roughly speaking, a total decrease of  5,000  Chinese. The estimated number of Chinese in the Commonwealth in1901 was about  30,000.  In the course of six years the Chinese population has decreased by about  5,000,  being equal to between  16  and  17  per cent. The Chinese, therefore, may be taken to be gradually decreasing in number in Queensland, as well as in other parts of the Commonwealth, and an industry which was said once to have been in their hands - though I do not admit that it was - must under the operation of our legislation inevitably be controlled by white men. That is a strong reason for hoping that, with the very slight assistance which is asked for, a special Queensland industry, which produces a most useful and agreeable form of fruit, will gradually pass into the hands of white labour. We may ask for this smallduty very confidently. I think that our request ought to be received most cordially by all the protectionists in the chamber. </para>

            <para>- Later on they might be able to grow bananas at the Capital Site. It is an absolute fact that bananas of excellent quality are grown in Queensland, and that the industry to-day is largely in the hands of Chinese. I am no great lover of the Chinese in Australia; but we must face the position as it is presented to us. The Chinese are with us, and in all probability will remain here for a considerable period. Suppose that we were to strangle this industry, and wipe out the number of Chinese engaged therein to-day. I do not think it is at all likely that they would immediatelymake their way to the land of their birth. The probability is that they would seek a means of livelihood in other directions. But apart from the Chinese who are engaged in the banana industry, there is, as previous speakers have stated, an armyof white folks employed and largely interested in the industry; and the fact that last year 146,250 centals of bananas found their way into the Commonwealth is sufficient warrant to me for moving, asI will move later on, for the imposition of an increased duty. &#34;If we are to have protection,&#34; all protectionists here have said, &#34;let us have effective and complete protection.&#34; Evidently those engaged in this industry to-day are not getting effective protection. Personally, I do not believe in a revenue Tariff. I would sooner see bananas coming in free than have a duty that is merely imposed for revenue purposes. &#39; Last year we derived a revenue of about , &#163;7,000 from foreign bananas. Evidently the duty has had a revenue effect. That kind of revenue is not acceptable to me. I want to stop the importation of bananas, and instead of Fiji and other bananas being imported to that extent, I wish to see our people consume the bananas which are grown in the Commonwealth, particularly in Queensland. </para>

          <para>.- I should like very much to vote for free bananas, but I have to consider what is my duty with regard to the Tariff. It appears to methat, whether I like it or not, I am here to fix up the Tariff on protectionist lines. It is of no use to kick against the pricks, or to try to make a Tariff full of anomalies. We have to recognise the fact that a protectionist Tariff - I think of a moderate description, and others think of an ultra protectionist description - has in some way to be fixed up. If that is so, the more the free-traders try to free articles from a protective duty the more anomalies they will create. They will create inconsistencies, and do what I think may be termed an injustice. The reason why I should like to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> request is in order to give the great working and poorer classes a cheap fruit. But I have come to the conclusion that the removal of the duty would not appreciablylessen the price of the article. In my opinion, it is more a Question of crops, cyclones, droughts, and markets than a question of a small duty. </para>

            <para>- What the honorable senatoris going to do on the question of bananas remains to be seen. I want to deal with a statement which fell from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who may have the credit of determining the direction of my vote. He said that because this industry was carried on chiefly by Chinamen he wanted bananas to be allowed to come in free, and urged that we ought not to protect the industry. That, I think, would be a gross wrong to our Chinese friends. It would be fixing up the Tariff on a basis which would not stand. I take it that these Chinamen are here by virtue of the law. Many of them have been naturalized ; some of them have paid&#163;100 to come into Victoria, and probably they are growing bananas at the present moment. I cannot understand any set of statesmen, or men calling themselves just and true men, who will invite a number of Chinese to come here under their laws, and persecute and boycott them when they are here. The Chinese in the &#39; Commonwealth are dying out by degrees. Very few Chinamen can own the land on which bananas are grown. What right have we to give protection in regard to every animal, every cereal, every product which is grown by white men and refuse it to the white owners of the banana land simply because . 60 per cent. of the tenants are Chinamen ? That does not appear to be a just or fair thing to do. If honorable senators vote for the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> as I should like to do for several reasons, they will create an anomaly in the Tariff, because they will be making an exception of the Chinamen and treating the owners of the banana fields unjustly. Therefore, although rather reluctantly, I &#34;shall feel bound to vote for the duty as it stands. . </para>

Let them grow as many bananas as they like about Brisbane, thev will not be able to compete with the duty-paid banana from Fiji, because the banana is a truly tropical plant. The vicinity of Brisbane is not tropical, and the banana grown there cannot compete with the tropicgrown banana of Fiji and North Queensland. Let any honorable senator investigate  the window of every fruit-shop in Melbourne, and I defy him to find in one single instance a label saying that the bananas were grown in Queensland.

            <para>- Yes, in the same way as artificial. butter is sold in London as best Australian butter. I have seen in London Australian meat labelled as &#34; New Zealand mutton,&#34; and New Zealand mutton sold in the shops as best English or Welsh. The whole course of trade is to represent the article to be sold as being the best of its kind. That is why the term &#34; Fijian &#34; is applied to Fiji bananas. It is not the fault of the white men who are growing bananas about Brisbane, but that the climate and soil are not suitable for the production of the same high-class tropical. fruit as is produced in Fiji, and North Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> was. pressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to say whether there was any other reason than the hurricane a year and a-half ago to account for the falling off by materially more than  50  per cent, in the exportation of Queensland bananas, notwithstanding the new crop of southern-grown bananas to which reference has been made. The honorable senator would not answer that question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

        <para class="block">Clemons had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> in the box, and therefore could not,&#39; as an examining counsel, press the question unduly. But it is notorious that in addition to the hurricane of 1906 there has been, as was stated1 last night and admitted to-day, a falling off in the number of Chinese engaged in the industry. It is well known that a quantity of the land previously occupied for banana growing is now occupied for the growth of sugar. The figures I gave last night are more effective than mere declaration or special pleading. I showed conclusively by official figures that the area of land under crop for bananas in Queensland had in one year fallen bv over 1,000 acres. The hurricane did not cause a change in the occupation of the land. The fact that&#39; bananas were blown down by a hurricane did not cause the land to cease to be used for banana! orchards. In  T905,  there were 6,198 acres under bananas in Queensland, and in the next year, the year of the hurricane, the acreage had fallen to 5,163 - that is, a drop of no less than 1,035 acres. The fact that there was a devastating hurricane in the district, which &#39;destroyed the crop, did not alter the occupation of the soil to the extent of over 1,000 acres. </para>

In view of the fact that hitherto the efforts he has made in reference to the imposition of heavy duties have in every single instance been designed to benefit Victorian industries, it is quite- a new phase to find him seeking to benefit, as is alleged; an industry outside Victoria. </para>

          <para>. - We have heard a great deal during this debate from various speakers and from the honorable senator who has moved the request, about the growth &#39;of bananas in Queensland. With all due deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I do not think that he knows as much about the subject as he tried to make the Committee think he knew. Bananas grow in Brisbane and all along the Queensland coast, but when you get to the far north they are grown to perfection. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has ever been in Geraldton, but that is the home of the banana in Queensland. Before the white man came bananas grew wild in the scrub there, and they can be grown for ten months in the year. About eighteen months ago, however, there was a great hurricane, which did a large amount of damage. The growers could not be expected to get over that damage in a day or two. Furthermore, it has to be remembered that the banana is a plant which rapidly exhausts the soil. The best of scrub land devoted to banana growing will be impoverished in ten years. So that the  growers have continually to lie clearing heavy jungle. I admit that a very large number of bananas are grown by Chinese, but it must not be forgotten, at the same time, that in Cairns, Port Douglas, Geraldton, and also, I believe, on land a little south of Geraldton, on the Russell River, quantities of bananas have been put in by white men. I have lived in the north for the last thirty-five years. </para>

            <para>- I am very sorry to hear the honorable senator, as a labour man, say that. I suppose he will say that white men do not handle the bananas when they are put on board the boats. At Townsville hundreds of men are getting a living in connexion with shipping. The bananagrowing industry causes a great deal of trade. Of course, the fruit has to be transhipped into southern boats. I take no account of the labour employed in connexion with Queensland bananas in Sydney and Melbourne, because I suppose the same labour would be employed if the fruit came from Fiji. I have beard protectionists say in this chamber that if only forty or fifty men were engaged in an industry it ought to be protected. No one can dispute the fact that more than 1,000 white men are employed in the banana industry of Queensland. </para>

He poses as a labour man, and if he doubts my word and can prove that my statement is wrong I will publicly withdraw it. He has only to send a wire to the Labour Union in Townsville. </para>

            <para>- When a previous item was being discussed, I was under the impression that the article was not produced in the Commonwealth, and was prepared to vote against the proposed duty; but when I was assured that the article was produced here, I voted in favour of the item. Under similar circumstances, I should do the same again. Even when the division was about to take place, I took the word of the honorable senator who assured me that the article in question was produced in this country. In my opinion, the word of an honorable senator who makes a statement of that sort ought to be taken. I believe that the proposed duty on bananas is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. We ought not to allow bananas grown byblack labour and handled by black labour in the Pacific Islands to come into competition with the locally-grown fruit. I am very sorry to say that in Queenslandbananas are grown very largely by Chinese. I should like to see the industry carried on only by white men, and would be prepared to increase  the duty by1s. per cental, if I thought that such an increase would bring about that change. </para>

When we reach other items relating to the products of Chinese, we shall find that some&#39; honorable senators who are now raising an outcry against the imposition of this duty, on the ground that it merely encourages a Chinese industry, will have nothing to say. I intend to support the duty.

          <para>- The principal argument that has been advanced by the opponents of this duty is that the industry is chiefly in the hands of the Chinese. Unfortunately, that is so; but if the duty be removed, the industry - whatever is left of it - will continue in the hands of the Chinese. That appears to me to be so clear, that there is really no room for discussion on the point. I deplore, as much as does any one, the fact that bananas are so largely grown in Queensland by Chinese. The people of the Commonwealth are not responsible for that. The policy of the &#39;Commonwealth, as I understand it, is to encouragethe production of anything that can be grown or manufactured here. High-class bananas - bananas togood that when they are sent down here they arc labelled &#34; Fiji bananas &#34; - grow luxuriantly along the whole coast of Queensland, from Rockhampton northwards. </para>

            <para>- I believe that at one time, Sydney-made boots were labelled Made inParis,&#34; and Melbourne-made boots &#34;Made in Germany.&#34; The people of the Commonwealth have hitherto had a prejudice against anything and everything either grown or manufactured in their own country. Happily, that prejudice is disappearing. We can grow in Queensland bananas as good as any that can be produced in Fiji or anywhere else. It is only a question of time, when the industry will be wholly in the hands of white men. As we know, under our White Australia legislation, there can be no fresh arrivals of Chinese, and that being the case, it is only a matter of a fewyears when those who are with us will be reduced to a minimum. During the whole of that period, this Industry, together with others, I hope, will be drifting more and more into the hands of the people of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> in, a bumptious speech, which was very loud, so far as volume of voice was concerned, but particularly weak in argument, in his opposition to the duty relied principally on the contention that the production of bananas in Queensland is decreasing with very great rapidity. He seemed to doubt the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that a cyclone was responsible for the destruction of a great portion of the crop of 1906.

In all the other centres of the State, with the exception of Cardwell, production increased, although not at a very great rate. Cairns and Mourilyan, together with Cardwell, are the districts where bananas are principally produced in Queensland, and they undoubtedly suffered very severely from the cyclone. </para>

            <para>- I do not know whether it did or did not do so. It does not influence me in the slightest whether the Queensland Parliament did or did not place a duty on bananas. All that I am concerned about Is this.: In Queensland, from Rockhampton northwards, bananas of a very high quality grow luxuriantly, and that being so, in carrying out a general policy of protection for the Commonwealth we ought not to exclude them. Every one of us is anxious to see the Chinese driven out of this and every other industry in Australia, and the way to arrive at that point is not to cut off the present duty but to increase it if it be found insufficient. The report of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock sets forth that - </para>

          <para>In the Northern districts, the cultivation of bananas is mainly in the hands of Chinese, on lands leased by them. They rarely adopt the careful methods of cultivation employed by them in connexion with market gardening, but crop until the soil is exhausted, and then desert that area, taking up a fresh lease somewhere in the vicinity. Subsequent to the destruction of the plantations by the cyclone in 1906, a considerable number of Chinese deserted their old holdings, and either left the locality alto- gether, or for some reason delayed replanting. Some recovery from the catastrophe has, how ever, been made in the affected districts; whilst taking an advantage of circumstances, an increased area was planted under this crop in the Maroochy and Redcliffe districts. </para>

            <para>- They may not all be produced by white men, but we are trying to make this a white man&#39;s industry, and I repeat that the only method by which we can do that is by increasing the duty and endeavouring to persuade the Queensland Government to carry out the resolution passed, I believe, some years a.go, that leasing of land to aliens be prohibited. If the duty be retained, or increased, as I hope it will be, there will be some encouragement for white men to engage in the industry ; but if the duty be swept away, and the bananas of Fiji are allowed to come in without let or hindrance, there will not be very much encouragement for any white man to engage in it. I take it that our object in framing this Tariff is, if we can, to create industries in Australia. Here is an industry which is native to the Continent.&#39; It needs only a little encouragement to place it on such a footing that importations from Fiji will be entirely stopped and this nutritious and healthful fruit will be placed at a very cheap rate upon the tables of a large section of the people. That is our whole policy. If, instead of endeavouring to secure the abolition of the duty upon bananas, our friends would only assist us to increase it, they would be doing something to establish another Australian industry upon a substantial basis. If the duty be swept away, banana-growing will either languish and die out, or it will fall wholly into the hands of the Chinese. </para>

            <para>- No. I will not hesitate to do what is just for fear that I may be regarded as an inconsistent protectionist.I am quite prepared to vote for high protective duties in cases where the industries concerned are worthy of them. I am willing to go as far as anybody in this chamber in endeavouring to &#34;entirely blot out the Chinaman from our skilled industries. But I am a freetrader upon this item, because I have no desire to give the Chinaman any protection. To me bananas appear to constitute an article of food which is worthy of our consideration. There are many children in Australian homes who make a very excellent meal of bananas when they can obtain them. Everybody will admit that the banana is an intensely nutritious fruit. Why then should we not obtain the very best procurable? Every Queensland representative has admitted - and the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission also proves - that the banana grown in Fiji is superior to anything that Queensland has produced or is likely to produce. </para>

From the evidence given before the Tariff Commission it is clear that owing to the climatic conditions which obtain in Fiji, bananas produced there will continue in a ripe and edible state for about ten days. That is one reason why we should obtain them. We want the best possible banana at the cheapest possible rate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has urged some strange arguments in defence of the position which he has taken up - as has also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> - but I do not intendto seriously notice <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> statements, because of a reply which he gave to me some time ago. </para>

            <para>- No doubt his ways are erroneous. I felt - as 1 am sure we all must have felt - profound sympathy with the honorable senator in his effort to reconcile his absolutely considered judgment that bananas form a food of the poor, and that they are a food which ought to be relieved from all unnecessary taxation, with his statement that, no doubt, with the very greatest reluctance he intended to vote for the retention of the duty. I am sure that the spectacle which he presented was sad in the extreme.  His  face betokened his distress. It grieved me to see my old friend in such a plight. What he said was, in effect, that on one side he felt bound to vote for freeing this most useful fruit, this food of the poor, from duty, but that, on the other hand, there were other protectionist duties in the Tariff upon natural products, and he thought he would be a protectionist on this occasion, and vote for1s. per cental on bananas. When I reminded him, by&#39; a humble interjection, of his great proclamation of faith in preference, and that Fiji was a part of the British Empire --a fact which any genuine preferentialist might take into consideration- </para>

It was that trie Queensland bananas were inferior tothe Fijian, and we are asked to impose this duty in order to encourage their production. We are told that the duty does not make a great deal of difference in the price, but it does make a difference.

            <para>- There is logic in that argument, but none in the demand that we should retain this shilling duty, which tends to exclude the Fijian banana, and gives an excuse for every retailer in Australia to charge more for his bananas than he would otherwise do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> corroborated the testimony given before the Commission that bananas are the people&#39;s fruit. It is the children&#39;s fruit, and is most wholesome also for grown-ups. It is often the only fruit procurable at a certain period of the year. If there is one importation more than another which should be encouraged, itis that of bananas. The figures show that we are not merely protecting what is described in the evidence as an inferior fruit, but are attempting to protect a supply that is intermittent and liable to be reduced or destroyed not merely by a cyclone but by diseases described by the witnesses. The proof of that is as plain as evidence can make it. During all the years up to  1906  there was practically an absence of importation. At any rate it was reduced to about  11,000  centals, but in  3906  it jumped up to  146,000  centals, all from Fiji. That shows that in addition to the quality being inferior the supply from Queensland is intermittent and irregular. We imported, in face of the duty, that quantity in  1906. </para>

          <para>Another witness, commenting upon the relative value of Queensland and Fijian bananas, said that the former would be ripe to-day and rotten to-morrow, whilst the latter would keep ten or twelve days after arrival. The effect of the duty upon bananas had been to practically destroy the tradefrom Fiji, and the public were now obtaining an inferior article at the same price as that paid prior to Federation. The Queensland article had to be consumed immediately; its export was impossible. Prior to imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff, the Fijian banana could be distributed as far west as Fremantle, and there was no comparison between its quality and that of the Queensland fruit. . . . One witness said that there was a possibility of the failure of the Queensland banana crop, owing to drought and fruit fly, and it would be lamentable if, under these circumstances, the fruit merchants were debarred from receiving supplies from Fiji. </para>

            <para>- I have no reason to think so. I have no knowledge on the subject, and have no right to question these witnesses. I am reading from the report of the protectionist half of the Commission. What I quoted was their statement regarding the evidence given before the Commission, and therefore, in so far as it is a condensed statement of the evidence, it has filtered through the minds of the protectionist side of that body. On that account I should undoubtedly accept it as bearing the inference I have put. </para>

            <para>- That is a very good way of putting it. It is the finding of the protectionist section on the. evidence. I do not say that Queensland should not be considered. I am not one of those recently described as geographical protectionists. But if the argument that Queensland should be considered is put forward, I say that Queensland has been sufficiently considered in many cases. The figures given to-day show that Queensland has had nearly half-a-million pounds expended within her borders in return for a small contribution, and the greater portion of it has come out of the Treasuries of the other States. South Australia contributed &#163;61,000 as against an expenditure within her own borders of &#163;800 or&#163;900. Of course, we know that the greater portion of the money was for the sugar bounty. When we passed the Sugar Bounties Act- </para>

            <para>- He is none the less suffering from an inflamed mental condition when he makes that ejaculation. I did not help to make that policy, but I opposed it all I knew and shall oppose it to the bitter end. I shall endeavour to take it away from Queensland if I can. But if the argument, &#34; Oh, this is for Queensland,&#34; is used, then, although I disbelieve in these geographical considerations, I say that Queensland ought to  remember how well she has been helped by the Commonwealth ever since she has been a member of it. Only the other day a Bill was passed for bounties, the greater part of which are for the benefit of Queensland production. The inclusion of coffee, cotton, jute, and other things was advocated. I am not blaming the representatives of Queensland. They are perfectly entitled to do what they can, but it is an idle and vain piece of nonsense to make an appeal on behalf of Queensland in respect of banana-growing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> clamours for preference, and I say to him &#34; There is Fiji, which is a part of the British Empire.&#34; </para>

Why will not honorable senators who support the duty do that? Is there any sense or substance in their opposition to it?

The argument has been used that a duty of1s. doss not, perhaps, operate much either way . But I happen to know that this duty has often been a determining factor in deciding the continuance of some small plantation in both North and South Queensland. Indeed, I may say that one grower told me that the duty of1s. alone paid him, if he were freed from the competition of importation. </para>

            <para>- I decline to argue the abstract question of free-trade or protection ; my desire is to deal with the Tariff as it arises under present circumstances and conditions. I emphasize the point that protection can be soundly and usefully applied only to primary industries ; and in my opinion, protection under present conditions, is a supreme need, not only in fee banana industry, but in agricultural industries generally. Protection is necessary to help the people who grow bananas, oranges, and so forth ; and though we may have to pay a little more for our South Australian oranges, or for our bananas, a policy which encourages a development of the kind I have indicated is worth paying for. It has been suggested that the quality of the Queensland bananas is inferior to that of the Fiji bananas. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. If the Tariff Commission desired authoritative and conclusive evidence as to the quality of bananas, they ought to have gone to the places where the bananas are grown - they could not expect the banana-growers to travel to Brisbane. Under the circumstances, I view the evidence with a great deal of suspicion, because, if it were desired to  have reliable statements as to quality, growers and other experts ought to have been examined in the places where fruit is grown. It may be that Queensland bananas are not up to the standard of selected Fiji bananas; but I make bold to say that,&#39; under ordinary circumstances, and for ordinary purposes, the Queensland banana is a very agreeable and nutritive fruit. It is possible that in Queensland the growers have not cultivated the banana with that closeness and scientific precision which obtains in Fiji, but, as a matter of fact, the Queensland people are fairlywell satisfied with the fruit as they produce it. I do not know whether the taste of Victorians and others is so superior that they can detect at once the difference between a Queensland and a -Fiji banana, but, although I am strongly opposed to all forms of gambling, I should not mind wagering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that I could place before him two bananas of such quality that he would find it difficult to determine which was which. </para>

            <para>- I have travelled on boats which have carried bananas from Cairns to Sydney, and I have also seen the Fiji fruit landed, at the latter city; and, from all outside appearance, there is not much difference between them. I think we may take it on the whole that the Queensland&#39; fruit is not much inferior, if at all, to that of the fruit from Fiji. I do not care to say much about the counter stroke delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in his contention that Queensland has&#39; had so much from the Commonwealth that it is time to stop the demand for any more. I regard the honorable senator&#39;s remarks as, so to speak, an appeal to provincial jealousy. I desire to urge, however, that there is incontestable evidence that the banana industry in Queensland is surely, though it may be slowly, passing from the hands of Chinese into the hands of white men. I have no desire to urge a prohibitive Tariff, but merely one that I think may rightly be regarded as fair. The duty now enjoyed elates from the inauguration of Federation, and the question whether it is deserved or undeserved is not worth discussing. </para>

          <para>. - I congratulate Queensland upon  having six real, good geographical senators.  Her  representatives may disagree on social and labour questions, but they are solid as a rock in regard to her industrial interests, being uninfluenced by arguments based on the interests of other States. They are above all else Queensland senators. It is admitted that bananas are a useful fruit food, and, in my opinion, there is an opening in the Australian markets for both Queensland and Fiji fruit. But there is another point of view from which we might well regard this question. Fiji is our nearest neighbour, and the future of the Commonwealth may be largely affected by the extent of her influence over the Pacific islands. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon endeavoured to bring about a federation between Fiji and New Zealand, Australia doing all she could to prevent it. Under these circumstances it would be well to have regard to the views of the Fijians on the subject of trade with Australia. I propose, therefore, to read to the Committee some statements which have been furnished to me, with the request that I should make them known to honorable senators. On the 25th July, 1905, the  President  of the Suva Chamber of Commerce, addressing the Prime Minister, said - </para>

        <para>With no thought of suggesting a threat, I may mention that there is a daily increasing inclination on the. part of our planters to urge the Government to establish reciprocal trade with New Zealand, which takes virtually all our exports and supplies us with so little. This feeling is being fanned under the smarting influence of self-defence, as the probability is forced upon us that New Zealand will put a duty on our fruit to favour the Cook and Raratonga Groups, which are planting up. </para>
        <para class="block">It is not surprising that the public sentiment of Fiji was much more favorable to New Zealand than to the Commonwealth. The statements which I have read furnish a strong indictment of the Commonwealth for want of interest in Fiji&#39;s development. There has been a great deal of correspondence on this subject, from which I take the following passage - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A question of vital importance is the trade facilities. What had seemed a natural reciprocity between the Commonwealth and Fiji existed a few years ago. Vessels laden with Australian merchandise went monthly fom Melbourne to Fiji, and returned freighted with the best bananas known in the markets of the world, as well as other tropical products. But this very satisfactory state of affairs is ended. Australia has almost annihilated the trade in bananas by Tariff regulations, practically shutting out the Fiji fruit. No direct boatsnow run to and from Melbourne, and theSydney steamers have other ports of call, thus, delaying the delivery of the fruit. New Zealand by her open door policy has captured agood deal of the Fiji trade, and received thebulk of the bananas grown during the last tenyears. Other portions of the trade, refused by Australia, have been diverted to England, Canada, or America, notwithstanding the greater- time taken in transit, and tha fact that a large proportion of Fiji&#39;s white settlers are exAustralians, take their holidays in Australia, and? regard the Commonwealth as the natural controlling power in the Pacific. </para>
          <para>No H. G. Well&#39;s imagination is necessary to foretell that, with the completion of the Panama Canal the present importance of Fiji as a port of call connected to the rest of the world by cable will be doubled ; aye, trebled and quadrupled ; that her trade (already not to be despised) will assume gigantic proportions; and that her general value will be vastly- increased. Speaking commercially, and without reference to political prejudice, who is to control and benefit by this increased trade? Is the Commonwealth, by a continuation of indifference to -the interests of Fiji, going to abandon her claim of superiority in these waters, and allow the new Dominion of New Zealand to carry off the plums of the&#39; position ? That England will, at some future time, delegate her control of the islands in the Pacific to one or the other of the larger colonies is almost certain. The preponderance of trade relations will be one of the largest factors in deciding to which colony such control shall be given, and present conditions indicate that New Zealand lias every chance of being selected. If Australia desires to have it, she must wake up to the true condition of affairs, and take active measures to regain the ground she has lost. There is no question of her ability to gain, keep, and perpetuate the sovereignty over these seas, but her inclination for such an- honour is still a matter of doubt. Scattered articles tn this subject have been appearing occasionally in various papers, both in New Zealand and the Commonwealth, and this indicates an awakening of public interest at the least. Should that awakening become sufficient to cause an investigation, the- British resident in Fiji hf.s great faith in the Australian&#39;s power of discernment, and will await with little or no apprehension the ultimate result. </para>

        <para>To the lover of statistics and the man who wants accurate figures for his facts, there are quite a number of books setting forth the present prosperity of the trade in the Pacific Islands generally, and Fiji in particular. During the year 1905-6, the total imports to Australia . from the Islands amounted to over ^200,000, and- in 1906-7 this had increased to &#163;300,000. On the face of things this would seem to guarantee that trade between the Commonwealth and these Islands was on a sufficiently firm basis to dispense with further bolstering, hut deeper investigation will show that while the total products imported have increased so largely, the percentage of the total amount produced in the Islands, finding its way to the Australian States, is much smaller than it was fifteen years ago. The trade returns for Fiji - everywhere recognised as the most important of the Islands of the Pacific - show an actual decrease of more than ,&#163;10,000 in the produce sent to Australia during the last vear alone. The shutting out policy adopted by the Commonwealth Tariff lias driven Island residents to seek for other markets with friendlier intentions, and where 99 per cent, of the </para>
        <para>Islands&#39; produce used to go to Australia, New Zealand now gets more than half, and Canada is already receiving an appreciable quantity. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>S. Larke, the resident Canadian Commercial agent at Sydney, reporting trade matters to his Government, among other things, stales : - &#34; The .Colonial Secretary of Fiji has been for some time in Melbourne in order to secure a reduction of the duties on bananas and some other productions of Fiji. He has offered a preferential treatment of imports into Fiji from Australia in return for the concession which he asks. It is not likely that the Australian Government will at present meet the request. Canada ought to be able to do so, as bananas ought to carry safely from Fiji to Canada, as might pineapples and other productions of the Island.&#34; </para>
        <para>The same thing applies to exports from Australia to the Islands. In 1905-6, the Islands  look  ,&#163;760,000 of Australian exports, and in 1906-7 the amount was ,&#163;840,000. But, again, this seeming increase is an actual loss in  Proportion  to the Islands&#39; purchases for the respective year. In Fiji alone the increase of import values was over ,&#163;300,000 during the last five years. And if we compare the prospects then and now the future of Fiji is looking very bright indeed. Up to 1906, only 73,000 out of the total 4,800,000 acres of land in Fiji were under cultivation. By far the larger portion of this being cane lands on the Rewa, Navua, Ba, Labasa, Penang, and Lautoka Sugar Estates. The balance was cocoanut producing, with a mere handful of planters growing bananas, and some three or four persons interested in stock. During the year 1906-7, something like 80,000 acres of the uncultivated lands have been either bought or leased on long lease, and sheep, cocoa, fibre, cattle and rubber are soon to be reckoned among the principal products!. In fact, every indication points to a speedy increase of the number of articles of export, as well as the quantity of those already being shipped. Every business man in Australia must ask : - &#34; Why should we let this growing trade  go  elsewhere? Shall we sit inertly by and see New Zealand and Canada pocket the profit of transactions which we could and should negotiate?&#34; </para>
        <para>Immediately following the visit of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> to these Islands, some eight years ago, the New Zealand party in Fiji all but succeeded in getting some sort of annexation to New Zealand. But the Australian element  predominated, and prevented the consummation of the scheme. It is very questionable whether, should the subject again become a &#34;live&#34; one, the sequel &#39;would be the same. Fiji has protested long and loudly against Australia&#39;s heavy taxation of her products. Leading merchants have used their trade influence ; the Planters&#39; Association and Chambers of .Commerce have forwarded protests ; and the Government has sent its Colonial Secretary to personally represent the injustice^ of the procedure - all in vain. Australia is injuring herself as well as her trade  bv this Tariff on bananas. It is more and more recognised that the banana is one of the most wholesome, useful, and universally acceptable vegetable fruits existent, and in driving the trade of Fiji from her shores Australia is also depriving her citizens of the best banana to be obtained at the present time in any of the world&#39;s markets. It is but a question of time when the demand for bananas will exceed the supply. Already the Queenslanders find it impossible to keep the Melbourne market alone adequately supplied (and, merely by the way, with an inferior fruit), with fresh bananas, and to argue that the trade, under such circumstances, needs protection, is absurd. It does not need protection from Fiji to-day  -  (1) Because of the greater distance the Fiji fruit has to be carried, and the primitive method of. carrying it in vessels that make no attempt to retard maturing ; and (2) the non-organization of growers in Fiji, and the very indifferent facilities for cutting, packing, loading and unloading. These reasons cause a very large per cent. of loss on each Fiji shipment, and, while the markets on the sea board may be full for a few days after the arrival of a steamer, it is impossible to reach inland cities or towns, or keep the fruit in a marketable condition until the next boatload arrives. There will be no need for protection of the Queensland market to-morrow, when these things are overcome, because the enlargement of the market will mean that there is room for all. The installation of proper fruit carrying vessels will insure a minimum of loss to planter and shipper, and greatly prolong the edible life of the Fiji banana in Australian markets. The rapidity with which a banana market enlarges itself when a controlled and steady supply can be obtained has been illustrated in America and England. During the last ten years the number of bananas shipped into America has been almost doubled yearly, and with an elaborate system of handling and packing in Cuba, and the employment of boats which arrest the maturing process, and land bananas at the port of discharge in exactly the same condition as when they are received over the ship&#39;s side, the losses from all causes do not amount to more than1 per cent. per annum. The same is true to a lesser degree of the trade between the West Indies and London. Capital, co-operation, and some degree of consideration from the larger to the lesser, will make the same conditions possible between the Commonwealth and Fiji. Should a mother discriminate between her children? Should one be crippled that another may grow more comely? The Commonwealth stands in the place of a mother to all these little struggling South Sea Islands, and were the proper balance arrived at, Queensland would hold the position of elder sister only to the rest of the family, and be given no more than an elder sister is privileged to get. To continue the somewhat homely simile, if the mother wishes to retain the confidence and affection of her children she must consider their wants and distribute her gifts as wisely as she knows how, and so must Australia listen to the desires of the Island daughters, and distribute her justice in decisions that cannot be questioned.  Her  supremacy cannot continue if she persists in enforcing prohibitive Tariff rates on all the Islands produce merely because they happen to be obtainable also within the boundaries of the Confederated States. Neither may she hope to retain her power if the present policy of indifference as to where the Islanders purchase their supplies. </para>
        <para>One argument that should appeal to every Australian sentiment in support of the fact that Australia should foster Fiji trade, is that the biggest business concern in the colony - a concern so large that it is often said locally that the Fiji Government merely exists for the convenience of the C.S.R. Co. - is owned and entirely controlled by absentee landlords - Australians resident in Australia. Fiji&#39;s coal bill for her mills, her boats, her engines of all kinds, is paid to Australians. Australian insurance companies carry the risks of buildings and citizens in Fiji. The manager of the Fiji branch of the Bank of NewSouth Wales - McRae, a Victorian - is an elected member of the Legislative Council, and one of the most forcible speakers therein. The entire colony is honeycombed with Australian energy and Australian interests. </para>
        <para class="block">It goes on to show the advantages from the agricultural point of view. I will not trespass upon the patience of honorable senators by reading any more passages from the document. I think I have read sufficient to indicate to every honorable senator the extent of the trade with Fiji, her prospects as regards development, and to point out that the trade of the Pacific Islands is of very great importance to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I realize that this question, looked at through Fijian eyes, far transcends the question of either free-trade or protection in relation to bananas. The question is, Do we want to exercise all the power we can to foster friendly and business relations between the Pacific Islands and ourselves? Do honorable senators attach more importance to the imposition of a duty of1s. per cental on a few bananas which are necessary for the people than to the question of doing all in our power to draw the Pacific Islands into the Australian fold? To&#39; my mind, the latter should be the dominant consideration, and even if I were the strongest protectionist in the Chamber I would vote in the direction of cultivating business and social relations with all the native races in the Pacific Ocean. With the desire to promote the best interests of the Commonwealth, not only for to-day, but in the future, I for one will vote for the amendment to make bananas free. </para>

            <para>- It would be foolish to suggest that the authorities in the Crown Colony of Fiji expect the Commonwealth to frame its Tariff for their special benefit. So far as the management of native affairs is concerned, they keep in mind only the interest of the Colony, and act quite regardless of what the outside world may think. They indent coolie labour, and allow the white man, whenever the policeman is out of the way, to flail his niggers as long as he can stand over them. While that condition of things is considered right and proper by the governing authorities in Fiji, it would be as sensible to say that oil and&#39; water willmix as to say that we should keep our minds fixed on any possible association of interest between the Commonwealth and that Crown Colony. They will manage their own affairs, and it is for the people of Australia to look after theirs. Coming to the matter of the imposition of a duty of1s. per cental on bananas, I wish to say that the figures given to the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Chataway</inline> are highly instructive. They go to show that after the date when the banana industry in Queensland received the benefit of protection - that is from 1 901. until the cyclone happened in 1906 - the increase in production was something in the neighbourhood of 100 per cent. If we remove this solitary shield that has in the past enabled the banana industry in Queensland to live and prosper, it simply means that it will be at the mercy of competitors in the South Sea Islands. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking, I admit, from second-hand information and not from actual experience. I will satisfy myself by saying that certainly there are some white men in the industry, and while there are some engaged in it i am not going to place it at the mercy of Indians in the South Sea Islands where the conditions of production are farmore favorable than they are in this country. The Chinese argument has been the principal one brought forward against the duty. But I wish to remind honorable senators that we are already protecting other industries which are carried on by Chinese to a greater or lesser degree. Take the furniture and cabinetmaking industries of Australia. Under this Tariff it is proposed to protect the cabinet-making industry by duties of 35 per cent, and 25 per cent. But although there are many Chinese engaged in that industry I am not going to allow that consideration to influence me to force duties down to such a level that none but Chinese. will be able to be employed. Take the vegetable industry. We propose tei&#39; impose a duty of as. per cental on vegetables. The vegetable growing industry is one in which a large number of Chinese are and will continue to be employed. When honorable senators speak of the Chinese employed in banana growing they should not forget the other industries in which Chinese are engaged. It is quite plain to me that if we reduce the duty the trade will to a very large extent go to Fiji, and that means that a corresponding area of land will be thrown out of cultivation in the tropical portions of Australia. Now, one of the great problems that will confront the Cpm-  monwealth Legislature both now and in the future is - What is the best and easiest means of encouraging our white population to settle in the tropical areas? We have that problem to solve. If we remove this duty on bananas we shall certainly be taking a step which will induce white men to look less favorably upon the tropical areas fis places in which to find a living. We shall throw the trade into the hands of banana growers in Fiji and the South Seas. It is also to be remembered that land in the South Sea Islands is much easier to bring into cultivation than is land in North Queensland, which is in the nature of jungle. We have there a dense jungle which has to be cleared before it can be made to produce bananas, whereas so far as ray experience goes - and it has not been a small one - land in the South Sea Islands is comparatively easy to bring under cultivation. Along the river flats there is nothing like the dense jungle that we have in North Queensland. It is easily made to produce a rich crop of bananas. Moreover, in the South Sea Islands there is plenty of&#39; cheap coloured labour. The coolie labour of India has  been  largely intro.duced and much of the land there is owned by Indians. </para>

            <para>- If the issue is narrowed down to choosing between encouraging Indians in Fiji and Chinamen in North Queensland I shall certainly give a vote which will protect the occupation of people in our own country. However, there does not seem to be any reason why banana cultivation should not be successfully .undertaken by white workers. The land is plentiful and the cultivation is easy. . The sprouts around the trees are sufficient to keep the crop growing perennially, and the cultivation does not involve any great amount of labour. On that ground alone I would urge that this is a most desirable industry to perpetuate in the tropical areas of Australia. Without delaying matters unnecessarily I wish to state that I shall support the item as it stands, in the belief that the duty is necessary to keep in cultivation as large an &#34; area of tropical Australia as possible ; secondly in the  belief  that this industry will later on develop into a white man&#39;s industry; and, in the third place, because it is necessary to keep the trade as far as possible in the hands of Australians. * </para>

          <para>. - I am amazed to see how unsophisticated some of our Labour senators are becoming. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has appeared for the time being as the champion of the Chinaman. But I cannot forget the White Australia principles that both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> were elected to maintain, nor can I forget that so long as we encourage the Chinaman in Australia we run the risk of endangering the White Australia policy. There can b&#39;e no denying the fact that the more encouragement we give to the Chinaman, whether as a vendor of fruit or as a grower, we are running directly opposite to those principles of ours. We have been assured that if we grant the protection asked for to the Queensland /banana industry it will eventually fall into the hands of white men. But I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and other Labour senators over and over again in this chamber, argue in the very opposite direction, and say that so long as the kanaka or the Chinaman, or the coloured man of any kind, is engaged in any particular industry there is no. hope for the white man entering into it. No man in this chamber has urged that argument more strongly than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor;</inline> but he is now prepared to vote to keep the Chinaman in the banana industry. </para>

I remember him when he has been so virtuous in insisting upon his White Australia principles as to say that he would refuse even to occupy a room in an hotel where a Chinese cook was employed. But he is quite prepared to tax the people of Australia to compel them to eat bananas grown by Chinamen. </para>

            <para>- There is no more blood on the banana produced by the kanaka or the coolie in his own home in the Islands, than there is upon the productions of Chinamen in Australia. As to the Chinese engaged in the furniture trade in Melbourne, or any other part of Australia, as far as I am concerned, I hope that something will be done to insure that no protection is given tothem. The Chinaman can receive no benefit from our protective duties, if we choose to take proper steps. Why should we not impose an Excise duty on the productions of the Chinese, just as we have imposed an Excise duty upon the sugar produced by kanakas in Queensland ? </para>

            <para>- I am just to the people of Australia. I do not want to give them bananas grown by Chinamen, nor do I want them to be taxed to uphold the Chinese who are the only persons concerned in this industry in Australia. The attitude taken up by some honorable senators upon this question is inconsistent with the stand they made when that of old-age pensions was under consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> opposed the imposition of a duty on tea, by which it was proposed to provide a fund for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. At that time, the consumers of Australia were the only care of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and others ;. they lost sight of the fact that it was the poor of Australia who were to benefit. They could not get away from the principle of free-trade, and insisted that we should have free tea, even if it meant the sacrifice of an old-age pensions system. They seem now to have forgotten the attitude which they then took up, and are quite prepared to tax one of the foods of the people, not to provide for an old-age pensions scheme, but to protect the Chinamen. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will tell their constituents what manner of protectionists they are - that they believe in protection for the Chinamen of North Queensland. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators who agreed to that subsidy are now proposing to shut out of Australia, by means of a tax, one of the products of Fiji. Is this not a curious illustration of the consistency shown in connexion with some of our legislation ? Some honorable senators were prepared to vote a subsidy to encourage trade between Australia and the Pacific Islands, and yet they now propose to support &#38; tax on bananas from one of the islands of the Pacific, on the ground that thev are grown by kanakas, and must not be allowed to enter Australia to compete with those grown by Chinese. </para>

            <para>- They have no right to expect the white people of Australia to tax themselves in order to assist one of their industries. If this duty amounts to something like 25 per cent. . and there are three or four bunches to the cental, it must be admitted that it is a veryheavy impost. Yet I was told last night that it was not protective. To my mind it has a very considerable protective incidence. The production of bananas in Australia is now greater than it was before the duty was imposed. My contention is that by imposing this duty we shall undermine the great principle of a White Australia, and I wish to warn honorable- senators so that they cannot say hereafter that no protest was raised. Certainly no protest was raised when other items affecting industries in which Chinese are engaged were under consideration. I am sorry ; but even if any had been raised some, honorable senators would probably have said that it was a mere waste of time, because the items were considered by another place and we should not challenge them. At the outset we proceeded on those lines, but we made no progress. We have placed an embargo on sugar grown in Australia by coloured labour, and have granted a measure of preference to white-grown sugar. Why should we not extend the. same principle to the production of bananas or anything else? </para>

          <para>. - I am really shocked at the attitude taken up by the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat. I think that I am as ardent a supporter of the policy of a White Australia as it is possible to find, but I hope that we shall secure a White Australia by humane and fair means. We have decided to abolish the kanaka, so far as Australia is concerned, by means that are not cruel. We have said that we do not want him, and have made provision for his deportation. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie desires that we shall neither deport the Chinaman nor permit him to live. We are to murder him by starvation. </para>

            <para>- We imposed conditions under which they might come here; we have now conditions under which no more may come. But if we are fairminded we shall either provide for the humane deportation of those who are here or permit them to live under conditions that are fair and reasonable. So much for the extraordinary attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. If it is defensible in that connexion, it is indefensible on another ground, and that is the granting of protection to Australian industries. The honorable senator claims to be, and I believe in the main is, a protectionist. This industry, if developed, will continue under the conditions that developed it; but the Chinaman cannot continue here, because we have already made provision that renders his continuance impossible. Thus from a protectionist point of view, even if we assume for the sake of argument that the honorable senator&#39;s first proposition with reference to the treatment of the Chinaman is defensible, it is indefensible to prevent the development of an industry which will go on when the Chinaman is extinct in Australia. </para>

          <para>- The increased duty is proposed simply for the purpose of giving additional protection. There have been imports of vegetables into the Commonwealth to the extent, in  1903,  of  4,451  centals;  1904, 4,101  centals;  1905, 4,145  centals; and  1906, 4,483  centals. The bulk of these importations came from China, andit is thought desirable to increase the production of vegetables for our requirements by Australians in Australia. The extra duty is proposed for that reason. </para>

It was a slip. He was probably caught unawares when he spoke, because this duty is ridiculously trivial. We had previously a duty of1s., which was ornamental - or something else - and now, with a total collection of&#163;246 under that duty, the. rate is to be increased in the interests of protection to 2s. It is absolutely farcical. </para>

          <para>.- Most of the duty must have been paid on green vegetables coming from New Zealand at certain times of the year. The Tariff Commission recommended that the duty should be1s. It looks a very small item for the Government to impose an extra1s. upon without rhyme or reason. If the Tariff Commission had recommended the increase, or shown some grounds for it, there might have been something in it. The duty is absurd, considering that the whole amount collected last year from the Commonwealth with a population of 4,000,000 people, was &#163;246. If the Tariff Commission had looked at the matter in the right light, they would have recommended striking the duty out altogether. I move - </para>

There is a great deal of difference between dried vegetables and dried herbs, and there is no country in the world so well adapted as Australia is for the drying and preparation generally of culinary herbs. In South Australia and other States people have settled on small blocks of a character scarcely suitable for any other industry. These blocks were cleared and put into cultivation, even before the inauguration of the Commonwealth, with the idea that the then protection would encourage the industry. Evidence was given  before the Tariff Commission by one grower, representing others in South Australia, and he was very emphatic in his request that the duty on dried herbs should be 4d. per lb. That evidence and other information induced the protectionist section of the Commission to make a recommendation to that effect. I do not know how it happened, but another place, by inadvertence or otherwise, included dried herbs in the same item as dried vegetables. </para>

It has been shown that it is absolutely necessary to have protection to the extent of 4d. per lb. in order that the industry may be established and flourish. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has indicated that he has a prior amendment, I shall leave honorable senators now to think the matter over.

            <para>- I have looked through the schedule carefully, and in addition to the error we saw in reference to citrus fruits there are other serious errors. I suggest to honorable senators that if they wish to be perfectly certain they should refer to the reports of the Tariff Commission, because, while the recommendations as they appear in the schedule may in most instances be technically right, there is very frequently some qualification or modification which takes away from the effect of the recommendation. It is. not correct to call my proposal a reduction of the duty, because it is rather a proposal that there shall be no increase. The effect of the duty is not to call into existence any industry, and it will not help the market gardener, but it will make the man who has to use dried vegetables, and whose lot is sufficiently hard, pay more for the things he requires. Seeing that there is no advantage to any Australian industry, I ask the Committee to support a proposal that the duty shall be 15 per cent. </para>

          <para>.- I hold in my hand a document issued by the Government, purporting to give reliable information about the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has just shown that it is incorrect, so far as item  61  is concerned, and that it contains many more incorrect statements. That being so, I suggest that it be withdrawn, and a correct statement substituted. </para>

            <para>- The sooner the leader of the Senate withdraws the document and issues another one the better it will be for us. If it is correct that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of  15  per cent. - and T do not know whether it is or not - I feel inclined to support the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I plead to a certain amount of ignorance as to the possibilities of this item. I notice that in  1906  we imported  .&#163;5,777  worth of dried vegetables yielding a revenue of  &#163;887.  Tn view of the fact that the protectionist&#39; section of the Tariff Commission had an opportunity to travel to all parts of the Commonwealth, and to obtain the fullest information on the subject, I am quite prepared to support their recommendation that the duty should be fixed at  15  per cent. </para>

It is not too much to fine an unfortunate ship&#39;s captain  &#163;100  because a Chinaman has been caught ashore, and here we have the Government barracking for protective duties for Chinese growers of bananas and cabbages. </para>

If the duty on the article is increased, its price will certainly , be raised. My leader is only asking for attention to be given to the position of the settlers in the way-back districts. I contend that a little consideration ought to be extended to them. Undoubtedly an increased duty will only increase the hardships of persons in the very places where &#39; we wish to make life as easy as possible. I ask honorable senators not to listen to the cry of Victorians who have not been outside the shadow of Melbourne, but to extend some consideration to the hardy pioneers of the continent. </para>

          <para>. - The last  speaker  has spoken about the unwisdom of honorable senators listening to Victorians who have never been outside Melbourne. I think it is a very unfair assumption that every Victorian has been confined to Melbourne.I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that in a very recent division some Victorians proved their knowledge ofwhat was done in the farthermost point of Queensland. They gave a vote which showed that they had sympathy for Queensland as well as for Victoria. They recognised that they were Australians first, and that is the attitude which we ought always to take. We cannot conserve more effectively the interests of the far-back settler, who seldom gets vegetables, than by adopting means which will lead to their production in great Quantities here. At present, if this duty has any effect, these vegetables are imported from distant parts. If we could do anything which would lead to the preservation of vegetables - which, it must be admitted, can be grown in some parts of Australia as varied and as excellent as they can be grown in any part of the world - we should. </para>

        <para>SenatorTRENWITH. - I am not now engaged in answering questions, nor do  I  propose to ask any. I have some considerable knowledge of the effect of duties.  I  have watched their operation withvery great closeness for many years, and therefore I am in a position to say, and, if  it  were necessary, to prove from many  instances,  that the immediate effect of the imposition of a duty is to  induce  local production, and the subsequent effect  is  for the local competition to materially reduce the price, not merely of the local article, but also of the article that is imported and used to be sold at a higher price. That has been the effect, not in one, but  in  many instances, of the imposition of a duty.  I  simply urge that in Australia there are times when vegetables are grown  in immense  abundance, and that any means which would provide an opportunity to  dry  the surplus, or otherwise make it a useful article for future consumption, would  be  an advantage both to the settler, and sometimes the somewhat distant settler, who is growing for the markets, and to the settler who has not yet achieved the possibility of growing. </para>

            <para>- There  are different kinds of compressed vegetables to suit the tastes of all sorts of people. I have another reason for voting for the proposed duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger is very anxious to know why some of us depart from the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. I am doing so in this instance because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is so anxious to stick to our recommendation. He is an avowed free-trader. I like to be on the other side from him, and therefore I shall vote for the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Commission. I am actually afraid of myself when I am on the same side as the honorable senator. The free-trade section&#39;s recommendation is 20 per cent. They must have had very good reasons when they -went to such extremes in the direction of protection. So little sympathy has been extended by honorable Senators to- the recommendations of the free-trade section that I am glad to have an opportunity of supporting one of them. </para>

          <para>. - We have heard a most determined plea by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> for encouraging the industry of preserving and compressing vegetables. One might imagine from &#39;his enthusiasm that a very important industry was at stake. But the duty paid under the old Tariff for  1906  amounted to only  &#163;887.  We shall surely not be able to plume ourselves that we have made an important difference to a local industry by the simple addition of  5.  per cent, to the duty. The amount received by the Customs represents duty on all sorts of compressed and dried vegetables in every kind of preparation. As far as it is necessary to import these goods it is desirable to have them sold cheaply, because there are some remote parts of the Commonwealth to which fresh vegetables never go. Even in mv own State, which ought to be able to supply vegetables <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> every part of the country, there are plenty of people, living at mines and far away from railway stations, who are unable to get fresh vegetables. The form in which these goods are mostly imported is that of prepared potatoes, which are a fair substitute for fresh vegetables when none other can be obtained. This is a revenue duty imposed on a very limited class of persons. In my opinion, what we really ought to do is to make the item free. </para>

          <para>. - I should not have spoken on this item had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> submitted this request. In. fact, I do not know that I should have even taken the trouble to vote, because it seems to me to be ridiculous to take up time in debating a difference of 5 per cent. in what must in any case be a revenue duty. It is absolutely idle to talk of this being anything else. The bulk of the goods affected are preserved potatoes. At one time I had the experience of having to spend nine months in the interior of Western Australia, where we could get no fresh vegetables. We had to face the question of what we were going to do for vegetable food, and the wholesale grocer whom we consulted said, &#34; The best form in which you can take them is that of preserved potatoes.&#34; These goods are all imported. What is the use of talking about a local industry in such a line as this, when the number of people so situated as to require dried vegetables are so few that if all the preserved potatoes consumed in Australiawere put up in the country it would not keep one factory going ? It is simply a waste of time to argue about the difference between15 per cent. and 20 per cent. Let us either make the duty prohibitive or make the item free. I would rather vote for 30 per cent. than 15 per cent., but I welcome the opportunity of voting to make the item free, because if that be agreed to it will have the effect of reducing the price. </para>

            <para>- I am not reflecting upon the vote which my honorable friend intends to give. But we have already decided to tax bananas, which in this country are wholly produced by Chinamen, and now we are asked to make dried or preserved vegetables free. I know that the preserving of these goods is done by white men. But though it is hard to vote consistently, yet, as these goods are a food, consumed by a very small section of the community, I think that any consideration we can extend to them would be proper. I shall vote to place the item on the free list. </para>

          <para>- Why did my honorable friend&#39;s colleagues support a preferential duty on Japanese bamboo&#39; window and verandah blinds as being manufactured in Great Britain? At least compressed vegetables are manufactured in the United Kingdom, and while the Government are so loud mouthed in their professions as to the splendid present that they are making to the United Kingdom by a preferential rate in favour of bamboo blinds, let us see whether they are honest in their professions, and are prepared to vote for a preference in favour of compressed vegetables from the United Kingdom. </para>

          <para>. - This appears to be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> special little bantling. He introduced it to the Committee in a comparatively offhand way as a proposal he expected us to carry straightaway, but I think we ought to know a little of the history of the proposal. Had it not come before the Tariff Commission I suppose that the Government would not have embodied it in the Tariff. It represents the request of one decent man, against whom I have nothing to say, who was working on a block&#34; of about 10 acres on One Tree Hill, near Adelaide. </para>

          <para>Is it a workman&#39;s block that you hold on One Tree Hill? - Yes; it is all wild bush country. 1  want to premise that I sympathize with this little chap, so to speak, but I desire to point out the circumstances under which we are asked to impose this ditty of  4d.  per lib. Dried herbs are used chiefly in the manufacture of sausages, and probably by all skilled cooks. The introduction of herbs doubtless improves many things that we eat, but that is hardly the question before us. The following questions were put to the witness - </para>
          <para>The price at which you sell your produce is 4d. ner lb. ? - The price varies according to the cost. </para>
          <para>Do you sell much at 4d. per lb.? - Yes; I sell ton lots at that price. </para>
          <para>Do you sell many ton lots? - No. </para>
          <para>How. many tons does your farm producer - Last year was a good year, and I harvested a little over two tons. </para>

But are we seriously to be asked to levy a duty of  4d.  per lb. upon the herbs which he produces and sells at that price, seeing that his total production for the year was only 2 tons? I expect to hear, shortly, that a vast amount of labour is employed in the industry, so I propose to read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westley&#39;s</inline> evidence upon that point. </para>

If we. are expected to expend our sympathy upon every little man in the Commonwealth, where shall we land ourselves? The thing will degenerate into a huge farce. We are asked to give a protection of 100 per cent, upon the production of dried herbs, notwithstanding that there is not the faintest chance of any of these herbs being imported irrespective of whether or not any duty is imposed upon them. I suppose that nine out of every ten householders in the Commonwealth &#39; grow their own herbs. If the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is to establish an industry by means of this duty, his proposal is a ridiculous one, whereas, if his desire is to levy a duty upon cooks, it goes too far. </para>

            <para>- In addition to the &#34; nice little man &#34; to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has referred, there are quite  a  number of small-block holders, not. only in the. district of One-Tree Hill, but in the Adelaide Hills, who derive n&#62; considerable proportion of their livelihood from the growing and drying of herbs. Quite  a  number of market-gardeners depend for  a  good portion of their livelihood upon the cultivation of herbs. I should like to read  to the Committee the letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westley</inline> to the Tariff Commission; in which he stated his case. Honorable senators will then be able to see what induced the protectionist section of that body to recommend the imposition of a duty of 4d. per lb. upon dried herbs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westley&#39;s</inline> letter reads - </para>

          <para>Dear Sirs, </para>
          <para>Some twelve years since I was induced by our Government appealing to our people to settle on the land. I accordingly invested my bit of capital, and took land up at One Tree Hill- </para>
          <para>After clearing and planting my land with the help of my family, I went in extensively for the growing of herbs (thyme, sage, <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c.).&#39;</inline> At this time I was assisted in my venture by a protective duty of 2d. per lb., which just enabled us to make both ends meet, but on the Federal Government rearranging the Tariff this duty was abandoned, and as a consequence we are now unable to grow the stuff to compete with the imported article, the result being that my years of labour money, together with the labour of my family, have been absolutely thrown away, and now instead of having something to depend upon, I have to find work away from home, besides either abandoning my block or trying to replant with something else in place of herbs which means further expense and labour, and which I am notin a position to do, as we would have to wait too long for results. </para>
          <para>I would respectfully suggest to the Commission that by the imposing of, say, a 4d. duty per lb.on this article they would be helping to keep myself and others on the land, and this commodity not being used heavily the duty would not press on the consumer.I do not propose calling any evidence, asI cannot afford to lose the time it would entail, but leave my case in the hands of the Commission and trust to the favorable consideration of this matter at their hands. </para>

        <para class="block">The idea that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has attempted to convey to the Committee is that dried herbs can be sold for 4d. per lb., when as a matter of fact <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westley</inline> told the Commission that it is worth 3d. per lb. merely to dry them.  His  complaint is that there is no possible chance of his obtaining a living from the production and drying of herbs without a sufficient protection. He further pointed out that his land having been used for the cultivation of herbs is altogether unfit for grazing purposes. He embarked upon the enterprise with the aid of a protective duty under the old South Australian Tariff, and now that that duty has been abolished he asks that it shall be re-imposed. A number of honorable senators ridicule the idea that a small industry should be protected. I contend that a. small industry, if native to the country, is just as deserving of protection as is a large industry. If we take a number of small industries, each of which may seem scarcely worthy of protecting, we shall find that in the aggregate they employ a large amount of labour. Each of the persons engaged in them is a customer of other manufacturers, and it is not fair, therefore, to ridicule this industry merely because it is of small dimensions. I hope that the Committee will not laugh out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> proposition, but will consider the interests of the small man on the land as well as those of the large city manufacturer. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to explain the reason why a duty of 20 per cent. was imposed upon this item in another place in lieu of 4d. per lb. The statement was made that these dried herbs were the raw material of butchers and sausage manufacturers, and consequently the item was allowed to pass upon the voices. To urge that the industry is a struggling one is a farce. Herbs can be grown in any State in Australia without  the least difficulty, and any cook in the community can dry them sufficiently for ordinary purposes. </para>

          <para>. - There is no proposition to alter the old rate of duty in this case. The argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been advanced and replied to here and in another place, not on onions, but on other items such as wheat, hay, and various other products which it has been the policy of the Commonwealth, since we have had a Commonwealth Tariff, to protect. In times of drought, the drought is not general throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, and there are parts which can produce what Other parts lack. An illustration was given to-day in connexion with one of the staple products of Queensland, honorable senators from which State told us that there have been shortages due to cyclones, but that under the normal conditions of Australia) they can produce bananas enough to meet the requirements of Australia. So, under normal conditions, the onions required in Australia can be produced if not in one State then in another. The largest importation of onions from any single country last year came from Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> proposition is to&#39; throw open to Japan a greater market in Australia for its onions. During the last few years important cases have come before the Courts in New South Wales in connexion with contracts arising out of the supply of onions from Japan. </para>

            <para>- It is absolutely correct. Here is a case in point with regard to onions. The Minister of Home Affairs knows absolutely nothing  of  the subject, when he says that at a time of dearth in one part there is a sufficiency in another, part of Australia. I was at one time perhaps the largest grower of onions in New South Wales, and I know something of the subject. Last year and the year before onions went up to  ^28  per ton, and the public -had to pay extraordinary prices. Onions  are  used very largely by the working classes ; and, but for  those imported from Japan at the time mentioned, there would have been none on the market. Onion-growing is principally a Victorian industry,  a&#62;nd  the market is rigged by those interested in their cultivation in that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is doing good work in showing what protection run mad will do for the working classes of Australia in times of drought and adversity. Onions are  a,  necessary and healthy food of the people ; and, in face of the facts, it is absolute hypocrisy to say that, in all circumstances, there is a sufficient supply for the people at a reasonable price. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;9.47&#93;.-  This is a duty which operates only in time of scarcity, and increases the price to the consumer; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has  not  presented the matter too  Strongly.  The argument, as the Minister says, applies to a great many other items; and, to my mind, it applies very strongly to the duty on cattle, sheep, and so forth, and most obviously to onions. This is not a protective duty in any sense of the term, because it does not encourage the production of one onion more. The supply, except in bad seasons, is amply sufficient to meet the consumption ; and we ought to regard the duty from the point of view of what its effect will be. In  1903,  which was the first year of .the full operation of the finally revised Tariff,  1,190  cwt. of onions were imported, as compared with  1,248  cwt. in  1904,  and  50,348  cwt. in  1905,  when there was a &#39;shortage owing to bad seasons. The latter was the year in which the price of onions rose to an abnormal figure; and no duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton would have kept out onions at such a time, though, of course, the impost would add that amount to the price. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator anticipates me.  Of course, it paid J apan, . the United States, and other places, to send onions here when the price was from  &#163;2 5  to  &#163;30  per ton, and the impost of a duty of is. per cwt, merely added to the price. As I have been reminded, it suits our own people, even in times of drought, to make little shipments of onions to places which are no doubt less favored than Australia. </para>

In the Wellington district of New South Wales, for instance, the Chinese cultivation of onions is a great flourishing industry, just as is&#34; the Chinese cultivation of bananas in Queensland. This may be described as the Chinese Customs Duties Government, because they are falsifying all their professions, both as to. a White Australia and as to British preference. The Government are dragging themselves, or being dragged, through mud of the most pestilential character, in a way that no set of gentlemen, with any self-respect or honour, would permit. Bananas, vegetables, and onions all represent Chinese industries which are being supported and protected by the champions of a White Australia. </para>

          <para>- - I cannot understand the Minister of Home Affairs objecting to my argument on the ground that it has been used before. Of course, the argument has been used before, and has probably been presented in a much better fashion than I can present it. The honorable gentleman has tried to raise the bogy of Japan as a possible competitor., but he cannot have paid very close attention to the statistics, or he would have seen that Australia, so far from being an importer, is a huge exporter. In 1904 the exportation was represented by 105,000 cwt. of onions, and in 1906, which the Minister of Home Affairs has instanced as a time when there were some importations, I find that the latter were represented by 13,000 cwt., while the exports amounted to 52,000 cwt. It would be as sensible to impose a duty on wool. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has said that this is essentially a Chinese industry, but in doing that he libelled a. number of deserving citizens of his own State. However, it is only one of those wild sweeping assertions made simply for the purpose of saying something on a subject of which the honorable senator knows nothing. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> onion industry is&#39; a big one, not only&#34; in Victoria, but in almost every other State of the Commonwealth, and, as the electors Happen to have proclaimed in favour of a protective policy, onion-growers are entitled to a measure of protection. In the Portarlington and western districts of Victoria there are numbers of white men growing onions, and they have asked for a duty of 5s. per. cwt. to protect them from the competition of Italy and Japan, where labourers work longer hours and receive lower wages than are customary in Australia. </para>

            <para>- There is no like lihood of Australia being without onions if encouragement is given to our farmers. It would not be logical to wipe out the local onion industry on the ground that those engaged in it aremostly Chinamen - thoughI do not admit that that is so - and allow onions to be imported free from Japan. Those who are consistent protectionists should see that consideration is given to onion growers as well asto other primary producers. </para>

          <para>. -This item - and there are others likeit - shows how the ordinary member of Parliament fears his constituents. Nothing could be more illusory than this duty. But it is astonishing- what effect the statement that we ought to consider the farmers has upon honorable senators generally. In my opinion, a number of honorable senators regard this as a useless duty, and yet are afraid to allow onions to be admitted free. Of course, I do not refer to protectionists like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> though I am surprised that he is content with as low a duty as is. </para>

            <para>- No doubt. Victoria is the home of such practices. . More than one attempt has been made here to increase the price of onions in that way. I have sat on the Opposition side of the chamber almost as long as I have been in this Parliament; but. although  1  and a few others may be regarded as insane freetraders, I did not expect that my insanity would be pointed out by an honorable senator sitting on these benches. We have been told that at the inauguration of Federation there was a sort of agreement with Tasmania that_ there should be a duty on onions, but I never heard of it before. It is a common protectionist gag to tell&#34; the electors that Australia needs Inter-State free-trade and protection against the outer world. Protectionists who use it try to induce the poor fool of a farmer to believe that th&#39;y are actively engaged in bringing about Inter-State free-trade.  1  am not going to tell the farmers of Tasmania that, although I believe in freetrade, I shall take precious good care &#34;that their onions and apples are protected. I have said to them that I believe that freetrade is good for all, and I shall apply it whenever and wherever I can. I am not going to make an opportunity to vote to place every item on the free list; but I shall certainly do what I can to make articles of food free. I shall therefore vote te remove the duty on onions. </para>

            <para>- There is a duty on wheat, and when it was proposed not very long ago to remit that duty there was an outcry from the farmers against its remission. That shows that the farmers felt the protection to be operative and to be an advantage to them,  and therefore they clamoured for its maintenance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said that onion growing is a Chinaman&#39;s industry. It is quite obvious that he does not know anything about onion growing in Australia, except in one little portion of it. He has proved that in . that part of New South Wales which he mentioned it is a Chinaman&#39;s industry, but certainly in Australia it is not. It is not a Chinaman&#39;s industry in Victoria, where a great many more onions are grown than in New South Wales. Nor is it a Chinaman&#39;s industry in South Australia, where also a great many more onions are grown than in New South Wales: one district alone - Mount Gambier - grows more onions than are grown in New South Wales, and grows them with white men, too. </para>

          <para>. - Since I addressed the Committee reference has been made to the fact that during last year and at other times the Commonwealth has been an exporter of onions. What would be the possible position of the Commonwealth if the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> were agreed to? Since 1902 - in fact since 1901 - there has been a duty of 20s. a ton on onions coming into the Commonwealth, and what has taken&#39; place has been governed by that as well as by other conditions. Prior to Federation, there was a duty levied in each State excepting New South Wales, where onions were admitted free. In Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia tlie duty was 20s. a ton, while in South Australia it was 40s. a ton. In 1899 New South Wales imported from the other colonies in the group and from other countries 180,655 cwts. of onions, of which 46.215 cwts. came from New Zealand. The total importation of onions in the six States last year amounted to only 13,155 cwts. When New South Wales had no duty she imported fourteen times the quantity of onions that the whole Commonwealth now imports under a duty of is. a cwt. If the duty were taken off, New South Wales, instead of getting, as she  does now, so many onions &#34;from the other States, would turn again to New Zealand, Italy, Japan, and the United States, and of course other parts of the Commonwealth would do the same. It is a reasonable and fair thing that we should protect these industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> stated just now that, to a certain extent, to impose this duty as a protection to the farmer as to gull the farmer. I do not share his view, nor do I think that the farmers as a rule do. Apart altogether from candidates standing for the Federal Parliament, I know that when Tasmania was asked in- 1899 to enter the Commonwealth one of the strongest arguments used by the farmers who doubted the wisdom of their colony taking that step was that they would lose their own protective duties. They were told, &#34;Never mind that; you will get free-trade within the Commonwealth and protection against the world.&#34; That was said to them, not by candidates, because no elections were pending then, but by federalists, including even the ordinary&#39; free-trade newspaper. I have&#39; in my possession an article  in which one of the most important free-trade newspapers in Tasmania told the farmers that they would get free-trade within the Commonwealth and protection against the world, and that they need not fear to enter the Federation, and that, I think, is what the farmers believed in. Since then candidates have gone before them to advocate protection or free-trade, as the case may be. But to say that they have been gulled by those candidates is, I think, wrong. As regards this item, it is a fair thing to extend to the farmers throughout the Commonwealth the measure of protection which the duty on onions has afforded to them since 1901. &#39; If we opened our markets to New Zealand, Japan, the Straits Settlements, and the United States, and allowed their producers to compete here on even terms with our own farmers, I do not think that there can be any doubt in the mind of any reasonable mail that our own growers would suffer prejudice and disadvantage. </para>

          <para>.- I find that fixing up a Tariff is a very wearying and irritating task.&#34; I am hear,tily sick of it. I have listened over and over again to arguments which I heard six years ago. When I found that certain items affecting the agriculturists were proposed to and passed by another place very much in the form in which they were settled in the Tariff of 1902, I thought that they would be adopted here without much debate, but I find that such is not the case; and that we are listening to identically the same arguments couched in exactly the same words as we listened to for nine months s:x years ago. I have just listened to two speeches about Tasmania from Senators Clemons and Mulcahy, and I believe that the latter has given us the. true version of the case. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> were here I would remind him that before we had Federal electors to deal with we each had to face State citizens and persuade them to accept the Constitution Bill. I do not know very much of what took place in the north of my State, but I. can state that in the south, without exception, every candidate and every newspaper, in order to induce, the farmers to accept the Constitution Bill and thereby fix up what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> called a compact, assured them that they would have protection against the outside world, although they would have to face free-trade within the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> ought to know that the people of Tasmania are particularly frightened about the farmers of New Zealandand very properly so. The man in New Zealand has better soil, he has more of it, and there are in that country a very large number of educated farmers from Great Britain. </para>

            <para>- The New Zealand farmer is, as a rule, better educated, is accustomed to high farming, and makes his land exceedingly productive. It is for these reasons that the farmers of Tasmania are particularly afraid of their New Zealand competitors. Given equal terms, the New Zealand farmer would be able, as to some items, to knock us out. That being the case, and we having debated month after month what these duties ought to be, by what principle of continuity of policyare we to strike out the duty in this instance? Why not give a moderate amount of protection to our farmers ? It is true that the duty could not operate in five years out of six. But it &#39;can operate in some years, and by retaining it we shall carry out the compact under which the farmers entered into federation. Every argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> applies equally well to potatoes, wheat, and barley. If we are going to knock out this duty, are we going to negative the duties on a score of other items to which the House of Representatives have agreed? Personally, I believe that when we have done with the Tariff it will be a worse Tariff than the old- one ; but at the same time the principle running through it is more protection. We have to bow to the majority in both Houses. According to my understanding of my duty, and of what my constituents expect of me, I must vote against the request. </para>

          <para>. - The Government sometimes stand very  strongly  bv the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and it would be well for them to indicate their attitude on this question. On both sides there appears to be an air of sensible compromise, and it might be well to throw out the suggestion to the Government that they should make it clear what they intend to do. If they are going to stand obstinately by some proposals thev may possibly give rise to a fight ! </para>

          <para>. - The reason for the increased duty on barley is that one section of the Tariff Commission  recommended  that the &#34;duty of is. 6d. under the first Federal Tariff should be raised to 2s. per cental. The printed document circulated amongst honorable senators shows that the other section of the Commission made no specific recommendation with regard to the item. A large quantity of barley is imported chiefly from the United States and England, and is used for malting. An excellent, bright barley is produced to a large extent in Tasmania, as well as in other parts of the Commonwealth, and it is thought that, an increased duty may induce our brewers&#39; to direct more attention than they have done to the local production. I hope that honorable senators will adopt the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. </para>

        <para>I should have preferred to move a request that maize generally be free for a reason &#39;that I have already given, and which I do not propose to repeat. I have not done so since the result of a number of divisions on such items as onions and potatoes, which are articles of food, leads me to believe that it would probably be unsuccessful. I put my request upon the broad ground that it will enable honorable senators who are  preferentialists  to vote for a preference near at hand, and one that is demanded by the interests of British settlers in the New Hebrides, which are of great concern to us, and in respect of which, in relation to the joint French occupation, a very great deal of discussion has taken place: There is no doubt that the mind of Australia has been very much exercised in regard to British interests in the New Hebrides. Unquestionably, our Tariff in relation to maize has had a serious effect  in retarding its production in those islands - to the extent, indeed, of seriously injuring British interests there. </para>

            <para>- What a. hollow sham is all this talk about the New Hebrides, if we are not willing to assist our own settlers there. Let us assist them in the direction in which they say that we can assist them effectually. It is a remarkable circumstance that a great proportion of the maize entering the Commonwealth from outside our own borders comes from the New Hebrides. It is imported, despite the duty which is operative, and which is a distinct disadvantage to the British residents in those islands. Unless we are prepared to assist them by admitting their product free, we ought for ever to hold our peace in regard to the set back which British interests have already sustained in the New Hebrides. I propose to read two or three sentences from the report of the High Commissioner in those islands, bearing upon this point, and there I shall leave the matter, because no observations of mine on Behalf of the British settlers in those islands, who are crying- out to us for assistance, can have greater force.

          <para>More distant islands seem little harmed by that Tariff, but it is precisely in the New Hebrides, in a sense the nearest to Australia, tli.it the effect of this Tariff is obvious to any one who visits the place, and, as shown by the Resident Commissioner, has been disastrous to the British settler, especially in comparison to the greater prosperity of the French settler under more liberal conditions offered by French New Caledonia. The Australian Tariff was framed in accordance with the protective policy of the Government, with no direct reference to any of the Pacific islands except that copra, one of the chief and most promising of these exports, was, and is, admitted to the  Commonwealth  free of duty. But comparatively little copra is as yet produced in the New Hebrides, greatly differing&#39; in this respect from the British Solomon Islands, and the freedom from Australian duty from this article is as yet little if any alleviation of the exceptionally bad position of the New Hebrides. I think I am right in saying that the principal products of the New Hebrides which have been affected by the Australian Tariff are maize and coffee. For the moment, the most important product of British settlers in the New Hebrides is maize, which has been adopted as a catch crop to tide over the time till  cocoanuts  can be planted, and come into bearing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> recognises that the Australian duty has had a retarding influence on the expansion of maize cultivation in the New Hebrides. </para>

          <para>But I note that the French authorities have found no difficulty in making such concessions to French settlers in the islands. At the risk of going beyond my business, I .would suggest that British grown produce from the New Hebrides might be admitted into Australia under special Tariff conditions, under a certificate of  origin  from the Resident Commissioner or other suitable official. </para>

        <para class="block">Of course we know the possibilities of. any preference extended to British settlers in the New Hebrides being taken advantage of by French settlers there. But the remedy for that sort of thing is that which was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> in relation to the difficulty of detecting deleterious substances, such as&#39; glucose, in confectionery. We must provide regulations to insure that the privilege is not extended to those to whom it is not intended to apply. Upon these grounds I submit my motion. </para>

          <para>. - It is interesting to hear from the VicePresident of the Executive Council the method in which a bounty ought to be applied and what its proper concomitant is. When we give a bounty for the production of articles in Australia we are immediately met with the almost universal cry that to it must be superadded a heavy protective duty. We have solemnly voted a bounty to British settlers in the New Hebrides, and also imposed against them a duty of is. 6d. per cental. We have not only nol enabled them to send their maize in free, but after giving them a grant of &#163;500 in order to induce them to grow it, we impose a. positive penalty of is. 6d. on every cental which they send into the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- If we vote &#163;500 as a bounty we shall have to say that we are doing it in order to promote British settlement in the New Hebrides, and to encourage those British settlers in the pur suit of agriculture. Then the very least we can do is to let &#39;their maize in free. Where else are they to find a market for it? Folly could not proceed further than to subsidize them to grow maize and then impose a duty on it if thev- send it here. I could understand the policy of the Government, although I should not approve of it, if they proposed to exclude from Australia all maize coming from the New Hebrides. That would be rational, but their present position is . incomprehensible; What are we asked to sacrifice? Assuming that we are asked to sacrifice something, the total quantity&#39; that came in last year from the New Hebrides was 8,000 centals. </para>

          <para>. - This is another of those items on which I find myself unable to agree with some of my honorable friends on this side. I yield to no one in mY desire to increase the trade connexion between Australia and the Islands of the Pacific. But we must ask what is a fair price to pay, and to what extent we are entitled&#39; to assist the British settlers in the New Hebrides. We are paying a bounty of is. 6d. on every bushel of maize grown by the British settlers in the New Hebrides and imported here. That means a bounty of 2s. 8d. a cental. If they send their maize here, we give them that bounty with the one hand, but we send a Customs officer to take is. 6d. from them with the other. That means that the net bounty which we give them is is. 2d. per cental of their maize landed here. Ordinarily speaking, that would be about 40 per cent, of the value of the article. If we subsidize maize grown in the New Hebrides - which the British settlers have the option of growing by coloured labour - to the extent of 40 per cent., then Australia has done as much in that particular as she can reasonably be asked to do. </para>

            <para>- Because the bonus is more than the Tariff. Let me divide the maize crop into two portions - that portion which would  be sufficient to .absorb the bonus, and that portion which may be in excess. Up to the present enough has hot been produced to absorb the bonus, and it is obvious that we have only that portion to deal with now. </para>

            <para>- Then I say that we have made provision of an amount which it was assumed would be sufficient to meet all claims, and if the claims involve a greater amount it will become the duty of Parliament to consider the propriety of making a larger sum available. At any rate, the settlers at present know that there is now waiting for them here a bonus of- 2s. 8d. per cental, but, in order not to disturb the Tariff, we collect is. 6d., so that there remains a bonus of is. 2d. percental. When we have done that we have done as much as Australia ought to be expected to do for the development of this industry in the New Hebrides. </para>

The bonus, no matter what the amount of it is, is given to encourage the production of maize by British settlers, and not with the intention of limiting the production. It surely is not hoped that the &#163;500 will cause production to absorb that amount and no more, but rather that production will be promoted to the fullest extent? </para>

            <para>- I am not parti- cularly concerned as to which came first. We are now revising the Tariff, and can make the duty what we like, and it seems the height of folly to give a bounty of &#163;500 to the growers in the New Hebrides, and then prevent them from taking advantage of it. </para>

          <para>. - I am given to understand that corn flour is essentially an Australian product, and one which we, in accordance with the general policy of the Tariff, ought to properly protect. The increase in the duty is due to the fact that the duty on starch flours - of which corn flour is either one or very like one - is proposed in item 104 at 2 1/2d per lb. in the general Tariff, and at 2d. in .the  preferential Tariff. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;11.22&#93;. - The Minister of Home Affairs is certainly mistaken in trying to establish any resemblance between corn flour, which is described in the statistics as maizena and corn flour, an article of food, and what is known as starch- flour. I think that he is also mistaken in- saying that corn flour is essentially an article of Australian production. I find that so far as imports are concerned, it is supplied mainly by the United Kingdom. If&#34; we are desirous of establishing some kind of trade favour towards the United Kingdom, the way to do it is by making that article free. I find that it supplies within a  comparatively small proportionate quantity the bulk of the maizena and corn flour imported into Australia. It supplies us with I&#62;557&#187;4&#176;3 lbs., and the next largest supply - under 300,000 lbs. - comes from  the United States of America. There are two grounds on which this article might be made free, namely, first that it is a food, and secondly to establish some kind of real preference in  favour of the United Kingdom. </para>

          <para>. - One feeis somewhat diffident at this hour in rising to discuss any item. But in view of the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cl:mons.</inline> that this is simply a revenue duty, I feel inclined to speak. Under the old duty of &#163;d. per lb. we imported 1,857,937 lbs. of corn flour, and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that it was a revenue duty. It is now proposed to increase the duty to 2d. per lb. </para>
