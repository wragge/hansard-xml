                        <para>- I am informed that since the beginning of the current financial year, the rule has been laid down that grants to immigration leagues must be subject to the condition that vouchers showing the manner in which the money has been expended shall be submitted for the information of the Department. That condition was applied to the only grant made so far this year, and will be applied to any others that may be made. In regard to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> I can find no trace of an application from the Queensland league. </para>

                    <para>Thomas Smith, sanitary inspector, said he visited the premises, which were formerly known as Latham&#39;s brewery, in Abinger-street, on 21st ult. On the second floor of the main building there was an accumulation of rotten potatoes. From 15 to 20 tons of potatoes were &#34; floating about.&#34; They were all in a state of pulp, and &#34; you could smell them in the street.&#34; In the stable he found about 20 or 30 bags of potatoes in a worse state than the others. Those at the bottom were in a slate of pulp, and a stream of liquid was floating from them. Round about the bags were crawling alive with maggots. </para>
                    <para>To <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> : I understand that the potatoes were purchased for the extraction of starch, which was to be made into glucose. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the report referred to; but since the postponement of the consideration of the duty on glucose, I have learnt from the highest authorities that the glucose used in confectionery is innocuous and nutritious, and that the use of a certain quantity in the manufacture of confectionery is permitted in Victoria, the standardization insisted on being tested by the strictest chemical analyses. When the item is again before the Senate, I hope to have further information. There is both good and bad glucose. </para>

                    <para>. - I remind the Minister that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that the duty on curtains and blinds should be fixed at 10 per cent., and I desire to know why the Government have submitted a duty of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. It seems to me to be altogether wrong to levy a tax of 25 per cent. on a mixture of cotton, and, therefore, I move - </para>

                    <para>.- This is absolutely a revenue duty. The articles covered by this item are used chiefly by working people, who, of course, cannot afford to buy expensive hangings and blinds. They are obliged to use cheap blinds, such as bordered blinds, which are not made in this country. This is only a revenue duty, and has no protective incidence. The item ought not to be subject to a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. -This is not a revenue duty. It is a protective duty. It is quite true that the raw material is imported, but the articles are made up here. In fact, there is a large number of blind manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Even if the articles were not made up here, it is about time that they were. The original Tariff imposed a duty of 15 per cent. on some of the smaller lines, and duties of 25 and 26 per cent. on the other lines. It is now proposed that the duty shall be 25 per cent. in the general Tariff and 20 per cent. in the preferential Tariff. In 1903 the importations of these articles were valued in round figures at , &#163;74,000; in 1904, at &#163;92,000; in 1905, at &#163;81,000; and in 1906, at &#163;87,000. From the United Kingdom we imported last year &#163;73,000 worth, and from other countries &#163;14,800. This is essentially a protective duty, and I invite the Committee to deal with it from that stand-point. </para>

I ask him to remember that his Government has deliberately taken one line out of this item and put it into another item. The only line which really requires protection is the manufacture of blinds attached to rollers. They appear under the head of furnishing drapery ; they were taken out of this item for protective reasons, and the other articles retained therein. It is as correct to say these blinds are made here as it is to say that a pair of sheets is made here. </para>

                        <para>- Sheets are not made here, nor are these curtains and blinds. We all know very well what the making of a pair of sheets amounts to. It means the taking home of five or six yards of material, cutting it into two pieces, and using a sewing machine. Almost in the twinkling of an eye the work&#39; is done, but it is really grotesque for any one to say that that is making a pair of sheets. Yet the Minister will stand up here, time after time, and assure the Committee, on a similar :pretext, that we are making an article in this country. This item covers articles  of furnishing drapery, which, with very few exceptions, cannot be made here. It is&#39; possible, I know, for a woman to sit down to the laborious task of knitting a pair of curtains. It will take her about a month to do the work, and if she wants to sell them, she will not get as much as would pay her for two days&#39; labour. Lace curtains come out in an absolutely finished state from Nottingham, The raw material for the stuff curtains is imported, but what work is there in making them ? It is simply the work of cutting the raw material into lengths and hemming the edges. It is ludicrous on the part of the Minister to try to impress the Committee with the idea that we are dealing with an item which is giving industrial employment. </para>

                    <para>. - I remind the Committee that oh curtains and blinds the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of only 10 per cent. I think that there is some obligation upon the Ministry to show why. they have proposed a higher duty. If the Minister is not in a position to give us a reason for the increase, perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> can say if there is any justification for departing- from&#39; the recommendation which he joined in making, and which I have no doubt he will support now. It may be said that in the case of this item the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of <inline font-style="italic">15</inline> per cent., but let me point out that that was made part of a general classification, and, therefore, does not apply to the two items of curtains and blinds, to which the recommendation of the other section did apply. In view of that specific recommendation I submit that even protectionist  senators may reasonably hesitate before they vote to put up the duty to 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That is just what I intended to say. It is well known that ordinarily carpets are bought in strips, and a certain amount of sewing is required to complete the article covered by the ordinary use of the word. In regard to curtains the procedure is almost precisely identical, as the piece goods are cut into lengths, and then sewn. If we are agreed that the duty on carpets is a revenue duty, we must admit that the duty on curtains is also a revenue duty.  I wonder that honorable senators can consider themselves justified in imposing these high revenue duties. Honorable senators of the Labour Party protest that they will support no revenue duties, but, unfortunately, with one or two exceptions, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> where they are asked to deal with what is purely a revenue duty, in nine times out of ten. some excuse is hunted for to justify them in supporting heavy taxation upon the people by alleging that the duty will have a protective effect. There is no more protection involved in this duty than there was in the duty on carpets, and the amount of protection given by that duty was represented by some vague, shadowy possibility of the. manufacture of carpets in. Australia at some time which no one could define. &#39; </para>

                    <para>. - If I attempt to reduce these duties I shall be told that they represent the taxation of luxuries, although I do not for a moment believe that to tax luxuries is the whole intent of the proposal. These fur duties are graduated, and the object is to afford protection for the sewing together of imported furs. This is imposing a heavy revenue duty on a particular class. I have no particular sympathy with the people who use furs, but this is distinctly a class duty, and I think 35 per cent. is too high. I see no chance of putting the goods on the free list, and, therefore, I shall vote for the same duty as was imposed under the old Tariff. I move - </para>

But in view of the heavy duties which this Committee has insisted on placing on articles used by the whole community, I really cannot in this instance support
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    in his proposal to reduce the duty upon an article that certainly is much more an article of luxury than of necessity - at least in our Australian climate. I really cannot see my way to reduce a duty in favour of the rich and the well-to-do, in view of the duties imposed upon the clothing of the enormous mass of the people - in fact, upon everybody in the country.

We have already imposed taxes upon the poorer classes. The only question now is whether we shall help them in any way by imposing a tax upon another section. If the alternative were between saying whether a tax should be imposed upon the poor or not, I should not hesitate as to my answer. But the question now is whether the masses of the people will be relieved of the burden which has been placed upon them if we vote to put a duty upon another section of the community. </para>

Now I contend that these are purely protectionist duties, but, assuming that they are revenue duties, it certainly is a fact that a certain  amount of revenue is required, and it is also a fact that if you tax one person to the amount that you require, you do not need to tax the other. But what I have risen to submit in this connexion is that in Australia we produce a considerable quantity of very fine furs - not the best in the world, but still furs of an excellent character. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very fine fur, and one of the best for certain purposes. It is not by any means the only fur we have. In addition to that, we have dotted over Australia establishments where  furrying  is carried on for the treatment of Australian and imported furs. This duty would have the double effect of reasonably taxing the people who can afford to use what are very costly, and, to a large extent, useless luxuries, and also protecting the  furrying  trade. Therefore, I hope that in this connexion the protectionist senators, at any rate, will not be led away by the continually reiterated declaration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in regard to revenue duties. We have hardly passed a duty yet as to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has not declared that it was a revenue item. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> hasadopted the attitude which he has explained. I think he has attached far too much importance to sentiment. The use of his own sound judgment on these duties would, I believe, convince him that he <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> making a mistake. This is, first of all, an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. The consequence is that if an imported article is of great value, the amount of duty on it will be high. Further, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is, I think, taking up&#39; very dangerous ground in adopting the principle of class  taxation, as he is doing now. To say that people who use furs represent a particular class, and ought to pay, is, I think, an unsound argument. </para>

                        <para>- In Australia, I should allow an exemption of somewhere between &#163;120 and &#163;160 a year, and no more. Let me point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> what his position is. We have to remember that this is an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, so that if the articles to which it applies are expensive, a heavy duty is collected. Clearly, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> own showing, furs are used by only a limited class, so that the duty will be confined to them. Why should they be singled out in that way ? There is no element of justice in it. Any honorable senator who suggested a reduction of the duty on furs would be met at once with the cry - &#34; Oh, he wants to free luxuries - to let the rich off lightly.&#34; We should recognise, however, that such an argument is hollow, and, very often, unfair. If these goods are costly, 25 per cent. is a very high rate of duty. </para>

I consider that it is a trap. Are we to say, &#34; We could not free of taxation such and such a Section, why should we let off this section ? &#39; &#39; That is a very dangerous argument. It is tempting, and has tempted me more than once. I have felt so annoyed when certain duties have been passed, that I have been inclined to say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> probably feels disposed to do, &#34;All these people have been taxed, although they ought not to have been, and I shall not be a party to letting any one else gofree.&#34; I repeat that it is a. very dangerous argument, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will recognise that even if this item relates to a luxury used by only a limited class, 25 per cent. is a very high rate of duty to pay on anything which does not actually represent a vice. </para>

He will pardon me for saying that such an attitude on his part is not likely to expedite business.

                    <para>. - I was under the impression that most of the furs imported into the Commonwealth came, not from Great Britain, but from Russia and other countries, but I find, upon reference to our statistical records, that it is not so. Out of a total of &#163;15,000 worth of furs imported last year, I learn that &#163;10,000 worth were of British origin. </para>

                        <para>- The real question is : How far does the honorable senator want a revenue duty on them? There is not a single glove factory in Australia, although I dare say a few people have made a few pairs. The whole item, whether it relates to men&#39;s or women&#39;s gloves, gardeners&#39; gloves, or driving gloves, is purely a revenue duty. That being so, there is not the faintest reason for discriminating between different kinds. I propose to move that the whole item be free. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister in this case proposes protective duties of 30 and 20 per cent.; but so few gloves are made in Australia that there is practically no industry to protect. Saddlers occasionally make thick leather gloves; but I doubt if &#163;100 worth of gloves is annually made in the Commonwealth. If effect is given to this proposal, great confusion will result, because every case of gloves that is imported will have to be opened and examined throughout by the Customs officials. Certain sizes in gloves are common to both men&#39;s and women&#39;s wear. Women&#39;s sizes begin at 6 and go up to 8, but sizes 7&#188;, 7&#189;, 7¾,and 8 are worn by both men and women. The proposed differentiation will not produce &#163;5 in duty, but it will create &#163;50 worth of additional work for the departmental officers, and cause great annoyance to honest importers, since almost every case will have to be. opened to prevent fraud. I intend to propose that the duties shall be the same whether the gloves are intended for men&#39;s or for women&#39;s wear. If the Committee favours that proposal, it will not agree to the insertion of the words which the Minister wishes to insert. </para>

                    <para>. - It is generally admitted that gloves of fine quality are not made in the Commonwealth ; but I am credibly informed that there are two factories in Melbourne, one employing something like fifty hands, in which the coarser kinds of gloves are made. That is a very fair beginning for the industry, and, seeing that this is to be a protective Tariff, justifies the giving  of a fair measure of protection to those concerned. Glove-making is an occupation from which are absent many of the objectionable features associated with some kinds of women&#39;s work, and if the industry is established in the Commonwealth, we shall not go far wrong in protecting it. If gloves are to be taxed as a luxury, the tax should fall on men&#39;s - not on women&#39;s gloves. </para>

Nothing could be more absurd, and no doubt Gilbert and Sullivan, if they were still collaborating, would turn the incident to good use in a comic opera. Why not go a little further, and have a sliding scale, making the duty higher as the size got bigger? Would a similar proposal, in regard to boots or anything else, have been tolerated? The whole thing is too absurd for serious consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Who can say? The Vice-President of the Executive Council has apparently acted upon some sudden and idle suggestion, but I hope that he will leave the matter alone. The only way to remove any possibility of doubt is to have one duty on every kind of glove. I venture to say that, in view of imports represented by &#163;232,679, gloves representing the odd &#163;679 were not made in the whole of the Commonwealth in 1907. Are we to impose a duty on a remote possibility of its affording some protection ? I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> should withdraw his request in order that the Tariff may be simplified, especially in view of the fact pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> that not a single glove factory is registered in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing in the report of the Inspector of Factories to show that these gloves are manufactured in Australia. Another objection I have is the absence of any definition of &#34; driving &#34; gloves. I have seen glove&#39;s made; and, so far as I can gather, they involve very little manual labour. A large quantity of kid is placed on a table, and cut into hundreds of pairs at a time by means of a knife worked by machinery. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask honorable senators to be good enough, even at this late stage, to remedy what was an obvious, mistake in the last division. What we did was to pick out those goods which it was acknowledged could be made here. It was pointed out, and it. must be well known to honorable senators, that driving gloves and housemaids&#39; gloves are made locally. </para>

We have made imports of these goods duty free under the general Tariff, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, still pursuing the course of the Government in endeavouring to afford magnificent assistance to the United Kingdom, and still urging upon the Committee the desirability of British preference, is now prepared that these goods imported from Great Britain shall bear a duty 01&#39; 20 per cent., but if imported from Germany, France, or America shall be duty free. </para>

I suppose that . what the honorable senator has in mind is a recommittal of the schedule, when he hopes to be able to alter what the Committee has done, and secure the imposition of a duty of 30 or 35 per cent, under the general &#34;Tariff. </para>

                (New South Wales) &#91;2.21&#93;. - When the last Tariff was under discussion, some five years ago, there were some pretty strong fights over the duties on hats, and we finally decided upon duties of 30 per cent. and 20 per cent. In the present instance, we are being asked to agree to a duty of 16s. per dozen, irrespective of. value. That seems to be a most undesirable form of taxation, in view of the fact that every other item in this division of the schedule is made dutiable at an
                <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                rate. I am unable to understand why the
                <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                principle should not be applied to the duties on hats. There is as great a divergence in the value of hats as in the value of any other line of goods in this division in respect to which we have agreed to impose
                <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                duties. Hats included under this item will run from 2s. 6d. apiece to almost any price. The idea of charging an all-round duty of 1s. 4d. each on hats, some of which will be worth 2s. 6d., and others worth over &#163;1, is so utterly preposterous that I intend 10 suggest a return to an
                <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                duty, and I move -

            </quote>
            <para class="block">Under the old Tariff, the duties imposed were 30 and 20 per cent. ; the duty recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission was 30 per cent. ; and that by the  B  section, 15 per cent. Taking into consideration the two rates under the old Tariff and the two rates recommended by the free-trade and protectionist sections of the Tariff . Commission, I submit that in suggesting a duty of 30 per cent. - an increase of 10 per cent. on the old rate in respect of a large proportion of the imports - I am submitting a very moderate rearrangement of the duties proposed in the schedule. It must be clear that in the case of some hats a duty of 16s. per dozen would not amount to anything like 36 per cent. It will be crushing on the poor man and will amount to scarcely anything on the high class of hats. I therefore suggest a moderate rate, a fair compromise between the two rates under the old Tariff and the two recommendations of the Tariff Commission. I am advocating a materially higher duty than the old one, and one with which the Government ought to be satisfied. </para>

                    <para>. - I had intended to move for a request wilh the object of securing a vote on the question whether we shall have <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties or fixed &#39;rates on hats. For that purpose I thought that I might move the omission of the word &#34; and &#34; with a view of subsequently moving the omission of all the words after &#34; and.&#34; At present the duty stands at 16s. per dozen. The duty before an alteration was made in another place was 35 per cent. I am quite willing to allow that duty to stand, because it would operate equally on all sorts of hats, but I am opposed to the fixed rate of 16s. per dozen.* I have before me some particulars showing the cost of importing hats. The cost price in London of one consignment of hats was &#163;.111 3s. Transport and landing charges amounted to &#163;25 7s. od. The actual duty paid was &#163;105 12s. at 16s. per dozen. Those particulars relate to the cheap class of wool hats landed in Melbourne. The gross percentage comes to 120 per cent.  The natural protection is about 22J per cent, on hats such as are worn by large &#39; numbers of people, and. which are sold retail from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. The duty upon the cheaper class of hat is actually much higher than on the superior class. That is an anomaly which the Committee should be eager to remedy. Figures before me show that the duty on a 10s. hat at the fixed rate amounts to about 100 per cent., and to only 43 per cent, on a 15s. hat. We ought to have an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate so that the higher the quality of the hat the more duty it will pay  Another consideration we have to bear in mind is that machinery imported for the hat industry comes in duty free. If it is not protection run mad to charge from 100 to 120 per cent, on the cheaper class of hats and to allow the local industry to import its machinery duty free I do not know what is. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be enough on an article on which the natural protection is from 30 to 35 per cent. But I am prepared to concede that there are special circumstances connected with this industry that justify a higher rate for the purpose of capturing the trade. I certainly shall not, however, vote for a fixed duty. I do not believe in the principle of it. I cannot accede to a principle which applies a duty of 100 per cent, or over to a 4s. hat, whilst it applies a duty of 43 per cent, to a\ 9s. or 10s. hat, and a duty of 25 per cent. to. a 15s. hat. We are now asked to vote for a duty of 16s. per dozen on every hat that is imported, no matter what the quality or value of it may be. It may be the commonest hat made or it may be one of the very best. As we all know, hats are made in Italy which are invoiced at 10s. a dozen. I am prepared to give the local producers protection against such competition. I should not like to see our workers brought within coo-ee of it. Speaking for myself I should be quite prepared to vote for an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 40 per cent. What would the effect of such a duty be? It would mean that, taking shipping charges and freight into consideration, the importer would have to pay from 70 to 90 per cent, on the original cost of the article. If that is not sufficient protection for any Australian industry) I say that that industry is a failure, and I speak as a protectionist when I say so. Experts have told  me that if there were no increase of duty whatever the Australian manufacturer would speedily make a cheaper kind of hat&#39; more suitable for the trade. </para>

                        <para>- No, it would mean the local manufacture of a lower grade article for a lower price - giving equal value. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has referred to the cost of importing hats under present conditions. I have inspected an invoice for &#163;113 worth of hats, such as are worn by those whom we are all desirous of protecting, namely, working men. These hats would be retailed at from 3s. 6d. to 4s. each in Melbourne. As a matter of fact they are being retailed at that price to-day. But that &#163;113 worth of hats was called upon to pay duty to the amount of &#163;105. </para>

Before these fixed duties came into force they could have been imported at a very much lower rate. I am speaking now of hats worn by artisans and labourers and retailed at about 4s. each. What about the hat worn bv the middle-class man - the man who can afford to dress respectably? </para>

Hats sold at that price can be and have been made here, but, as a matter of fact, men who can afford to pay such a price are offered a premium lo purchase imported hats, since they are dutiable at only 40 per cent., compared with a duty of 100 per cent, in the case of the inferior articles. Then, again, those who can afford to wear a still better class of hats - Woodrow&#39;s hats retailed at 15s. each - have to pay a duty of only 25 per cent. In other words, we have a duty of 25 per cent, in respect of hats worn by the rich man, a duty df 45 per cent, in regard to hats worn by the man who can afford to pay, and a duty of 100 per cent, on those worn by men who cannot afford to pay a big price for them. This is done in the interests of a petted industry, representatives of which have been able to gain access, not to the Minister of Customs, but to the man who really occupies that office - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne - and to persuade him that we should deal with this item on a plane different from that of others. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee is entitled to receive from the Vice-President of the Executive Council an explanation of the reason why he proposes a duty per unit regardless of value in respect of the output of one particular industry, whilst a fixed duty is not imposed upon other manufactures. If a fixed duty ought to be imposed on hats, why should we not have a fixed duty per yard on flannel, per lb. on blankets and other goods? What is the reason for this discrimination? Labour in the production of cheap tweeds, dress materials, and woollens in Europe bears the same relationship to the total  cost as does the labour in the manufacture of hats there. Why does not the Minister propose a fixed duty per lb. upon tweeds? Why did he not take the unit as a basis in that case? </para>

                        <para>- It would have been in the opinion of an extreme protectionist like my honorable friend. Such a system of taxation, however, is not protection, but prohibition, and prohibition of the most unfair sort. It does not prohibit the importation of goods worn by the man who can afford to pay, but it imposes a serious embargo upon the importation of hats worn by the poorer class of the community, or upon anything else to which it is applied. The hat industry has come into prominence in many ways since the famous &#34; Six hatters &#34; episode, but if there is one fact more than another in relation to it which has been fully established, it is that good wages are paid in it. I happen to know that the standard of wages paid by the Denton Hat Mills Company is practically higher than that paid in any branch of the textile industry. </para>

                        <para>- The wages rank above those paid in kindred occupations in Melbourne. If that be so, in the case of the industry in Melbourne, I am sure that the position is the same in Sydney. I pay that tribute to the hat manufacturers of thee States. That fact, however, does not, to ray mind, justify us in imposing protective duties, as we are doing in this case, at the wrong end. If any honorable senator will satisfy me that a duty of  40  per cent. upon an article, plus a natural protection of about  25  per cent. in respect of the cost of importing, making a total of  65  per cent. in favour of the local manufacturer, is not adequate protection, I shall say at once that I know nothing whatever about the question. </para>

                    <para>. - My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> has delivered a sensational sort of speech essentially in the interests of the poorer classes of the community. The design and object of this Tariff is to protect that class. We have, first of all, to bear in mind that the hat industry with which we are now dealing is one of the best and healthiest that we have ; that its chief raw materials - wool and rabbit furs - are obtained on the spot, and that what is sought to be done by the Tariff is to recognise conditions as we find them. The honorable senator himself furnished the very reason why there should be a fixed duty, as we propose. He has told us that hats invoiced down as low as 10s. per dozen are being imported from Italy, and he expects the industry here to pay good wages - he admits that it pays the best of wages- to flourish and prosper while exposed to the competition of the products of sweated labour from abroad the rubbishy hats imported into Australia at an invoiced price of  10s.  per dozen. </para>

                        <para>- Those who are dealing with this matter every day, and having goods of this class coming under their notice, cannot but realize that a great injustice is being done to our own people by the rubbish, from Italy and other places, which is dumped from time to time into Australia. The very object of the fixed duty is that practically all these lower priced hats - all the rubbishy hats to which my honorable friend has referred, and which come into competition with our own productions - shall be subject to almost prohibitive imposts. It may be perfectly true that, in respect of hats invoiced at  10s.  or  12s.  per dozen, duties ranging as high as  100  or110 per cent. are imposed. Such duties are imposed because, in the first place, we do not want that class of goods, and, secondly, because those who wear the poorer class of hats can be, and are, better served by our own manufacturers. We impose a fixed duty of 16s. per dozen to prevent the importation of these lower-class hats, and to give our own productions a reasonable chance. I appeal to honorable senators to say how it is possible for our manufacturers to compete, in the absence of a fixed and almost prohibitive duty, with the class of hats to which reference has been made. Every importation of the kind comes into unfair competition, and tends to drag down the wages of our own people. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not altogether appreciate these facts. The value of the importations from abroad during the last few years have been as follows: - 1903, &#163;315,900;  19047  &#163;342,700; 1905, &#163;349-300; and 1906; &#163;369,56* . These figures bear eloquent testimony to the fact that a duty of 30 per cent, is ineffective. Importations have been gradually increasing. I hope that I have made it clear that we require a fixed duty. I am more or less in sympathy with the contention raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> as to the duties on the better class of hats. I admit that the Tariff, -as it stands, imposes upon the lower class of hats, which the poorer class of the community here  really do not require, a high duty, which gradually becomes less as it is applied to the more expensive varieties, and I may relieve the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Mulcahy,</inline> who is prepared to support a&#39; duty of 40 per cent., by telling him that I have already been consulted as to a request that a duty of 16s. per dozen or of 35 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> whichever is the higher rate, shall be imposed on the more expensive classes. I gladly give my assent to that proposition. </para>

It pays splendid wages, and I can assure my honorable friend that it produces excellent hats for that particular section of the community about which he is so concerned - the humbler classes. </para>

                        <para>- Mv honorable friend has suggested a hypothetical case, in which  the consumer will be called upon to pay 100 per cent. by way of duty. But, as a matter of fact, if we impose a fixed duty of 1 6s. per dozen upon hats, we shall not be troubled with those huge importations of rubbish which have hitherto come into competition with our own productions. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has endeavoured to make it appear that the proposed substitution of an alternative form of taxation will meet the objection which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> It will do nothing of the kind. Under certain circumstances it will mean more revenue to the Customs, but the gross anomaly to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> directed attention will still exist. What are we asked to do by the Vice-President of the Executive Council ? We are asked to impose upon hats an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 35 per cent., or a fixed duty of 1 6s. per dozen, whichever returns the larger revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> &#39;s objection was that a fixed duty of 16s. per dozen would be a crushing impost upon the lower class of hats which are used by the poorer sections of the community, while it would be relatively a lighter charge upon the higher priced hats which are used by the wealthy classes. Let me put a concrete instance : Under this proposal hats valued at 16s. per dozen will be called upon to pay 16s. duty, because under a 35 per cent. rate they would contribute only 5s. 6d. The Vice-President of the Executive Council does not propose to lessen the taxation upon the cheaper class of hats. He intends that they shall still pay 16s. per dozen. </para>

                        <para>- Then why does not the party to which the honorable member belongs deal with the combines already in existence? I wish to show honorable senators at what stage in the rising value of hats the proposal of the Government will begin to take effect. Upon hats valued at 1 6s. per dozen, an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 35 percent. would amount to 5s. 6d. The Government propose that these goods shall be dutiable at 16s. Upon hats worth 32s. per dozen the duty would still be 1 6s., because the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate would only be equivalent to11s., and the higher duty would be collected. Upon hats valued at 48s. per dozen an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 35 per cent. would be 16s. 6d. It is only when we reach that stage that the alternative proposal of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty will begin to operate. All hats the import value of which is below 48s. per dozen will be required to pay a duty of 16s. per dozen. Thus the great majority of the hats used by the poorer classes of the community will be called upon to contribute the higher rate, namely, 16s.a dozen. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, I admit, has been fairly consistent - perhaps as consistent as one can be in dealing with a Tariff like this. The proposal of the Vice-President of the Executive Council will in no sense lessen the heavy duty which will be imposed on the lower class of hats imported, although it may have the effect of causing a larger revenue to be collected upon the higher class. The honorable senator has&#39; affirmed that the hat industry is one of the healthiest in the Commonwealth, and that it is paying the highest wages. I believe that the statement is correct, and I am glad to hear it. But that statement does not justify the  present demand for higher duties. If the industry had been in an unhealthy condition, the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have had better grounds upon which to rest his case. But he has told us that under the operation of previous duties of 30 per cent. and 20 per cent, the industry had become healthy, and was in a position to pay the best wages. If that be so, why are higher duties required? Surely we are entitled to some reason in this connexion before we levy an additional impost. The very&#39; statement of the Minister absolutely destroys any claim which might otherwise have been made for an increased measure of protection. Assuming that the industry is a healthy one, let me remind him that not a single representative of the largest hat establishments in Sydney and Melbourne took the trouble to appear before the Tariff Commission. Why? Have the Victorian manufacturers shown themselves shy about asking for more protection? Have they ever hesitated to make it appear, either by petition or by deputation, or by means of lobbying, that they were entitled to further consideration? Nevertheless the fact remains that in the two largest States of the Commonwealth the representatives of the biggest factories religiously abstained from presenting themselves for examination. Why ? There is only one explanation possible, and it is that if subjected to cross-examination they feared that they might disclose the fact that their industry already was too highly protected. As they have declined to give information which would have been of value, I propose to present a little to the Committee. From the figures which are available in respect of three of the States, I find that there has been. a steady advance in the industry from -the stand-point of the number of hands employed, the wages paid, and the plant in use.- In Victoria the number of hands increased between 1899 and 1905 from 896 to 1047. In 1899, Victoria sent only &#163;5,900 worth of hats into the other States, whereas last year  she sent &#163;46,000 worth. It is a pleasing and startling fact that Victoria managed, in five years, to multiply her exports of hats to other States by from eight to nine times. Could an industry want more? I find in New South Wales evidence of the same gratifying progress. That State had, in 1899, -five factories, with plant worth &#163;4,000, and employing 184 hands. In 1905 the number of factories had jumped to twenty-seven, and of hands to 918. I have not the figures showing the value of the plant for that year, but I have them for 1904, when it was &#163;26.000, so that the plant had multiplied nearly seven times in five years. </para>

                        <para>- You are paying too highly for a thing when you could buy it for a lower price. As it is quite clear that that splendid advance has been obtained with duties of from 20 to 30 per cent., there is no justification for, or commonsense iri, raising the duty to 100&#39; per cent., as the Government now propose. </para>

                        <para>- I have evidence from an authority which no one in this Chamber will venture to dispute. I shall give it presently. In 1899 Queensland had three factories, with plant worth&#163;5,290, and twenty-seven hands employed. In 1904 she had six factories, with plant worth &#163;12,621, and 128 hands employed. Putting the figures for the three States together, I find that the hands increased from 1,100 to 2,093, or practically doubled in five years. No wonder the Minister says that this is one of the healthiest industries, paying the best wages. Seeing that in every way we view the. industry there is evidence of satisfactory substantial and sound progress, what justification is there for still further increasing the duty? </para>

                        <para>- The increase of imports was ridiculously small compared with the increase in the output of the factories. That increase of importation will always take place when a country enters upon a period of prosperity, bringing &#34; a sudden increase of purchasing power, and of the demand for these commodities. It is not possible for the mills to extend their operations suddenly, and supply that demand. It takes time to do it. But there is evidence from those figures that the mills are steadily enlarging their plant, adding to the number of hands employed, and overtaking the local market. Grouping together the different kinds of hats shown in the official statistics under the names of felt, sewn, dress, and n.e.i., the imports in 1903 were, in round figures, &#163;314,000 worth, and in 1905 &#163;363,000 worth - an increase of &#163;49,000, or 15&#189; per cent. What, on the other hand, was the increase in the output of the local factories? There is only one way in which I have been able to ascertain that. I have been able to discover no information showing that output, but there is a very simple way of judging what the operations of the factories were. It may be safely assumed that, having doubled their hands, they have doubled their output. With superior plant and double the hands working it, if the industry is to be carried on profitably, it must turn out at least double what it did previously. Therefore, on that simple showing, there was an increase of100 per cent. in the local manufactures, as against the 15&#189; per cent. increase in the importations. There is another way of checking the expansion of the local trade. Statistics show that the value of the large number of minor articles imported for use in the hatmaking industry increased from &#163;55,000 in 1903 to &#163;100,000 in 1905 - an increase of &#163;45,000, or, approximately, 80 per cent. The factories would not have gone on year after year steadily swelling their imports and purchases of those minor articles until the increase reached 80 per cent., unless they were also turning out a larger quantity of completed goods. Those facts are substantial proof that the industry has advanced very much more rapidly than, and out of all proportion to the increase in, the imports. Honorable senators may say that there are still imports, but, no matter what duty is imposed, local manufacturers cannot overtake the imports in a day or a month, or even a year. It takes some time to develop a local industry. All that protectionists can ask is that the measure of protection given shall be sufficient to enable the local factories, by steady - or, if they like, by rapid - strides, to overtake the requirements of the people. The history of the last five years shows that the measure of protection given has been ample for that, and that the local factories are rapidly beating the importer clean out of the market. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asked me if I could give the prices of hats for the two periods I quoted. </para>

It was the importation that was keeping his price down. Had the duty been higher, the price of the imported: article would necessarily have been higher, and, on his own showing, that witness would then have increased the price of his own commodity up to just below that at which the imported article could be landed. </para>

                        <para>- It is the consumer I am thinking of, but of whom the honorable senator never thinks. I said previously that I would give the price of some hats and the rate of duty, worked out on them, according to an authority which I did not think any honorable senator would venture to question. When the Tariff was before us six years ago the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood published in the newspapers a list of the various grades of stock hats which formed the great bulk of the imports, giving their prices and showing the rates at which the duty worked out. It may be said that prices have altered since that day, but that does not materially affect the percentage represented by the duty proposed to be&#39; charged. Even if the price has risen a shilling or two per dozen, the percentage of duty may be slightly different, but the argument will not be marterially affected. Applying the proposal in this schedule - and it will be much worse if the proposal now fathered by the Government is agreed to - to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sa&#39;rgood&#39;s figures, I get the following results : - Men&#39;s wool felt hats, invoice value, 8s. 6d. per dozen; duty proposed, 16s. per dozen, representing 188 per cent, (general Tariff) and 12s. per dozen, representing 141 per cent. (United Kingdom). I shall not give all the- grades of value set out by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, but will take them by easy- stages, thus: hats, 12s. -per dozen, duty 16s. per dozen represents 133 J per cent. ; hats, at 18s. a dozen, duty represents 88&#167; per cent.; hats, at 21s. a dozen, 76 per cent.; 24s. a dozen, 66 per cent.; and -31s. a dozen, 51J per cent. If I turn to boys&#39; wool felt hats, I get something even more startling. These figures are not mine ; they were compiled by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, from invoices in his own warehouse. </para>

On boys&#39; hats valued at 9s. per dozen, the rate is equivalent to 178 per cent., and on boys&#39; hats valued at 18s. per dozen, to 88| per cent. I could give similar information in regard to other makes of hats, but I do not wish to unduly detain the Committee. The figures a.ll point the moral that fixed duties fall- with crushing weight on those whose poverty forces them to buy cheap articles, whilst those who can afford to buy dear articles contribute very little to the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Ministers would not have the courage to state plainly in the schedule the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> equivalents of the fixed rate. My contention is that, by the adoption of fixed rates, the poorer sections of the community are heavily taxed, while those who can afford to buy an expensive article get off lightly. With <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, the more money a man has to spend, the more he contributes to the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- And I am not advocating the importation of any kind of hats; and the question of the honorable senator has nothing to do with my argument. All I say is that the duties represent a monstrous impost, which enables the local manufacturer to keep prices up as high as he chooses. Although we were told by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in introducing the Tariff, that all he desired was sufficient protection to equalize conditions, with, perhaps, a little over in favour of Australia. What I desire is sufficient protection to give the manufacturer the market, accompanied, however, by a warning that if he raises his prices too high, and thus seeks to fleece the public, the importer will step in. </para>

                        <para>-That is the very industry in connexion with which the Prime Minister admitted there was a combine. If there be no such thing as a trust or arrangement in connexion with the confectionery industry, why the veiled remark of the Minister the other day that it was not advisable in the public interest for the Government to disclose what they were doing in the matter? I accepted that statement, and have since refrained from putting any questions in regard to the matter; because, if the statement meant anything, it meant that the Government were getting information, but that it was not advisable for the people outside to know what the officials were doing. What is the good of the Vice-President of the Executive Council asking us to put forward a proposition when he tells us beforehand that he will not consider it? Personally, I would much rather see an increase in the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty than the fixed duty as now proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned at present with what the Minister has said ; I am simply trying to give the Committee the benefit of my investigations. Even admitting for a moment that the Minister&#39;s statement is correct, I contend that the industry ought to be in a more healthy condition ; and by my vote I intend to make its health more vigorous. Another point that appeals to me is the difference between the wages paid to the employes in Europe, and those paid to the employes in Australia - a point I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> religiously avoided. The wages paid in Italy vary from 15s. to 25s. per week of sixty or seventy hours, as compared with &#163;3 7s. 6d. for a week of forty-eight hours in Australia. In view of these figures the vast difference in the cost of manufacture will be at once realized. I have in my hand a document from which I gather that in England, the country to which we propose to give preference, the conditions, so far as wages and hours of labour are concerned, are very little better than those obtaining in Italy, and a few figures will make the matter clear. The cost of producing a dozen hard felt hats here, without yielding any profit to the manufacturer, is &#163;2 18s., whilst in England they can be got f.o.b., including the manufacturer&#39;s profit, at &#163;1 14s. The cost of producing a dozen soft felt hats here, without giving any profit to the manufacturer, is &#163;3, while in England they can be got f.o.b., including the manufacturer&#39;s profit, at &#163;2. The facts all go to prove that the conditions under which the local industry has to struggle are such that it cannot compete successfully with the importations unless it gets effective protection. I did not consider that the old duty was effectively protective, nor do I think that the proposed duty will be. In 1906, under duties of 30 and 20 per cent., we imported these articles to the value of &#163;369,561, which yielded a revenue of &#163;19,021. In the course of his very interesting address, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that no manufacturers had ever complained of the duty, and that not one of them had gone before the Tariff Commission. </para>
