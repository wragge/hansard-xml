            <para>-  Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> 1 have obtained some figures from the last report of the Joint Coal Board. They are very interesting. The report shows, amongst other things, that the production loss from industrial disputes on the New South Wales coal-fields has not exceeded 3 per cent, of possible production during any one of the last three years. In the preceding eleven years losses ran from 5.7 per cent, to 18.3 per cent. In 1960-61, the percentage of man-shifts lost as a result of industrial disputes fell below 2 per cent. That is probably the lowest level in the history of the New South Wales coal-mining industry. In the first half of this calendar year, 1961, man-shifts lost as a result of industrial disputes - the figures relate to underground mines only - on the Cessnock.NorthWest field, fell to .12 per cent, and for the Newcastle district, they fell to .06 per cent. In other words, I do not think it is an overstatement to say that, for the first six months of this year, losses because of industrial difficulties have been negligible on the Cessnock and Newcastle coal-fields. </para>

            <para>-  My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. I presume he has noticed the disparity in the numbers of males and females in the various States. In Tasmania, as in other States, the disparity has been brought about by the immigration policy. In 1950, there were 102 males to every 100 females, but by the end of 1960 there were 112 males to every 100 females. As this development is causing concern, and as certain action has been taken in other States to alleviate the position, will the Government, in deciding future immigration policy, consider the increasing imbalance of the sexes in Tasmania? </para>

            <para>- I have noted the disparity, although I have not seen the most recent figures for Tasmania, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> mentioned. I agree with the honorable senator that this is a problem which should be rectified as soon as possible. I undertake to place the matter before the Minister for Immigration, stressing the position in Tasmania, and asking him to keep this well in view when considering the policy for the coming year. </para>

If that situation does occur, and the great Singapore base is rendered virtually useless for the purposes of Seato, will it not also be rendered virtually useless in all other respects? If I am right in assuming that it will, would I be correct in saying that it might be desirable for the Australian Government to commence discussions with the United Kingdom Government for the purpose of ascertaining where that base might be shifted to? </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister of Malaya, the Tunku Abdul Rahman, is, 1 understand, going to the United Kingdom to discuss with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> a wide range of subjects related to the possible merger between Singapore and Malaya and various proposals which have been made for the establishment of a Greater Malaysia, which would mean some form of political closeness between North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, Singapore and Malaya. I did read in a newspaper that the Tunku had stated he would discuss, in this general context, the future of the Singapore base, but I am not able to say whether the quotation given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> is completely accurate. If the future of the Singapore naval base is one of the subjects to be. discussed, it is a matter that lies between the United Kingdom, which built and owns the base, and the Malayan Government. I am quite sure that the Australian Government will be kept informed of any discussions concerning this matter. Last week, I think it was, I read newspaper reports that the United Kingdom had decided to remove the naval base. I do not believe that those reports are true. I know nothing of them, and I think that I would have known something of them had they been true. Lord Selkirk, United Kingdom Commissioner-General for South-East Asia, who lives in Singapore, said that he knew nothing of the proposal and that he would have known of it if it were true. At this stage I think that this matter is being played up by the press rather more than it should be. </para>

First, is it a fact that Scott Brothers, owners of pearlshell fishing craft in Western Australia, received a permit from the Department of Immigration to indenture labourers from outside Australia to work their pearling luggers? Secondly, did Scott Brothers contract to employ the indentured labour exclusively on their pearling luggers and to return them to the place of engagement upon completion of the pearling season? Thirdly, have Scott Brothers carried out their contract in respect of the labourers indentured by them? Fourthly, who was responsible for dumping the indentured labourers on the shores of Derby, Western Australia, and not returning them to the place at which they were engaged? </para>

Whether those reports are accurate 1 do not know. Should such discussions take place now or in the future, particularly if they take place between the representatives of two other countries, and if information concerning them is conveyed to Australia, i! would, be unusual for that information to be made available publicly in the Senate. </para>

If this is a fact., and if this rate continues, is it not possible that Australian industries could slip out of the control of Australians into the hands of foreigners?

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> raises a very important matter - one that requires some consideration. This Government has continued a policy of endeavouring to attract into Australia as much overseas capital as possible. That has been done in the belief that there is so much for us to do in Australia that it is beyond the resources of Australian savings and that, by having overseas capital invested in Australia, we can quicken the rate of our development and at the same time get the benefit of overseas knowledge and experience. I hope that will continue to be our policy. I do not share the apprehension that has been expressed about the possibility of losing control of our industries. I do not believe that will happen. However, there is always the possibility that capital will come in to acquire an already established industry. That capital would come in not to develop the country but to get the benefit of development that has already taken place. The introduction of such capital needs to be looked at in a different way. I forbear to say what the powers of the Commonwealth are in those circumstances. It is rather difficult to say what powers are readily available. The. inflow of capital needs to be encouraged; it is not automatic. People with capital must have confidence in a country. Such people are always careful to observe the policy of the country in which they contemplate investing their money, and to adhere to it. </para>

If so, with what countries have negotiations been held? What success, if any, has attended those negotiations? </para>

            <para>-  My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation, relates to the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act  1959,  which deals broadly with the rights of action for death, injury and damage as a result of air disasters and accidents, and damage to, and loss of, goods carried by air. The Minister may recall that when this legislation was before the Senate the matter of its applicability intrastate was raised. Has the Minister been successful in persuading the States to pass complementary legislation If so, what States have passed such legislation? Have any States refused to pass it? </para>

            <para>-  Quite soon after the passing of the legislation through this Parliament I took up with all the States the matter of the adoption of similar legislation with application to intra-state travel. The matter was taken up first by correspondence and was then processed through the Australian Transport Advisory Council. The point has been reached where a model bill has been drawn up and circulated to the States. I think I am right in saying that most of the States have agreed to it and that Western Australia has actually passed the legislation. </para>

            <para>-  My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Because I have been seriously embarrassed in my position as a senator, I ask for your indulgence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to make an explanatory preface to my question. Some weeks ago, I wrote a letter to the Minister for Social Services on behalf of one of my electors. He was in receipt of both an age pension and a war pension. After the recent increases he was overpaid and certain adjustments had to be made. This man did not want the local Liberal member of the House of Representatives to know of his circumstances, and he asked me to take up his case. 1 did so. Last week, I received from the Minister a letter in which he set out all the circumstances, and in the last sentence said that he had communicated all of the information to the member of the House of Representatives for the relevant area. I have always understood that the confidences of a senator in the performance of his duties were respected by the Ministers of this Government. I ask the Leader of the Government: Is it now the practice that such confidences are broken by Ministers? If it is, and he does not approve the practice, will he take the matter up with the Prime Minister with the object of stopping the practice before it is extended further? </para>

            <para>- The question asked by the honorable senator is similar to a question that was addressed to me recently, asking for details of Commonwealth expenditure in one State. I think the answer given by the Treasurer to that question was to the effect that it would not be possible to provide such information in respect of one State because very frequently moneys that are debited to a branch of a Commonwealth department within a State are not, in fact, spent within that State, the moneys being applied to the purchase of materials, stores and a number of other things in other States. Such entries do not relate necessarily to expenditure within one State. As that is the kind of question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has addressed to me, I expect that the same kind of answer will be given. However, if he will put the question on the notice-paper I will look at it and find out whether any information of the kind for which he asks can be supplied. </para>

This bill ratifies the existing practice by making provision for these inspections to take place in the vicinity of the aircraft.

          <para>That the  bill be now read  a second  time. </para>
          <para class="block">The bill which I introduce seeks the repeal of section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-1960. Section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act does not permit the Commonwealth to enter into contracts for the carriage of mails unless the contract provides that only white labour will be employed on such work. This section has its origin in an amendment agreed to by the Parliament during the debate on the Post and Telegraph Bill 1901, and was intended primarily to ensure that only white labour would be employed on the ships on which mail was conveyed. However, in view of the specific terminology used in section 16, the same conditions have been observed in the contractual arrangements for the carriage of mails overland, in which, of course, there has been considerable development since 1901. </para>
          <para>The present provisions are considered to be unduly restrictive, since they involve discrimination against coloured people, including aborigines, in our Australian community. In all, there are now some 5,900 Post Office mail contracts which may involve a payment of as little as &#163;1 annually and, or, actual working time of less than one hour a week. Many of these contracts represent a very minor part of a contractor&#39;s business activities, which may be principally concerned, for example, with road transportation or some other community service. Under the existing legislation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> such a mail contractor is unable to engage a coloured person for duties which include the carriage of mail, even if the mail work represents only a very small proportion of the total work to be performed. </para>
          <para>Over the years, section 16 has been interpreted to allow for the employment of people in whom coloured blood is not preponderant. Consequently, it has been permissible for half-caste people to be considered for mail contract duties. Nevertheless, in a community such as ours, the existing legislation is too restrictive, for there is a responsibility upon us all to pay proper regard to the contribution that everybody, including coloured people, is able to make to community life, in which communication by mail plays such an important part. </para>
          <para>The Post Office, under the normal employment provisions of the Public Service Act 1922-1960, employs suitable aborigines in various capacities, including work at post offices, telephone exchanges or with line parties. Consequently, there are no valid reasons why these people should not be permitted to apply for employment on work associated with the carriage of mail under contract with the Post Office. The bill seeks, therefore, to remove these most undesirable restrictions to which I have referred and  to  give coloured people the opportunity for employment on mail contract work. I commend the bill for consideration by the Senate. </para>

            <para>. -  I refer particularly to Division No. 531  -  Royal Australian Air Force, and Division No. 535  -  Aircraft and other equipment, repair and overhaul. The Air Force is a branch of the armed services, and it seems to be very efficient. Apart from the comments that I am about to make, I think  1  can say that it is the best equipped of the services. We. do not see, in relation to the Air Force, the same ministerial strutting all over Australia that is seen in connexion with the other services, nor is there the same attempt on the part of the Air Force administrators to make good fellows of themselves. The Air Force is a working force. Each time that the members of an air crew board an aircraft they take their lives in their hands. For that reason, they become, more or less fatalistic in their outlook. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I have said, the Air Force is efficient. From the point of view of the defence of Australia, it is probably our first line  of  defence. We of the Australian Labour Party for years have been advocating that the Air Force should be kept in proper order, that there should be a sufficient number of aircraft and that aerodromes should be constructed at strategic locations, so that the Air Force could be used to keep prospective aggressors away from Australia. Of all the armed services, the Air Force is the only one that is up to date. </para>
          <para>Five or six years ago, there were references to the purchase of jet fighter aircraft from America. The former Minister for Defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride, went to America, and on his return stated that the aircraft which it was at first thought would be purchased would not be available and that, anyhow, they were not good enough for our purpose. The proposal was therefore abandoned. Investigations were made in other parts of the world with a view to obtaining suitable jet aircraft for the Air Force. Only recently I asked in the Senate whether the Government had decided to purchase from France Mirage jet fighters, and I was told that it had. I have found on inquiry - my information may be wrong, and I should like the Minister to correct me if it is - that the Australian authorities, whoever they might be, have arranged that the Rolls-Royce engines at present used in the Mirage aircraft are to be taken out and other engines installed in their place. The information I have is that the new engines that are to be used in the aircraft are not up to date, and are not as efficient as the Rolls-Royce engines. I understand that, so far as upkeep is concerned, the Rolls-Royce engines are miles ahead of the other engines. My information may be wrong. Has there been some arrangement to replace the Rolls-Royce engines with engines which even the French Air Force has declared obsolete and inferior to Rolls-Royce engines? Apart from this, may I compliment the Minister and the Air Force upon the efficiency of the service. This is a new departure for me. </para>

            <para>. - My remarks may be regarded by the Minister as somewhat premature, but on second consideration he might think that there is something in this subject to discuss. I refer to the possibility of including in the Royal Australian Air Force personnel from Papua and New Guinea, with the ultimate objective of training them to take over the air defence of their own country. That is, of course, a long-term project. It would take a long while for those people to be trained as members of the R.A.A.F. and ultimately as members of the New Guinea Air Force, but the situation must be faced eventually. Has any thinking been done along these lines? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Undoubtedly Papuan and New Guinea men make splendid fighters; they are probably second to none and their reputation is world-wide. I refer, of course, to fighting on the ground. Naturally, the idea of fighting in the air is new to them. I do not disparage them when I say that the race is by no means airminded at present. It will take some time to encourage these people to look to the air, but we must face the problem ultimately.. Will, the Minister say whether the R.A.A.F. has considered incorporation of Papuan and New Guinea personnel, with the ultimate objective of forming within the R.A.A.F. a New Guinea Air Force unit and eventually an exclusively New Guinea, service? </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Flaherty</inline> has been very generous in his commendation of the Air Force, and that is appreciated. He asked specifically whether it was a fact that Rolls-Royce engines were being removed from Mirage fighter aircraft and replaced by Mirage engines. Such is not the case. I shall give, briefly, the history of negotiations for the Mirage fighter. Naturally, we were after the most efficient aircraft of this kind in the world. After very thorough examination of all counterparts in the world, the air frame itself appealed very greatly to our experts. We in this country, and indeed the world generally, have a very great appreciation of Rolls-Royce equipment. We have used it in this country for years and it has given magnificent service. We were particularly interested in it because we are British people and desirous of supporting British industry. For these reasons, we arranged for a Rolls-Royce engine to be fitted to a Mirage fighter, not that that might be the last word but that we might be able to make a comparison of performances of the aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a Mirage engine. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I must be very guarded in what I say. Far be it from me or anybody else in this country to suggest that the Rolls-Royce engine is inferior to any other make. That would not be fair to the Rolls-Royce people or to British people generally. Let me put the position in this way: The performances of the Rolls-Royce and the Atar engines were- almost identical. I think that we could let it go at that. But there were other factors that had a very big bearing on the decision that we took. The Mirage aircraft was designed for an Atar engine. Therefore, it stands to reason that the fitments are simpler and modifications more easily attained. Another important factor was that other countries are attracted by the performance of the Mirage fighter with a Mirage motor. Had we fitted a Rolls-Royce engine, we might well have been the only country flying a hybrid aircraft, if I might use this term. It will be readily understood that in this modern world modifications are being made to aircraft from day to day. The people of Australia have to pay for those modifications to keep our aircraft modern and up-to-date. Our decision to buy the Mirage aircraft with an Atar motor puts us in the category of other nations who are buying the same aircraft. In the main, the French Air Ministry will develop that aircraft and motor until they have, as nearly as possible, reached the ultimate. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline>suggested that we consider training personnel from Papua and New Guinea so that they might ultimately be in a position to effect the air defence of their own country. We could all agree in principle with that suggestion, but I should like the honorable senator to ponder the difficulties that immediately present themselves upon examining this proposal. Flying an aircraft to-day is a highly specialized occupation. Flying, servicing and backing an aircraft that flies at twice the speed of sound requires a degree of perfection that takes years to attain. It is not easy to transpose into that occupation people who have so far to go to reach the starting point from which we commence operations. I would not suggest that the thought is unworthy of consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> has suggested that this would be a long-term project. I have seen the people to whom he has referred, and I know that they are making great strides in their educational attainments. 1 think the time will come when they shall be able to commence training them for some of the occupations to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> has referred. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I pay a tribute to the officers and men of the R.A.A.F., who have served Australia well in war and in peace. It was unfortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Flaherty</inline> should have felt obliged to pass insulting remarks about the men who fly jet aircraft from a moving flight deck, and about the men who fly bombers from a moving flight deck. Those men, as the honorable senator said, take their lives in their hands whenever they go on a training or operational exercise with the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Australian Navy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Flaherty</inline> should know that men fly in the Army. The Army has an aerial spotting service, and the men who fly planes in the Army take their lives in their hands. While paying due tribute to the men of the Royal Australian Air Force, we must remember that personnel of the other services perform difficult and dangerous work for the community, both in peace-time and in war-time. </para>

The sum of &#163;1,266,000 is provided as an initial payment on eight Bell helicopters ordered for search and rescue work. These helicopters will be coming forward in the new year. Provision is made for the payment of &#163;3,911,000 for the P2V -7 Neptunes, delivery of which will commence in January next. Two a month will be delivered until the whole squadron has been delivered. An amount of &#163;60,000 is provided, representing payment on the Vampire trainers. Provision is made for &#163;13,000 for Canberra bombers. The sum of &#163;1,488,000 is provided as a final payment on the Hercules transport aircraft. The sum of &#163;2,927,000 is provided this year for the Mirage fighters. The sum of &#163;1,067,000 is set aside for expenditure locally with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the Government Aircraft Factory. As honorable senators are aware, both these organizations are undertaking the manufacture of engines for the Mirage fighter on the one hand and the assembly of aircraft on the other, with great benefit to the Australian aircraft industry. </para>

              <para>-  A year or two ago I was speaking in Brisbane to some former Royal Australian Air Force pilots. They were on the reserve list, but when they attended to their duties, as was required of them, they were looked at askance and they felt they were not wanted. They spent many hours doing nothing, with the result that many of them threw in the job. Evidently they believed that they were not wanted by the present officers. I have been unable to find any item covering the payment of these reserverists </para>

Can the Minister tell us anything about the relative numbers and fighting power of the aircraft held by Australia and by this northern neighbour? </para>

We are building up our forces merely for the defence of Australia; we have no designs against any other country.

Provision for that expenditure has been made so that we will be in a position to hire special equipment such as cranes to meet our temporary needs.

Last year, the appropriation was &#163;170,000. Comparatively recently, the Parliament passed legislation providing for a contribution of, I think, one farthing a bushel from wheat sales for wheat research. We all realize that it is very desirable that the wheat industry itself should contribute to wheat research, which is extremely important in relation to the product itself and to world markets. I should like to know what amount has been collected under the act which provided for wheatgrowers to contribute, I think, one farthing a bushel. Is this &#163;200,000 the total, or only part of the money that has been collected? I take it that it is only part of the money. What is the full amount that has been collected? What proportion of the fund does this &#163;200,000 represent? Where are wheat research stations established? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Recently I read that a wheat research station was established somewhere in the north-west of the New South Wales wheat belt. I cannot remember the name of the town. Are there any other wheat research stations in Australia? Are some of the agricultural colleges in the various States receiving money from this fund? I should be interested to know whether the Roseworthy Agricultural College in South Australia receives any part of this wheat research fund, which could be devoted to the improvement of wheat varieties, and to wheat research generally. </para>

During tie last few weeks various honorable senators on this side of the chamber have asked questions about tobacco, and the answers given seemed like funeral notices. They offered no hope that anything would be done for the Australian -tobacco industry, which seems to be struggling with the overseas tobacco monopolies for a place in the Australian market. Would I be wrong in suggesting that there is some inconsistency in proposing to spend &#163;25,500 on research for the purposes of an industry which, according to answers to questions, is at the end of its tether, at any rate temporarily? Is this money to be  spent on trying to find ways and means to break the hold of the big overseas monopolies so that the Australian tobacco industry can find its rightful place in the Australian market? </para>

I understand that during the last year or so the work of &#34; Southern Endeavour&#34; has been made less effective because the vessel has had to return to port with its catches, thereby losing contact with the fish amongst which it was operating. </para>

              <para>asked whether he was right in saying that the tobacco industry is at the end of its tether and, therefore, the expenditure of over &#163;25,000 on tobacco research cannot be justified. This industry is far from being at the end of its tether. During the last ten years it has made a wonderful contribution to the economy of this country and has saved us from spending a great deal of money overseas. It is true that at present the industry is facing some difficulties. For some of those difficulties the industry itself is responsible, but others arise from factors over which it has no control. As I said in this chamber only to-day, the Government is trying to meet the situation that has arisen. It is doing all that it can do to encourage representatives of the States and of the industry to co-operate with it in finding solutions for the problems that face the industry. The sum of &#163;25,500 to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> has referred will be made available to State universities and to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Anybody who knows anything about the activities of those organizations in relation to tobacco will concede readily that that money will be very well spent. </para>

            <para>. -I refer to Division No. 355, subdivision 2, item 09, Sugar Industry - Committee of Inquiry. This committee is under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy.</inline> I ask the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Minister: Do the terms of reference include investigation of the increased utilization of mechanization in the sugar industry and the effect of mechanization in depopulating northern Queensland? We have seen the effect of bulk handling on the waterfront. In Mackay over one week-end practically 400 men were dismissed, and in seven mills in the Mackay district baggers, sewers and stackers had to find other work. The same thing has happened in practically all the sugar ports of Queensland. </para>
          <para>I am not suggesting that we should deny the advent of increased mechanization or automation, but I do say that the Government has a responsibility to maintain settlement in northern Queensland to which the sugar industry has made a substantial contribution over many years. The Government has a responsibility to find other avenues of employment for the men who will be dismissed. We have had the advent of mechanical harvesting in the sugar industry, and there are mechanical loaders in virtually every district. Up to the present, mechanical harvesters can be used only on level ground and not on undulating territory. They are being used in Bundaberg, Ingham, Babinda and other places. I was wondering whether the terms of reference of the inquiry embrace the effect of mechanization on the industry and also whether it is likely to have any effect, ultimately, on the price of sugar to the Australian consumer. </para>
          <para>Recently a number of sugar farmers in Queensland raised the question of the control of the sale of sugar farms. Such control does not operate in northern New South Wales where there is some measure of sugar cultivation. In Queensland the sale of farms has always been regulated, sales having to be approved by the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board. Devious methods are utilized to frustrate the efforts of the board, but nevertheless, the law provides for this control. Cane-growers are seeking the abolition of this control. I was wondering whether this matter was included in the terms of reference of the committee of inquiry. </para>
          <para>In regard to the Wool Marketing Committee of Inquiry, a rather interesting speech was made by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in another place in relation to sales at Portland where the wool-buyers of Australia adopted stand-over methods to determine that sales should not be held, or not be effective if they were held. A direction was issued to members of the wool-buyers&#39; association that they were not to participate in the sales. The honorable member for Wannon, who knows quite a deal about the wool industry, documented his case very substantially.  His  speech is available to be read, and I think the Minister would have a responsibility in respect of that matter. Of course, we had previous definite evidence, as the result of the inquiry conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cook in New South Wales, that there were pies, or buyer arrangements, which adversely affected the interest of the wool-growers. </para>
          <para>I pass to the committee set up by the Government to inquire into the dairying industry. I understand that committee has recommended the abolition of the subsidy to the dairy industry. What is the attitude of the Government in this matter? Is it going to announce before the general elections that it will accept the finding of the committee and abolish the subsidy to the dairying industry? </para>
          <para>I pass to the item dealing with tobacco research. Does it include research into buying arrangements and the marketing of tobacco? As honorable senators know, the tobacco industry throughout Australia is in the doldrums to-day. Many growers are thinking of walking off their farms. If there is a repetition of buyers&#39; methods next year similar to those which characterized sales this year, growers from north Queensland to Western Australia will have to walk off their farms. We know that many of the Western Australian growers are comparatively new to the industry and that their leaf was not of a high grade. This is a difficult industry in that special attention is required right from the time of sterilization of the soil until the marketing of the crop. Men who have been in the industry for many years claim that the quality of the leaf this year is no different from the quality of the leaf produced last year. Yet prices were totally different, and much of the leaf was discarded at open auction although subsequently negotiated sales took place. The price of leaf being utilized in tobacco was recently raised by 2d. for every 2 oz. I think that the percentage of Australian leaf compulsorily required to be utilized in the production of tobacco is 43 per cent. I should be pleased if the Minister would supply answers to the questions I have asked; they call for very simple replies. </para>

This provision is to meet the balance of the contribution this year to include the cost of a congress committee and to finance the preliminary expenses, as very little revenue is expected from the congress prior to 1962. This congress could well introduce a new era for the poultry industry in Australia. </para>

The Government announced some time ago that it was willing to discuss with State governments and the industry organizations several issues arising from the report and recommendations of the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry. The two items to be discussed are the new five-year stabilization plan in respect of the present agreement which terminates on 20th June, 1962, and the reconstruction of that section of the industry which the committee believes is in an unsatisfactory economic position. Negotiations with organizations concerned with the industry, regarding new stabilization proposals, will commence at an appropriate time when the ideas of the Government and the industry have been fully formulated. The reconstruction aspects are to be considered at the next meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council which, on present indications, will take place early in 1962. </para>

            <para>. -  I wish to refer to the fishing industry, which comes within the items mentioned in Division No. 355. I invite the Minister to give the committee his observations on the matters related to the fishing industry that I am about to mention. I think he will agree with me that, by and large, the retail price of fish in Australia, particularly in Western Australia, is inordinately high. There are reasons for that, one being, of course, that there are not sufficient fish in Australian waters. I imagine that the fishing industry is having a lucrative time because of that situation. No doubt there are other reasons which account for the ridiculously high price of fish, but they are by the way. I shall confine my argument to the shortage of fish. I ask the Minister: Has the department, in its research, come to the conclusion that Australian waters are deficient in fish? What is the nature of the research that has been conducted in regard to our fishing beds? Does that research disclose that there is a deficient quantity of fish available for the nation, at least for the time being? Does it also disclose that fish may be taken economically from our waters so as to compete with overseas supplies? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no doubt that the fish that we purchase from overseas is competing very favorably in price with local fish. Why is it that the fish which we import from Great Britain and South Africa can be sold at prices which, generally speaking, are lower than those we pay for fish caught in Australian waters? These are matters that merit investigation. The price of fish in Great Britain, South Africa and the European countries is very much lower than it is in Australia. The reason for the high price of Australian fish may well be that we are short of fish, or that our seas have relatively so few fish in them that is is too expensive to take them out. </para>

            <para>. - May I reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> while the many points he has raised are fresh in my mind. I can speak only in general terms because I must confess that I am not a fisherman. My knowledge is confined to the steps that have been taken recently to meet this situation which is causing concern to Federal and State governments alike. It is obvious that the demand for fish exceeds the supply. The position has become so acute that the State governments, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Government, have taken action which it is hoped will be of great benefit to the industry. Recently, an Australian Fisheries Council was established on the same basis as the Australian Agricultural Council. In effect, the Commonwealth Minister for Primary Industry is the  chairman  of the council and its members consist of the Ministers for Agriculture of the various States. I understand that they include also a representative of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is the task of the council to be responsible for research into the fishing industry in Australian waters. Such research could be concerned with the breeding habits - because it has been indicated that some kinds of fish are not now breeding as well as they might - and feeding habits, which have a great deal to do with the matter. </para>

At this stage, it would be premature to forecast the lines along which the activities of the council will move. I have no doubt, however, that the problems of the industry are in good hands.

            <para>.- Obviously, one of the tasks of the Department of Primary Industry is to examine and conduct research into matters concerned with the welfare of our primary industries. I hope that the amounts shown in the estimates for the department do not represent all that the Australian Government is doing in the way of research and inquiry into the problems of our primary industries. I should like information on that point. If we disregarded the items of expenditure which relate to travelling allowances, subsistence, postage, and so on, we could come to the conclusion that we are spending on research and inquiry into our primary industries only about &#163;800,000 or &#163;900,000 a year. That is a miserly sum in compari son with the immense returns that we receive from those industries. </para>

The sums that are shown in the estimates for the department appear to be very small, and not commensurate with the returns that we get from our primary industries. I make no apology for saying that I think we have gone overboard with secondary industries in the last ten years and we are a little over-inclined to say that the primary industries are so prosperous that they can look after themselves. </para>

              <para>- Yes. We have spent a lot of money and attention on the development of our secondary industries and we have been a little inclined to allow the other industries to look after themselves. The sum proposed for fisheries services is so small as to be laughable. This is an island continent. Other countries send fishing vessels thousands of miles to our shores to reap big harvests of fish. We in this country, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> said, are poorly supplied with fish and the fish with which we are supplied is very highly priced indeed. Apart from the &#34; Fisheries Newsletter &#34;, we are spending on fishery services &#163;10,000. I cannot help wondering what it is that is preventing us from taking some action to develop our fisheries services properly. When the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission were sold some time ago, we were told that the receipts from the sale would be put into a fund to be administered by a committee for the purposes of the fishing industry. Some Australians who had ideas about developing some of our fisheries, including the crayfish industry, told me that they had made inquiries to see whether money would be available from that fund for developmental purposes and had been informed that no money was available. So far as I could make out from the last balance sheet of that trust fund, virtually the only money spent had been that expended on the vessel to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> referred. It appeared to me that the people on that committee were not particularly active or else they were being impeded in some way in doing anything real to develop our fisheries. </para>

          <para>We hear a lot of talk about the need fo; good foodstuffs and the need <inline font-style="italic">io</inline> develop our primary industries. Here is a primary industry that is almost entirely undeveloped, on which we are spending a paltry, miserable sum of &#163;10,000. Even the trust fund established from receipts from the sale of our whaling industry seems to be in a moribund state. I regret that Australia is not doing more research to assist her primary industries. One industry that is obviously not being given one-tenth of the attention it deserves is the fishing industry. Activity in regard to that industry is moribund. When we consider the returns that other countries are getting from fisheries, it is clear that Australia is throwing away tremendous possibilities. </para>

          <para>Division No. 359 relates to the proposed vote for the Division of Agricultural Economics. I am happy to be able to say without qualification that I have the utmost appreciation of the work of this division. The services that it gives personally and through its periodicals are most valuable to the Parliament, the farming community and the public generally. In the first place, we should remind ourselves that, contrary to a good deal of propaganda that has been forthcoming on the European Common Market, this division of the Department of Primary Industry has, for the last three or four years, been producing forceful articles on the impact of that development on Australian primary industries. They are most comprehensive and penetrating articles. </para>
          <para>From the point of view of keeping our rural industries in proper perspective, the division&#39;s &#34; Quarterly Review of Agricultural Economics &#34; is invaluable. It would not be out of place to remind ourselves of the opening statement in its article on the estimates for 1960-61, in which it is stated that the aggregate volume of production of Australian rural industry in 1960-61 was estimated to be 6 per cent, above that of the previous year and 3 per cent, higher than ever before. However, the gross value of production was expected to rise only by li per cent, to &#163;1,345,000,000 and the net farm income to fall by more than 4 per cent. The article goes on to give a very short statement on volume of production and value of rural production and exports. This shows in graphic form, not something that can properly be referred to as prosperity such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> mentioned, but rather a dwindling return such as to bring most of these industries to the cost line. Net income, except from larger properties, has to a great extent ceased to exist. This is illustrated by the fact that although rural production increased from an index number of 122 in 1953-54 to an index number of 154 in 1960-61, the gross value increased from &#163;1,160,000,000 to only &#163;1,345,000,000. Although the volume of exports of rural origin increased from an index number of 116 in 1953-54 to an index number of 155 in 1960-61, the value f.o.b. of those exports fell from &#163;687,000,000 to &#163;684,000,000. With the concurrence of honorable senators I incorporate the following table in &#34; Hansard &#34;: - </para>

          <para class="block">1 should like the Minister to tell honorable senators just what is being done in relation to our primary industries.

          <para>The Division of Agricultural Economics has revealed that in 1957-58 the tobacco crop exceeded 10,000,000 lb. By 1959-60, production had exceeded 20,000,000 lb., and the estimate for this year is about 31,000,000 lb. Tobacco production is increasing at the rate of about 10,000,000 lb. a year. We have been told of the marketing problems for tobacco. May we have the department&#39;s analysis of the troubles that beset the tobacco industry? </para>
          <para>When may we expect the report of the committee inquiring into the wool industry? What are the four or five basic problems to which the committee is particularly directing its attention? </para>
          <para>Finally, may I have an assurance that the work of the Division of Agricultural Economics is fully utilized by the Department of Labour and National Service each year when the important process of assessing the basic wage is undertaken? I believe that the chief deficiency of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is that it fails to make a proper assessment of the economics of the agricultural industries. Tn view of the wealth of information available from the Division of Agricultural Economics I ask the Minister to ensure that the Department of Labour and National Service presents that information to the Arbitration Court so that it may fully understand the position. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It may be argued that that amount is sufficient or that it is insufficient. Australia is such a vast country that there is no limit to the amount of money that could be spent on research into our primary industries, provided we have the funds. I will give a break-up of the amount being spent on research. The Commonwealth has contributed &#163;980,000 towards research into the wool industry. In addition, the industry provided &#163;490,000. making a total  of  &#163;1,470,000. The Government&#39;s contribution to the wheat industry for research purposes was &#163;200,000. A similar contribution was made by the industry itself. The dairying industry received &#163;100,000 from the Government. The industry itself provided &#163;130,000. The beef industry received &#163;50,000 from the Commonwealth, and the industry itself provided &#163;250,000. The tobacco industry received &#163;25,000 from the Commonwealth. The industry itself contributed &#163;187,000. </para>

              <para>asked what was being done to develop the fishing industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> also sought information on that subject. The honorable senators claimed, perhaps with some justification, that the amount provided in the Estimates is not sufficient to meet the needs of the industry. It may be that several factors have highlighted the needs of the industry. Over the last decade or so our population has increased enormously. It is true that a percentage of the persons who account for that increase have for generations been fish eaters. There is a great demand for our fish. That is one factor that contributes to the problem. From the little I know of the industry I am aware that the industry faces great technical problems associated with the breeding and feeding of fish in our waters. All I can do is repeat that the States and the Commonwealth realize the need to take some positive action to solve the problems confronting the industry. They have set up a council. Whether the sum that has been provided in the Estimates will prove to be adequate is a moot point. I suggest that the amount that has been set aside is a starting point. I am sure that as the need for assistance is made known the Government will meet that need to the best of its ability. I think all of us hope that an investigation into the problems confronting the industry will produce worthwhile results. </para>

I make bold to say  that  that may well be one of the reasons for some of the problems with which the industry is now confronted. I know so little about the tobacco industry that I cannot speak with authority. But there are some things I do know. I know that climate plays a vital part in the production of  saleable  and usable leaf. I know, too, that the soil in which the plant is grown has  a  vital influence on the kind of leaf produced. Because the Government has adopted the policy of stepping up the content of  Australian  leaf in the finished product, growers have seized upon the opportunity to  increase  their plantings with little regard to the type and quality of leaf they intend  to  produce. The Commonwealth Government has no jurisdiction over the restriction  of  plantings in the States. That is a matter which the State governments will have to face up to if the overall problem  is not to  be accentuated. </para>

              <para>-  If there are insufficient fish in the sea, I do not see how we can get sufficient there. An equally great problem is that of increasing the birthrate of fish. I have spoken to fishermen on the north coast of New South Wales who probably catch their quota of fish, but I have been left with the impression that it is a poor man&#39;s industry. I ask the Minister what is the nature of the research that is being conducted in the fishing industry. </para>

            <para>. - I, too, relate my remarks to the proposed expenditure on fisheries services. I refer to an answer that was given to a -question asked earlier in the afternoon about the fishing craft &#34; Southern Endeavour &#34;, which is at present in South Australian waters. Did the Minister say that up to this point of time the vessel had not been sold? I am wondering whether he can assure honorable senators that, if the vessel is sold to some outside organization, one of the terms of sale will be that it must remain in South Australian waters. The fishing industry of South Australia is making a substantial contribution to our overseas balances. &#62;The sale of crayfish is producing a substantia&#93; income. It would be a tragedy if this vessel were to be sold to private enterprise and taken away from South Australia to be used in another State or even in some other country. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> and other honorable senators have raised the matter of research into fisheries. The discussion has reached the stage where I am obliged to rely on technical advice. To that end, 1 make the following contribution to the debate: Waters in the Southern Hemisphere generally are not as rich in fish as are Northern Hemisphere waters. Some Australian waters are not rich in fish. The Fisheries Division and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization are engaged in oceanographic and biological research which is directed mainly to an evaluation of fishing resources. Some State departments are engaged in scientific research. The Fisheries Division is beginning a programme of economic research into fisheries. Research has shown that the major Australian fisheries can be sustained and that there is scope for development in certain sections of the industry, such as tuna-fishing. </para>

            <para>. - I am pushed into this debate by the fact that so many of my colleagues have spoken about the &#34; Southern Endeavour &#34;. Fisheries research was dear to my heart, although recently I have more or less given it away because 1 did not think I was getting anywhere. I was very interested in the Minister&#39;s remark that this amount of &#163;10,000, which has been allocated for fishery surveys this year, is a good starting point. As last year&#39;s allocation was &#163;12,000, all I can say is that we are starting to go backwards again. This appropriation is ludicrous in comparison with what is done in other countries. As my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Setter,</inline> the Director of the Fisheries Division, knows, it must take a great deal of keenness on his part for him to carry on without the encouragement from the Government to which he is entitled, but which he does not receive. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As some of my colleagues will remember, it took me five years of almost constant speaking in this chamber, going to the Minister time and time again, and forming a federal body, which cost me &#163;150 of my own money, to get something done for the fishermen of Australia. All I managed to have done was to have fishing proclaimed as a primary industry. That made a difference, because fishermen now receive various benefits which other primary producers receive, such as averaging under the income tax law. </para>
          <para>Canada spends about 10,000,000 dollars -not 10,000 dollars - a year in this field, and has about fourteen large and small ships doing survey work, pure and simple. It has an extension service at the Brunswick University, which costs about 78,000 dollars a year, and to which fishermen may go. The United States of America has about ten ships of various types, from the tuna clipper that costs about &#163;350,000, to the smaller estuary vessels. Those ships are working in that country in the interests of the science of fisheries. Great Britain has not only ten or twelve vessels on survey work, but also the tenth minesweeper flotilla to keep the fishermen out of trouble. In all the more central fishing ports, from Yarmouth, Hull and Grimsby right around to Brixton on the south coast, there are meeting places for the fishermen where films are shown of new types of nets, where lectures are given, and where instructions are given for the stopping of over-fishing. Even in South Africa and New Guinea small ships are doing nothing but survey work. </para>
          <para>When the Nor&#39; West Whaling Company Limited was sold, and there was money to be used, I was in great heart. I thought that we were really going to get somewhere. For twelve months I have watched the activities of the &#34; Southern Endeavour &#34;, which cost about &#163;350,000. One of the things for which I asked time and time again was long-term loans to fishermen. At the end of the war our fishing fleets were in a bad way. The fishermen themselves had left the industry and, obviously, it was going to be quite a hard job for them to get the fishing industry back to the position in which it was before the war. Their vessels were out of date. They had been used by the three services. I was hoping that long-term loans would be available to fishermen, as they are in Canada, the United States of America and Great Britain. Such loans would have enabled the fishermen to repair their vessels and engines, and to do anything else that they wanted to do. I hoped that the loans would be provided from the &#163;800,000 that came from the sale of the Nor&#39; West Whaling Company. </para>
          <para>I am not quite sure of this statement, but it is as near as I can get to the facts. So many fishermen applied for long-term loans that it was decided not to give anybody a loan. To my way of thinking, that was an extraordinary way of handling the matter. Nevertheless, I think that statement is pretty true. This miserable &#163;10,000 that is appropriated for this year will not go anywhere. </para>
          <para>I refer now to the setting up of the new council. I spoke to the appropriate Minister from my State after he had attended the conference here in Canberra. I asked him whether it would help in any way if I gave him a precis of the notes that I had collected over about five years of studying this problem. His reply was: &#34; Oh, yes, you might send it in. I do not suppose that I will have time to look at it; but still, send it in.&#34; That was not very encouraging. It does not give me the impression that this new council will get very far if the Ministers from the other States are so busy that they have to adopt the same attitude as the Queensland Minister has adopted. </para>
          <para>I rose to say that this year&#39;s appropriation is not encouraging to the department, and certainly is not a step forward. As I said hear the beginning of my remarks, it is a step backwards of &#163;2,000. Instead of the appropriation being &#163;10,000, it should be something like &#163;100,000. That amount will have to be provided before we are likely to get anywhere and have real research into fisheries. The Japanese know more about the Coral Sea than we do, as far as fisheries are concerned. The position will remain that way until the Government really lets its head go, puts up more money and takes more interest in this subject. In the meantime, we shall go on importing at least half of the fish that we require for consumption in Australia. </para>

Finally can the Minister tell the committee what has happened to the proceeds of the sale of the Nor&#39; West Whaling Company Limited, to which some reference has been made this afternoon? It has been suggested that that money should be utilized for fisheries research. Can the Minister tell us what has happened to that money? </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> has asked for the value of fish imported into Australia. 1 understand that imports amount to about &#163;4,000,000 a year, or about 50 per cent, of the total Australian consumption. Let us be quite frank with ourselves about the fishing industry. A great deal has been said in criticism of the Government because there is a shortage of fish. Generally, that is a statement of fact; but I defy any honorable senator to stand up in his place and say that he has gone into a recognized fish shop in an established town and been refused a meal of fish because it was in short supply. 1 concede quite readily that with our growing population and diminishing fish resources the Government has an obligation to do what it can to solve this problem. In its wisdom, the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with the States, has established a council which, I believe, despite the rather uninterested approach to his responsibilities by the Queensland Minister, will be able to do a very worth-while and very necessary job in ensuring supplies of fish for the Australian people and reducing our annual expenditure on imports of fish by at least a portion of the &#163;4,000,000 that we spend now. </para>

            <para>.- I direct attention to the item relating to wheat industry stabilization, under which an appropriation of &#163;13,022,000 is sought.I wonder whether the Minister has at his command a statement showing all the transactions carried out this year that have required the Australian Wheat Board to call on the Government for a subsidy of that magnitude. Will the subsidy take the form of an advance to wheat-growers in anticipation of recovery when sales are made, or will it take the form of a straightout payment to the board, the money then being distributed to the growers and never recovered? The wheat stabilization scheme has thrown up for the first time the need for a subsidy, and the committee will agree that &#163;13,000,000, the amount sought, is a sizeable amount. It is asked for in a year of record crops and, I believe, of record sales. As a background, I should like to be told, if the Minister has the information at his command, whether the subsidy takes the form of an advance to wheat-growers or of a straight-out payment to the board. I should also like to know the circumstances that necessitate the payment of a subsidy this year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Perhaps the Minister would permit me to make one other comment. We are all taking a very keen interest in the sales  of  wheat by the board to Communist China. I follow these matters with such powers of understanding as I have, and very rarely do I voice complaints until I have seen that responsible opinion confirms my anxiety. I was disquieted theother day when I learned that the Export Payments Insurance Corporation had refused to stand behind the outstanding liability of the board in respect of the sales to Communist China. </para>

              <para>-  Before the suspension of the. sitting I was referring to the proposed vote for the subsidy of &#163;13,500,000 for the dairy industry. I think it is proper to ask the committee to consider the implications of the McCarthy committee&#39;s report in relation to the continuance of this subsidy. You will recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that the committee, after a very full investigation of the industry, reported in August, 1960, that a rather different attitude should be adopted to the dairy industry in the next decade from that which has been adopted in the past, and that a period of ten years should be set aside for a programme of what the committee called rehabilitation. This meant that a transition period should take place, commencing in the present year with the subsidy of &#163;13,500,000 we are now voting, the subsidy continuing at that amount until 1963-64, and then reducing over a period from 1964-65 to 1969-70 from &#163;13,500,000 to &#163;2,000,000. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The committee, considering the interests of the productivity of the industry, suggested that the. money be devoted not to a consumer subsidy as the present subsidy is but to the eradication of disease and the assistance of factors in the industry that would promote production. We are all interested in the idea of the elimination of subsidies as such, but there are two factors that I want to bring before the committee to-night which I think should receive the urgent consideration of the Minister and the Cabinet before these recommendations are adopted. The first matter I wish to bring before the committee is that in this industry, as in agricultural industries generally, the net farm income has become, relative to other sectors of the Australian economy, so low that it is doubtful whether it is wise politics to dispense with a consumer subsidy in the circumstances. In fact, we have reached the stage where the dairy industry requires the support not only of a subsidy of a consumer nature but also of a more generalized subsidy. </para>
          <para>The second thing that I think requires the most earnest consideration before this report is adopted is the probable impact of the European Common Market proposal, not upon primary industries generally in Australia, but particularly upon the dairy industry, which will be difficult to sustain if European economic unity is achieved. I ask the Minister, therefore, if he will be good enough to tell the committee what the Government&#39;s obligations to this industry are. Will he assure the industry that until June, 1962, the subsidy is assured, and that even if the McCarthy committee&#39;s proposals are adopted there will be no diminution of the subsidy before 1963-64. I am quite sure that the Government has obligated itself to the industry to a continuance of the subsidy for that period, but I ask the Minister if he would be good enough when replying to these comments to state that there is no doubt as to the continuance of the subsidy at least for that period. </para>

          <para class="block">The Government has an agreement with the State governments and the dairy industry which runs until 30th June, 1962. On 9th March last the Minister for Primary Industry announced the Government&#39;s intention to complete this agreement, and details of subsidy and pricing were subsequently announced by the Minister on 23rd June last. The substance of this announcement was that the Government would maintain the subsidy at &#163;13,500,000 for the final year of the stabilization agreement - the sixth year in which the subsidy has been paid at this level - and that butter and cheese prices in Australia would remain unchanged during 1961-62. </para>

            <para>. - In referring to Division No. 682, I wish to raise with the Minister problems affecting war service land settlement in Western Australia. My remarks are concerned particularly with the war service land settlement schemes in the areas known as Rocky Gully and Mount Many Peaks, in the southern part of the State. Mount Many Peaks is not far from the city of Albany. I do not intend to develop an argument on the matter at this stage because I do not think it is necessary to do so, but I propose to state briefly the situation in which the settlers find themselves. Most of the properties are gradually reaching the stage at which they will be fully developed. There is a belief current in the district, and held by many of the settlers, either that the properties have not sufficient carrying capacity or that the planned area under developed pasture, of approximately 600 acres, is not sufficient. In other words, the settlers believe that the planned area of pasture should be more than 600 acres, and that something should be done to enable them to run a greater number of sheep. The number of sheep that can be carried at present is not economic, having regard to present prices and costs of production. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having said that, I wish to refer to the corollary of that position; that is to say, the problem that will face the settlers in the future. Most of them have been on their properties for some years. Many of these settlers, who are men of a good type, are getting on in years. They have growing families and are concerned about the prices that ultimately will be charged for the properties, or the ultimate rental value, as the case may be. Therefore, they are concerned about their equity in the properties, and that, of course, is related to economic value and carrying capacity. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline> who is in charge of war service land settlement, visited Western Australia earlier this year and, in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> and me, spent a most interesting few days in that area discussing the projects with the settlers there. Their case was put to the Minister at that time. I am interested to know whether he has had an opportunity to review the matter, and whether he has arrived at any conclusions. I should also like to know whether he agrees that the problem as presented by the settlers in fact exists and, if so, how he thinks it might be solved. I assure the Minister that in the minds of the settlers they have a genuine difficulty. There are other minor problems which are not relevant at this stage. Basically, the matter is one of economics. I should be grateful if the Minister would state the views that the Government may have about the difficulties of these men who are doing such a fine job. </para>

            <para>. -  I am interested in the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent.</inline> I assure him that the problem does not apply only to Western Australia. The settlers who have been on properties for some years are now beginning to look to their security. When the. areas were subdivided originally, the acreage allowed to each settler was considered to be adequate to enable him to maintain a reasonable standard of living. However, with the reduction of prices that has occurred, the need has arisen either to increase the area or to increase the carrying capacity to enable the settler to derive a reasonable return. </para>

          <para>I think that the problem, by and large, involves economic security. It is more than fifteen years since World War II. ended, and I think it is fair for soldier settlers to ask about the position of their holdings and the amounts that they will have to pay either by way of permanent rental or purchase price. I am not by any means levelling any criticism in this matter. I am simply stating the view that we should let these men know where they stand. I wonder whether the Minister has any information he can give the committee as to the possibility of dealing with these properties on the basis of an economic rental or a purchase price which would enable the soldier settlers to make a reasonable living and to know where they stood. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> said, there are some very fine men on these properties. They have devoted a lot of time and hard work to improving the properties. There are some very fine soldier settlement areas in Tasmania, but wherever one goes the same problem arises. These people want to know where they stand. They want some sense of security. I was impressed by what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> said on this most interesting matter. </para>

            <para>.- 1 rise to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty&#39;s</inline> statement on soldier settlement. Some time ago he and I visited King Island in Bass Strait, where there are about 138 soldier settlers. We came away with the impression that most of these people were up against an impossible task in meeting their commitments. The Minister referred to the problem of regrowth. The areas were faultily cleared in the first place. This was ti-tree country. Most of the land was just turned over without being worked very much. Grass was sown, and ti-tree growth has come up with the grass. The department has spent a good deal of money in trying to eradicate that ti-tree growth. We found that these settlers have no possible chance of meeting their commitments. 1 believe that their case is urgent and that something should be done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>About ten years ago a committee of the State Parliament, which included at least three men who had had much experience in land development, after an investigation recommended that the blocks be let to the settlers at a fair rental. The position must be faced. The sooner it is faced, the better it will be. It is now sixteen years since the war ended. Some years .after World War I. there had to be a writing-down of values. This action is long overdue in respect of King Island. If these men are to stay on their properties with the security of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> spoke, there must be a substantial writing-down. I hope that the Minister will take notice of the comments that have been made. </para>
          <para>During the last twelve months the price of beef in Tasmania has fallen, probably by 35 or 40 per cent. The same position applies to King Island. It costs the settlers there approximately one-third of the price of a lamb to export it to the Melbourne market. I know that the State Government is involved. With the decline in primary production, if there is to be any resurgence amongst these settlers, their commitments must be substantially written down and they must be placed on a new basis. 1 believe that a reasonable basis would be that which was recommended by the committee ten years ago. </para>

              <para>-  From memory, about 200 acres for a dairy property and upwards of 600 acres for a sheep property. Most of it is borderline country, which the early settlers on the island did not bother about. They did not think that it was good enough to bother about. With the conclusion of the war, the department took it in hand, developed it to a certain extent, and placed soldier settlers on it. It cannot be over-emphasized that under existing conditions they have no earthly chance of meeting their commitments. </para>

            <para>. -  I think that every honorable senator would agree with the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico.</inline> Most of the people who were put on the land under this scheme were settled by the States with advances made by the Commonwealth. In some States the system was different, but the advances were made by the Commonwealth. There are some fine settlements of returned people up on the River Murray in South Australia. With the co-operation of the Commonwealth and the State, they have made a magnificent job of settling there, growing dried fruits and grapes. But to-day these people cannot meet their commitments. Only on very rare occasions is this because of being unable to produce the commodities from the land. That might be the position on King Island and in some other fringe areas, but it is not the case with these people on the River Murray. 1 think that the Commonwealth Government is to blame. I was pleased to hear Government supporters criticize the Government for its handling of soldier settlement. The Government has created difficulties for soldier settlers by its handling of the economy. The soldier settlers are producing goods for which they cannot find markets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> pointed out how costly it was to send goods from King Island to the Melbourne market. The same problem confronts all settlers. Many ex-servicemen have been settled on wheat-growing land. The amount of wheat grown to-day is much greater than was grown ten or fifteen years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> compared production in 1954 with production in 1959, and pointed out that although production had increased, less money was going into the pockets of the producers. That is the position in which the soldier settler finds himself to-day.  His  problem is not solely one of being on fringe land.  His  problem is accentuated by the state of the economy. The Government&#39;s credit squeeze has affected him detrimentally. Many settlers are unable to obtain overdrafts from the banks in order to buy necessary equipment for their properties. They are forced to seek finance from the hire-purchase companies, but they must pay high rates of interest on whatever money they obtain. They are worse off now than ever before. A searching inquiry should be made into the problems confronting soldier settlers. Representation on any committee set up to inquire into this matter should not be limited to members of the Government parties. It should be an all-party committee. The committee should inquire thoroughly into the position of soldier settlers in order to see whether legislation should be introduced to relieve their plight. </para>

            <para>. -  There is no simple solution to the problem mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent,</inline> I think it will be conceded that the land settlement schemes operated by the Commonwealth and the States after the Second World War compare more than favorably with the schemes that were introduced after the First World War. An essential ingredient of the schemes put into operation after the Second World War was that a reasonable living area should be made available to the settler. That precaution was not taken in the schemes that operated after the First World War, with the melancholy result that many returned servicemen were obliged to walk off their properties because they did not have a reasonable living area. But those who remained on the land ultimately were able to increase their holdings to a reasonable size. The problem mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> cannot be solved by increasing the size of the allotments now held because most of them are in well developed areas, and are producing. With the passage of time the settler is forced to look further afield. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> discuss with the Western Australian Government the closer settlement scheme now being developed in Victoria by the Victorian Government on the same lines as the soldier settlement scheme. When that scheme is finally under way, and is accommodating the land-hungry young men of the State at the same rate as the soldiers were settled, I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> will have a solution to his problem. </para>

            <para>. - I thank the Minister for his courtesy in endeavouring to answer the question that I put to him. I am well aware that this is a difficult matter. I am well aware that there may not be a short answer to it, particularly off the cuff in a debate such as this. I wish to say only one thing more about this matter, and I do not expect the Minister to deal with the aspect that I now raise. The problem of soldier settlement is complicated because the venture is a partnership between the Commonwealth, the State and the soldier settler. Nothing in this world is more frustrating to a participant in a scheme such as a soldier settlement scheme than to be told, when problems are raised, that the matter is not one coming within the scope of the Commonwealth; that it is a matter for the State. I know that at some point that must be done, but it should not be done to the settler. I feel that because the Commonwealth introduced this rehabilitation scheme of soldier settlement it has, despite the constitutional problems involved, a very strong moral responsibility  to  approach the States when something unfortunate happens. Something unfortunate is happening in Western Australia. The soldier settlers there are definitely not satisfied. They placed their problems fairly and squarely before the Minister for Primary Industry at Mount Barker some months ago. They put the position to him frankly and with no holds barred. They put to him four or five questions and problems. In all fairness, those questions should be answered. It would be a grave injustice if they were not answered fairly and squarely and those concerned were told to  go  elsewhere for an answer. Will the Minister for Air be courteous enough - I am sure he will be - to convey my remarks  to  the Minister for Primary Industry? Some time has elapsed since this problem was raised with the Minister. I repeat that in all fairness these very fine young men who are growing up - unfortunately, they are not so young now - are entitled to the courtesy of a reply. </para>

            <para>. - I refer to the proposed expenditure on Commonwealth elections and referendums under Division No. 239 - Electoral Branch. I note that this year &#163;420,000 has been allocated for this item, whereas the appropriation last year was &#163;10,000. I am quite aware, of course, that this tremendous increase is due to the forthcoming general election on 9th December. I should like to know from the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wade)</inline> whether matters raised by me some time ago during the normal question-time of the Senate have been attended to. At that time I referred to the condition of lighting in the polling booths. I indicated that I had received a number of complaints about the lighting and about the fact that many elderly people whose sight was failing were experiencing difficulty in marking ballot-papers, especially in the late afternoon and early evening. Has the Minister been able to have an inspection made of all places where polling is likely to take place? Is he thoroughly satisfied that the lighting will be adequate at the next election? </para>

Can the Minister assure honorable senators that at the forthcoming general election voters will not be inconvenienced by having to rest their ballot-papers on ledges with rough surfaces? </para>

            <para>.- I relate my remarks to Division No. 239 - Electoral Branch, sub-division 2, items 05 and 06. I ask the Minister for Air whether any special preparations are in train to publicize the correct method of voting for the Senate. Every member of the Senate - in fact, every member of the Parliament - &#39;knows that for years we have been complaining about the extraordinarily high number of informal votes which are recorded at Senate elections. I do not know of anything special having been done by the electoral authorities to try to remedy that situation. I ask whether they have anything in mind in an effort to remedy what is a very serious state of affairs. Large numbers of people now qualified to vote have come from countries where methods of voting are entirely different from ours. Those people have not been used to our system of voting, particularly in relation to the Senate. That is one reason for the very considerable number of informal votes that are recorded. </para>

              <para>- It is one reason. Therefore, I strongly urge the Electoral Branch to consult authorities experienced in these matters about the best way to publicize the correct method of voting for the Senate. I strongly urge the branch to use the newspaper columns for advertising and particularly to use television to illustrate the method of voting. Also, I strongly urge the branch to examine the desirability - I am not altogether sure about this myself - of printing instructions in a number of languages to indicate the correct method of voting to migrants. I believe that if we seriously want to do away with the scandal of the large number of informal votes we must do something positive to instruct the people. </para>

            <para>. - In New South Wales at the last federal election 248,000 informal votes were cast. If another 10,000 such votes had been cast, we would have had an &#34; informal &#34; here as a senator. The number of informal votes cast was very nearly equal to the quota required for a candidate to be successful. That is a very serious state of affairs in a democracy. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has said, the Government should try to educate the people in the method of casting a formal vote. There are several reasons why informal votes are cast. One is that a Senate candidate has not the same personal appeal as a candidate for election to the House of Representatives. The personal appeal of a candidate for election to the House of Representatives has an effect on the voter, but the Senate vote is almost impersonal. The result is that people are not so careful about the manner in which they vote for Senate candidates. They do not think it is particularly important for them to cast a formal vote; so they do not try. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Moreover, on both sides of the political fence there is not the same party drive to ensure that formal votes are cast for the Senate as there is behind the campaign for candidates seeking election to the House of Representatives. Even in the experience of the Australian Labour Party, one can go into areas where a great campaign is being conducted on behalf of the candidate for the lower House but only a secondary interest is being taken in the Senate election. </para>

              <para>- I am not in favour of abolishing the Senate while 1 am a member of it. When I came into the Senate I was asked whether I was the youngest senator. I replied. &#34; Yes, in years of service&#34;. I was then asked, &#34; What is your ambition?&#34; And I answered, &#34; To become the oldest senator &#34;. The abolition of the Senate is improbable. We of the Labour Party know that quite a few hurdles have to be surmounted before the Senate can be abolished. In the meantime we have to get the best possible vote for it. I believe that the same duty applies to the Liberal Party and, to an extent, to the Democratic Labour Party, although sometimes those parties have the advantage of being first on the ballot-paper. I believe that drawing for positions on the ballot-paper is a very good idea, lt is a pity that it could not be done in the House of Representatives elections. The Australian Labour Party would have a greater chance of winning then. </para>

          <para>I believe that in the interests of all parties we should do something to educate the people to cast a formal Senate vote. Liberal Party candidates are in the same position as Labour Party candidates.  A  Senate candidate has not the same kind of campaign behind him as a House of Representatives candidate has. Of course, the party machine puts out the publicity, but a Senate candidate still has to get the active support of the people in the branches and the districts who often have their interests centred in the House of Representatives candidate, and not always in the Senate team. Therefore, I believe that in all sections of a political campaign the inclination of all party machines is to forget the Senate. </para>
          <para>I suggest that it is the duty of the Government to supply the funds and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> said, to develop a campaign, designed to get the largest possible formal vote for the Senate. It is scandalous that 248,000 people in New South Wales voted informally in a democratic system of government. I think the figures in the other States would show a similar proportion of informal votes. I see nothing wrong with the Government expending money to ensure the casting of formal votes. The Labour Party would be prepared, as it always is, to abide by the result. We think that every person should cherish the vote. Those people who do not cherish it enough to vote formally should be given some assistance if they are voting informally because of ignorance. I commend that idea to the Minister. </para>

In addition to the normal provision under that item, provision is also made for the salaries of telephonists on loan from the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department - that is, an amount of &#163;21,230  -  and for initial installation costs in the Commonwealth Offices, Wharf-street.

            <para>. -  I enter this debate after having listened to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde,</inline> and to the Minister&#39;s reply in regard to matters under Division No. 239, sub-division 2, item 06. I feel impelled to enter the debate very briefly because I do not accept the Minister&#39;s contention that the basic reason for the informality of votes, which has become quite a problem in our electoral system to-day, stems almost solely from a lack of political education. I believe that that is a contributing cause, but perhaps we are overlooking the real cause. That is the complex nature of the ballot-paper itself. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Voting for the Senate is a formidable task even for anybody who has had a reasonable degree of political education. An elector has to vote for anything up to  26  candidates on a Senate ballot-paper, not necessarily consecutively, or in the order in which their names appear on the ballotpaper. I understand that that method has been termed by a newspaper reporter the &#34; donkey vote &#34; or the &#34; unthinking vote &#34;. A person who wants to cast a vote, in accordance with his beliefs as to the proper order of the parties, on nearly every occasion has to start somewhere near the middle of the ballot-paper. There he votes for the team of his choice, the team which he hopes will be returned. Then, in order to follow his party&#39;s requirements in respect of the remainder of the paper, having in mind the necessity for validity, he has to jump to another group and then back to another. That is a formidable task even for a person in full possession of his faculties and with all the political knowledge that is required. </para>
          <para>In my view, political parties should not content themselves with placing the blame for informal votes on factors that are not basic to the problem. If we accept that it is a formidable task for a person at the height of his mental form, so to speak, to cast a formal vote, we must accept that it is a much more difficult task for old people and for people with poor sight, having regard to the ill-lit places in which votes are cast. We should be directing our thoughts to the question of voting reform. I did not know until recently that in the United States of America - a country which is a pioneer in many fields - a person can vote for a party by electing to do so, or may vote according to a series of ballots associated with State elections, as the Americans know them, or with the federal elections at which a  president  is chosen. In America, by electing to support the party for which he wishes to vote, a person can cast a valid vote without having to face the mental hazards and other hazards arising from the necessity to put consecutive numbers on a ballot-paper. I believe that we should be working along those lines rather than that we should be reflecting on the mental ability of people who cast informal votes. </para>

              <para>- Then let me say that there was a reflection on their educational standards. I do not want to misquote the Minister. The problem could be solved to some extent by doing something which, unfortunately, is not done in most of our public schools. If lessons in electoral procedure were given to school children, when the children attained voting age they would perhaps be better equipped to avoid some of the pitfalls presented by our present voting system. However, the final solution to the problem will not be found in that. </para>

However, as I have said, I do not think the final solution to the problem will be found in such lessons. I believe it will be found in voting reform. I suggest that we study the American system. I do not say that we should adopt that system in its entirety, but some aspects of it could well be considered by this Parliament. If we adopt the attitude that the casting of an informal vote is due only to a lack of political education, we shall not be grappling as we should with this vexed problem. </para>

            <para>. - For the Minister&#39;s benefit, let me say that I shall relate my remarks to Division No. 239  -  Electoral Branch. It is rather interesting to note that yesterday the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said that members of the Opposition, lazy and incompetent, wasted time during the last sessional period in discussing an electoral bill and that to-night a great amount of time is being devoted to a discussion of electoral matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When the electoral bill to which the Leader of the Government referred was being discussed, members of the Opposition tried to persuade the Government to agree that polling booths should be closed at 6 p.m., but the Government, acting completely unreasonably, irrationally and irresponsibly, would not accept that suggestion, nor would it agree that, if voting were to continue until 8 p.m., better lighting facilities should be provided in polling booths. I believe that inadequate lighting is responsible in no small measure for the fact that so many informal votes are cast. </para>
          <para>I refer next to Division No. 233  -  Real Estate Management. I ask the Minister: For what purposes will the sum of &#163;334,000 that is sought be used? </para>

I ask: How much of that money will be paid to people who supervise the bridges that have been constructed or are being constructed in preparation for the lake that is to be provided for Canberra?

            <para>. -  Prompted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey&#39;s</inline> very interesting contribution to the debate, I want to make brief reference to Division No. 239. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> very often, but I find myself in complete agreement with him in his diagnosis on this occasion, and probably every one in the chamber is in agreement with him. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> really agreed with the Minister. They expressed themselves in different ways but they both agreed substantially on the causes of the problem presented by the great number of informal votes now cast. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> will agree with me when I say that many informal votes are cast because of the emotional stress that an elector feels when going into a polling booth. I have been concerned with elections for many years, and I have come to the conclusion that there is a degree of emotional stress involved in casting a vote. Old ladies or, for that matter, many young ladies and people of the other sex become quite nervous in a polling booth. I believe that, in considering the problem of informal voting, we must start from there. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When you peruse the informal votes that have been cast you can come only to one conclusion, which is that a great many of them are due to honest mistakes made because people are emotionally disturbed or excited by the process of recording a vote, particularly when they have to write down a series of figures from one to 24 or one to 27, not necessarily in the order in which the names of the candidates appear. I think that is the chief reason for informal voting. You can put it down perhaps to lack of intelligence or lack of education. I do not think the reasons are important. </para>

              <para>- Or lack of concentration. There are many reasons. How often do you find a ballot-paper marked starting with the figures 1, 2 and 3, missing the figure 4, and continuing with the figures 5, 6, 7, &#38;c? I have seen many of them. 1 do not think that a great proportion of these informal votes can be corrected, because people have trouble in adding from I to 27 and putting the numbers down in the correct form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> postulated an answer to this problem. He suggested the American system of pushing buttons. With very great respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> I do not agree with him. I think we would have as many, or more, informal votes with that system as we have now. Let us transpose our problems into the American system. Electors would need to push some 5, 6 or 7 buttons in a given order. That would mean you would need to have a &#34; how to vote &#34; card showing the buttons and showing the order in which they have to be pressed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> may be right and I may be wrong, but with great respect to him I suggest that that would present just as great a mental hazard as writing down the numbers. </para>

              <para>- They will not register an informal vote, but they will register a wrong vote. If there were six or seven groups on the ballot-paper you would have to inform the elector of the buttons to be pressed and the order in which they were to be pressed. There would be a number of combinations. I am not a mathematician, but it would be factorial seven. That gives you a great number of numbers. You could have a very high incidence of potential error by pressing buttons in the wrong order. You might even put a D.L.P. candidate in. </para>

          <para>I do not think that the Hare Clark system related to the American automatic system of button pushing would work. I think we have to face this problem realistically. The only answer is probably the long answer; I do not think there is a short answer to the problem. I think that the long answer is a long, and perhaps tortuous, system of education. It may take several generations. There is no quick solution to the problem of how to cut down to a reasonable minimum the number of informal votes. Schools could play their part, and I think that political parties could do more about the problem than they are doing. I was interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde&#39;s</inline> thesis. Political parties should approach the proposition of voting for the Senate by emphasizing the need of electors to vote for every candidate on the ballotpaper. </para>

              <para>- With great respect, I think it is definately incidental. I do not see how I can talk about elections unless I talk about political parties. I am merely carrying the argument a little bit further than members of the Opposition did. If I am not in order, neither were members of the Opposition. However, I shall conclude by saying that I feel a long process of education is needed. I do not think that any of the parties devote sufficient time to the education of electors along the lines I have suggested, namely, the insistence that electors must vote for every one on the ballot-paper. </para>

          <para>Let me make one more suggestion before I conclude. Perhaps the chief ballot clerk at each polling place could issue certain instructions when handing out Senate ballotpapers. He could be requested to tell even elector to whom he hands a ballot-paper something to this effect, &#34; This is a Senate ballot-paper. You must vote for every candidate on the ballot-paper. Do you understand that? &#34; Perhaps that could be said to each elector as he receives a ballotpaper. That is something I pass on to the Minister for his consideration. After all there is no reason why such a suggestion could not be made to each elector in exactly the same way as an elector is asked, &#34; Your name and address? &#34;, and &#34; Have you voted before? &#34; Those are questions that are put to electors, and I think a further instruction could be given namely, &#34; You must vote in order of preference for every name on the paper &#34;. There are many other ways to help but I will not go into them. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> that a complete switch to the American system is the short answer to the problem, or is any answer to the problem. Nor do I agree with the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> that it is the Government&#39;s responsibility to cater for the various national groups who come to Australia. </para>

I do not agree with him that the duty of remedying the situation lies with political parties or with the schools. I have been a teacher and I know that children would be taught the method of voting at about the age of twelve years. They would probably be taught it in one lesson of about 40 minutes. It is asking a lot to suggest that the schools, in 40 minutes, should teach twelve-year-old children something which they will not apply until they have reached the age of 21. </para>

            <para>. -  I wish to put forward a suggestion which I think could help to solve some of the difficulties associated with this matter, and consequently reduce the expenditure involved in Senate elections. It has always seemed to me that an elector faces a very difficult task when he has to place figures against 27 or 28 names on a ballotpaper, many of the names being quite unfamiliar to him. I can understand that bis interest tends to wane after he has placed figures opposite half the names. In Western Australia, for many years there were several individuals who stood for election on every possible occasion, whether the election was for the Senate, the municipal council, the roads board or anything else. They had a perfect right as citizens to stand for election, but the fact that they did so made the ballot-paper much more confusing. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When there is a large number of candidates, or if there are, say, only five vacancies to be filled by the candidates, surely a person who states his preference for five or more candidates makes his intention clear. If it were provided that candidates who voted for one more than the number of vacancies would record formal votes, there would be a much greater number of formal votes. In addition, it would mean an end to the practice of declaring informal ballot-papers on which electors had voted for 26 of the 28 candidates, but had failed to place figures alongside the names of the remaining two candidates. In Western Australia, there is always a large number of informal votes. When I was a teacher we taught the need for civic responsibility. We carried out class elections to teach students the way to vote. The subject was not taught in a special lesson of 40 minutes. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> many of the things that we learn at school are never used by us afterwards. For instance, I remember learning how long it would take to fill a bath and pull out the plug. The fact that a subject that is taught at school will not be used for some years is not sufficient reason for failing to teach it. A great deal more could be done in our schools to teach civic responsibility. The actual use of the machinery of voting comes later after civic responsibilities have been assumed by those who have become adults. </para>

            <para>.- I understand that the main responsibility for civil defence lies with the States. This is a very serious matter. As the defence of this country is in the hands of the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth should do more than it is doing in regard to civil defence. The United States Government is spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars on civil defence, because it appreciates the danger from the possibility of nuclear war. I should like the Minister to explain why last year only &#163;112,200 was expended. I understand that there is a school at Mount Macedon, to which prominent and interested men from the States go for lectures, after which they return to their States; but very little has been done. </para>

          <para>Recently, I saw in the publication &#34;Newsweek&#34; an illustration of an underground shelter built by a man named Davis. He was sitting in the shelter with his family, and there was a gun on the table. In the accompanying letterpress were printed the ideas of a number of men of religious persuasion. The question was whether a man who built a shelter which would house only so many people would have the right to use a gun on any others who sought to enter. One individual was asked whether he would use a gun on a child outside the shelter after he had closed the door. One religious authority said that any one would be perfectly in order in shooting people who wanted to enter. Another said that it might be necessary for a man to sacrifice his own family. There is considerable interest in the subject in America. Private enterprise there is making a lot of money from building shelters. Whether the shelters will be of real service, I do not know. However, that is all by the way. </para>
          <para>I ask the Minister whether there is any possibility that the Government will accept its responsibility and do more in the future than it has done in the past in regard to this very important matter. </para>

            <para>.- I note that although an amount of &#163;300,000 was allocated last year for this purpose, only &#163;112,000 was expended, but it is again proposed that &#163;300,000 be appropriated. I should like to know why this is so. I am interested in the constitutional position in relation to civil defence. I understand that one State Premier disclaims any responsibility whatever for it. What view does the Government take of the constitutional position? What authoritative opinions support the view that this is a State responsibility? This is a matter that should be cleared up. We should know definitely upon whom the responsibility rests. There is some doubt as to whether civil defence should come under the general defence policy of the Commonwealth or under State jurisdiction. </para>

            <para>. -  Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico,</inline> I am surprised that so little of the allocation was expended last year. I have had letters from various bodies in Western Australia which are interested in civil defence, complaining that owing to lack of finance a full civil defence programme could not be executed. This was one of the reasons given for so little being done in this direction. Quite, a number of country roads boards and shire councils have written to me, expressing fears that our civil defence policy is lacking in many respects. They want a more vigorous policy to be pursued. The reason given to them for lack of such a policy is lack of finance. Yet before us to-night is the fact that last year &#163;300,000 was allocated for the purpose, not half of it was spent, and a similar allocation is proposed for this year. Is this something automatic? Is this a token civil defence, to assuage the doubts or fears of a few people, or is civil defence really worth while? Are we to make a worth-while project of it? If so, we must spend a great deal more each year than &#163;300,000. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> sought particulars of the amount spent last year. The expenditure was involved in running the civil defence school at Mount Macedon, Victoria, on salaries and wages, catering for students, travelling expenses, &#38;c. The unexpended balance was &#163;184,000. This was to allow assistance to the States for civil defence. So far as I am able to ascertain from the. director, no firm decision has yet been reached as to the form that this assistance will take. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> asked whether the States have a responsibility in regard to this matter. They have both responsibilities and rights. I should not like to leave the committee with the thought that this matter, which is of some moment to the people of Australia, is passing backwards and forwards between State and Federal authorities with the idea of avoiding a difficult decision. The information I have is that progress is being made towards defining the fields of responsibility and it is hoped that some conclusions will be reached in the near future. </para>

            <para>. -  I should like to say a few words on this matter. One way and another there is a fair bit of loose talk about it. This is sponsored by the press and, unfortunately, highlighted by an irresponsible section of the press. We must have clear in our minds what we mean by civil defence. When we have a look at the problem, it boils down to this: Every instrumentality and every service that is necessary for the co-ordination of our civil defence force is a service or instrumentality of the States. Take the railways and the transport services. They are manned, controlled and directed by the States. Take the problem of dispersion of population in time of crisis. That can be done by the State transport services. The Commonwealth has no railways running through New South Wales. New South Wales owns the railways within its borders. The obligation is on the States to accept their responsibilities in relation to these elements of civil defence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Assume that in a time of grave crisis certain areas of population had to be evacuated. The people evacuated must be accommodated somewhere. That is clearly a matter for the States. Only the States can deal with that matter. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some of the services associated with civil defence. Take the fire services. The fire brigades are controlled directly by the States. The States own those services, lt is useless to try to pretend in this chamber or elsewhere thai those services are, in some mysterious way, the responsibility of the Commonwealth. They are State responsibilities. You cannot get away from that fact. In time of crisis problems will arise concerning the supply of water. This again is a matter for the States. Hospital treatment and the provision of first-aid services are clearly matters for the States. The Commonwealth does not maintain hospitals or first-aid services. Those are State services. Everybody knows that. It is silly to talk about Commonwealth responsibilities in relation to such services. </para>
          <para>Take the matter of the education of the people in time of crisis. That is obviously something that can be handled only by the States. Apart from the constitutional factors, one can see why the States accept their responsibilities in relation to civil defence. </para>
          <para>There is one level only at which the Commonwealth operates in civil defence. The Commonwealth is responsible for the higher control and direction of our civil defence services. At some stage during a crisis it will be obvious that the Commonwealth must direct and control all these services, each of which remains, however, the responsibility of the States. At the higher level the Commonwealth must of necessity accept responsibility. I have complete confidence in this Government. 1 am sure that it is planning for the coordination of our civil defence services. I am quite certain that those plans have in the main already been formulated. To come into this chamber and say that the Commonwealth is wholly responsible for civil defence is foolish. Such a statement must do immense harm, and indicates that the speakers concerned have a very inadequate knowledge of the subject. </para>

              <para>- I relate my remarks to the appropriation of &#163;300,000. Last year, &#163;112,200 was spent under this division. 1 join issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> for some of the remarks that he made on the responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States with regard to civil defence. Whilst I concede that in theory the States have all the responsibility, I reject the argument that in fact the responsibility lies anywhere other than with the Commonwealth government. For instance, if it were suggested that this country would be involved in a war, necessitating the use of whatever facilities we had for civil defence, the responsibility would immediately fall on the Commonwealth under national security regulations. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> that during the last war, whilst in theory the States carried out certain functions in regard to civil defence by using the police forces and certain other sections of the community, in fact the directing force was the Commonwealth government, as it would have to be whenever danger threatened this country. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline>claimed that responsibility for civil defence rested mainly with the States. I submit that where the power lies so too the responsibility lies. The power of collecting money lies with the Commonwealth. If any major amount of money is to be spent on civil defence - I think a large amount should be spent - that expenditure must come in some way from the Commonwealth Treasury. Nothing will convince me that if the Commonwealth is prepared to spend, say, &#163;1,000,000 on civil defence it will not want from the States assurances as to how that money will be spent. </para>
          <para>Civil defence is a most important matter. Improper motives should not be imputed to honorable senators from this side of the chamber who raise this matter. Civil defence is in the forefront of the minds of many Australian citizens to-day. It is very much in the minds of Americans to-day. I read recently that many Americans are building shelters in which to escape the consequences of an atomic war. Some of them have even gone to the extent of stocking their shelters with provisions. It may be said that their actions amount to hysteria, but nevertheless it is obvious that in the minds of many Americans there is a great fear that in the not-too-far-distant future they will need a great deal of protection. Let us not ignore the possibility not only of large numbers of persons having to go underground to avoid destruction from the air but also of whole cities having to go underground to escape the effects of fall-out if somebody is silly enough to trigger off an atomic war. </para>
          <para>This debate should not be limited. There should be no intimidation. It should not be suggested that when someone raises this matter he is striking at the defence of Australia or is saying something which should not be said. We should be afforded every opportunity to express our views on this subject. My view is that the sum of &#163;300,000 which is to be appropriated for the current financial year is not nearly sufficient. Because of the division of responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States, proper steps are not being taken to deal with civil defence. I should like the Minister to say whether there have been any conferences between the Commonwealth and the States to co-ordinate civil defence activities. I should like to know what the Government proposes for the future, bearing in mind that the expenditure of &#163;300,000 will be no more than a drop in the ocean. These are matters upon which honorable senators should be informed. Having been so informed, we can only regard that as being a stepping off point for further discussion and probing of the matter. </para>

Many conferences have been held. I am informed that we seem to be approaching a solution of the outstanding points of difference between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to their spheres of influence.

At least he tries to answer questions and not to avoid the issue. I ask him: Where does the responsibility of the Government commence and end? Does it end with the appropriation of &#163;300,000? If it so desired, could not the Government increase its appropriation to &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;10,000,000?

          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> has pointed out, in time of war the Commonwealth Government takes the fullest responsibility for the defence of Australia. It does the same in peace-time. The Commonwealth has constitutional power to deal with defence. Does not the defence of Australia include the defence of its men, women and children? It is a matter of defending not only property but also the lives of our people. It is quite possible that in the near future there will be a minor war in which nuclear weapons will be used, <inline font-style="italic">la</inline> that event, a properly organized system of civil defence would save thousands of lives. </para>
          <para>I direct the attention of the Minister for Air to the fact that a year or two after the bombing raids on Darwin during the last war a commissioner was appointed to inquire into circumstances surrounding the event. The commissioner pointed out in his report that if there had been proper organization in Darwin the effect of the bombing would have been quite different. Any one who reads the report of the commissioner will realize what a tragedy the whole business was. 1 shall not go into all the details, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> because I know that you know your duty and that you will stop me. I repeat that if there had been a thorough civil defence organization at Darwin a good deal of the trouble that occurred would have been averted. If we look ahead now and provide a complete organization for the defence of our people in the event of war, thousands of lives will be saved. The Government has a responsibility to provide this organization. To-night I have listened to various speakers pass the buck. Evidently the Minister for Air is attempting to pass the buck, too. The Government has passed the buck. I repeat that civil defence is the Government&#39;s responsibility, lt is time it woke up to that responsibility. </para>

It did not hesitate to use those powers during the last emergency. But I remind honorable senators that to-day the responsibilities and powers of the Commonwealth Government are limited.

            <para>. - I refer to Division No. 766, sub-division 4, item 23, City Omnibus Service - subsidy (for payment to the credit of the Australian Capital Territory Transport Trust Account). I live in a city in which bus and tram fares were increased recently. Those bus and tram services receive no subsidy; there is no fund from which the city council can subsidize bus and tram fares. Of course, it could allow the old fares to continue to operate and later meet the deficit from its general revenue. I ask the Minister whether the &#163;62,000 provided under this item by way of subsidy is to make good the losses which may be incurred by the Canberra bus service. If that is so, the Government will have to admit that the Estimates are prepared loosely. 1 understand that any losses incurred in running the buses are made good from the Australian Capital Territory Transport Trust Account. In that case, this amount is not a subsidy, but an amount included in the Estimates to make good losses. That is the way it appears to me. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not want to let my remarks end there; nor do I want to stray from the estimates under consideration. The other day, when the committee was dealing with other votes, I mentioned that similar items are included elsewhere in the Estimates. There is a similar item in respect of Darwin. Possibly, if we looked at the estimates for Port Moresby we would find a similar item. This is the position: The people who use the bus service in Canberra are in a more fortunate position than people in the capital cities and other cities in which buses run. The problem is to keep the buses running. I am sure that everybody knows that at present one of the greatest burdens imposed on local authorities is to keep their transport services going. All their transport services are showing losses. Certainly those services are not in the very favorable position in which the Canberra bus service is. It may be difficult for the Minister to give me a reply to this question: Are the fares charged in Canberra economic? If they are, why is this provision made? Last year, the appropriation was &#163;62,000, and &#163;60,000 was spent. </para>

I wonder whether the Minister is able to state the area of parks and gardens and recreation reserves in Canberra to which that appropriation applies. 1 also refer to sub-division 4, item 12, Swimming pools - maintenance. The appropriation this year is &#163;13,000, which is slightly less than the expenditure last year. Can the Minister tell me whether the swimming pools in Canberra pay their way? They were built under a different system from that adopted in other municipalities where the ratepayers build their own pools.

Last year, the appropriation was &#163;8,000, and &#163;7,000 was spent. Of course, subsidies are paid by the Government for the building of aged people&#39;s homes outside of the Australian Capital Territory. I ask the Minister whether this subsidy is similar to those subsidies, or is it a subsidy for the operation of those homes? </para>

              <para>- Exactly. Is this appropriation compatible with its responsibilities? The time has arrived when the citizens of Canberra should be given the opportunity to assume full civic responsibility. Some of the appropriations that have been queried already would not appear in the Estimates at all if this city had full civic status and the citizens themselves were responsible for the expenditure involved in civic administration and providing the amenities and services which are provided by the civic bodies in other capital cities. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I realize, however, that the position of Canberra is very different from that of the State capital cities. Canberra is an artificial city which has grown up because the seat of government is here. It is still in the process of growth. Over the last ten years its growth has been phenomenal. Notwithstanding those circumstances, the Government has to face the fact that the time is coming when the citizens of Canberra must be given a greater share in the government of their city. That, of course, will entail greater financial responsibility for them. I do not suggest for one moment that they will ever be able to undertake the whole of the financial responsibility for Canberra because there are certain things in this city which are here because it is the National Capital. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Advisory Council is only a token body and has no real responsibility. That is not because its members are not able and willing to carry responsibility, but because they are not given the responsibility to carry. I should like the Advisory Council to have much more responsibility, and the same status as civic bodies in the other capital cities. </para>
          <para>Then I turn to item 27, which relates to cultural and community activities. That, again, is an item of expenditure that would not appear here if Canberra had its own civic authorities. The appropriation fo: this purpose last year was &#163;21,800, of which &#163;20,718 was spent, and this year the proposed vote is only &#163;6,800. Has the necessity for cultural and community activities ceased, has the standard of cultural activities dropped, or what has happened? The proposed vote this year is about one-third of the expenditure last year. </para>
          <para>I refer next to the section of Division No. 766 dealing with education. I see there an item relating to secondary school bursaries. Are those bursaries given to enable children from primary schools in the Territory to attend secondary schools in the Territory? I hope that that is so, because the schools here are of a very high standard. As a matter of fact, the beautiful school buildings are the subject of envy by people who live in the States. I sometimes wonder whether we are spending too much on buildings and not enough on teacher training, teachers&#39; salaries and so on, but that is by the way. </para>
          <para>In the same section of Division No. 766 there is an item dealing with payments to the Department of Education, New South Wales, for services rendered. The proposed vote for that purpose is &#163;715,000. These payments are for the services  of  teachers, for teacher training and so on. 1 consider that the time has come when this Territory should have its own teacher training college. We know that the teacher training colleges established in all the other capital cities of Australia are overcrowded. The colleges in Western Australia are definitely overcrowded; there are too many students and they cannot be trained adequately. That lack of training, of course, is felt in the schools. In Canberra there is the Australian National University, with the School of Advanced Studies and the School of General Studies. We have in this city some of the best professional brains in Australia and elsewhere. I think the establishment of a teacher training college in Canberra would be well justified. It would provide teachers for the schools in the Territory, and the cost would be offset to some extent by a reduction of the payments being made to the Department of Education in New South Wales, which now provides the teachers in the schools here. </para>
          <para>Referring still to Division No. 766, I notice in sub-division 4 the item, &#34; To recoup the State of N.S.W. for payments under the Child Welfare Act and in maintenance of juvenile offenders and mental patients in State institutions, &#163;40,000&#34;. The appropriation last year was &#163;28,000 and the expenditure was &#163;38,000. I should like to know whether there has been any subdivision of that amount, and whether the Minister could tell us what was spent on the maintenance of juvenile offenders and what was spent in respect of mental patients in State mental institutions. If we can believe all that we read in books on psychology, and if environment does play a part in the building of character and determines whether children will be delinquents or otherwise, I do not think there should be many delinquents in Canberra. If children anywhere get a good go from the authorities, those in Canberra do. The schools and other buildings used by children in this city are of a very high standard. </para>

            <para>. - I refer to Division No. 776- Health Services, item 02, &#34; Health and dental services, &#163;58,700 &#34;. I remind the Minister that on 19th November, 1959, 1 suggested that the Government should consult immediately with the States with  a  view to having an Australia-wide dental health survey made by a competent person or persons. Two such surveys have been made on a State basis, one by Barnard in New South Wales, and one by Halikis in Western Australia. The results of those surveys, when made public, came as a terrific shock to the people who take an interest in dental health. They showed that the average fourteen-year-old child in New South Wales had thirteen cariesaffected teeth. In the six-year age group, only five children in every 100 had healthy teeth. The story is a frightening  one.  In the seven-year age group, only two children in every 100 had healthy teeth, and in the eight-year group only one child in every 200 had healthy teeth. </para>

              <para>- I find myself in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> on dental health, but that is about the only subject on which 1 do agree with him. The Halikis survey covered the first permanent tooth that appears in a child&#39;s mouth - that is the molar. Within from six to twelve months after the first appearance of those teeth, for every 100 children eleven teeth had to be extracted. Those children kept their first permanent teeth for only six months. In the seven-year age group, for every 100 children in Western Australia 38 of the first permanent teeth were extracted. In the twelve-year age group, 109 of those teeth had to be extracted for every 100 children. I make another appeal to the Minister to consult with the Minister for Health and request him to ask the Government to cause a survey of dental health to be made. 1 am convinced that the results of that survey would so shock the Government that it would consider doing something about the dental health of the nation. </para>

              <para>asked also about the reduction in the amount made available for cultural and community activities in Canberra. The reduction is due to the fact that an amount of &#163;15,000 was provided for the Police Boys Club in 1960-61, and this is not included in the vote for 1961-62. Secondary school bursaries are provided at primary and intermediate standards, and a special bursary is provided for children living in remote areas inside and outside the Australian Capital Territory. The honorable senator referred also to expenditure under  the Child Welfare Act. I am in a position to inform her that the estimate for 1960-61 was &#163;28,000, the actual expenditure, &#163;38,375, and that this years estimate is based on the latter figure. The provision includes the salary and expenses of a child welfare officer in Canberra. The break-up of the expenditure for mental and other institutions is not available at the moment. If the honorable senator would like the information I shall obtain it for her. As the population of Canberra is increasing, expenditure of this nature must also increase. </para>

            <para>. -  I refer to Division No. 766, subdivision 5, item 08, Payments to the Department of Education, New South Wales, for services rendered. I think that the present system has worked extremely well and that it would be premature to alter it at the moment. I believe that this Territory should have its own system but I do not want to see a generalized control of all the Territories by a centralized department here in Canberra. I think, therefore, that the setting up of an educational system in the Australian Capital Territory might be deferred until the government of the Territory has been decentralized. When this city has its own governing body, then I think it should have its own educational system. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline>referred to the setting up of a teachers&#39; college. It would be admirable to have a teachers&#39; college of the ordinary type, but I am quite satisfied with the teachers&#39; colleges of New South Wales, which are very well conducted. For that matter, the teachers&#39; colleges of all the States are well conducted, but I know those in New South Wales much better. Earlier in this sessional period, or it may have been during the previous sessional period, in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, J made the suggestion that attached to the Australian National University should be a teachers&#39; college for secondary teachers. I pointed out as an example the Ecole Normale Sup&#233;rieure in the French system, a school infinitely higher in standard than any that we have in Australia. </para>

          <para>The Senate should also examine the items of the estimates to see that there is integrity between the expenditure and the vote. I wish to refer to the item mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn,</inline> namely, the subsidy amounting to  &#163;62,000  that is paid in respect of municipal transport in the Australian Capital Territory. This information has been retailed throughout the capital cities of Australia. Why should metropolises establish transport systems for public conveyance by means other than a local vote? If the fares do not meet the expenditure, let the difference be made up from local rates instead of from the taxes paid by the general taxpayer. </para>
          <para>I rise to support the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney.</inline> We are asked to vote more than  &#163;5,000,000  for the purpose 1 have mentioned. In other words, the Australian taxpayers are to be taxed to sustain the Canberra community. I have referred to garbage services. The time has arrived for this community of between  50,000  and  60,000  people to embrace the opportunity, using the political language of Sena&#39;.or Tangney, to adopt the responsibilities of self-governing citizenship and, I think, the corresponding responsibility of raising rates to pay for the services it needs. I admit that a distinction should be made between expenditure of a national character in the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian Capital Territory and that of a local character. If the aspirations of taxpayers in every quarter of the Commonwealth are represented worthily in this Parliament, it will be our privilege to vote sums for the provision in the Australian Capital Territory of amenities and structures which express the national tradition. The people of this community are privileged in many respects. During a recent debate in this chamber on the subject of rents for Canberra houses, we heard that the&#62; enjoyed an advantage over the general taxpayers in the method of assessment of rent. </para>

            <para>. - I think that some misapprehension may be creeping into the debate. It has been suggested that the residents of Canberra do not pay rates and taxes. They do pay rates and taxes, and the amounts collected go into Consolidated Revenue. The question whether they should have a local system of government or whether they should continue to be governed as at present is a matter for debate, &#34;but in fairness to the people of Canberra, I think it should be made known that last year they paid &#163;1,660,000 in rent, &#163;364,000 in rates, &#163;180,000 in motor registration fees, and so on. While it can be argued with a good deal of justification that Canberra is a favoured city, inasmuch as its omnibus services are subsidized, even those least interested in the system that is adopted must readily agree that there are associated with the National Capital factors which are not associated with other cities of comparable size. Canberra covers a vast area. There are no main thoroughfares such as those that are generally regarded as the business centres of a community. The suburbs are scattered over a wide area, and a great deal of travelling is involved for people who are required to live here in order to serve the citizens of Australia. I do not think it is quite fair to suggest that they are enjoying privileges to which they are not in any way entitled. </para>

            <para>- I respect the Minister. I merely ask: What is embraced by the proposed expenditure of &#163;11,000,000 by the National Capital Development Commission? Last year, the amount expended was almost &#163;11,000,000. Approximately &#163;20,000,000 is to be expended on the Australian Capital Territory this year, and that rate of expenditure seems disproportionate in relation to other national responsibilities. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> I agree that we must accept a measure of responsibility for expenditure of a national character in the Australian Capital Territory. I have posed a question, and I do hope that the Minister will not distort the position as did the Leader of the Government in the Senate yesterday. </para>

            <para>.- We are asked to note expenditure of &#163;13,929,000 for capital works and services in the Australian Capital Territory. Included in that amount is the sum of &#163;11,000,000 for the National Capital Development Commission. I think the Minister should inform us of the works proposed by the commission that will absorb this amount. I am concerned about the fact that the amount of expenditure proposed for this Territory is disproportionate, by all relevant standards, to the need for development in outlying Territories. It is most important to try to repel the idea, which I know has been a comforting thought for generations, that if you want good bread you should live near the bakehouse. I am speaking for the provinces. </para>

            <para>.- I refer to Division  711,  Other Services, item <inline font-style="italic">04,</inline> &#34; Radio- Frequency Allocation Review Committee - Expenses  - &#163;1,418&#34;.  I want to ask the Minister in charge of the committee a few questions in respect of that report. In doing so, I point out that I believe, that the report which the committee has made- is an excellent one. The committee has pointed to the very many difficulties which exist in the modern world in the allocation of radio frequencies. At page  23  of its report, the committee, recom:mends the setting up of a permanent committee to do the job which this ad hoc committee has done so well. I believe and hope that the recommendation will impress itself upon the Minister. I put the point of view that this committee could well form the nucleus of an Australian federal communications commission established on similar lines to the American Federal Communications Commission which has given that nation such an outstanding lead in telecommunication. The point in respect of a permanent committee is the necessity to obtain the full-time services of the very best men. This would require that the members of the committee be paid an adequate salary for the most important functions which they would be called- upon to discharge. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I must say that I do not agree with all of the findings of the committee by any means, and the most obvious chink in the committee&#39;s armour appears to be those aspects of the report dealing with the abolition of frequency modulation broadcasts, which were being carried; out. by the. PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department on an experimental basis, in co-operation with the Australian. Broadcasting Commission. I know that mis is. neither the time nor the the. place for a- technical discussion of. frequency modulation. I. simply pause to say that- it is- a system of sound broadcasting which permits superb quality of reproduction with a minimum of: interference such as that caused by static, heterodyne whistle, and all the multitude kinds of manmadeinterference that afflict ordinary amplitude modulation broadcasting, which, is the normal, system of broadcasting, in use in the Commonwealth at the moment. The frequencies used in this type of transmission internationally are in the  88  to  108  megacycle band. Transmission normally is for short range, about  30  to  40  miles, in line of sight, causing very little international or interstate interference. </para>
          <para>If we turn to page  84  of the committee&#39;s report, we find this sentence - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In- the normal course of events the Committee would have examined the whole spectrum in a methodical manner but in view of the urgency expressed in the Minister&#39;s letter to the  Chairman,  the Committee proceeded to consider in some detail the V.H.F. band (30 to 300 megacycles) with particular reference to the provision of 13 television channels. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, the committee was in a sense excusing itself for the difficult position in which it found itself, which ultimately led it to make what I believe to be the one capital blunder in the entire report in relation to the abolition of frequency modulation broadcasts. After finding in the very high frequency band three additional channels for television, as requested by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Davidson),</inline> the committee then had on its hands two megacycles which it was able, if it had seen fit, to allocate for the continuance of the frequency modulation services. In spite of this, the committee recommended that frequency modulation transmission be discontinued - in the words of the report - because of -   the possible increase in demand by large or new taxi interests. </para>

There were representatives of the Austraiian Broadcasting Control Board, amateur operators, manufacturers, public utilities, Defence Services, and the PostmasterGeneral. I certainly have no quibble with the personnel of the committee nor with the general nature of its findings. This recommendation is like the 13th stroke of a crazy clock.

          <para>Our community willingly subsidizes culture. Under other departments we make grants to the Commonwealth Literary Fund. We subsidize the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, the Australian Humanities Research Council, historical societies, Australian paintings, overseas exhibitions of Australian art and a large number of other things. Instead of presenting music of superb quality, which gives so much pleasure to many thousands throughout the nation, we are going to scrap frequency modulation broadcasting because it is possible - not certain - that some taxi interests may be inconvenienced. One has merely to state the example given by the committee to provide its own refutation. Even allowing that taxis are very important, it is right and proper to point out that in order to have a national frequency modulation service it is only necessary to set aside in this particular band about 180 kilocycles. </para>

              <para>-  It is not in breach of Standing Orders at all. The committee had two megacycles with which to play, and it pushed frequency modulation off and let the taxis on. lt would be necessary to take only a small fraction - less than 10 per cent. - of the two megacycles that are left - say 180 kilocycles - in order to give a first-class transmission. In earlier speeches on this subject I have settled for a smaller frequency band. But on more mature inquiry I believe that about 180 kilocycles is desirable. That is all that is necessary to give the entire nation the benefit of frequency modulation. Frequency modulation transmitters have line-of-sight range only. Skip troubles do not worry them. Transmissions in one large centre of population would not interfere with those in other States or other large provincial centres. It may be that frequency modulation transmissions were pushed off the band for reasons other than taxis and taxi trucks. If so I am anxious to know why the report does not cite examples. I want to know why the report was adopted so smartly by the Government when no reasons were given for the committee&#39;s decision. </para>

          <para>As from July of this year the United States of America will make frequency modulation transmissions in stereo. Although the United States is no bigger physically than Australia, it has a very much larger population, very many more demands for frequencies, and very many more calls on existing frequency space. Nevertheless, the United States is able to embark on a programme of stereo frequency modulation. Admittedly, that transmission requires only one frequency because of the work that has been done by engineers in the United States. I ask the Minister to give this matter close consideration. At a time when other countries are going full speed ahead in order to implement a modern system of frequency modulation, Australia is killing it. </para>
          <para>I know that it has been suggested that frequency modulation could move into the 500 to 600 megacycle band. I suppose that half a loaf is better than no bread at all. For the reasons that I have stated it is unfair to expect receivers of frequency modulation transmissions to move off this band in order to let the taxis on. The equipment held by listeners in this country for the past twelve or thirteen years and on the dealers&#39; shelves has become so much junk since 30th June last when the experimental transmissions were discontinued. It is possible to modify that equipment to enable it to be used in the 500 to 600 megacycle band, but, because of technical difficulties, such modification would not be an economic proposition. The people who hold  this equipment  would  be  better advised to start from scratch in the new frequency band. </para>
          <para>If somebody must be inconvenienced, why not the taxis? If somebody has to lose the use of certain frequencies, why not let it be the taxi operators? A perusal of the report insofar as it deals with the necessity for more modern use of the bands and the provision of narrower channelling in bands reveals that the equipment now used by the taxis will require at least modification and possibly replacement by 1966. So the benefit to these commercial operators will be only of five years&#39; duration. </para>
          <para>I know that the Minister is sympathetic to culture. 1 know that he is sympathetic to the form of entertainment that frequency modulation can provide. On many occasions in the Senate he has gone out  of  his way to give me assistance and encouragement in pursuing my campaign for the return to the nation of frequency modulation broadcasting. For all those reasons I ask the Minister to examine the views that I have expressed and to see what can be done to restore to Australia frequency modulation services in the veryhighfrequency band. If that is too much to hope for - if the plumbers and artisans have defeated the artists and musicians - 1 ask the Minister whether something can be done on the principle of half a loaf being better than no bread at all. Can frequency modulation be restored to us somewhere between 400 and 600 megacycles? If that were done it would mean, of course, a complete re-hash of our listening equipment. I would not like anything that I have said to be taken as an attack on the integrity, ability or sincerity of members of the committee. </para>

              <para>-  I now proceed to discuss the effect that the continued operation of these experimental stations might have on services valuable to the community. The desirability of introducing permanent frequency modulation broadcasting services has been considered from time to time. As late as 1958 the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, after a public inquiry, concluded that there were genuine practical difficulties associated with the introduction of frequency modulation services. Those difficulties arose principally from the rapid development of television services and the consequent demand on the use of very high frequency channels. In 1960, the problem of providing sufficient channels for television services was considered by a technical conference convened by the board. The general view taken was that television should be expanded in the very high frequency band, and that efforts should be made to secure more channels to enable this to be done. This conclusion was considered first by the board and later by the Radio Frequency Review Committee - the Huxley committee. It was concluded that only by using the band of frequencies that had been reserved for frequency modulation broadcasting could sufficient channels be made available for television, and at the same time reasonable provision made for the growth of essential fixed and mobile services. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> has read the report. I take it that he realizes that frequency modulation channels can be made available only at the expense of other services. </para>

              <para>-  Following the adoption of this recommendation it was decided to discontinue the experimental frequency modulation transmissions. The circumstances were explained at length in a statement made by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Davidson)</inline> on 31st May, 1961, which was widely circulated. In that statement it was emphasized that frequency space is available in the ultra high frequency band for the development of frequency modulation services should a strong demand for such services be forthcoming. There are, however, problems involved in planning for this. The need for the service would have to be justified in the light of the costs involved. Again, the extent to which any such service should be developed, having regard to television expansion and the needs of country residents as well as those in capital cities, would require careful consideration. </para>

              <para>-  An answer is required. I would like the Minister to get an answer on this matter. It is an unanswerable fact that after finding three new television channels in the very high frequency band two megacycles - not kilocycles - are open between 92 and 94 megacycles. In order to comply with the national frequency modulation service, I have suggested that only 180 kilocycles of that band be set aside. That is less than 10 per cent. It is not as though I want the whole band kept open. I want only a tiny, almost infinitesimal part of it kept, because it has a short range of transmission and throughout most of the year there would not be interference difficulties. In the warmer months there may be a little trouble. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I invite the Minister to tell me of any modern nation, any developed nation, which is using the ultra high frequency band in preference to the very high frequency band for frequency modulation transmission.

          <para>If, as the Minister has pointed out, ambulances, hospitals, rural fire brigades, the police and other important users of frequencies provided a reason why frequency modulation was dropped from the very high frequency band, one would have thought that a report prepared by Professor Huxley and the experts to whom we have already referred would have made a passing reference to it. If we turn to page 85 of the report we find the only example that is quoted. Really it is not an example but only a possibility. The report reads - </para>

          <para>I have the greatest appreciation of the fact that experimental transmissions by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, in association with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, have done a great deal to stimulate interest in frequency modulation broadcasting in this country. In fact, if we had been left without the assistance of the government services in this matter, probably there would have been no experimental frequency modulation transmissions at all. People know that when something is experimental they buy at their own peril. It is very difficult to be specific on this point, but when the Government knows that from  &#163;500*000  to  &#163;1,000,000 -  I am only guessing when  1  use that figure; I am not pretending to be accurate - is involved in frequency modulation receivers throughout the Commonwealth, including those on dealers&#39; shelves and in my home, it is reasonable that if somebody has to be pushed off- </para>

            <para>.- We are considering the proposed expenditure of  &#163;113,510,000  by the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. Not all of it will be spent on frequency modulation. This debate is taking place after the installation of commercial accounts within the department. The .proposed vote provides a perfect illustration of the need to consider policy in relation to estimates. In this vote, the appropriation involved in interest alone is  &#163;15,347,000,  and the appropriation involved in depreciation is  &#163;11,058,201.  Those two items amount to more than  &#163;26,000,000.  That poses a very practical problem that would engage the attention of a purposeful and sane businessman in any forum, even this committee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The question is whether in voting the levies on the taxpayers for the purposes of the Postmaster-General&#39;s services we should vote  &#163;113,000,000  or that amount, less  &#163;26,000,000.  I put the question in as simple terms as those. Those two items illustrate the issue whether commercial accounts are proper for this department or whether merely cash accounts showing receipts and expenditure are the appropriate basis for a public department such as this. I put the matter in that way because I ask the Minister to afford as much information as he can to the committee to justify this revised system of Post Office accounts. </para>
          <para>I do so with less temerity because my own inclination is to believe that if we are to rationalize the idea of government departments taking their places in the service of the community alongside ordinary enterprises of individual taxpayers or collective enterprises of taxpayers, the government enterprises have to be put on a competitive and comparable basis for the purpose of judging their efficiency and economy. I believe that we would be following a mistaken guide if we did not analyse so much of the past expenditure of the Post Office as remains in the form of capital assets, assess the depreciation, consider the interest value of the assets involved, present the accounts on a commercial basis, and then strike a levy for the- services of the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department that would enable the department to meet all of those imposts and pay its way. </para>
          <para>When I state that proposition I have in mind the commercial activities of government that have appeared in modern times, such as railway and other transport services, including Trans-Australia Airlines. They are to be distinguished, in only a very narrow degree, from ordinary commercial services; but the Post Office has a tradition. It has the privilege of having emerged as a government business undertaking half a century before the idea of running a business for government profit appealed to any political party. The Post Office was established as a service to the community. When I said &#34; half a century &#34;, my history was sadly astray. Governments espoused the idea that they had a responsibility for postal services probably 250 years ago, or may be earlier than that. </para>
          <para>I believe that an appropriation of &#163;113,000,000, of which no less than &#163;26,000,000 is for two items - depreciation and interest - ought to engage the thoughtful consideration of this committee. The appropriateness of that idea can be positively asserted in relation to banking, transport and shipping services, and all the commercial activities which one party in the political forum directly urges and in which another party in the political forum indirectly acquiesces and then espouses. Distinguishing the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department from that ilk, are we justified in appropriating &#163;113,000,000, which would exceed the appropriation on a noncommercial basis and a governmental accounting basis by about &#163;26,000,000? I rose to put that point of view in the hope that the Minister will justify it. </para>

            <para>. -  In referring to Division No. 711, I take the committee from the Olympian heights of the economic propositions so ably submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to the matter of postage stamps. The department spends quite an amount of money in printing stamps. I would be interested to learn from the Minister what the designing of stamps costs the department, and also what Australian artists, if any, are engaged in the designing of stamps. I cannot avoid the feeling that our postage stamps are amongst the most dull, unimaginative and inartistic of all the stamps in the world. Postage stamps are an important way of advertising  a  country. Many countries realize that. It might be a tradition of the Australian that he does not tend to display the desirable artistic qualities in the design of postage stamps, but the people of some other nations do so. </para>

          <para>When one compares our stamps with the stamps of many other nations, one cannot avoid the conclusion that ours are designed by a good, honest public servant in a dingy office which does not lend itself to inspiration. Also, one cannot avoid the conclusion that we cannot get away from the kangaroo as a motif. I wonder how many times the kangaroo has been put on our stamps. It is time we got away from the kangaroo age. </para>

We are not dealing with this subject properly in Australia. I suggest that we get away from the kangaroo and I suggest also that we get away from the wombat. That has been on so many stamps that I am sick of it too. There are many things that we could use as motifs for our stamps.

A new issue of Australian stamps is a matter of considerable interest. I suppose that any small European country makes many more issues of new stamps than does Australia. A challenge is presented to us, as Australians, to consider this matter. I ask the Minister to tell us now who does the designing of our stamps, who decides the motifs that are to be used, and whether any of our recognized artists are co-opted in this very important cultural enterprise. </para>

I do not know whether the Minister has ever considered the difficulty that a lefthanded person encounters in trying to make a telephone call from a public telephone box in Australia. I believe that one person in about every ten persons in the community is left-handed. When a lefthanded person goes into a public telephone box, he takes the receiver in his left hand and then, holding the receiver ready to put to his ear, he tries to turn the dial on the telephone. He has almost to stand on his head to do it. </para>

            <para>. - 1  want to know whether the officers of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department have ever tried to calculate the loss in postal revenue that arises from a practice that has been adopted by some organizations during the last few years - the practice of not sending out receipts for moneys received. This practice is fairly wide-spread now, and is being adopted even by some State government instrumentalities. I know that the Victorian State Electricity Commission does not send out a receipt for money received unless the consumer puts a cross in a square on the account that has been sent to him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My main concern is that this practice, which is becoming more wide-spread each month, must result in a considerable loss of revenue to the Postal Department. I admit that 1 cannot suggest what the department itself could do to alter the position, except that it confer with the State governments. It is clear that the practice entails a loss of revenue to the States because, as receipts are not issued, stamp duty is not paid. I should like to know whether any estimate has been made - I admit that it would be only a rough estimate - of the amount of revenue that the Postal Department is losing through this practice. If the practice develops further, the result may well be that those who use the services of the department will have to pay more for them. </para>

              <para>- That is the point to which I am addressing myself. The annual turnover of the Post Office is about  &#163;130,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> flatters me if he believes that I could stand in my place now and give an adequate and intelligent report of the workings of the Post Office since it was placed on a commercial basis. I concede that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was entitled to try to clear his mind on the wisdom of the policy which prompted the Government to charge interest on the capital invested in the Post Office. </para>

          <para>I know that there are two schools of thought on that matter. Those who belong to one school of thought argue that the Post Office is an undertaking that should be run on a businesslike basis. They ask why people should be taxed to support services which do not pay. They say that the services are used by one section of the community and they ask why all of the taxpayers should be asked to bear the loss. Those who belong to the other school of thought ask why interest should be charged by the Government on money raised through taxation. There are two schools of thought. The Government came down on the side of placing the Post Office on a business basis. I am not in a position to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> a report of the Government&#39;s thinking on the result of the change, but I will ask the Postmaster-General if he is in a position to put down  in writing  a precis of his impression of  the results  of the  &#39;Changeover. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline>had something to say about our postage stamps. The Post Office has a stamp advisory committee which comprises amongst its members philatelists and the director of the Melbourne Art Gallery. This committee closely examines designs, submitted frequently as  a  result of competition, and makes recommendations. The reference that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> made to the quality of the stamps has caused to be placed in my hand  a  report of the Post Office&#39;s policy on stamps. Having no time to read it all, I shall quote merely  a  few lines, as follows: - </para>

I am informed that no appreciable decline has been observed in the trend of postal traffic following the growth of the practice of some business houses of not sending out receipts. Admittedly there is  a  loss to State governments in duty, but that is not a matter for the Commonwealth. One would be closing one&#39;s eyes to the facts of life if one were to say that there was no loss of revenue to the Commonwealth Government. I am sorry that 1 cannot give any details, but I freely admit that in my thinking there must be some loss. </para>

              <para>- Some thirteen years ago I worked in the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department, and during the course of the time I spent in the personnel branch I had a lot to do with the postal investigation service as I was working alongside officers engaged in that service. During those years I watched those officers cross-examine people suspected of various offences. In those days I became very disturbed because those men were not trained in police methods; they used their own methods of cross-examining suspects. In some cases the offences were trivial, such as a short count in the till; other cases were more serious such as assault and battery or damaging of Commonwealth property. </para>

          <para>In those days I felt that members of the postal investigation staff should have been trained in police methods. Members of the police forces in the various States, particularly members of the criminal investigation branches, are under the close surveillance of the press, and probably of private lawyers. Police officers have developed a tradition of fairness in handling suspects which I think they can be proud of. My worry is that this same tradition has not been evident in investigations in the Post Office. I remember in those days &#39;that time and time again these officers went outside the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act in warning suspects of the sentences which might be awaiting them. I always felt from my experience in those days that this was not a good thing for the department; and I raise the query to-night for the Minister&#39;s consideration, particularly in view of the happenings of those days and possibly some things that have happened since. </para>
          <para>It might be a good thing if the service were to be composed of trained detectives. A man who qualifies as a detective has had a normal police training and grows up in the police tradition. I feel that it would be to the advantage of the criminal investigation branches and to the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department if detectives could be loaned to the Commonwealth for a period of time. It would certainly help criminal investigation officers to know more about the internal workings of the biggest Commonwealth department. In view of all sorts of happenings recently I believe that the public of Australia would feel better satisfied if one section of the community was not subject to treatment of a kind against which the community generally is protected. </para>

              <para>-  In Western Australia, the second smallest State as far as the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is concerned, there would be three officers, and one could take it that in Adelaide there would be approximately the same number. There would be one or two in Tasmania and more in the larger States. Most of those I have in mind had no particular police training. They came up through the ranks of the department. Any officer could apply for such appointment. Generally the senior position was filled by a senior man from the third division, but the assistant investigators would come from such people as linemen, postmen and the like. I raisethis matter so that the Minister might makesome comment upon it. </para>

          <para>I wish to pass now to another matter. Over recent years there seems to be some doubt as to the division of responsibility between the Public Service Board and thePostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. I havenoted instances which have occurred - not during my days in the department, but muchmore recently - in which the PostmasterGeneral has declared that certain happenings in the department are the responsibility of the Public Service Board whereas the newly appointed head of the department,. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Grady,</inline> seems to adopt a different attitude. I think we should have a clear understanding of the position in this Parliament. I hope that responsibilities are noi being clouded between the Public ServiceBoard and the department. I would think that it is the duty of the Public Service Board to exercise oversight of the department in matters associated with standard of&#39; examinations, recruitment and dismissals and that type of thing. </para>

              <para>-  Yes, certainly,, but the Public Service Board merely dealswith the appointment of officers, their conduct in relation to certain sections of the act, their dismissal, superannuation rights, and so on. For all practical purposes trieconduct of officers is the immediate concern of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the Department of Civil Aviation, or whichever department is handling a dispute that may have arisen. For instance, it is thejob of the head of the department, and, in the final analysis, of the Minister, to make reports and recommendations regarding: conduct to the Public Service Board. I should have thought that the use of motor cars would be a matter for the administration of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and not for the Public Service Board- </para>

            <para>. - 1 am prompted to speak of a matter that 1 have discussed in this chamber over the years, and about which I have never received satisfactory information. I refer to the attachment to telephones of automatic recording devices. In other countries there have been available for about fifteen years devices which may be connected to telephones, at the request of subscribers, to enable callers to record messages which can subsequently be played back. I understand that there is nothing very complicated about the apparatus. The question is whether the provision of the devices is a matter for the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department or for a private organization. Can the Minister tell me whether the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is interested in this matter? Does it propose to install these devices when asked to do so? As I have said, in this respect we are about fifteen years behind most other nations and we should be trying to catch up. </para>

            <para>.- I ask the Minister: What is the approximate cost to the Australian Broadcasting Commission of the facilities which it has been decided to grant to the various political parties for the purposes of the forthcoming general election? The facilities to which I refer, and of which I want to know the cost to the commission and therefore to the taxpayers, relate to the broadcasting and televising of political matter over national stations. Broadcasting time has been allocated as follows: - Four hours to the Government parties, four hours to the Australian Labour Party, and three-quarters of an hour to the Australian Democratic Labour Party, or not sufficient time for the leader of that party to deliver his policy speech. On television, the Government parties have been allocated two hours, the Australian Labour Party two hours, and the Democratic Labour Party half an hour. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I question the propriety of the granting of such facilities to political parties at the expense of the taxpayer. I also question the discrimination that is shown. </para>

              <para>-  My party will  be  only too pleased to give up its threequarters of an hour on the radio and half an hour on television if the Government parties and the Australian Labour Party will give up the time that has been allotted to them. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> should regard this matter as one for levity. If he were on our end of the stick he would not do so. I also question the granting of money for this purpose on the ground that 1 have always understood that in a democracy such as ours all candidates are regarded as being equal before the electors. It is obvious that if money provided by the taxpayers can be used by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to provide for certain political parties facilities worth considerable sums, there is no reason why the News and Information Bureau should not also be used to assist certain political parties. 1 object strongly to the facilities being made available at the expense of the taxpayers. I believe that, fundamentally, it would be a good thing if no facilities were provided at all. </para>

              <para>-  I understand that it may do so under the act constituting the commission. It is thereby given power to determine the times that shall be made available to political parties. I understand that that is the position, but I would welcome correction if it is not. My party believes that the facilities should not be granted in that form. In fact, we think that no facilities ought to be given, but if they are, they should be confined to one hour for the expression of the policy speech of each party which is represented in the Parliament or which polled a significant vote at the previous election and is contesting a majority of the seats. As a result of my investigations, I believe that no other country in the British Commonwealth gives facilities to this extent. In support of my statement that the grant of money to enable these facilities to be made available is wrong, I point out that in Great Britain, a country of 44,000,000 people, an infinitely less amount of time is given to political parties. It is regrettable, therefore, that the Parliament has let slip out of its hands control over these facilities. In Great Britain, the leaders of the political parties confer and agree on times. </para>

              <para>-  I have read a survey of the recent election, which stated that the leaders of the parties conferred with regard to times. I stand by that statement, because it was an official survey of the last election in Great Britain. Whether or not that is the position, I say that there should be no grant of these times. If there is a grant, it should be on a basis that retains  the  equality of candidates before the law. I also take the strongest exception to the use of public funds to grant facilities, in periods when elections are not being held,  to  certain political parties, while refusing similar facilities  to  others. Only this year the Australian Broadcasting Commission has given facilities to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to comment upon the state of the economy. I suppose I have no objection to that, but the Australian Labour Party also applied to the commission for similar facilities, which were granted. The Leader of the Democratic Labour Party applied to the commission for facilities to comment upon the state of the economy, but these were refused. </para>

              <para>-  I do not know. I do not know whether it applied, but it forms part of the Government. At any rate, the leader of my party sought facilities from the commission, and he was refused. Some time ago I pointed out that the commission gave facilities to parliamentarians, supporters of the Government and of the Australian Labour Party, to comment in the commission&#39;s ordinary services upon a wide variety of public questions. In response to a question, I received a list of Government supporters who had received such facilities and a list of members of the Australian Labour Party who had received them. 1 asked what members of the Democratic Labour Party had received such facilities and I was informed that none had received them. </para>

          <para>I conclude my remarks by saying that I take the strongest exception to the use of public funds to grant in a discriminatory way to some political parties facilities which are not given to other political parties. To do that is to commit an offence against our democratic system. As I said before, if it is felt that some facilities should be given, let every political party that is represented in the Parliament, that has a significant vote and is contesting a majority of the seats, be given one hour to broadcast its policy speech, and then let all parties be put on the equal basis that if they want extra time they may purchase it from commercial stations. </para>

I was very distressed, when phase 3 of the television establishment was announced, to learn that Western Australia and South Australia had been left out. We believe that phase 3 will not be completed until some time in 1964, so it will be some time before phase 4 comes into operation. </para>

          <para>Can the Minister tell me why the Australian Broadcasting Commission has steadfastly refused to use translator transmitter stations. I refer to one type of translator, the Adler, with which 1 am familiar. Some 200 of these are operating throughout the world, 70 of them in America - in Nevada, California and Arizona. The cost of a 10-watt transmitter, imported from America and landed in Fremantle, is &#163;2,100. That includes the cost of the aerial and all other necessary equipment, other than establishing it on the site. </para>

              <para>-  I could not say. The landed cost of a 150-watt transmitter is &#163;8,000. Many months ago I asked the Minister over what distance these translators could operate, and I was amazed to get the answer that the smaller type would cover some twelve miles. I refute that statement; I do not know from where the Minister got his information. I do not think that one can go past the American Federal Communications Commission, which is the equivalent of our Australian Broadcasting Commission. In a report which it was asked to produce on Adler translators, the commission stated - </para>

          <para>I think immediately of Western Australia. The terrain is flat and ideal for line of sight reception of television. I suggest that the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as an experiment, install one of these translators, to cover some of the remote agricultural or goldfields areas in Western Australia, in order to see how it would operate. There are several translators in Italy where the terrain requires the transmission to be lifted over high mountain peaks. In the interests of the people who will not have television available before 1964, I ask the Minister to inquire from his advisers what they have against the use of the Adler-type translator as an experiment. </para>

          <para class="block">Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Flaherty</inline> asked me whether I, or any officer of my department, had in any way tried to get East-West Airlines Limited to sell out to, or amalgamate with, the Ansett interests. Honorable senators will recall that I emphatically denied this, and I do so again now. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Shand,  chairman  of East-West Airlines Limited, made a statement to-day to a Sydney newspaper repeating the allegation that I had urged his company to sell out to Ansett, or, alternatively, to come to terms with him. In order to place this whole matter in its proper perspective I now wish to make the following explanation. </para>
          <para>First, 1 should give the Senate  some  relevant facts about East-West  Airlines. </para>
          <para class="block">This company has for some time operated a network of feeder-type rural services in New South Wales. When the Government announced in 1957 its policy of giving certain types of assistance to selected feeder airlines, East-West Airlines became eligible for such assistance. Consequently the company received subsidy payments in 1958-59 of &#163;16,955; in 1959-60 of &#163;25,000 and in 1960-61 of &#163;25,700. Also, the Government facilitated its hiring of Fokker Friendship aircraft worth about &#163;400,000 on generous financial terms from Trans-Australia Airlines in 1959, and assisted it in obtaining at nominal cost surplus DC3 aircraft from the services. Considerable assistance was also given by my department in providing at considerable cost the airport, navigation and lighting facilities necessary for the utilization of the East-West Airlines fleet. </para>
          <para>All this assistance was primarily given to improve the standard of rural air services in New South Wales. I think it can be fairly said that it has done just that. However, it clearly had the additional effect of assisting in a material financial way the operations of East-West Airlines. </para>
          <para>Notwithstanding the assistance given by the Commonwealth, it has been apparent for some time that the company has had difficulty in achieving satisfactory commercial results. Last year, Ansett Transport Industries Limited, which operates the other rural airline in New South Wales, made what was generally regarded in aviation circles as an attractive cash or share offer to East-West Airlines for the purchase of the company. This was rejected. </para>
          <para>The company, on the recommendation of the directors, about June, 1960, took steps to amend its Articles of Association so that every share transfer required specific board approval. At the same time it also set in hand action to make a bonus one-for-two share issue. The commercial justification for this issue in a company with a paid-up capital of just over &#163;100,000, with a marginal record of profitability and with a consequential substantial dependence on Government subsidy, was indeed hard to see. Neither of these actions by the company had any direct effect in resolving its basic financial problems. In fact, the bonus issue could only have accentuated these problems. </para>
          <para>As  chairman  of the company and as the person primarily responsible to shareholders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand</inline> made various personal approaches to me for additional Government assistance. This could only have taken the form of either additional subsidy or help in acquiring further aircraft. East-West Airlines was already receiving a subsidy which last year reached &#163;25,700 on a capital outlay, including the bonus issue, of &#163;165,500 compared with the subsidy of &#163;44,000 paid to Airlines of New South Wales at a figure of &#163;1,500,000 capital employed in the business. Equipment used includes four Fokkers. </para>
          <para>On the aircraft equipment side it was manifestly clear that East-West Airlines - and in fact the whole of the New South Wales network - already had sufficient aircraft to operate the required services. </para>
          <para>During the course of his discussions with me <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand</inline> raised on a number of occasions the take-over bid made by Ansett last year. On every occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand</inline> raised the take-over bid with me I went to great pains, both orally and in writing, to point out to him that consideration of this offer was entirely a matter for the commercial judgment of his board. For example, I wrote to him on 25th August in the following terms: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Director-General brought to my notice his correspondence with you dated 23rd August. I find your statement that I urged you to re-open the negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> incomprehensible. I said in the course of our meeting and I repeat now a decision to negotiate with Ansett is entirely a matter for the commercial judgment of your Board. If the question of negotiations with Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., or any other Airline arises in the future I would be glad if you would make this quite clear to your Board. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I cannot understand in these circumstances why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand</inline> insists in saying that I advised him to sell out to Ansett. No amount of misrepresentation, no matter how persistent, can resolve the problems which face his company. These require the earnest and careful attention of the board and its management. </para>

            <para>May I remind the Senate that the Government was forced in some ways, to some extent, to take the action that it did at the close of the last sessional period because of filibustering on the part of the Opposition.

            <para>The second thing I want to point out is the small contribution that the Opposition made to the debates in all the circumstances.

          <quote>
            <para>I think an inspection of the record would show that the debate on very few bills was led on behalf of the Opposition by any one other than the Leader of the Opposition.

          </quote>
          <para>The fourth point was as follows: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The principal contribution to the debates made by honorable senators opposite, apart from the Leader of the Opposition, was continually to ccae into the chamber and call for a quorum to be formed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Those remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> were given a good deal of publicity to-day in the Australian press. I take advantage of this, the first opportunity I have had, to present the facts. Those facts, coldly presented, will completely confound the statements that were made by both honorable senators. </para>
          <para>Let me turn first to the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. That was a measure about which obviously there was no great urgency, because it was introduced first in 1960. It lapsed at the time the Parliament was prorogued and it was re-introduced in the House of Representatives on 21st March last. It was introduced in the Senate, following receipt of a message from the House of Representatives, on 4th May. It had lain about all that time. It was taken to the second-reading stage, and debate was adjourned. The second-reading debate was resumed on Tuesday, 9th May. It lasted from 8.18 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. - a period of 2 hours 12 minutes. </para>

              <para>- No. The Minister will find that on Tuesday, 9th May, the debate commenced at 8.18 p.m. and ended at 10.30 p.m. Then, on 10th May, the second-reading debate commenced at 8 p.m. and continued until 11 p.m. - three more hours. On Thursday, 11th May - I think this is the day to which the Minister is referring - the debate began at 4.53 p.m. and ended at 9.8 p.m. That meant that a further two and a quarter hours were spent on the second-reading debate, which lasted for seven and a half hours altogether. </para>

          <para>There were sixteen speakers during that debate. How were they apportioned? There were seven Government speakers, and then the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wade)</inline> spoke in reply. So eight speeches were delivered by the Government senators. Seven speeches were delivered by members of the Australian Labour Party and one by a member of the Democratic Labour Party. There was equal participation in the debate between Government and Opposition senators, except that one more speech was delivered on the Government side. It cannot be claimed that there was any filibustering at that stage. </para>
          <para>The Opposition moved that there be an instruction to the Committee of the Whole in a certain particular. I proposed that motion at 9.8 p.m. on 11th May and spoke for eighteen minutes. Two speeches were delivered by Government senators - one by the Minister for Air and the other by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> The whole exercise took 31 minutes. I did not use my right of reply. So there was one Opposition and two Government speakers to that motion, the Opposition not exercising the right of reply. There was dearly no filibustering at that stage. </para>
          <para>That same evening the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole at 9.44 p.m. and considered the measure until nearly midnight - a period of two and a quarter hours. During that time Government senators participated as freely as did members of the Opposition, man for man. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> in particular to note this interesting fact: From 11.9 p.m. until close on midnight there were seven speakers, six of them being Government senators. One Labour senator spoke for five minutes - myself. So if there was any element of filibustering, it certainly was not engaged in by the Opposition. I do not suggest there was any filibustering. Government senators are entitled to exercise their right of speech quite freely; I do not deny them that right. I repeat that the whole committee stage lasted for two and a quarter hours. </para>
          <para>I have traversed the whole of the progress of that bill. I say through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar,</inline> that what he has said is utterly and completely without foundation. Of the six speeches that were delivered by Government senators in the last hour of the committee stage two were delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> one by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> two by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> and one by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent.</inline> I repeat that I was the only other senator who spoke at that stage. Those facts completely repudiate the suggestion that the Opposition&#39;s attitude to that bill justified the Government&#39;s action in having an all-night sitting in most unfair and undemocratic conditions. </para>
          <para>We then proceeded to discuss the Stevedoring Industry Bill. We commenced consideration of that measure in committee at 4.29 p.m. on 17th May and, after a break for dinner and a break for supper we passed the measure at 2.16 a.m. on the following day. We considered the bill for six hours 38 minutes. That was a most important bill which excited nation-wide interest. It was highly controversial; the Opposition felt strongly about it. I doubt whether anybody in the chamber will say that in leading for the Opposition at the committee stage I wasted one minute. We dealt with many clauses. We divided on six. There were six divisions, and time was taken for those. Liberal Party, Australian Country Party and Labour Party senators participated equally and freely in that debate. Until to-day no one has ever suggested that the Opposition did not play a proper and speedy part in dealing with that measure. </para>
          <para>Now let us see what happened at 2.16 a.m. on 18th May. Ten more bills were dealt with. I shall take them one by one and then summarize the result. At 2.18 a.m. we debated the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I led on behalf of the Opposition and rose merely to say that we did not oppose the bill. The whole thing was disposed of in two minutes. Then at 2.20 a.m. we debated the Broadcasting and Television Bill. On this occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> led on behalf of the Opposition and delivered a speech which lasted for six minutes. The measure was discussed in committee and was disposed of at 3.5 a.m. Again there was no delay, no filibustering. The Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty Bill followed at 3.5 a.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> led on behalf of the Opposition, and the whole thing was through by 3.9 a.m. It passed through all stages in four minutes. Then followed the Defence Pay Bill at 3.9 a.m. Again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> led on behalf of the Opposition. That measure had passed through all stages by 3.22 a.m. - just thirteen minutes later. </para>
          <para>Then we debated the Life Insurance Bill at 3.22 a.m. I led on behalf of the Opposition and spoke from 3.22 a.m. until 3.46 a.m. - a period of 24 minutes. I was the only Opposition  speaker.  Three Government senators - Senators Wright^ Wood and Paltridge - spoke. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> moved the gag, apparently to stop honorable senators on the Government side from speaking. They were debating that bill very extensively and adequately. </para>
          <para>We came next to the Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Consideration of that began at 4.58 a.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly,</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, against! whom in common with all my other colleagues the attack of the Leader of the Government was directed, spoke for more than an hour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> then applied the gag and the guillotine, limiting all stages to 6.38 a.m., when consideration of the bill ended. Consideration of the Appropriation (Works and Services) Bill (No. 2) began at 6.38 a.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> immediately applied the guillotine, limiting all stages to the period from 6.38 to 7.2 a.m. I spoke for two minutes. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Under the allotment of time, consideration of that bill was to last for about 22 minutes, but the bill was passed in two minutes. Was there any filibustering there? Was there anything to justify the guillotine? </para>

          <para>The Supply Bill came on at 6.42 a.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> immediately applied the gag and the guillotine, limiting all stages to 7.7 a.m. I and other Opposition senators spoke. We objected to the guillotine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> made a second-reading speech. Of course, the guillotine descended, and the bill was passed at 7.7 a.m. At eight minutes past seven I led for the Opposition on the Supply (Works and Services) Bill. I spoke for four minutes. I was the only Opposition  speaker  in the second-reading debate. The committee stage took until 7.40 a.m. During .that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> spoke. </para>
          <para>Then we came to the vastly important bill, the final one, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Bill. We objected to the suspension of the Standing Orders. There was debate on the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> participated in that debate. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> declared the measure an urgent one. He applied the gag and the guillotine, limiting all stages to 12.15 p.m., at which time the session ended. On that vastly important bill, Senators Dittmer, O&#39;Byrne, Cooke and Tangney spoke in the committee stage. There is a record of an opposition devoting itself to bills and being ruthlessly gagged. In the ten bills there were five gaggings and in others there were many formal motions that took only two or three minutes. I believe that in that mere statement of the facts I completely confound all that was said by the two honorable senators. </para>
          <para>We have been told that the Opposition was lazy. Let us look at the performance of honorable senators on the Government side throughout the period. Apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly,</inline> who took a leading part in the proceedings, and myself, there were five rank and file senators who spoke constantly .throughout the night. What was the record of honorable senators on the Government side, apart from the Leader of the Government and the Ministers? Only four honorable senators opposite spoke during the night. Let me say who they were: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar,</inline> himself, spoke for only two minutes in the whole evening; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> spoke for ten minutes; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> spoke for four minutes; and the one man on the Government back-benches who continuously and adequately devoted himself to a consideration of the measures was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who was heavily engaged throughout the night. Look at the record. Throughout the whole night, where were the lazy ones? They were quite clearly on the Government side. The Opposition back-benchers had a far better record than the Government back-benchers, who left everything to their leader. Look at their inglorious record! There was a whisper from three of them, and certainly a magnificent contribution from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> throughout the whole evening. When allegations of this sort are made, it behoves the Leader of the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> to look in their own backyards. </para>
          <para>Eleven bills were considered throughout the whole of that long evening, including the important Stevedoring Industry Bill. Five gags were applied. The allegation is that I monopolized the debates. I led for the Opposition on three substantive bills only. As I have recounted, the other three bills on which I spoke were completely formal, and I devoted minutes to them. Three of my colleagues led on other important bills. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly,</inline> of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who led on two bills. So, of the bills that mattered at all, I led on three of them, and my colleagues led on four of them. </para>
          <para>It is true that we called quorums. I would have been ashamed of honorable senators on my side if they had not done so. That was the one opportunity that we had to retaliate against the Government for its unfair treatment of the Opposition. I make no apology for calling quorums on the Government. Since it was going to keep us here during that long session, we were determined that honorable senators on the Government side would listen to us. Seven quorums were called. Let us hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> said, in most extravagant terms, of that performance. He said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The principal contribution to the debates made by honorable senators opposite, apart from  the  Leader of the Opposition, was continually  to  come into the chamber and call  for a quorum  to be formed.  1 emphasize the words &#34; continually &#34; and &#34; the principal contribution &#34;. The quorums themselves took exactly fourteen minutes. There were seven of them. So that anybody who wishes to do so may check that, I refer the Senate to the pages in the &#34;Hansard&#34; of 17th and 18th May, where the record of quorums can be found. There are two on page 1159, two on page 1162, one on page 1170, one on page 1174, and one on page 1183. Those seven quorums took 14 minutes out of an allnight sitting. That was the one gesture that the Opposition could make to show its disgust and to retaliate against the Government. I would have -been ashamed of the Opposition; it would have been spineless and without spirit of any kind if it had not taken advantage of every opportunity it had to record its protest. I take the opportunity to congratulate those of my colleagues who stayed with me and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> throughout those arduous and tiring debates, being gagged throughout in the process. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I am sorry to have kept the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> but I owed it to my colleagues and my party to put the facts before the Senate and to reject completely the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner.</inline> He began his speech by saying - </para>
          <para>I  wish to make a few remarks,  I  hope without heat and feeling, in order  to  put  the record  straight. </para>
          <para class="block">He failed as miserably in controlling the heat and feeling as he did in putting a case. I have dealt at length with his first point about filibustering. The statement that the debates were left largely in my hands is confounded by the facts that I have just recorded. He referred to the laziness of back-benchers on my side of the chamber in not taking part in the debates. All I say to the honorable senator, through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> is that they had a far more glorious record on that occasion than did the back-benchers on the Government side, with the notable exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline></para>
          <para>On the question of quorums again, the extravagant language used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> shows how ill his case was and how little notice it deserves. He claimed that the principal contribution made by the Opposition to the debates was the calling of quorums. Two minutes was spent in forming each of seven quorums. It is a disgrace to those on the Government side that those seven calls for quorums had to be made. </para>

              <para>-  A considerable amount of time - probably more than the bill deserved - was taken up in debating the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, but far more time was taken up in debating the Stevedoring Industry Bill. That debate went on for two full days and for a part of another day. It began at 4.34 p.m. on 16th May and went on until midnight. It was resumed after question time on 17th May and went all through 17th May and up to 2.15 a.m. on 18th May. A study of &#34; Hansard &#34; will show that during that time, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> said, many speeches were made repeating what had been said before. During the two and a half days that were spent on that one bill a great deal of time was wasted by the Opposition, so that it was necessary for a number of less important bills to be put through quickly. That is the justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner&#39;s</inline> statement that filibustering was responsible for the fact that on 17th and 18th  May a  number of bills had to be put through as quickly as they were. </para>

          <para>The other charge that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> made was that the Opposition left matters m the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> himself underlined the truth of that charge to-night. He said that he led for the Opposition on all the significant bills. He said also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> led for the Opposition on one bill and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> led on another. So they did, but, as &#34; Hansard &#34; will show, both of those bills were not opposed by the Opposition. </para>

Quorums were not called, as they could have been called, when no member of the Opposition was in the House, as was the case during that debate for at least fifteen or twenty minutes. </para>

              <para>- While this debate was taking place, there was a period when no member of the Opposition was in the House. There were many other periods when not more than one or two members of the Opposition were in the House. Bearing in mind that a great deal  of  time had been wasted on two bills, is not it reasonable to say that the Opposition was lazy if two, one or none of its members were in the House? ls not it reasonable also to say, when all major bills except those that were not opposed were taken by the Leader of the Opposition, that the Opposition was leaving all the work to its leader? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition himself has underlined <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner&#39;s</inline> statement about the events of 17th and 18th May. He has complained that after all the major bills had gone through - bills which he had taken himself either of his own will or because his party had handed them to him - there came into the House an important bill relating to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. He has complained that he had to spend the whole of the adjournment for breakfast in studying that bill so that he could lead on it for the Opposition, having led on all the others. That bill came from the House of Representatives, and surely he could have studied it before then. Is not it reasonable to infer that he had to devote the adjournment for breakfast to a study of that bill because nobody else on his side was prepared to study it for him and to take from his shoulders some of the burden that he had been carrying for two days? If that is a reasonable inference, it was entirely proper for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> to say that, as it always does, the Opposition left everything to its leader. It was entirely proper for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> to say that the jamming up of a number of unimportant bills - most of them were unimportant, and ten or twelve of them were sales tax bills - was due to the filibustering on the Stevedoring Industry Bill and the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. I believe that a study of the record will show that the comments on this matter made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> were completely factual. </para>

            <para>. - I am amazed to think that a Minister of the Crown should stand up in this chamber and make a speech such as we have just heard, after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had documented the happenings of the particular night. What are the facts? It is known that the Opposition requested the Government to sit normal hours, saying that it was quite prepared to come back the next day, or even one or two days in the following week. 1 wish to repeat something I heard. At times it is a bit dangerous to do that; but as one who is used to danger, I will take the risk. I understand that a meeting of the Government parties was held to discuss the length of the sitting. I heard that it was stated by the leader of the House, &#34; We will finish by one o&#39;clock and will get it through &#34;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>After the persistent requests of the Opposition for the Government to conduct the affairs of this House as they ought to be conducted, can any one take any objection because certain members of the Opposition made quite sure - seeing that the Government was not conducting the affairs of the House in a manner befitting a house of review - that the Government kept a quorum in the chamber? I plead guilty to taking that action myself. To say that the Opposition was not taking the business of the House in a serious manner, or was not acting in the fashion it should have acted, is not borne out by the facts. It ill-became any person, particularly the leader of the Senate, to make the remarks he did. Admittedly, he must tire at the end of a sessional period. Not only has he his work in this chamber to attend to, but he also has to spend a great deal of time on other matters. However, just because every one will not agree with what he desires, he becomes offensive. </para>
          <para>I am certain that no person who had any consideration for the well-being of this House as a house of review - whether he be a member of the Senate or a person who takes some interest in its proceedings - could not have been other than shocked at the proceedings that night. Even newspapers which usually support the present Government painted a very black picture of what the Government did, stating that it had done the Senate a great disservice. The speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> has made did not give the facts as each senator who was present knows them. I am sorry to think that because a person gets a little bit nervy, as seems to be the case with the leader of the Government, he should be as offensive as he has been. </para>

            <para>. - I too, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> express my regret at delaying the House on this occasion. I also want to make it quite plain that I had no intention of referring to the happenings of the night of 17th May, had it not been that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> when speaking to the motion for the suspension of the standing order, again brought up the subject and referred to the fact that the Senate had been brought into bad repute. I do not think he used the words &#34; into bad repute &#34; but that is what he implied. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One other point I wish to make is that no word of mine was intended as a personal criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. I think I stated - and I wish to reiterate the statement - that 1 admire him for his efficiency and the hard work he performs. Even at this very moment I think he has our great sympathy because we realize that the speech he made to-night was the speech that any leader of an opposition would be called upon to make in defence of a team he is unfortunate enough to lead. </para>
          <para>The facts should be placed before the public. They were not placed before the public on that occasion. When we went home from that sitting of the Senate the headlines that greeted us in the newspapers were about the shame of the Senate. The facts were not known by the public. The facts were substantially those which I stated very briefly yesterday, and which were then dealt with in more detail by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner.</inline> I did not accuse the Opposition of filibustering on that particular night. I did say one or two days before that the Opposition was wasting time, and I repeat that charge. The Opposition did waste time. It knew that we were nearing the end of the sessional period and it deliberately wasted time. It should have known then that we would be called upon to have an all-night sitting. Some of the blame must definitely lie with the Opposition. </para>
          <para>Some remarks were made last night, and again to-night, that I was acting in collusion with the Leader of the Senate in the remarks that I made. That statement is entirely incorrect. I had no intention, when I came into this chamber, of speaking to the motion at . all. I certainly would not have spoken to it had it not been for the provocative remarks which were made, intentionally or otherwise, by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>Referring to the night in question, I do not know at what hour of the morning it was, but at one stage the Leader of the Opposition made a request - in fact, I think he made several requests - of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to suspend the sitting. I remember distinctly that on one occasion he stated that he had some sick senators. This matter can be verified by reference to &#34; Hansard &#34;. I looked it up myself this afternoon. &#34; Hansard &#34; does not mention the number of senators referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, but I have a very vivid recollection of his saying, &#34; I have ten sick senators who are under doctor&#39;s orders. They have had to go home to bed.&#34; Ten sick senators! I suggest that that statement of the Leader of the Opposition places my comment in proper perspective. I have said that the Opposition was either not capable or was too lazy to carry out its duties as an Opposition team. </para>

              <para>- I stayed here all night. We know that many members of the Opposition, apart from the sick ones, went home to bed. The sick ones, of course, had our sympathy. It was no fault of theirs that they were sick. </para>

          <para>I also want to refer to the calling of quorums on that occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> was quite right when he said that quorums were called for, and that no members of the Opposition were here. On several occasions a member of the Opposition came into the chamber, called for a quorum to be formed and then went out again. It is all very well to refer to speeches that were made by members of the Opposition at that time. The question I ask is: Where were the other members who did not speak? That is the kernel in the coco-nut. Those who were here were kept here deliberately to keep the ball rolling and the rest were home in bed. I want to support my remark that the Opposition was either not capable of carrying out its duties or was too lazy to do so. If we look back to the events of 17th May, my remark can be justified. </para>
          <para>This afternoon, at 5.25 p.m., there were only two supporters of the Australian Labour Party in the chamber. At 5.30 p.m., there were three. I remind the Senate that on 7th September last, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman</inline> was speaking during the Budget debate, there was not one Opposition supporter in the chamber. Does not that bear out my contention about honorable senators opposite? Time and again we have seen only one member of the Opposition in the chamber. I recall that on a certain occasion a member of the Opposition was sitting with a visitor in the gallery. Suddenly he became aware that there was not a member of the Opposition in the chamber. He had to leave his visitor and rush into the chamber so that there would be at least one Labour supporter in the Senate. Time and again I have seen only one or two honorable senators on the other side of the chamber. It was that kind of thing which formed the basis of the statement I made yesterday. I repeat that, on the occasion I have mentioned, the Opposition was either not capable of carrying out the duties of an Opposition or was too lazy to do so. </para>
