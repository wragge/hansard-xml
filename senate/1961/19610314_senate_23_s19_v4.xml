                        <para>-  My question is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Is it a fact, as reported in the press, that the growth in passenger traffic on civil airlines has not attained the increase which was expected last year? How does current passenger traffic compare with that of last year? Is it a fact that both airlines are considering the acquisition of further frontline aircraft? Could such acquisitions be justified in the light of the current passenger trends and the financial conditions of to-day? What are the respective frontline strengths of the fleets of Ansett-A.N.A. and Trans-Australia Airlines? </para>

                        <para>- The first part of the honorable senator's question relates to the growth in passenger traffic. It was expected that in the early part of this year the traffic growth would be of the order of 5 per cent. That has not materialized. In fact, in the first nine weeks of this year there was a down-turn in the number of passengers carried to the extent of about 3 per cent, fewer than last year. One airline has made an application for the acquisition of a new aircraft. Its first application was in respect of a second-hand aircraft. That was made late last year. The company was unable to obtain a second-hand aircraft. It then made an application for the acquisition of a new aircraft. In view of the position I have described in relation to the lack of passenger traffic growth, that application has been rejected. The other operator has made no application to me. The honorable senator then asked whether I could justify the acquisition of such aircraft. I think the facts answer that question. In the circumstances of the down-turn in passenger traffic I do not think any further acquisitions could be justified. That is why I have rejected the application by the operator concerned. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In answer to the question about the frontline fleets, I inform the honorable senator that each operator has three Electras and two DC6B's; Trans-Australia Airlines has twelve Viscounts, two of the 800 series and ten of the 700 series; and the Ansett-A.N.A. group has ten Viscounts, compared with Trans-Australia Airlines' twelve, five being of the 800 series and five of the 700 series. Behind the front-line fleets, apart from the DC3's and DC4's there are the newer Friendships, of which Trans-Australia Airlines has nine and the Ansett-A.N.A. group six. </para>

                        <para>- I intended to ask Senator Henty who is the Minister for Customs and Excise, a number of questions. I regret his illness. Knowing the great fund of knowledge that the Minister for the Navy, Senator Gorton, possesses, I will address the questions to him. Was the banning of the book about Lady Chatterley and her lusty lover the work of the whole Cabinet, or was it done by Senator Henty in consultation with the Prime Minister or after consultation with a few of his colleagues? Is it a fact that the book was banned principally because of the author's use of a rude four-letter English word? Has Senator Henty ever banned a book on his own responsibility? If he has, which one was it? Has any Minister for Customs and Excise banned any book on his own responsibility? Has the Minister read exSpeaker Norman Makin's splendid book entitled " Federal Labour Leaders "? </para>

If the Minister has read it, did he note that Norman Makin was taking no chances of his book being banned because he printed that four-letter English word, " d-a-m-n ", which although I have been here for 30 years I have never heard used in the Senate, with a " d " followed by a dash? </para>

                        <para>-  I understand that the Minister for Customs and Excise, when making a ministerial decision on the banning of a book, naturally dealt with a matter which was the responsibility of the Government. I read the book in question many years ago. It contains quite a large number of various four-letter words and I am not sure to which particular word Senator Brown referred. I am not aware whether the inclusion of certain four-letter words in the book is the reason for the banning of the book. I understand that the Minister placed, a ban on the book in such a way that his ruling could be challenged in the courts of Australia, should anybody desire to do so. I have given this answer off the cuff and honorable senators will appreciate that I am not completely au fait with this subject. However, I understand the position to be as I have stated. </para>

In view of the fact that importers are still advertising delivery of 1960 season Turkish figs at prices which are one-half the Australian cost of production and advising clients to take advantage of the low rate of duty of 4id. per lb., in anticipation of a Tariff Board finding that the duty should be increased by ls. 6d;. or 2s. per lb., will the Minister take steps to place an immediate embargo on the further importation of Turkish figs, pending a finding by the Tariff Board and subsequent action? </para>

                        <para>-  It would be quite contrary to usual practice to impose a duty in anticipation of a Tariff Board finding. Nobody knows what recommendations the Tariff Board will make, so I can hold out no hope in that direction. If the circumstances are as Senator Pearson states, and I do not doubt him for a moment, a procedure is available whereby representatives of the industry may go to the Department of Trade and seek a special arrangement. But under the legislation the Minister for Trade may make that special arrangement only after the matter has been referred to the Tariff Board. </para>

                        <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs. Is it a fact, as stated by Moscow radio in a broadcast this week in which reference was made to Russia's demand for the extradition of an Estonian migrant now resident in Australia, that Russia and Australia were allies in World War II. against the common plague of fascism? Is it a fact that so far as Russia is concerned, the alliance was made not by choice but as a result of Hitler's invasion? Did not Stalin originally prefer to ally himself with Hitler in order to destroy Poland in return for territorial gains, which included Estonia? When the democracies were fighting fascism, did not Stalin invite press representatives to publicize his embrace on Moscow railway station of Mr. Matsuoka, Japan's envoy to Russia and Australia's enemy? Did not Stalin further invite publication of his even more effusive embrace of Hitler's military attache, and1 did he not state that the embrace illustrated Russia's lasting friendship with Hitler's Germany? Did not Hitler's subsequent invasion of Russia, rather than Russia's dislike of fascism, which is communism's twin, make Russia our ally? Is not Australia's gratitude for help in World War II. due to the common people of Russia and not to the Soviet Government or the Russian Communist Party? Has the Soviet Government ever done anything for Australia which would justify handing over to Russia an Estonian refugee who denies charges made against him by Russia and whose own country has been the victim of Soviet crimes, including genocide and colonialism of the worst type? </para>

                        <para>- Most of the matters about which the honorable senator has asked are matters of recorded history. It is a fact that following a meeting between von Ribbentrop, who was then the Foreign Minister of the nazi Reich, and Molotov, who was then the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, an agreement was entered into between Germany and Soviet Russia by which the last named country agreed to supply quantities of materials to Germany just prior to Germany's attack upon the West. At that stage Russia was not in any sense in alliance with those countries that were fighting aggressive fascism. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Stalin's agreement with nazi Germany did in fact involve an attack upon Poland both by Stalin from the east and by nazi Germany from the west, so that she was attacked upon two fronts simultaneously. In that instance Poland, the attack upon the independence of which was the ultimate reason why the Western powers went to war, was attacked by Russia, lt was only subsequently, when the nazis invaded Russia, that an alliance was formed against an enemy which was then attacking both Russia and ourselves. Until that stage had been reached there had been no alliance; rather was there an encouragement of Germany by Russia. </para>
                    <para>I agree that the gratitude of the West is due to the Russian people for the sacrifices they made. It is worth noting that the Russian people were invoked to fight for mother Russia and not for the political system under which they lived. I would add that I believe also that the gratitude of the common people of Russia is due to the common people of the Western world who fought against nazism and who supplied to Russia so many of the sinews of war. I know of nothing that Russia has done for Australia. </para>

                        <para>-  My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, relates to an amendment of the Public Service Act which was effected by Act No. 105 of 1960. That amendment set out the eligibility of ex-servicemen in Commonwealth departments to transfer from the Fourth Division to the Third Division. I ask the Minister whether representations have been received from either the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia or the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia seeking action by the Government to remove what they, and I consider to be an anomaly in the application of the amendment to which I have referred, the anomaly being that the opportunity for promotion of a number of ex-servicemen who have studied and have qualified in a number of subjects, and many of whom in  1961  would have passed the required examination to allow them to rise from the Fourth Division to the Third Division, has been affected. I further ask the Minister whether a decision has been made in relation to this matter. If it has not, will he present to the Postmaster-General a favorable case with a view to allowing those persons who have been keen enough to study for promotion to complete their studies and, if successful, to enter the Third Division? </para>

                        <para>-  The whole purpose of the lifting of the embargo on the export of iron ore is to encourage prospecting and search, in the belief that we have in Australia very much greater resources of iron ore than so far have been ascertained. The basis of the scheme is to encourage people to prospect. The proposal is that if a person locates an iron ore deposit, we shall give him the right to export a portion of that deposit. In such circumstances, our total known national reserves will be increasing, despite the export that occurs. We believe that this scheme will not only increase our known natural resources but also earn us a substantial export income. Our knowledge of iron ore deposits, apart from those that are classified as being first-line reserves, is limited. My department has prepared a tabulation which gives such information as is available. The information is available to the public generally and I shall send Senator Scott a copy of the document. </para>

The programmes referred to depict shootings, bashings, killings and, in fact, crime of every conceivable form. Does the Minister agree that such programmes may have a very bad effect on some adults and particularly on young and impressionable minds? Will steps be taken to ensure proper censorship of television films that come into Australia? </para>

Knowing Senator Wedgwood's interest in rehabilitation, I am sure she will know that there is in the Melbourne pool of Commonwealth motor vehicles a light car fitted with all the automatic devices that are necessary to rehabilitate people in the driving of a motor car. I imagine it is this car to which the honorable senator has referred. It carries learner plates. In the hands of a very competent and highly skilled instructor, the car is used to instruct limbless soldiers, spastics and other such people in the handling of a modern car with automatic controls. I think it is fair to say that this is a Government service that meets with the approbation of all thinking people. </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister for the Navy a question relating to hydrographic surveys of the north-west coast of Australia. Will the Minister inform the Senate whether a conference has been held to determine priorities in a five year plan for the charting of the Australian coast line and whether such priorities have been determined? Will he express an opinion in relation to the advisability of giving a top priority to the preparation of a new survey chart for that portion of the north-west coast between Legendre Island and Bedout Island, covering the approaches to Point Samson and Port Hedland? Is he aware that overseas ship masters approaching Point Samson and Port Hedland and unfamiliar with these waters must depend solely on a British Admiralty chart published in 1883, which is said to be out of date, totally inadequate and dangerous? Does he not agree that from a national point of view, with growing exports of minerals from these ports, an up-to-date cartographic coverage should be prepared as soon as possible? </para>

                        <para>- There has recently been a meeting of interested parties to lay down a programme for a five-year survey of Australia's coast line, the interested parties including the Navy, the Division of National Mapping, which comes under the Department of National Development, and various State departments. A programme has been laid down and the interested bodies, including the State governments, have been informed of the programme. At the moment, I have not in my head precise details of the times at which various parts of the coast are to be surveyed, but I shall let Senator Cooke have a copy of that programme, if indeed I have not already done so, as I rather think I have. </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister representing the Treasurer a question which, relates to international tourism and the Government's willingness to subsidize this industry in order to assist our balance-of-payments problem. Is the Minister aware that the agreement between the Chevron, and Hilton groups of hoteliers has, now fallen through and, as a result, work on several of the proposed chain of nine international-standard hotels to be built in Australia has either ceased, as in some cases, or will not commence at all? As hotel accommodation in almost all States of the Commonwealth is scarce and often inadequate to fill international tourist requirements, will the Government consider ensuring the completion of these planned hotels, as speedily as possible by either making funds available on loan or by taking up shares in the company concerned? As I understand four-fifths of all international tourists coming to Australia arrive in Sydney, is the Government considering allowing Qantas Empire Airways Limited to proceed with the erection of an internationalstandard hotel to cope with the constant need to find accommodation for these tourists as they arrive? </para>

                        <para>- I have read in the press that the agreement between the Australian Chevron company and the American Hilton group has fallen through. I think the honorable senator will realize at once that the rest of the question, which involves the possibility of government ownership, either in part or in whole, of these proposed hotels, raises very weighty questions of policy, especially for a government of this complexion. I have no doubt that this development will have an influence upon the Government's thinking in respect of the general question of tourism, but I have no expectation that the Government would engage in, or become a party to hotel construction or operation. The question about Qantas does, of course, raise another aspect of 'the matter. It is 'the practice- of international airline operators to conduct hotels as part of their airline operations in order to meet the increasing demand for package tours. International air operation together with the conduct of hotels falls into a special category. </para>

                        <para>- My question to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport, refers to the standardization of rail gauges in South Australia and Western Australia. Has the Minister seen a recent press report that the Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford, is contemplating legal proceedings against the Commonwealth if rail standardization projects are proceeded wim in Western Australia prior to those in South Australia? Does a provision exist in the agreement between South Australia and the Common^ wealth that would enable that State to bring such an action? If the answer to my second question is, "Yes", will the Minister say whether the Commonwealth can enter into an agreement with Western Australia which would provide for that State's standardization project to proceed contemporaneously with that of South Australia? </para>

                            <para>-  I should like to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry whether he is aware that the Farmers Union of Western Australia and associated farmer bodies have protested to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Primary Industry about the first advance on the 1960-61 wheat crop being made in two moieties. Is he aware that the farmers' representatives strongly deny that the farmers are in any way responsible for the inflation that the Government has allowed the country to suffer and have stated that they see no reason why the farming community should be penalized further by an anti-inflationary measure applied to the wheat-growers? They consider that the farmers certainly are not the people responsible for inflation in this country, since almost all of the money they receive is paid out for essential goods, such as machinery, fencing materials, superphosphate and materials for pasture improvement, to mention just a few. Furthermore, the farmers are responsible for a large proportion of our export income, and the Government has stated that it is keen to promote exports. Is the Minister further aware that the cost of production of wheat has gone up and that the farmers, through their unions, have sought the support of members of the Australian Labour Party in their efforts to get fair treatment from the Government and an easing of the unnecessary and unfair burden on wheat-growers by pressing for the amount to be paid in April to be increased to 2s. 4d. a bushel - the extra 4d. representing the increase in the cost of production - and, what is more important, for the first advances for the remainder of the present stabilization plan to be not less than 1 1 s. a bushel, plus or minus any increase or decrease in the cost of production? Is the Minister aware that what I have said represents the decision of the Farmers Union of Western Australia and is not merely my statement? </para>

                            <para>-  I was not aware of the decision of the Farmers Union of Western Australia, but I pay great respect to industrial organizations in rural industries because they are the bodies that speak for the industries. The points that have been raised by Senator Cooke were answered, in the main, when I replied to a question that was asked by &gt;Senator Tangney last week. Senator Cooke has laid emphasis on the splitting of the payment as a counter to inflation. He quite loses sight of the fact that many more millions of pounds were involved in the payment of 9s. a bushel this year, as the first payment of the advance, than in the payment of lis. last year, which was made in one lump sum. Senator Cooke also loses sight of the fact that the wheat-grower is obliged to pay interest on all money that is advanced against his crop. In the ultimate, he could be worse off by asking for or demanding that higher payments be made than revenue permits. In view of the fact that the wait has been merely about six weeks, I am certain that the wheat-growers of this country are prepared to make their contribution towards stabilizing the economy and keeping interests costs down to the bare minimum. </para>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the criticism by a number of religious denominations of a stage play about to be produced in Australia, known as " The World of Suzie Wong "? This play deals with the life and loves of a Hong Kong prostitute and, in the opinion of the religious leaders, is of a depraved and corrupting nature. If the Commonwealth has any jurisdiction in matters of this nature, will the Minister make his own inquiries about the play? </para>

                        <para>-  I preface a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport by saying that I understand that several companies in Tasmania act as booking agents for the " Princess of Tasmania ". Is a system already in operation under which these companies refer their bookings to Melbourne for the allocation of accommodation? I refer to the booking of passages from Tasmania to Melbourne. Would it not be much simpler and eliminate the confusion that some people have experienced if one company with branches in the most important centres in Tasmania - for example, the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited - were made the sole agent, so that allocations could be made at Devonport, on the spot, instead of having the round-about method of reference to Melbourne for allocations? </para>

                        <para>-  Under a new system of arranging passenger bookings on the " Princess of Tasmania ", a system which will come into force on 1st April, all of the accommodation on the vessel will be allocated by one central booking office in Melbourne, which will be operated by the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited. In order to facilitate this and to ensure a minimum of delay in advising clients of the accommodation that has been allotted to them, a teleprinter service has been installed, part of the cost of which is being met by the Australian National Line. By this means, the line is confident that the difficulties which  have been experienced at times in arranging bookings will be eliminated and that, the service provided for passengers booking from Tasmania will be at least as speedy as would have been provided if all Tasmanian inquiries were referred to, say, Devonport. </para>

                        <para>-  Three Australian Electra aircraft have returned from America, having been modified. Two of these aircraft, which belong to Qantas Empire Airways Limited, are operating internationally. They, like other similar Electra aircraft, will operate at the speeds which were applicable prior to the restrictions being placed on them. I cannot tell the honorable senator offhand the cost of modifying each aircraft, but I shall find out and let him know. With regard to domestic operations, the aircraft that have come back have been tested by our own technical men who were sent to Burbank from the aeronautical laboratories of the Department of Supply and from the Department of Civil Aviation to watch the modification operation. These aircraft are quite capable of being operated at the former higher speeds, but we do not intend to permit that until all Electra aircraft operating on the domestic pattern have been so modified. The reason for this is that, for purposes of flight control, it is not thought advantageous to have aircraft of one type operating at different speeds. </para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade. I remind him that over the week-end, following the recent report of the Tariff Board ref using an increase of duty, representatives of the timber industry announced their intention to come to Canberra this week and make representations to the Minister for Trade for the imposition of an emergency duty. Can the Minister inform me whether those representations have been made? If they have been made, what is the result? </para>

                        <para>-  My information is that the meeting is to take place on Thursday of this week. A combination of circumstances has been operating in the timber industry. The Tariff Board declined the representations that were made to it and refused protection. There was a substantial increase in imports until about the end of November. Since then imports have declined quite appreciably. There has also been a fall-off in home building. The combination of higher imports and declining consumption in home building has created some difficulties. A conference will be held on Thursday to see whether a solution can be found. </para>

However, I am sure that the Commonwealth, as in the past, would co-operate with the States in measures to protect the health of the Australian people generally. </para>

Is it not also a fact that since the Tariff Board gave its finding the saw-milling interests have approached the Minister for Trade and requested that the matter be dealt with under the emergency powers contained in the tariff legislation that was passed by this Parliament last year? Is it not also a fact that the Minister requested those interests to provide him with additional information which, up to last week at any rate, had not been forthcoming? </para>

                        <para>-  My understanding of the position is that the meeting to be held on Thursday is for the very purpose of forming a panel representing the timber industry to put to the Department of Trade its case in support of the claim that some special action should be taken. That is where the matter rests at the moment. Senator McKellar will know that there is provision for a special reference to a  deputy chairman  of the Tariff Board to obtain a special duty. One difficult circumstance is that there is a Tariff Board report only a couple of months old; but that problem is to be discussed next Thursday. </para>

I think I convinced most honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> was completely off the track when he said that the Government did not have a dynamic policy in relation to oil search. The search for oil in Australia has reached the stage where I would hope, provided the Government maintains its present rate of expenditure and, if possible, increases it, that within the next three or four years oil in commercial quantities will be found in Australia. </para>

                                <para>-  In mentioning three or four years I was playing safe. The oil companies in Australia and the Bureau of Mineral Resources recognize that oil in commercial quantities does exist in Australia. Believing this to be so the Government has encouraged oil companies from overseas to invest in the establishment of oil refineries in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> is shaking his head. Let us look at the facts. When the Labour Government was in office we had one refinery operating, and that only in a small way. Under the present Government an oil refining industry has been established in the mainland States with the exception at present of South Australia and Queensland, but it has been announced that refineries will be built in those two States. Why has the Government encouraged oil companies to build refineries in each of the States? The answer is that each State has an oil-bearing potential. If we find oil to-morrow in Western Australia a refinery is already in existence there to meet the needs of the industry. The same statement applies to the finding of oil in Victoria or New South Wales and within a year or two it will apply in respect of Queensland and South Australia. So Australia is ready  to  go ahead with the refining of oil once it is found. What a terrific difference the finding of oil would make to our overseas balances! What a boon it would be to Australia if we could find oil here in quantities sufficiently large to satisfy our needs! So much for oil. </para>

                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition criticized the Government for encouraging overseas capital to help in the development of this nation. I was interested in a recent statement by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> that in the eighteen months prior to 1959-60 about £150,000,000 had been spent on the establishment of new industries in Australia. A great deal of that amount was provided from overseas. It is interesting to note also that factories to the value of £240,000,000 have been started here but have not yet been completed. The Government has encouraged overseas investment in this country as a means of solving our imbalanceofpayments problem. Australia is now forced to import the goods that those industries will be able to make here. When established those industries will employ large numbers of people.  So  the case put tor- ward on Thursday last  by  the Leader of the Opposition falls to the ground. He made no really constructive suggestion. All he did was to criticize the Government. He did not say what Labour would do if it were in office. </para>

                                <para>-  Very well. The Labour Party has already demonstrated what it will do if it gets into power. The people of Australia will judge the Labour Party on its record. In 1949 Australia's export income fell by £40,000,000 and the Labour Government allowed the unemployment figure to reach 25 per cent, of the work force. </para>

                                <para>- The record is in " Hansard ". I am sorry. If I referred to 1949 I was wrong. I meant to refer to 1929. When Australia's export income fell by £40,000,000 in 1929 the unemployment figure reached 25 per cent, of the work force. The government in office from 1929 to 1931 was a Labour government. Under a Labour government you will always have more unemployment than under a Liberal-Country Party government. On Thursday last I referred to the fact that in 1949 under Labour the unemployment figure was more than 5.6 per cent, of the total work force. </para>

                                <para>- All I can do is quote statistics; if they are incorrect, I must be incorrect. These statistics show that during the June quarter of 1948, a year during which there was not a coal strike, the unemployment figure reached 3.5 per cent, of the work force. I challenge any honorable senator opposite to point to any period during this Government's term of office when the unemployment figure has amounted to more than 3.5 per cent, of the work force. </para>

He also referred to the establishment of a paper mill. The matters referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Court</inline> were too numerous to mention. He is a conservative man and his estimate of £150,000,000 was a conservative one. If a Labour senator follows me in this debate, possibly he will tell me the extent to which capital expenditure on national development was encouraged by the Hawke Government from 1953 to 1959. </para>

But [ have told honorable senators opposite of national developmental programmes worth £150,000,000 upon which the Liberal Government in that State has embarked in the last two years. I again invite honorable senators opposite to examine the record of the Hawke Government over that period of six years and indicate one worthwhile developmental project that it initiated. Honorable senators are asked to produce only one such project. I repeat that I have been able to indicate developmental projects worth £150,000,000 that have been encouraged by a responsible Liberal government, supported by the Country Party. </para>

                                <para>-  I have been telling,  you  that for a long time. It is important to realize that it is only during the term of office of a Liberal-Australian Country' Party government that one oan expect development in this country. It is only during the term of office of that kind of government that capital funds will come in from overseas. As soon as the Labour Party is returned to office - if it ever is - it  will  prevent that flow of capital. Those who have the necessary money have not confidence in Labour. </para>

                        <para>I shall now make a few remarks about rural development which I think should be of interest to members of the Government. In days gone by we had a banking system which went along with our rural industries. The banks financed those industries on a year-to-year basis for the provision of capital improvements. That is why the rural industries have achieved such success. But I am rather of the opinion that to-day the banks are not supporting the development of our rural industries as they did in the past. In 1955 advances of the Australian trading banks to primary producers totalled £220,000,000. By 1960 that sum had risen to £236,000,000, an increase of £16,000,000. Advances  by  stock firms to their clients rose from -£67,000,000 in 1955 to £113,000,000 in 1960, an increase of £47,000,000. If we examine the relevant banking figures, we find that in 1958 the banks had £335,000,006 on deposit from the primary producers. In I960 the relevant sum was £360,000,000, an increase of approximately £25,000,000. It will be seen that in that period of six years the increase in advances made by the banks to their country clients was approximately £30,000,000 'less than that of the stock firms. </para>
                        <para>I can recall that when I was at home on the farm before I was elected to the Parliament every one around me used to deal with a trading bank and had very little to do with stock agents. But most of those people have changed their banks and some are dealing solely with stock .agents. I do not know that one can blame the banks entirely for that state of affairs. I understand that  the  trading banks are obliged to place some 17 per cent, of their deposits with the Reserve Bank, that they have to keep another 16 per cent, or more for liquidity purposes, and that they 'are instructed by the Reserve Bank what rate of interest they shall  'Charge  to primary producers and others. As honorable senators know, the maximum  Tate  is 7 per cent., the average rate is 6 per cent., and the rate for primary producers is <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent. It would seem that it is not profitable for the banks to advance to primary producers at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent. I would rather see the banks charging a uniform rate of interest so that a farmer would have 'the same opportunity to obtain finance from a bank as would manufacturing firms. </para>
                        <para>The Government may have to examine ways and means of finding capital for the further development of new rural areas. As I have already indicated., although deposits lodged by the rural community total £360,000,000, the total amount advanced to primary producers a couple of months ago - it has since decreased somewhat - was £236,000,000. On the other hand, we find that the banks have encouraged the manufacturing industries by advancing them a far greater percentage of the money they have on deposit. It is interesting to note that advances to the. manufacturing industries in .1958 totalled £154,000,000 and that in 1960 the sum was £213,000,000. Their deposits in 1959 were £130j000,000 and in 1960 they were £147,000,000. So in actual fact the banks have advanced to the manufacturing industries more money than those industries have on deposit. But they are advancing to the rural industries only approximately two-thirds of what is being held on deposit. That may be because of the desire to encourage the manufacturing industries, but I am inclined to think that the chief reason is that the manufacturing industries are paying an interest rate of .approximately 7 per cent, whereas the primary industries have to pay only <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent or <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> per cent., as the case may be. </para>
                        <para>The Commonwealth Development Bank was established! as a result of legislation introduced1 by this Government, and at the time of its establishment we hoped that it would "work smoothly. I notice that at the moment the bank is charging 6 per cent, interest on loans for developmental purposes. I wish to compare that position with the efforts of the Government of Western Australia, through the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia, to encourage rural development in the Esperance Downs area. At Esperance, there is a tract of country of approximately 4,000,000 acres which enjoys a rainfall of from 15 inches to 27 inches a year. It is suitable for grazing and cereal growing, and at the moment it is practically undeveloped. </para>
                        <para>The Rural and Industries Bank financed some of the settlers in the area, and at a later stage the State Government decided that it .also would advance money to assist development. It appointed the Esperance Plains Development Committee to examine ways and means by which the .government could assist the development of the Esperance Plains area. In 19.51 the committee came forward with a scheme to advance amounts of up to £1,000 to settlers with approximately 500 acres cleared, a house and some machinery. The amount of the maximum advance was subsequently increased to £4,500. </para>
                        <para>Originally, the committee recommended that loans should be free of interest for three years and1 that borrowers be exempted from the repayment of capital for five years. In 19.58, the scheme was further amended. The maximum loan was increased to £4,506, which was to be interest-free for five years. The term of the loan was increased to 35 years and settlers were exempted from repayments of capital for seven years. The committee appreciated the need for rural development. It also appreciated that it was necessary for settlers to be able to get their properties earning income before being required to repay the loans made to them. </para>
                        <para>The Development Bank is charging  6  per cent, right from the inception of its advances to primary producers. I do not believe that anybody who has to pay  6  per cent, interest on the money that he has borrowed to develop his property can really assist the development of rural industry. As I understand it, at present the trading banks have no incentive to put money into primary production. If we as a Government want to encourage the development of rural areas, we may need to devise ways and means to encourage the provision of capital for that purpose. Of course, such capital will have to be provided at low rates of interest.  1  suggest to the Government that it should consider the varying rates of interest that the banks are allowed to charge, with a view to encouraging the banks to return to the assistance of rural industries. I also suggest that the Government have a look at the recommendations of the Esperance Plains Development Committee. If the Government is of the opinion that development of the kind being carried out at Esperance is desirable, finance might be made available on a long-term basis, with interest and, sinking fund payments withheld until such time as the settler is able to get on his feet. </para>
                        <para>As honorable senators may be aware, approximately 80 per cent, of our income that is earned overseas is earned by primary products. Obviously, the quickest way to increase our export income is to encourage primary production. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline> at the time when the economic restrictions were imposed in November last, stated that the trading banks would be instructed through the Reserve Bank to make available finance for the purpose of carrying on rural industry. The purpose was to ensure that primary producers would be able to obtain money with which to purchase superphosphate and other such farming needs. That was the action of a responsible Treasurer who wished to see our primary industries being assisted to carry on. Of course, the Government cannot instruct a bank to look after an individual client; nevertheless, an instruction has gone out to the banks that they are not to curtail the advancing of money to primary producers, because it is the primary producers who can do most to earn the export income which is so necessary for Australia. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to a matter which I believe will be of interest to honorable senators. I refer to the rapid growth of communism and the number of Communists throughout the world. In 1939, there were approximately 170,000,000 people in the world who were controlled by Communists.

                                <para>-  1  am not giving causes. We know that the Communists are rapidly gaining control of increasing numbers of people throughout the world. It is our aim - and it is also the aim of honorable senators opposite, I hope - to keep Communists out of Australia. Last November, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> L. Sharkey, the secretary of the Communist Party in Australia, returned from a conference held in Moscow. On the way, he was feted in Peking -by the  deputy  leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Now that he has returned to Australia he will no doubt instruct the Communistcontrolled unions to do as he wishes, with a view to retarding the further development of Australia. We have seen the happenings on the Western Australian coalfields recently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latta,</inline> a self-confessed Communist, controlled the unionists and held them from their work for almost six weeks. </para>

                        <para>We have seen how the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, which is controlled by another self-confessed Communist, has developed stop and start strikes on the waterfront here, there and everywhere. In Fremantle, the waterside workers were out for more than ten days. Between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000 worth of products were on the wharfs at Fremantle awaiting export. The Communists prevented their export. No doubt that stoppage was the result of an instruction received from Moscow by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> L. Sharkey and relayed to the Australian waterfront. </para>
                        <para>There are other aspects of this matter which, cause me concern, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President.</inline> I believe that we can combat the kind of happenings to which I have referred, but .the aspect that concerns Australia most is the infiltration by Communists into the 'trade union movement. The Australian Labour Party has them on unity tickets. The Communists would not be able, alone, to return a member to this National Parliament, but I believe that they are rapidly gaining, control of the .trade union movement. That being so, and recognizing that it is by and large through the trade union movement that members of the Australian Labour Parity are in this chamber, we are rapidly approaching a time when we shall have in this Parliament trade union representatives whose policies are dictated by art outside group known as Communists, and that will be a tragedy for Australia. I say that with all sincerity. When the industrial groups endeavoured to keep the Communists out of the trade union movement they had a considerable amount of success. </para>

                                <para>- We have here a couple of their representatives. The honorable senator knows what they were. They were the ones who were fighting the Communists, as I have read in the book. Would the honorable senator like me to read the book to him so that he will know what the Communists are? I am not saying that anyone on the opposite side is a Communist. All I am saying is that the Communists 'are infiltrating the trade union movement, and 1 challenge the honorable senator to contradict that statement. Facts and figures prove that I am right. These are the people who will in future dictate the policy of the Labour Party, because, by and large, the trade union movement elects honorable senators opposite to this Parliament. That is one of the greatest 'tragedies that confronts us to-day and it is right that 1 should mention it in 'this chamber. It is highly dangerous that 'the Australian people can be controlled in this Parliament by an outside body, acting upon the dictates of Moscow and Peking. Honorable senators opposite cannot deny that the secretary of the Communist Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> L. Sharkey, returned' from the Moscow conference via Peking, or that he was entertained by the  Deputy  Premier of red China. Since his return we have had strikes on the waterfront and no doubt we shall have more in future. We have already had a strike at Fremantle, where goods to the value of £2,500,000 were held up for weeks awaiting shipment, because the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia decided that it would not work with the Foremen Stevedores Union. It was a dispute within the union movement itself, organized by the Communists and in defiance of a decision of the court. </para>

                                <para>- I think it should be made quite clear, when there is a stupid statement from the Opposition that a senator on this side may have received Communist preferences, that these second preferences go to any political party. If Communist Party candidates have No. 1 position on the ballot-paper, and their bitter enemies, the Liberals, have No. 2, the Liberals will, of course, get the Communist second preferences, because the Communists vote straight across the paper. They are so dopey that they do not know how to vote. If Labour Party candidates happen to be in No. 2 position, they will get the preferences. I am not objecting to that. What I am objecting to is the rapid growth of communism throughout the world to-day, the methods that communists are using to gain control of the Australian trade union movement, and the successes that they are having. In a few years, if we are not very careful, we may have the Labour Party in government. I do not say for a moment that one Labour representative will be a Communist, but I do say that Labour representatives will be dictated to and1 will obey the orders given to them by outside Communists. I refer to members of the Australian Communist Party, which this Government endeavoured to ban in 1951. However, the people of Australia said, " No ", in a referendum. In the campaign, the Leader of the Opposition went out and fought the Communists' cause, and all Opposition members who belonged to the great Australian Labour Party went out and fought for the rights of the Communists. It is interesting to note that six weeks prior to the referendum a gallup poll showed that 66 per cent, of the electors would vote for the granting of power to ban the Communist Party and that three days before the referendum, as a result of the exaggerations of the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Labour Party another gallup poll indicated that the referendum figures would break even. Upon the taking of the referendum, a majority of States was in favour, but because of the large population of New South Wales a majority of the Australian people voted against it. As a result, we cannot control the Communists. Being on this side of the chamber, I believe that the people should know what action the Communists are taking to achieve their objective, and the success with which they are meeting. When I go out on the public platform during the next election campaign, I shall have no hesitation in telling the electors of the rapid growth of communism and of the control that Communists may gain through the Australian Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>The Australian economy is expanding very rapidly. The Government is accused of proceeding in fits and starts, but we shall always proceed in fits and starts when the economy is balanced on a razor edge. We have to go first one way and then the other. That will always be so. I do not think there was ever a time when such wonderful success was obtained in establishing full employment as has been the case during this Government's term of office. </para>

                                <para>-  When Labour was in office, unemployment figures rose to 5 per cent, during the coal strike in the June quarter of 1949. In 1948, when there was no coal strike, the figure was 3.8 per cent. Yet now, When the figure is not more than 2 per cent, the honorable senator says that we could not help having full employment. If Labour is in government within five years, the unemployment figure will be not <inline font-style="italic">!5</inline> per cent, but 10 per cent., because Labour has not a single idea about developing the country. What the Labour Party wants to do is to cut up the cake that is already provided. That is the difference between Labour's policy and our policy. We believe in developing the country as we go along and dividing the good things that are made in Australia. The Labour Party says, in effect, " No. We are in office, we will throw out what we have and divide it amongst ourselves." Honorable senators know as well as I do that within five years not a single £1 would be coming into this country from overseas to provide for its development. </para>

                                <para>- All right, we were told that the Government would review the position later. We were told that the sales tax to be imposed on the motor industry was necessary. A couple of honorable senators on the other side realized what a terrible thing this Government was doing to many thousands of people in the Commonwealth of Australia. To the everlasting credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> notwithstanding all the pressure that was brought upon him within and outside his party - a party which at election times stumps the country and says its members are independent - he refused to vote for the legislation. He maintained his attitude notwithstanding all the pressure that was put upon him and the fact that members of his party refused to speak to him. </para>

                        <para>Before proceeding any further I should like to refer to some of the comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott.</inline> He referred to the unemployment position in 1929. He said 1949, but fortunately some one corrected him. He never knows where he is. He meant 1929, under the Scullin regime. Nobody will deny what he said. There was 25 per cent, unemployment at that time. It was a disgrace to this nation, but it was due to the administration of the Bruce-Page Government that 25 per cent, of the nation's work force was unemployed, in 1929. I venture to say that just as many will be unemployed after fourteen or fifteen years' administration by this Government. </para>

When the present Government took office in 1949 we had a state of full employment and money was available for all projects. We had the best economy of any country in the English-speaking world. We say that honorable senators opposite want to see a return in this country to the conditions that existed in 1929. They are looking for a recession, because they believe that the workers are getting too much. Their leaders are organizing the defeat of the Government when it goes before the electors in December next. Their leaders hope and trust that the Government will be defeated then, although I know that some of the rank and file members do not want to lose their seats. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> is smiling. He has drawn No. 1 position on the ballot-paper, and he cannot be defeated, but some of his colleagues have drawn No. 3 position on the ballot-paper and they are not too happy about the situation to-day. </para>

                        <para>The reason why we say that these people are not fair dinkum and that the Government does not want to hold the reins of office after next December is that we remember that four or five years ago a committee representing both sides of this Parliament was appointed to consider constitutional reform. Every member of this chamber who has studied the matter realizes that the Constitution must be altered if this country is to prosper. This Government received an almost unanimous interim report from the Constitutional Review Committee in 1958 and it received the final report in 1959, but legislation has not yet been introduced to provide for the committee's recommendations to be submitted to the people by referendum. However, I hope and trust that a referendum asking for additional powers for this Parliament will be conducted at the time of the next general election because no government can properly conduct the affairs of this nation under a Constitution that was drafted in the horse-and-buggy days. This Parliament must have greater powers before we can make an effort to advance Australia comparable to that which was made between 1941 and 1945 by the Curtin Government and the Chifley Government. </para>
                        <para>In another place, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has moved a very sincere motion of censure on the Government. As the procedures of this chamber do not permit us to do that, we have moved an amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Administrator's Speech. I wholeheartedly support the amendment, which was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> last Wednesday, and I trust that it will be carried. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> was speaking to the amendment, he had the audacity, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> to ask why the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was so often overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> was most indignant and said, in effect, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> should be ashamed of himself for criticizing the Prime Minister, who was overseas and doing a fine job. </para>

It ruined the Australian Government while Jim Scullin was overseas, trying to rectify the results of the bankrupt policy that had been applied by a previous administration. Apparently honorable senators opposite think that that was all right, because it  was  a Labour Prime Minister who was overseas. I want to say this to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> and other Government supporters in this chamber: Knowing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> will do as much harm while he is overseas on this occasion as he has done in the past, I look forward to next December, when the people will give a man of outstanding ability - the present Leader of the Labour Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell</inline> - the right to go overseas to attend to international affairs on behalf of Australia. </para>

I say in all sincerity to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> and to other members of the Government who are howling and squealing about some kind of a unity ticket that no political party should be allowed to interfere in the management of a trade union. If I belong to the Postal Workers Union, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> belongs to the Waterside Workers Federation and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> belongs to some other union, why should we tell the engineers union what to do?

                                <para>-  I have nothing to do with unity tickets and I have nothing to do with interference in the affairs of other trade unions. I belong to the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union, and I can give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> an assurance that no Com will be elected to any position in that union. I remind him that in the union to which he belongs, the graziers union, there are many Corns and many D.L.P supporters. I do not know whether they were elected on unity tickets, but I repeat that no Com will be elected to any office in the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union. If I do my job in that respect, I think I will have done a fair job. Our party has just held1 elections in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> has been elected secretary of the party and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stout</inline> has been elected  president. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know. I do not know the history of every man in our party. You seem to know it. Perhaps you will tell the Senate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was elected secretary and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stout</inline> was elected  president,  people opposed to our party told us that we had done wrong and that we were ruining the Labour Party. I read in the capitalist press that the Labour Party would, have to organize again with the Australian Democratic Labour Party. Our party has nothing to do with the Democratic Labour Party, the Liberal Party, the Country Party or the Communist Party. Our opponents might just as well say to us, "Why do you not have a lineup with the Liberal Party, such as it has with the Country Party? " </para>

                                <para>- No, we would not. We have nothing to do with the Democratic Labour Party. Those who created the party and the electors who have been voting for it are getting jack of it at the moment because they are losing their jobs. Unemployment brings things home to a man. Honorable senators on the other side of the chamber are sitting cosily, receiving a salary of £3,500 a year, just as I am. Most of them are not likely to lose their jobs, but some of them will do so in December. The supporters of the Democratic Labour Party who are losing their jobs in the motor and other industries are the people to whom the Government will have to look for support at the next election. But the Labour Party will come back as the only party that has a plan and a policy to give them economic stability and social security. </para>

                        <para>I have mentioned some of the promises that were made in 1949. Anti-Labour governments before 1949 and since 1949 have never produced any plan which would give stability. They have coasted along on the good seasons and the overseas demand for our primary products. Naturally, full employment flowed from that condition. Where is this Government's plan to meet an emergency? How has Australia got into the economic position in which it is to-day, when we have to submit to all this pernicious legislation? It has happened because the Government has had no plan. Although I hope it never happens, in the natural cycle of the seasons we have drought. What is the policy or plan of this Government if the Creator sends another drought to Australia? It has no such policy or plan. </para>
                        <para>Had it not been for the purchase of our wheat by China, what would we have done with all the surplus wheat we have? The Government is glad about that purchase, despite all its condemnation of China. 1 do not know what goes on in China or in Formosa. </para>

On the other hand, we cannot disregard the 660,000,000 Chinese who live on the mainland. I venture to say that, despite all the filthy propaganda that has been used against our party and people who have advocated the recognition of mainland China, in all probability the Prime Ministers who are meeting in London to-day will decide to recommend to the United Nations that Communist China be admitted to that organization. I have had the opportunity to go to the United Nations and I give this warning: If Communist China is not admitted, the day will come when the United Nations will be asking Communist China to join it. Those 660,000,000 people cannot be disregarded, much as we dislike their way of life. </para>

                            said that the Communists are gaining control. Of course they are! Independence is given to the Congo, Algeria and other places in Africa, but what is done then for those countries? The cream has been skimmed off them and then they are left with nothing. They have a potential which in many cases they do not know now to use, and in other cases they have not the money to enable them to use it. That is how they have been left. If colonies are to be given their independence, they must be given the ways and means by which to work their economies and they must be given some assistance. As I have said, this Government has coasted along without any plan.

Therefore, I say that the Government has no plan. If we are to have a stabilized economy we must have a plan. I remember that in February, 1942, the Labour Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> said - </para>

                        <para class="block">That is what the Labour Government was doing. I will return to that later. No sensible party or government wants to implement controls if it believes in our democratic way of life; but the Labour Government was forced to use controls, just as the Liberal Government was in 1939. When the war broke out in that year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> and his Government introduced controls of petrol, food, transport and many other things. That action was necessary because Australia was in danger. When the Labour Party took office in 1941 it continued the controls. If controls were necessary during the war, they were doubly necessary during the rehabilitation period in the post-war years from 1945 until Labour went out of office. During the depression years, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> pointed out to-day, 25 per cent, of the work force was unemployed. To get stability back into industry it was necessary to introduce controls. Those controls forced people to resist the purchase of luxury articles. Instead of spending money on such articles they kept it in their pockets. During the post-war years, from 1945 to 1949, it was necessary, in the interests of a stable economy, to regulate the building of homes. It was necessary also to regulate expenditure in other directions. That is why Labour retained controls. We believed that if we had remained in office after 1949, within a few years those controls could have been lifted because by then the economy would have become stable. </para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline>
                            will not suffer because he is well off. The people of Australia will very soon suffer severely because of the decision of this Government, in 1949 to allow prices to find their own level. Have prices found their own level? To-day's high prices are the cause of all our troubles. The Labour Party did not want prices control, but it was forced to impose such a control. It knew that vast areas of Europe had been devastated during the war. It knew that the cities, the towns, the corn fields and the vineyards had been destroyed. It knew that the people of Europe would bid high for Australia's primary produce. So it decided to fix a home consumption price for export commodities. Under Labour the basic wage would have remained at £5 10s. or £5 12s. a week. As much as possible of our surplus primary production would have been exported to the starving people in countries devastated by war and the proceeds of those exports would have been distributed on a pro rata basis amongst Australian producers. If that policy had been carried out Australia would now have a stable economy. To-day we find that wheat land is selling for as much as £65 an acre.

A Labour government would have kept the price of land stable. Under Labour it would not have been necessary to guarantee the farmer 14s. or 15s. a bushel for his wheat. But because of its commitments, the present Government is forced to give such a guarantee. If Communist China had not taken a large quantity of our wheat the Government would have been in the soup this year because wheat production has been high. </para>

Labour's plan was formulated for the benefit not of any individual section of the community but of the country as a whole. Everybody in Australia would have received a reasonable share of that which was produced. </para>

                                <para>-  It would depend on overseas demand. Supporters of this Government have received high prices for their wool. I know of many people who went .from wheat growing and dairying into the wool industry, but they have had their fingers burnt. Wool is finished! No matter what committees the Government may appoint to examine the wool industry, the price of wool will be governed by overseas demand. It does not matter how clever the members of your committees may be, before anything can be done for the wool industry the people who control pies - those who organize to buy the wool - must be defeated'. </para>

                                <para>-  I never at any time suggested that Labour would fix a price for wool. The only wool that needs fixing for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> is the wool over his eyes. I said that Labour would fix a home consumption price and that wool would be sold at world parity, which was then about 240 pence per lb. </para>

He will wish that he had never heard of the policy. In his policy speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> promised the people, amongst other things, security in the job of their choice through stable development of industry and flexible national works. He also promised that there would be no conscription of labour. But what did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> say in this chamber last week? No honorable senator opposite was disturbed by what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> said because supporters of the Government do not care about the ordinary working man. At election time supporters of the Government are blinded by Communist propaganda. Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> was asked what was to become of workers who had been put off by the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited. He said that they had been absorbed into other employment. Is that not conscription of labour? </para>

You have to go where you are directed." And out they went! I want to give the lie direct to what has been said on the other side of the chamber. If I am wrong, all I want the Minister for the Navy to do is to tell the Senate who those 600 men were and where they were reemployed. If they were re-employed through the Department of Labour and National Service, he must know where they have gone to work. I have before me a telegram from the Trades Hall Council in </para>

                        <para>When we look into the position created by this increase in the sales tax on cars, we find that prior to the introduction of this pernicious legislation in November last men were asked by the Ford company to transfer to Broadmeadows, where they would be guaranteed full employment. I believe that the Ford company was sincere in its statement. Those men agreed to go. They sold their homes in Geelong on a depressed market and bought new homes on a buoyant market in the Broadmeadows area on the assumption that they would be employed there permanently. But they did not know of the Federal Government's change of mind and probably they committed themselves for carpets, floor sweepers, washing machines and television sets. They have been given the sack. They have been left jobless at Broadmeadows, with all their commitments, because of the action taken by this Government in November but which it withdrew a couple of weeks ago. I praise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for having looked into the future and prophesied what would happen if the Government did that sort of thing. It is easy for honorable senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> to sit here in this chamber and smile. </para>

The shortest cut to communism is to create misery and poverty. No Communists will take this country while we have full employment. But if we create conditions similar to those which existed in 1934 and 1935 under an anti-Labour government, we will have communism. It will breed, and nothing will stop it. The only way in which to prevent communism is to provide social and economic security for the people. If we work men and women 32 hours a week instead of 40 hours and they receive the reduced pay for only 32 hours' work, we will breed communism. </para>

                        <para>I can recall that during the depression good tradesmen - carpenters, bricklayers and painters - who had fought for this country during World War I. were sacked, left their wives and children in Melbourne, walked the roads and became Corns. But when they got employment again they became stabilized. If we have unemployment, if we have people walking the roads and three or four men applying for one job, we will breed communism. Just recently a cleaner was required at the Melbourne Technical College. There were 25 applicants for the job! Bunny's in Glenhuntlyroad, Elsternwick, wanted a driver. Thirtyfive men had arrived by 8 a.m. to apply for the job! If you want to avoid communism, you cannot afford to have that sort of thing happening. </para>

                                <para>-  -If they did not go they would not have got anything. The Minister has quoted the unemployment figures. But let me point out that numerous workers do not go near the Department of Labour and National Service, because they have to wait for seven days before getting a mere pittance of a few shillings a week. Many of them never register for employment. So I venture to suggest that the level of unemployment is greater than the Government has stated it to be. </para>

                        <para>The Leader of the Government in the Senate asked recently, " What is wrong with our 1.7 per cent, unemployment?" He said that in the United States of America there are 6,000,000 unemployed - I believe that the figure is nearer 7,000,000. He also said that in Canada the position is worse than it is in Australia because there is 10 per cent, unemployment, and he went on to add that in England there are 800,000 unemployed. That is all very well. There arc millions of Communists in Russia, but that does not mean that we must be Communists too. There are millions of people starving in India and Egypt. Have we to starve because of that? Only the maladministration of this Government has brought about poverty in this country. </para>

I give him an assurance, which he may accept with confidence, that the people who devise the policies of the Australian Labour Party, which controlled the affairs of the nation from 1941 to 1949, will bring forward a policy that will lead to a return to economic stability in this country. We can and will do it. The people who constitute the Labour Party are not all lawyers, doctors, labourers or farmers; men from every walk of life beling to this great  movement.  They are the people who define the policies of the Australian Labour Party. The platform of the party has never changed since it was announced in 1901. We hope one day to see the socialization of the means of life. We hope and trust that one day that will come about, but in the journey to that goal there are many pitfalls. </para>

                                <para>- You  may smile, my friend. Our policy is to work gradually towards that goal, and we shall reach it some day. The people look forward to that time. Only last night I heard Professor Brown, during a television programme, speaking of the wonderful country of Denmark. In that country, which has a good socialist government, there is no unemployment; there is no one without a home; there is no one in want. We in Australia have greater potential than there is in Denmark, and we could enjoy the same advantages if we had a different government at the helm. </para>

                            has said that he is keeping his eye on the employment position. Let us have a look at the " Sydney Morning Herald " to see what it says about the matter. 1 do not imagine that honorable senators opposite would suggest that that newspaper supports the Labour Party. On 11th February last the "Sydney Morning Herald" stated that General MotorsHolden's Limited had put off 2,632 employees.

                                <para>-  It is a disgrace, and you can blame your Prime Minister for it. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> stuck to his guns and come over to vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> on this side of the chamber, this unemployment would not have occurred, because the additional sales tax on motor vehicles would not have been imposed. For some reason, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> changed his mind. On 14th February, the " Sydney Morning Herald " stated that the Ford motor company had sacked 813 employees. On 9th March, the company sacked an additional 980 employees, so that a total of approximately 4,500 people were dismissed- by those two motor companies. </para>

                        <para>Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> ever going to open his eyes? Cannot he see that something is wrong and that action must be taken if we are to have full employment in this country? In addition to the numbers dismissed by the companies I have mentioned, 170 employees of Borg-Warner (Australia) Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary company making component parts for motor vehicles, also were dismissed, together with 83 from Associated Battery Makers of Australia Proprietary Limited and many other employees of similar organizations. Those people have been thrown on to the scrap heap. What does the Government intend to do about it? What do the supporters of the Government think should be done? What action is to be taken to assist the 4,500 tradesmen, many of whom no doubt have entered into hire purchase commitments., who have been thrown to the wolves? </para>

                        <para>Who is to look after those people who have been dismissed from their employment? Has the Government no responsibility in the matter? After all, during the regime of this Government they have been induced' to purchase homes for £5,000 and £6,000, or to pay rent of as much as £5, £6 and £7 a week. Do not honorable senators opposite think that these men are entitled to some consideration? It should not be forgotten that some of them are returned servicemen who fought on the field of battle for this country. Are the supporters of the Government going to sit back and sneer and giggle at their plight? It seems to me that many of these poor men and their wives and children will be looking at empty plates this winter. It is up to this Government to honour this promise to implement full employment. There are many phases of the motor industry to which I could refer and which have been adversely affected by the Government's policy, but I do not propose to do so now. </para>
                        <para>Let me turn to another of the promises that the present Government parties made during the general election campaign of 1949. The Prime Minister stated that, if elected, the Liberal and Australian Country Parties would undertake a steady reduction in the rates of taxation, review indirect taxation and increase tax allowances for medical, dental and education expenses. In what way has the Government reduced taxation since 1949? The present Government parties won the election on the promise to which I have just referred, and other promises, but can any honorable senator opposite point to an instance in which taxation has been reduced? I say that taxation has increased tenfold since the Government came to office. </para>

                        <para>The Government has removed import controls. Until February last year, the Government had decided that articles of one kind would be allowed into the country and articles of another would not be allowed in. I have seen applications for import licences for component parts necessary for industrial operations which have been refused by the Government. Overnight, in February, 1959, the Government lifted all controls on imports. Surely honorable senators opposite have met people whose businesses have been ruined because of the overnight lifting of import controls. I have here a letter from the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. I do not wish to read it, but I shall do so if honorable senators opposite would like me to. The letter states that imported articles are being sold more cheaply in Australia than similar articles manufactured here. Some people may say that our costs are too great. Perhaps they are. If wheat land costs £65 an acre, costs of production must increase proportionately. This Government has lived from day to day and has been able to do so because of the good graces of our Creator, who has given us bountiful seasons. </para>
                        <para>We do not want controls, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> but if the Government wishes to increase Australia's export trade there must be some controls. The position should not be regulated by the freezing of funds. It should be regulated legitimately. If there is a commodity that it is necessary to import because it is essential to the manufacture of goods for export, I say that we have to allow it to come in, but some of the commodities we see in shop windows these days, such as canned chicken, should not be admitted. Who, for instance, thinks that we need to import canned chicken, frogs legs, chocolates, fish and fruit. Fancy Australia importing fruit! We should be exporting it. Because the Government has lifted the controls on imports, many such commodities are coming into the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wedgwood</inline> shakes her head to indicate that they do not. They will be found in Myer's store, next to the Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Melbourne. I do not blame Myer's; I blame the Government. Anybody will take an opportunity if it exists. Import controls have been lifted on these items. </para>

                                <para>-  That is a good question. But how will we get on if we sell all our wheat and have to buy it back? We will come to the same stage as we had in the depression, when wheat was ls. 7d. a bushel and wool was lid. per lb. There must be some stability between export and import. America has a tariff wall, just as China, India and the United Kingdom have tariff walls. All countries have some control, and why should they not? Why should we ruin one industry? </para>

                        <para>Housing is very important. What is the Government doing about it? It is tightening the control on funds. The value of building in progress in November last year amounted to £61,800,000, but only a month later, in December, it had fallen to £43,900,000. When I tried to obtain a home for a person in Melbourne, the Director of the Housing Commission of Victoria, told me that 18,000 people awaiting homes were on the books of the commission and that these included many returned soldiers who are the responsibility of this Government, but cannot get homes through the War Service Homes Division. Under our migration policy, hundreds of thousands of immigrants are coming to this country. I can take any doubting person in my car through the suburbs of Melbourne and show him six or seven families living in one room. They can afford to pay £10, £12, or £14 a week for this accommodation. Where does the returned soldier who fought for this country get accommodation? </para>

                                <para>- That is what 1 am told. I am told that they are living in Queensland, so the honorable senator had better be careful; he knows, how bad they are. The Government has since 1949 continued a smearing campaign against the Australian Labour Party. There is nothing new about it. I have just read Norman Makin's history of the Australian Labour Party, which shows that a similar smearing campaign has gone on ever since the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson's</inline> time. It went on long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> was sixteen years of age.. Of course, he changed his mind when he turned sixteen. The campaign has gone on ever since. Although the leaders and members of the great Australian Labour Party have been smeared, we have never changed our name, our platform or our policy, and we never will change them. The day will come when we will return to office. We hope it does not come in the circumstances in which it came in 1941, when a government elected by popular vote of the people reneged and discarded the reins of government in the greatest crisis that ever faced the Commonwealth. We do not want it to happen again, as it happened then when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> repudiated promises he made to the people, and left the country to the Japanese. We want the people to believe in Labour and to elect us on a popular franchise. That day will come, because this Government is doomed. Most thinking people who read the anaemic address given by the Administrator on behalf of the Government will agree with me. I heartily support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong.</inline></para>

                        <para>During my recent tour of Japan and some parts of South-East Asia I found that generally the small nations in that area were living in a constant state of dread of attack by Communist China. The state of their economies in some instance is not good by any means, but that was the least of their worries. The pressure of the 650,000,000 famine-stricken people in mainland China, and the appetite for power and expansion of the Chinese Communist leaders, constituted a source of fear and worry to all concerned among the smaller nations of South-East Asia. In a telegraphed news message to the " Courier Mail ", Brisbane, last week, Trevor Smith stated that the  President  of Pakistan had informed the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London that Communist China was covering the whole of South-East Asia with an army of 500,000 men fully equipped and trained for war. If that is true, the feelings of the smaller nations of that area  aTe  understandable. </para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">His Excellency,</inline>
                            the Administrator, said in his Speech in this Senate last week that the Commonwealth Government would do all in its power to promote steps towards universal disarmament under proper safeguards. However, I am satisfied that disarmament is an empty pipe dream unless Communist China reaches agreement with the rest of the world on this paramount issue. I do not think that Communist China wants disarmament, but I may be wrong. Whilst I was in Tokyo I noted a telegram in the " Japan Times ", an English language newspaper published there. It may interest members of the Senate to know that five daily English newspapers are published in Tokyo - three morning newspapers and two afternoon newspapers. They are published entirely in English. In October last year the " Japan Times " published a telegram from Peking in which the Foreign Minister in the Communist Government of China,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chen</inline>
                            Yi, called for intensification of military training for a massive attack on Taiwan. That does not look very healthy.
                        </para>
                        <para>It is my view - and I said so when speaking on disarmament at the Interparliamentary Union Congress in Tokyo - that an invitation should be sent to Communist China through the appropriate channel - Russia may be - to sit in on disarma- ment talks even without a seat in the United Nations at present. 1 mention these matters to show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> and those who think as he does that dangerous forces are at work in many parts of the world - forces which are far more worrying than the transient effects of the economic measures that are before this Parliament to-day. </para>
                        <para>I directed attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, in</inline> previous years to the dangers implicit in prices chasing wages and said that an awful crash was inevitable if the ever-rising spiral of costs was not corrected'. I have shown previously in this Senate - those who heard me will bear me out that this is rights  -  that wage increases granted in the early post-war years had been f ollowed, as surely as night follows day, by price increases in much the same proportion. This movement has continued ever since, until our manufacturing industries have largely been priced out of the markets of the world. </para>
                        <para>In my opinion, our industrial courts, I regret to say, in their judgments have generally failed to strike a balance between productivity and the cost of living, with the result that our export industries have suffered gravely. Annual wage and salary increases should not exceed increased productivity. In the United States of America, it is said that those who get more pay than is justified by their productivity earn the wooden nickel - that is, money which begins to lose or has lost its purchasing power. In other words, inflation is the great destroyer, and hits the wage earner hardest of all. The amount available to be shared amongst us all depends on how much we produce. If we produce more, we can pay more. Let that 'thought sink into the mind of every honorable senator in this chamber. The amount available to be shared depends on how much we produce. If we produce more of the goods that are required, we can have more. We can have better wages and better times. </para>
                        <para>Australians .generally have been living, in my view, beyond their means, both locally in this country and internationally, until inflationary boom conditions began to develop fast. Credit has been too easy. The motor car industry supplies proof of that. The burden of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson's</inline> complaint to-night is that the motor industry has been delivered a smashing blow. No fewer than 330,000 new motor vehicles were registered during 1960. Most of these vehicles were purchased on time payment through hire-purchase companies. At the end of 1960, the hire-purchase debt stood at £440,000,000, having increased by £60,000,000 during that year. Because of easy credit, people have been able to purchase motor cars and other manufactured1 goods on very small deposits - frequently on no deposit at all - with the result that those who have used the facilities of hire purchase now stand 'indebted to those companies in a sum of £440,000,000. Many of the hire-purchase companies have been offering up to 10 per cent, interest for money from the investing public in order to make sure of attracting sufficient funds for the redemption of short-term loans. In these circumstances, I say to you all that there was no escape; credit had to be restricted if economic stability was to be maintained. There is no answer to that. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister has pointed out that this high-interest borrowing outside the banking system had two evil effects. First, it increased the burden on the general run of taxpayers - that is you, me and the rest of us in this country - because the high interest payments were treated as business expenses and became deductible in taxation returns, to the point that 40 per cent, of the interest was being met by the Treasury. That means that it was being met with money collected from the Australian taxpayers as a whole. You, I and the rest of us in Australia have been making that tremendous contribution to the firms that are engaged in these high interest collections. We are paying to keep the crazy business going. Action has now been taken to prevent these high interest payments from being fully deductible for income tax purposes. Some changes have also been made in the bank interest rates. Interest on fixed deposits rose in November last from <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent, to 4i per cent, on a twelve months deposit basis. These measures are being taken to check this trend. </para>
                        <para>In the current financial year, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, 65</inline> per cent, of the cost of capital works, both Commonwealth and State, is being met from Commonwealth taxation revenue. This course has been forced on the Commonwealth because money urgently needed for national development, for the employment over a wide field of labourers who look for employment from these sources, has been attracted away from the savings banks and the field of public loans. The wisdom of using revenue for capital works depends largely on the point of view. Our big Snowy Mountains project, which has been superintended by our worthy leader in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> has been financed, as far as I know, up to the present from revenue sources. There are different points of view on it, but I want to say to the Senate that it is a source of pride to me - others may feel differently - that many great public works have been financed during our term of office without resort to borrowing, although I agree that the time has come to ease the burden on the present day taxpayers. As a result of these measures, I am sure that in the next financial year loan money will become much more abundant and by its use the taxpayer of the future will carry his share of the cost of public works constructed in this period of Australian development. In the next year, as the result of these economic measures, there will be a more abundant How of loan funds than has been the case in the past, and the taxpayer of the future will accept his share of the burden. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I take pride in the fact that over a period of years now we have been able to finance great developmental works out of revenue without incurring any loan responsibility for the people of this country. We have done our share. In the future, as loan money becomes available because of the Government's economic measures there will be better times and works will be financed largely from loan funds. So, the taxpayer of to-morrow will contribute his share to the cost of public works of this country by loan money being used for that purpose. </para>
                        <para>An interesting fact that I have always noted is that where borrowing is easy governments are prone to pursue a borrowboomandburst policy to court electoral popularity. I am not saying that that applies to the present Government only; it applies to all governments. In Canada in recent years government borrowings have been so large that not enough capital has been available for private investment. In Australia the reverse has been the position. There has been no shortage of capital for private investment, but insufficient money has been available for Government borrowing. Truly one man's meat is another man's poison. </para>

                                <para>- Of course they are. You know very well that while the present conditions have prevailed not only the local authorities but also the States and the Commonwealth itself have had to depend on a very limited supply of loan money. That is why the Government has been forced to use revenue for developmental works. That is also why there is a shortage of funds for local authorities. I hope that as a result of the Government's economic measures there will be a better day not only for the Commonwealth but also for the States and the local authorities; loan moneys will flow more freely and there will be better days for those bodies. </para>

                        <para>I point out that the boom in 1960 included an increased demand for imports, but our export income fell substantially because of the lower prices received for wool and other products on overseas markets. Let us never forget that 80 per cent, of our export income is derived from primary production. The result has been that our overseas balances have been caught between rising outgoings for record imports and reduced incoming returns from our exports. Our overseas balances are running down so fast that they create real concern. I confess that this weakness in our London funds is the greatest worry confronting the Government. After studying the facts involved in the present situation, I have supreme confidence that the present economic measures will gradually produce stability. </para>
                        <para>The Government has abolished import controls. That is a good move because trade is a two-way business. We cannot expect other nations to support us by liberally buying our goods if we are not prepared to buy goods from them in return. We cannot be dog-in-the-manger. That dog will not bark. We have to buy from other nations if we expect them to buy liberally from us. The abolition of import controls is all to the good. The Prime Minister's assurances that those controls will not be re-imposed are based on his solid belief that the balance of payments position can be safely held. I agree with him and with the general attitude of the Government to this issue. The balance of payments position can be safely held even when import controls have been abolished. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister has also given an assurance that the Government has no intention to devalue the Australian £1. During my tour of Japan and the South-East Asian countries, I was very humiliated to find that the money-changers were not very willing to accept Australian money. Honorable senators opposite are interjecting in an attempt to convey that this Government is responsible for that position. I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> had the chance to put matters right when he was in office, but he did not do so. The Australian £1 was not looked upon too kindly by the moneychangers in the ports which I visited. The English and American currencies were the ones they wanted in every case. I confess that that was a blow to my pride. Nevertheless, I see no point in devaluating the Australian £1 any further than it has been devalued to date. That would make our position with other countries very difficult. </para>
                        <para>In order to make our economic position doubly sure it is imperative for us to boost our exports and to encourage those engaged in secondary industry. The Government is giving major pay-roll and income tax concessions to encourage Australian manufacturing companies to concentrate on the exportation of their merchandise. I am all in favour of giving such concessions to those engaged in secondary industry who will make the effort to sell goods on the world's markets so that our London funds can be strengthened. They are making their efforts under very difficult conditions because of the high cost structure in this country. I believe it would be fair enough to give somewhat similar concessions to the exporters of primary products. After all, our wool-growers, dairy farmers, meat producers and cane-growers have been bearing the burden of maintaining our overseas funds and they should be given the same consideration as that given to the manufacturing industries. </para>
                        <para>I shall now refer to the subject of rural credit. Under the economic measures the trading banks have been given specific instructions to " bear in mind the need for providing finance for export production in the rural and mining industries and to give special consideration to the needs of rural customers affected by adverse conditions ". It should be emphasized that no farmer or grazier should be denied credit for stocking up with sheep or cattle if he has an abundance of feed following the recent good rains in many parts of Australia, irrespective of his credit worthiness. Financial houses can, cover their advances in such cases by stock mortgages. Even if a farmer or grazier is not considered credit worthy by the bank while he has feed and water on his property money should be made available for the stocking up of that property with sheep or cattle, as the case may be, that will provide export income. </para>

                                <para>-  The authority has been placed in the hands of the banking and financial houses. Generally speaking I think they are in favour of extending credit wherever possible. I -do not know of any farmer or grazier who has been treated badly by the banks but I have heard1 of some individuals, whose credit worthiness is not good, being denied credit despite the fact that their properties are well grassed and well watered owing to recent rains. It would be a waste of the land of this country, at a time when we need' produce for export, to withhold credit from a person who was not credit worthy but who desired to re-stock his property. Australia needs to raise as many sheep and cattle as the land will support in order to assist the export drive. We should use to the utmost the resources that nature has given us. If necessary the banks and financial institutions could secure their loans by taking stock mortgages. In that way farmers and graziers who would1 not qualify for a loan under normal circumstances would be able to contribute something towards this country's export income. </para>

                        <para>I hope that a matter as important as this one is not left entirely to the judgment of a country bank manager who may not have a proper appreciation or understanding of the directive that was issued to the banks. Such a manager may know a farmer who has been an unsatisfactory client of the bank in the past and with whom the bank no longer wishes to do business. Because of the bounty of nature that farmer's property may now be well grassed and his dams may be full of water, but he is told that he cannot obtain credit with which to stock his property. A farmer in that position should be able to overcome his difficulty by negotiating a stock mortgage with the financial institution. I hope that no man on the land is denied credit as a result of the Government's action. </para>
                        <para>The sale to mainland China of wheat and barley worth £27,000,000 will certainly make a valuable contribution to our overseas funds in the current financial year if sufficient loading berths can be assured for the number of ships required to move such a huge quantity of grain. Latest reports suggest that if the Australian Wheat Board can deliver the grain to mainland Chinese ports not later than October next there is a good1 chance of negotiating a further sale of wheat to China, estimated to be worth an additional £30,000,000. That will mean an export earning of about £60,000,000 - a wonderful shot in the arm. I hope that we can make those sales to mainland China because we badly need outlets for our big surplus of wheat. </para>
                        <para>The dairy farmers are pleased at the decision of the Government to maintain the annual subsidy to the industry until 30th June, 1962. The Commonwealth Government has also indicated that it is prepared to discuss at the appropriate time with the State governments concerned and leaders of the dairying industry the basis for a further five-year stabilization plan beyond 30th June, 1962. </para>
                        <para>Undoubtedly quite a number of people have been hurt by the credit restrictions. In particular the motor trade has suffered but from my observations the great majority of citizens has felt very little discomfort from the Government's measures. We have only to look around us to see how few people, other than those associated with hire-purchase companies and the motor trade, have been affected badly by these measures. The Government acted and a few particularly vulnerable industries will feel for a time the effects of the pinch. If the Government's action had been deferred until next year or later I believe that  a  much wider range of people would have been affected. The hire-purchase companies and the motor manufacturers have had a long and very profitable run. Let there be no mistake about that. Those people cannot expect that run to go on indefinitely. The whole tone of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson's</inline> speech was that the Government should not have interfered at all - that the motor trade and the hire-purchase companies should have been allowed full rein to pursue a policy of laisser-faire. Should the motor manufacturers and the hire purchase companies have been allowed to go on without reduction, like the words from the song " Kathleen Mavoureen ", may be for years and may be forever? Those people have had a good go and they cannot expect to be allowed indefinitely to draw off the great bulk of investment funds at cates of interest much higher than those offered by1 Commonwealth bonds. The work of national development must proceed. How can it be done without funds? We had reached the crossroads and a decision had to be made. Were the motor manufacturers and the hire-purchase companies to be allowed to draw off the great bulk of investment funds, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> suggested, or was the Commonwealth to receive a fair share of those funds? That is the decision that had to be made. What decision would honorable senators opposite make?' I know where I stand and I think I know where most thinking people in Australia stand on this issue. </para>
                        <para>The Government envisages schemes of vigorous road development in north and north-western Queensland, the Northern Territory and the northern part of Western Australia in order to assist the beef and other export industries there. It envisages the improvement of port and loading facilities for the export of coal, lt envisages standard gauge railways between Broken Hill and Port Pirie and between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle as vital links in our export trade. The Government believes that, by the provision of better rail and road transport facilities, the cattle industry can be geared to earn a further £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 per annum in exports. With my knowledge of the cattle areas of this country I think this can be done. If good loading facilities are provided it is estimated that a further  £10,000,000  per annum can be earned from the export of coal. I think it can safely be said that once the railway between Mount Isa and Townsville has been reconditioned the production of metals and ores from Mount Isa, Mary Kathleen and elsewhere in that area can be stepped up sufficiently to earn £20,000,000 per annum over and above the current value of exports from the area. </para>
                        <para>The goal is a big one but it is being approached quickly in north-western Queensland. Our greatest potential for export earnings is our wool if only some sensible method of selling it can be devised. Under the present system we are not selling our wool for profit; we are giving it away at bargain prices. Wool is our greatest exportable asset. Our wool clip is fully sold every year, notwithstanding the gloomy predictions that have been made over the last 40 years about competition from synthetic fibres. </para>
                        <para>The Commonwealth Government has appointed a wool inquiry commission, and I can only hope that some good recommendations will emanate from that commission. The- intrinsic value of wool - the genuine, inherent or basic value - to the world is far greater than our growers are able to secure on markets which are governed by pies and other restrictive practices in order to keep down the price. We need a more sensible method of marketing our wool. Improved methods of marketing would mean .tremendous additions to our export wealth. There are so many people pulling against one another that our greatest asset is not producing the wealth that this country is entitled to derive from it. We must find a better selling method. </para>

                            meant that every manufacturer of woollen goods would like to see a basic price for wool. Price falls provide opportunities for the speculators, but they mean a loss for the manufacturer of woollen goods. Under the auction system, a great number of speculators buy on the low market and sell on the top market.

                        <para class="block">They are the men who reap the rich profits that are to be found on the happy hunting ground of wool auctions. The man who is engaged in the manufacture of woollen fabrics, whether he be in Australia or elsewhere in the world, wants to have a basic figure below Which he knows the price of wool will not fall. He is prepared' to compete at that level, but he does not want to be the victim of circumstances in which his competitors are able to buy at a much lower price after he has bought his wool. The manufacturers, the really good members of the wool business, are not getting a fair go at our auctions. As I said earlier, the speculator is getting all the profits. </para>
                        <para>A basic price for wool is of the essence of the floor price plan about which we have heard a lot in recent times, and which I am glad to say is attracting a greater number of supporters each year. Large numbers of wool-growers are looking forward hopefully to the recommendations of the wool inquiry. Having been a wool-grower, I have seen the game played from the selling side and the growing side, and I want to tell honorable senators that things are not right in the wool industry and that every year Australia is losing a king's ransom through the manipulation of the wool auctions. If honorable senators want proof of that statement, let them read the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cook of New South Wales, who was appointed a couple of years ago to inquire into the trouble at Goulburn and the wool industry generally in New South Wales.  His  report is in the Library and is available to every one with an inquiring mind to read. In fact, in my view, we do not now need a wool inquiry commission. If we were to take note of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cook's report, we would have all we needed to enable us to take the requisite action to rectify the present state of affairs. </para>
                        <para>We cannot do anything without the goodwill of the wool-growers throughout Australia. I regret to say that there are always great differences of opinion and that we have not been able so far to get a majority view on a right and sensible method to sell our wool. I repeat that as a result of our present selling methods we are losing large sums of money. If we were to get what I describe as being the intrinsic value of wool - the genuine value, the basic value - we would be able to put our overseas balances in credit ten times over. But we are not getting that value. If only we could evolve a satisfactory method of marketing our wool, we would find a solution to our present problems. But tremendous influences are at work in this country to prevent that being done. </para>
                        <para>The Comalco company, in partnership with the Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corporation, expects to raise the aluminium production capacity of the Bell Bay smelters in Tasmania to 25,000 tons annually by 1964 and to 60,000 tons per annum later. In Queensland, the Comalco company expects to have a 360,000 ton per annum alumina plant operating at Weipa by mid- 1966, involving an 'expenditure of from £30,000,000 to £40,000,000. Thus an aluminium industry will be established on the eastern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is estimated that almost one-third of the production of this plant will be sold outside Australia, so a big source of export income is being established. The development of this industry will mean to the Cape York Peninsula what Mount Isa has meant to north-west Queensland. </para>

                        <para>The mineral yield in Queensland rose last year by 16.4 per cent, above that of the previous year. I should say that the bulk of the metals produced would be exported to overseas markets. I wish to say something about sugar, which is an important Australian industry, particularly in Queensland. In support of my contention that not everything ls wrong in the Australian scene to-day, I point out that during 1960 a record total of 776,061 tons of raw sugar was exported overseas. The 1961 sugar crop is estimated to be worth about £67,000,000 to the Australian raw sugar producers. The export ingredient of that sum will approximate £32,000,000, while the balance of £35,000,;000 will come from sales of sugar for home consumption. It will thus be seen that our great sugar industry is pulling its weight in the field of exports. </para>

When we (have passed through this <inline font-style="italic">period</inline> of adjustment and have corrected the weaknesses which have appeared in our economy, I feel certain that we shall continue to enjoy the wonderful run of prosperity and full employment that have been the outstanding features of the present Government's long term of office. I reject the doleful amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> and' support the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-RepIy. </para>

                            <para>. - I associate myself with the expressions of loyalty to  Her  Majesty the Queen that are embodied in the Address-in-Reply. I wish to express my very profound personal regret at the unfortunate and untimely death of our late Governor-General, Lord Dunrossil. I feel that it was a great tragedy for a man who had occupied the positions that Lord Dunrossil had occupied, and who had been selected for what is probably one of the greatest positions to which a citizen of the British Commonwealth can aspire, to die so soon after reaching the shores of Australia. As has been truly said, he died at the height of his fame. Whatever our political thoughts might be, we cannot help but feel melancholy about it. </para>

                        <para>Having said that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> I wish to say that I subscribe wholeheartedly to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline> to which he so ably spoke when the debate was in its infant stages. If I can avoid doing so, it is not my intention to indulge in tedious repetition. I feel that there is in this chamber far too much repetition and re-hashing of things that have been said before. I shall endeavour to do my best to make a new approach to the situation that we are discussing and perhaps to introduce one or two new arguments to the debate. Whilst the matter is fresh in my mind, I want to make one reference only to the speech that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher.</inline> He said that as a consequence of the Government's credit restrictions and other economic measures only two sections of the Australian business community had suffered, and he cited hire-purchase companies and the motor body building industry. I think that even his colleagues would1 disagree with the contention that only two sections of Australia's economic life had been adversely affected by the Government's economic policy. Has not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> heard of the electrical trade? Does he not know that the firm of Pope Products Limited, in South Australia, and its counterparts in other States, have been forced to retrench large numbers of employees as a direct consequence of the Government's economic measures? I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> nodding his head in agreement. </para>

                                <para>-  I must have made  a  mistake. The honorable senator's head must have been nodding for some other reason. It appeared to me that he was nodding agreement. He must know, as I know, that there have been substantial retrenchments by Pope Products Limited, Philips Electric Industries Proprietary Limited, and other electrical firms in South Australia, which deal in television and other electrical equipment. There have been many retrenchments and statements have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Barton</inline> Pope and other leading industrialists in South Australia. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> not heard of the textile industry and the difficulties confronting it as a result of the Government's economic measures? Has he not heard of the building trade and its troubles, and has he not read the statements made by those people who occupy leading positions in that industry? When he tries to dismiss the position with an airy statement that only two sections of our business life are affected by these credit restrictions, he is adopting a completely unrealistic attitude. </para>

                                <para>-  I propose to have something to say about that at a later stage of my address. It might be timely to introduce another note into this debate now. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> spoke, on behalf of the Government, in opposition to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline> he said that he expected the Opposition to criticize the Government, and that there was nothing unusual about that. He said that what he called the carping criticism coming from the Opposition benches could be easily discarded when one took into consideration the biased nature of the Opposition. Let us take the position as it stands. It is not so much a question of the Opposition's criticizing the Government on its measures in the last twelve months as of that person to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> so frequently referred in his speech, the man in the street, critcizing the Government. Let us see what he has to say and what he is thinking about the matter. If his thoughts run parallel to the thoughts of the Australian Labour Party, which is  Her  Majesty's Opposition, even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> must acknowledge the validity of the criticism that we level against the Government, especially as that criticism is endorsed by supporters of the Government. I propose to submit at a later stage proof that the Opposition does not condemn merely by virtue of the nature and structure of our parliamentary life. The things that we say are being said through the length and breadth of the country. </para>

                            referred to the bias of critics, no doubt arrogantly implying that nobody had the right to criticize the Government and that no criticism could have any validity because of the excellence of the Government. That intolerance was directed not so much against us in this chamber as against the people who assisted this Government into office. I refer to the big business institutions of Australia. They are the ones who are criticizing the Government's activities and they are in the best position to know just what has been the effect of the Government's measures upon the economic life of Australia.

                                <para>- Thank you. In effect, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> is saying, although he is skirting around the problem, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Barton</inline> Pope was handling the truth carelessly when he made a statement about the Government's economic measures. I am particularly interested in the question of unemployment, and especially in its relation to South Australia. Last week I asked a question which was answered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> as Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. He gave what I consider was a Silly Willie reply. I asked for the numbers of people unemployed throughout Australia and the numbers in the respective States. I went on to ask whether the Minister, in replying, would refrain from confusing the position by reference to the alleged number of what are called unfilled vacancies. 1 have a great respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton's</inline> mental ability. I do not think I am doing him an injustice when I say that he appreciated fully what was implied in the latter part of the question, but he preferred, as I said, to play Silly Willie because it was a question that embarrassed the Government. On every occasion when we have probed the Minister for Labour and National Service through the Minister who represents him in this Senate, and when the probe has been made directly in another place, we have had given to us - in addition to a number of unemployed totalling, say, 66,000 at a given date - some further information. In order that the position can be blanketed in some way the Minister carefully goes on to say that there are some 50,000 unfilled vacancies. I have said on many occasions, but I want to repeat the statement in order to give it added emphasis, that this is a dishonest approach to the situation. The expression is used in an attempt to create the impression that despite the fact that some 66,000 people are unemployed in, say, March, 1961, they can readily accept another job. That is not the case at all, and it certainly has no application to the position which exists in South Australia at present. All this vague talk of unfilled vacancies is most unfortunate. </para>

                        <para>The Government speaks of its dampeningdown process. It is extraordinary how many words have been coined by the Government in the last four or five years as a subterfuge to hide its real intent. Ministers talk no longer of unemployment, but of disemployment. Certain sections of the business world are to be dampened down, not dealt with. Big businesses are referred to as fringe institutions. This play on words is quite dishonest. It is interesting in a way, but it is an attempt to disguise the intent and the result of the Government's activities. You can disregard, in the main, all these answers about unfilled vacancies and go back to the basic fact that the fellow who was a process worker in General Motors- </para>
                        <para class="block">Holden's Limited, and who was dismissed as the result of the Government's measures, is not eligible for the type of vacancy which is so glibly referred to by the Minister for Labour and National Service in another place and by the Minister representing him in the Senate. </para>
                        <para>I was interested enough to have a look at the advertisements in the Adelaide "Advertiser" to-day to see just what was offering in the field of employment and just what these unfilled vacancies were. I found that there were only 118 advertisements from employers seeking labour. A large proportion of them were seeking juveniles, and a fair proportion were seeking highly skilled tradesmen with qualifications that no process worker who had been dismissed from General Motors-Hold en's Limited could possibly possess. A number of housemaids were required. That is a very significant thing. We have not seen those advertisements frequently in latter years. I do not know whether it is a trend back to the old order, but it is significant that there were a number of such advertisements. There were only about half a dozen advertisements for labourers or process workers - people who might be looking for work because they have been dismissed from the motor body industry as a consequence of this Government's activities. Each applicant was required to have experience in the building trade or experience in scaffolding. Those who have some 'knowledge of the building industry will know that a good builder's labourer is a man who is required to employ a fair degree of skill. </para>
                        <para>What I have just mentioned exposes, I feel, the airy-fairy nature of statements by Ministers about unfilled vacancies. It is no good to Bill Jones, who has been dismissed from General Motors-Holden's Limited, to be told that there are plenty of vacancies for university lecturers, or that there are a number of vacancies for 'technicians in the field of radio and television. It is no skin off the nose for the Minister to talk in the terms of these vacancies, but the man in the street, about whom he refers so frequently, is not qualified to take jobs listed1 in the unfilled vacancy field. He is what he professes to be, namely, a process worker. </para>
                        <para>I say with every degree  of  sincerity that I can muster that there are men in South Australia to-day over the age of 50 years who have been put off from the motor body building industry as the result of this Government's activities and who are now practically in the unemployable class. Nobody wants them. They are the forgotten legion the way the world is moving to-day. Do not tell me that I do not know what I am talking about. A member of my own family who is in this age group has the ability and mental agility to work and hold his own- in most places, but he cannot find employment because he is in the wrong age group. No man over the age of 50 years who is put off in this country in this time of selective employment will find employment unless he is extraordinarily highly skilled. It is hopeless for any member of the Government to try to say that this sort of thing is not happening in every State of the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>Then again we hear talk of 1.5 per cent, or 1.7 per cent, of the total work force in Australia being unemployed. I have pointed out that that is not a true reflection of the unemployment position in this country because it covers only the number of people who are registered as unemployed It is well known that there is a transition period1 between the day on which a man becomes unemployed and the day on which he claims unemployment benefit. When a man ceases to be employed in one industry he is prepared' for a week, or a fortnight or perhaps a month, to give it a go to find another position rather than approach the Department of Labour and National Service and claim unemployment benefit. The picture presented by the Government is a phoney one which has been carefully designed to prevent the general public from understanding what the employment position in Australia is at any given time. </para>

                                <para>-  Before I go on to explain how I would remedy the position let me say that it is not solely my responsibility to remedy the situation. However, I think it could be remedied by going back to the situation that existed when Labour was last in office. I know that Government supporters will say that there was unemployment then. They will talk in terms of some 3 per cent, or 5 per cent, of unemployment in 1949. That is completely dishonest, because the only unemployment in 1949, which the Government is so fond of referring to because a Labour government was in office at the time, was caused solely because a coal strike occurred that year. Honorable senators opposite know that that is a fact and they know also that during the régime of the Labour Government there was no unemployment. When they talk about conditions under the Labour Administration between 1945, when the war ended, and 1949 they talk about controls and restrictions. That is what they have done during this debate. It has been said that all sorts of things happened in the four years before the Liberal Government took over. I think that honorable senators opposite tend to forget many things that happened between 1945 and 1949. </para>

It ill becomes the Government to speak sneeringly about what happened in those years and about the efforts of the people who served on various rehabilitation boards. 1 sat on one of those boards, on which there were men who had a political outlook different from mine and who probably disagreed very bitterly with my views. Their views were the political views of this Government, and 1 say that you do less than justice to those people when you talk disparagingly of the work they did under a Labour administration.

                                <para>- I shall refer to your colleagues. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> who is a very clever advocate, had a lot to say about the alleged deficiencies of those years. If honorable senators will read the report of his speech, they will find that what I am saying is true. All I am setting out to do is to present in perspective the position that existed between 1945 and .1949. If honorable senators want to make comparisons between the conditions in those days and the conditions of to-day they should have full regard for the situation that then existed and the difficulties of the time. If their tolerance permits them to do so, they should even go so far as to imagine themselves in the position  of  an administration which had to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of returned servicemen and place them in industry. That administration had to give consideration to the problems of those ex-servicemen - some of them were very big problems - and it successfully carried out its task. When honorable senators opposite refer to some of the things that </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para class="block">Labour did not do when it had an opportunity to do them, they should remember the basic task that confronted the Labour Government. It was to rehabilitate eXservice personnel, and I should think that every decent-minded citizen in this country would acknowledge that everything else had to take second place to that very laudable objective. When honorable senators opposite make comparisons, all I ask them to do is to acknowledge the things that Labour did in those years. </para>
                        <para>I said at the outset that I would establish that it is not only the Labour Party that is attacking the Government on its economic measures. Many people who are more closely identified with the Government than perhaps we are, and who have been its most ardent supporters, have views similar to ours on this matter. Before I touch on that point, however, I want to make reference to the Government's decision last year to increase the sales tax on motor vehicles by 10 per cent. The increased tax was applied for three months. A couple of Government senators said at the time, as we on the Opposition benches were saying, that the increased tax should not be imposed. They were quite vocal about the matter, and one went to the extent of voting against the measure. Without trying to weep crocodile tears on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood's</inline> behalf, I say that he was consistent in his attitude and that time has vindicated his approach to the matter. </para>
                        <para>What really happened as a result of the increase of the rate of sales tax on motor cars? All that the Government succeeded in doing was savagely to penalize every person who bought a motor car during the period of three months that the increase from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, applied. It was never suggested by the Opposition that the only nigger in the woodpile as far as the motor body building industry was concerned was the 10 per cent, increase in sales tax. We knew that it would have some effect on that industry but we also knew that the credit restrictions would have a damaging effect. I say that the 10 per cent, increase of sales tax was an unnecessary and savage penalty on a section of the Australian motoring public. What it really meant was that everybody who bought a car in the period between November of last year and a week or so ago had to pay an <inline font-style="italic">extra.</inline> £100, or ever more, for the vehicle. Anyone who bought  a  car prior to the increase of sales tax in November  last did  not have to pay the additional amount, and anyone who has bought a motor car since the additional tax was lifted will not  have  to pay that additional amount.  As  I have said, all that the Government succeeded in doing was to inflict a savage penalty on  one  section of the Australian community. </para>
                        <para>Then, at the very time when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> was defending the increased sales tax on motor cars, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> dropped a bombshell. On the eve of his departure for overseas, he announced that the additional tax would be removed. The Treasurer was left, like Mohammed's coffin, suspended between heaven and earth. Obviously, he was not consulted before the Prime Minister dropped this bombshell. I &lt;1o not know whether the additional sales tax that was paid by purchasers of motor cars during this three-month period can be refunded, but I say that if it is possible the Government should do so. The fact that this additional tax was removed within three months of its imposition proves conclusively that the Government should not have imposed it in the first place. I know that if I had bought a car during that period and had to pay an extra £100 because of the additional sales tax, I would not think it unreasonable to expect that that amount should be refunded to me. </para>

                                <para>-  The Government does not usually adopt such a hit-and-run policy on all items that are subject to sales tax. The Government imposed this increase against widespread opposition and against the advice of the Opposition. It kept it on for three months and then suddenly lifted it. That proves conclusively that it should never have been imposed in the first place. I say that it is not an unreasonable criticism of the Government to say that people who bought cars during that period were savagely penalized. There is no doubt about that. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ridley</inline> said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> has a vested interest in the Government. He can make such a sacrificing gesture and smile. On his ministerial salary he probably would not be as adversely affected financially as some other people who bought cars during the period when the increased sales tax was in operation. </para>

                        <para>I want to refer to some of the critics of the Government. I shall leave the opposition from the Australian Labour Party and refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland who from time to time has made statements which Government supporters have seen fit to eulogize because those statements have supported Government policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas,</inline> in his latest economic review, has hit the Government for six, so to speak, because some of the things he said are exactly the things that we have been saying. I do not think that anybody would suggest that there is a unity ticket between the Australian Labour Party and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland. So, we can only assume that he has arrived at his conclusions without any assistance from anybody on this side of the chamber. </para>

                                <para>- It is surprising to me because if my memory serves me correctly I can remember statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland which have been quoted by supporters of the Government in order to foster the idea that they are doing a good job. I would class <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> as an impartial person who makes his statements after careful consideration of the position. At least he has one advantage that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> and I do not possess, and that is that he is accounted an expert in the field of economics. </para>

                                is a shrewd prophet when he says that internal conditions may force a return to import controls.

                        <para class="block">I think that he would be a pretty good prophet. I know that when we have talked about the re-imposition of import controls supporters of the Government have said, " Over our collective dead bodies ". I do not believe that. The hit-and-run policy the Government has adopted during the last four or five years will make the reimposition of import restrictions inevitable. I am not impressed by any denial by any supporter of the Government during this debate that import restrictions will be re-imposed. I am certain that they will be re-imposed and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland is on the right track when he also contends that. </para>
                        <para>I come now to another criticism of the Government, not toy the Australian Labour Party but by the Government's own supporters or people who might reasonably be expected to be its supporters. The Victorian Employers Federation, m its newsletter, has discounted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner's</inline> claim that the Government's financial policy would lead to the building of more homes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> said, in effect, that more homes would be built by the Government and that the credit restrictions and the economic squeeze would not affect the positron. Government figures released the next day showed a drop of 43 per cent, in the housing and flats approvals in January, compared with the same period last year. The newsletter continued - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>Before the credit squeeze there was an 18 months' lag in housing. Clearly, with fewer homes being built this gap is increasing during the credit squeeze, not narrowing. How can more and cheaper homes be built when there is less finance available to build homes? Further, builders' costs are rising because of reduced activity. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">The article concludes with these words - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The housing and migration programmes are closely linked. We cannot sustain a full migration programme if our housing is restricted. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>So, again we hear the voice of the critic. In this instance the critic was a very important group of men associated with the Victorian Employers Federation. It is not only the Australian Labour Party that is criticizing the Government's policy and attacking the Government in terms of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong.</inline> The Government is being attacked from outside the Parliament also. What we are saying in this chamber is being echoed outside it, or is being said outside before we say it. The same note of criticism runs through all the statements, and every article expresses the same fear - that the Government has gone too far along the road of expediency and consequently the economic problems of the country will be worsened. </para>
                        <para>I ask honorable senators to listen to a statement made by the secretary of the Co-operative Housing Society of Victoria only yesterday. He was referring to a drop of 16 per cent, in home-building in Victoria. The secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> A. Collins, said - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>If this trend continues beyond March 31st there will scarcely be any large-scale builders left in the home building field. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">What is the position? Is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> lying or rs he telling the truth? It is quite easy to dismiss the Opposition's criticism by saying that its job is to oppose and to criti cize and that it is here to bury Caesar not to praise him, and therefore its criticism has no validity because of its partisanship. I freely admit that that argument can be put forward on the basis of logic. But you cannot ignore the criticism of the Victorian Employers Federation. You cannot ignore the criticisms of Professor <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland and his business and economic associates. You cannot ignore the voice of the co-operative building societies when they say that home-building in Australia is in a serious plight. No matter how carelessly honorable senators opposite dismiss with a sneer and a flourish criticism levelled from this side of the chamber, they cannot still the voice from outside - the voice which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> so aptly described as the voice of the critic. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to what I consider a very important matter - one that I have referred to on every possible occasion in this Senate, namely, the serious shortage of steel in Australia. It may be remembered that in my first speech in this chamber I dealt with the shortage of steel. That was back in 1953. During subsequent debates I have from time to time referred to this matter and I have pointed out that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, excellent firm though it may be in other respects, has limited steel production in Australia to suit its own ends and has been permitted by Liberal governments in the States and in the Commonwealth to dictate the terms under which steel will be produced in Australia. Nobody can deny the truth of that statement. The B.H.P. has been allowed to dictate its own terms in relation to steel production. Our need for steel is becoming more imperative and impelling every month. We have been forced to import steel, thus depleting our overseas balances. Steel can be produced in Australia at less than half the cost of imported steel. It is stupid for any government to allow a monopoly to dictate terms to it and to force it to dance to the tune called by that monopoly. The B.H.P. has restricted the output of steel to suit the interests of its shareholders and each year Australia is faced with a shortage of steel. </para>
                        <para>Let us keep political considerations out of this matter of steel production. The Government should tell the B.H.P. that if it cannot satisfy Australia's requirements, the Government will step in and do the job itself. The Government should take a firm stand in this matter. 1 understand that an honorable senator from the Government side of the chamber has on the notice-paper a motion calling for a discussion of the steel industry. If my understanding is correct I commend the honorable senator concerned. By all means let us have a discussion on this matter as quickly as possible and if the B.H.P. is limiting the output of steel, let us do something about it immediately. </para>

                                <para>-  I cannot give the figures offhand, but 'the rate of increase since 1953 has by no means kept pace with Australia's increased requirements of steel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> may be aware, as most honorable senators are, that I am not the first to sound a warning about the shortage of steel. As far back as 1949, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dickinson,</inline> who was Director of Mines in South Australia for quite a number of years, drew the attention of the South Australian Government to the necessity for doing something to improve steel production. Let us face it; there has been procrastination. The B.H.P. , in order to satisfy the needs of a few shareholders, has been allowed to limits its production of steel. </para>

                                <para>-  No, I would not. The point I am making is that the company would have had to increase production tenfold in order to keep pace with. Australia's requirements. The United States is a country where free enterprise is supposed to have all the virtues in the world of business. Yet the American Government is not beyond taking legislative action in respect of the American steel industry. The United States Steel Corporation, one of the biggest steel manufacturing companies in America, was at one time required by the American Government to seek public subscriptions in order to expand its activities in accordance with the growing needs, of. American industry. United States legislation contains machinery to require things, of that kind to be done. We in Australia should learn from what was done in America. Surely we will not still be faced with a shortage of steel twelve months, two years or ten years from now, if we live that long! There is no excuse for a shortage of steel in this country. There would be some excuse if we lacked the natural resources with which to make steel, but we have some of the greatest reserves of the best grade ore in the world. It is farcical to think that we are exporting iron ore and buying back the finished product. Surely all honorable senators will agree that that is not a satisfactory position. </para>

Despite the significance or otherwise of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> question, I think we must all agree that the problem is a serious one. If we agree on that point, the next thing we should do is throw politics out the window for a while at least and see whether we can arrive at some solution to the problem. We must do what we can to utilize our raw materials and obviate the necessity to import steel. The importation of steel adversely affects our overseas balances because we are forced to pay fantastic prices for steel on the world markets. </para>

Even when that plant is in full production, if the situation is not treated as urgent and if something is not done to increase still further the production of  steel,  we will continue to be faced with a shortage.

                                <para>-  I do not say  that  the Government would necessarily have that power. But it reposes in the States collectively; they have the right to make a decision. I think the honorable senator will agree with me when I say that I believe nothing could prevent this Government from giving a lead to the States by saying, " We will call a conference of the State Premiers to see whether we can ascertain what the States are prepared to do ". If nationalization were the only answer, 1 should say that it would be far better to have the steel industry controlled by governments than to have in the field a monopoly which is producing steel only in quantities to suit itself. So, even though talking in terms of nationalization is unreal, because the power does not reside in the Commonwealth Parliament to nationalize the industry, it would be far better to have production controlled by governments than not to have anything done at all. </para>

                                <para>conclude my reference to the subject of steel by saying that I have tried to deal with the matter objectively. I am not attacking the Government. 1 am not saying that it ought to do certain things, nor am I decrying what it has done. All I am saying is that a proper approach to the problem will be made, that a degree of recognition will be given to its importance, and that some early action will be taken to ascertain whether the Commonwealth can give a lead. 1 turn now to a rather extraordinary situation that seems to have developed in South Australia and about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> asked a question earlier to-day. I was amazed to learn that the South Australian Government intends to take out, or has in fact taken out, a writ against the Commonwealth because it believes that the Commonwealth intends to proceed with the standardization of rail gauges in Western Australia instead of proceeding with the conversion of the Broken. Hill to Port Pirie line. Surely the action of a government of the same political colour as the present Commonwealth Government in taking out  a  High Court writ against this Government is one of the most extraordinary things we have ever seen in Australian politics. It opens up an entirely new aspect of Commonwealth and State relations. </para>

Extra development work in South Australia would be very helpful at this stage.

                        <para>I conclude my speech on the note on which T began. It is this: During this debate the Labour Party has moved an amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply in which it suggests that the Government has lost the confidence of the people because of its failure to face up to certain economic issues. I said earlier that the views I intended to put forward were, in the main, the views of persons who could reasonably be regarded as unbiased observers and who, if they had any political leanings at all, would lean towards this Government. All the quotations I have introduced into my speech have come from persons who occupy responsible positions in the Australian community in economic and other fields. The arguments advanced' by those persons support everything that we on this side of the chamber have said and everything that the matt in the street is saying. I believe that the observations of these people have proved that this Government no longer has the confidence of the Australian people. No matter how much the Government may whistle to keep up its spirits, the attitude of the community will be demonstrated in no uncertain way when the election is held' at the end of this year. </para>

If he takes the trouble to read my remarks, he will be reminded that the Prime Ministers of the member countries of the Commonwealth agreed to hold a meeting in London beginning on 8th March. The member countries are the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia. New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana, the Federation of Malaya and the Federation of Nigeria. As on former occasions the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland also has been invited to attend. The previous meeting was held in May, 1960. At that meeting, the view was expressed that meetings should be arranged more frequently than in the past. Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> is suggesting that we should not be represented at such meetings by our Prime Minister. I disagree with him most violently. The conference that is taking place at this point of time is probably one of the most important that the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth countries have ever attended.

The Premier of Western Australia, while discussing the problems of the State with the Commonwealth Grants Commission, is reported to have said - </para>

                            <para>The proposed standard gauge railway from Kalgoorlie to Kwinana was important to the the Government's plans. The cost of £35,000,000 was beyond the State's resources.  1 think it will readily be accepted that such a cost would be beyond the resources of the State. The Premier is reported to have continued - </para>
                            <para>The decision of the Commonwealth on the proposal was of the utmost importance as it would enable a start to be made with the establishment of an iron and steel industry, which was recognized everywhere as the cornerstone in the establishment of secondary industry.  1 point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which he maligned, has signed a contract with the Western Australian Government to establish an integrated steel industry in Western Australia at a cost of approximately £40,000,000. Surely the Government must be impressed with the case presented by the Government of Western Australia, because this railway will make possible the development of a major steel industry, which must result in a cutting down of the outflow of money for the importation of steel, with a consequently lessened draw on our overseas funds. </para>

                        <para>The Government's decision to increase the grant to the Australian National Travel Association for tourism is very welcome but I suggest, with great respect, that to provide £100,000 is only to pay lip service to the need for the encouragement of tourism. I suggest it would be far more realistic and produce far greater results in earning overseas capital if the grant were raised to £350,000 in the coming budgetary year. Surely an extra amount of £250,000 is not a lot to ask for an industry that brought us in £12,500,000 last year. I am convinced that with the right type of promotion, which can be obtained, only by spending money, this figure could be trebled within the next six or seven years. 1 ask the Government to consider also some form of income tax rebate for those people who subscribe voluntarily to the funds of the Australian National Travel Association. I believe that there is an anomaly now in respect of tax concessions for such subscriptions. If a company involved in the actual transport of tourists makes a contribution, the amount is an allowable deduction for income tax purposes, but if a trading firm, such as the Myer Emporium of Melbourne, makes a contribution to encourage tourism, that is not allowed as a tax deduction. I ask the Government to have a look at that anomaly. There is no doubt that the activities of the Australian National Travel Association over the last years have shown some very encouraging results. I have figures for the first nine months of 1960, which are related to the figures for the corresponding period of the previous year, and these show quite a remarkable increase. From January to September, 1960, the number of tourists from New Zealand, which is our biggest, market, was 23,760, which represented a 42 per cent, increase on the figures for the previous year. From the United States there were 6,800, an increase of 27 per cent.; from Canada, 1,036, an increase of 35 per cent.; from the United Kingdom, almost 7,000, an increase of 12 per cent.; from Europe, almost 3,000, an increase of 8 per cent.; from the Far East, almost 3,000, an increase of 4 per cent.; and from South Africa, 538, an increase of 32 per cent. There is no doubt that these figures prove that the increased activity of the Australian National Travel Association over the last three years, and particularly during the last ten months, has shown quite steady results. My suggestion that the Government should increase its grant to £350,000 is supported by the amount of money that other countries are appropriating for this industry. I was amazed to learn that Indonesia intends to spend the equivalent of £A. 12,500,000 in the next eight years to attract tourists, and that the South Korean Government has designated 1961 as " Visit Korea Year " and has announced as attractive programme for overseas tourists. This emphasizes the fact that tourism is an industry that can no longer be ignored. </para>

                        <para class="block">It is well for us to remember that 50,000,000 tourists, that is, five times the population of Australia, are on the move annually. Austria offset her deficits in the national Budget by tourism alone. I have suggested raising the travel grant from £100,000 to £350,000. Expressed in terms of Australian currency Britain spends £1,000,000 a year in tourist promotion, France spends £1,500,000 and Russia spends £1,250,000. Europe last year had more than 36,500,000 tourists. I mentioned earlier that the tourist trade brought us £12,500,000 last year, although we had only 70,000 tourists. Italy had 8,000,000 tourists. I understand that the Italian economy to-day is tied to tourism. Italy is not a rich country, and tourism is one of its most important income earners. West Germany had nearly 5,000,000 tourists and Switzerland, France, Spain and Austria a little more than 3,000,000 each. These figures show just how much we are missing out in respect of this money earner. A few nights ago I asked one of the top men in the Australian National Travel Association. " How much could you spend to promote this industry overseas? Could you spend £500,000?" He replied: " No, not at this time. We could not get you value for the money because we must have trained personnel in this business, and we would have to set up offices overseas, but we could spend a lot more than we have at the moment." I said, " What amount? " He replied, "£350,000". When we consider the impressive returns that other countries are obtaining from tourism, surely that is not a lot to ask, because we are seeking to increase our earnings overseas! We should capitalize on the fact that Australia has lovely and varied beauty spots. I cannot speak from personal experience, but I am told that our beaches are unsurpassed anywhere in the world. Some curious features are peculiar to Australia. For instance, our wonderful climate is certainly an attraction for tourists and we should capitalize on it by selling its attraction more vigorously overseas than we do. It is a climate which permits outdoor sports of various descriptions to be enjoyed virtually all the year round. So much for the tourist angle. </para>

                                <para>-  I do think they will be all right, and I only hope the Government will implement them as soon as possible. A tax allowance of 16s. in the £1 is to be offered to companies developing overseas markets. I think that is a very worthy proposal, as is the decision to grant a rebate of pay-roll tax. </para>

                                <para>-  I am led to believe otherwise. I am convinced that the stories that the press have tried to get across to the public of a disagreement between the Treasury and the Department of Trade are just another attempt to embarrass the Government. Let us be frank. The press of this country has taken unto itself the right to be Her Majesty's Opposition because we have not an effective political Opposition in this .Parliament. Why do you think the press is kicking the daylights out of the Government? It is plain for anybody to see that the press is trying to be Her Majesty's Opposition, and it is making these attacks to try to embarrass the Government. I am convinced of this, because I am led to believe that the decision of the Government was made a week before the press statement that there was trouble between the Treasury and the Department of Trade. </para>

                                <para>-  I will allow you to draw your own inference. Let me get back to the proposal to allow a rebate of pay-roll tax. Because this is rather complex, I should like the statement to go into " Hansard " in its correct form. This is what the Acting Prime Minister said - </para>

                            <para>There will be a formula which, up to a point, will increase the benefits of pay-roll tax abatement as the taxpayer lifts the level of his export sales. The rebate will be allowed according to the increase in the value of the exports which an organization achieves over the value of the average of its exports in the base years 1958-59 and 1959-60. The rebate will be calculated having regard to the proportion which increased export sales bear to total income from the sales. </para>
                            <para class="block">The rebate will apply for three years from 1960-61. In the light of the experience of those three years the policy will be reviewed. </para>

                        <para>The other proposal mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister was the proposal to assist in the development of warehousing facilities to accommodate Australian products in overseas countries.  1  think it is a sensible proposal and I am at a loss to understand why it has not been adopted much earlier, not only by this Government, but also by other governments. It is one of the most sensible proposals I have heard for a long time. Obviously, the fact that goods are there to be seen by a prospective purchaser, and he knows that they are available for immediate delivery, must have a significant effect on the sales of the particular commodities. </para>
                        <para>An honorable senator opposite asked me whether I thought that these measures would be any good. Because of the down turn in our overseas credits I hope that the Government will implement all of these proposals - the standardization of rail gauges, the construction of roads in the north-west of Western Australia, encouragement to tourism, proposals to encourage export trade and the provision of warehousing facilities. I hope that the Government will treat these matters as urgent. </para>
                        <para>As a member of this chamber, and as a Western Australian I desire to re-affirm a protest that I have made on a number of occasions, I think that my South Australian colleagues will join me in doing so. My protest is against the omission of Western Australia and South Australia from phase three of the extension of commercial television stations. Surely at least one station could have been established in country areas in these States! I do not think that would have upset the Government to any extent. I know that there is a terrific demand for trained personnel and that the sale of television sets imposes a strain on the economy, but why should Western Australia and South Australia be left out of the programme? The least the Government can do, I think, is to satisfy the worthy people who live in the country and who lack many of the amenities which city dwellers take for granted. The Government should try to include the country people in phase three of the extension of television stations. Country people make a very great contribution to the nation's economy and surely it is right and just that they should not have to wait until last for television services. Why should Western Australia and South Australia have to wait until last before receiving the benefits of this great medium of communication? </para>
                        <para>When I say that these country people make a great contribution to the economy of Australia, let me remind honorable senators that Western Australia provides an important market for the other States. It imports annually goods to the value of £123,000,000 from the other States of the Commonwealth and yet its country areas will be the last to receive the benefits of television. A total of £115,000,000 worth of exports go from Western Australia, or nearly <inline font-style="italic">12i</inline> per cent, of the nation's total exports. That is accomplished by 7 per cent, of the Australian people. </para>
                        <para>I wish to touch also on another matter that causes me some alarm. There is a tendency to-day for people and governments in Australia, whenever they bump up against  a  problem, to talk of granting greater .powers to the Federal Government. It is a tendency that we in this Chamber must resist. This suggestion, if it were taken to its logical conclusion would lead to a virtual dictatorship by the Federal Government as the result of centralization of all power in the one government. It would mean the ultimate extinction of State parliaments. All power would be vested in this Federal Parliament. </para>
