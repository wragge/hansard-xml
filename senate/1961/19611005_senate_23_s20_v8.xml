If this is the practice, who authorized it? Is the Public Service 'Board aware of the practice? Will the Minister consult with the Prime Minister on this matter so that the childish practice may be terminated forthwith? </para>

                        <para>- The procedure in these matters is well established. My recollection of the position is that State members should address -their inquiries on -federal matters through federal members. I have no recollection of a procedure -whereby when a senator makes an inquiry the federal member concerned is notified of that inquiry. I ask 'the honorable senator to place his question on,the -notice-paper so that I may obtain the facts. It 'may 'be that such a practice -has developed as an act of courtesy to the member who holds the seat concerned. If the question is .placed on 'the notice-paper I will get the facts for the honorable senator, because-at the moment I am not clear on the point. </para>

                        <para>- I have some figures with me relating to the coal export trade. The importance of this trade is evidenced by the programme that the New South Wales Government is carrying out. The importance that the Commonwealth attaches to this trade is evidenced by the Commonwealth's support of that .programme. I am pleased to note that the Premier of New South Wales recently said that the Port Kembla works could be completed ahead  of  schedule. I understand there is some conflict of -opinion at Newcastle about whether loading facilities should be erected. I hope that conflict will be resolved shortly. I express no view on the various .proposals, because the whole -matter -is -very much  a  technical one. However, I should like to see Newcastle swing into stride as quickly as Port Kembla has, .because the information we are getting is that the inroads we are making into the Japanese coal trade have attracted a good deal of notice in the United States of America. That country is coming back on pretty competitive terms. It is not only a matter of price but also a matter of providing (loading facilities so :that -the trade can 'be -handled -expeditiously. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The completion of -the facilities at Newcastle as quickly as possible is a matter of some consequence. That is apparent if one looks at the figures. In the year ended June last our total exports of coal -rose to -1,900,000 tons, returning an income of £7,700,000. That represented a big increase -on our exports in the previous year, which amounted to 1,100,000 -tons. The story is only starting to unfold itself, because the statistics that are available show that in the 'last half of this calendar year -exports of coal from New South Wales will amount to 1,500;000 tons. Orders booked and -shipments arranged for the last three months of this year show that'900;00(9 tons will be shipped out of New South Wales - 500,000 tons from Newcastle, 200,000 tons from Port "Kembla and 200,000 tons from the port of Sydney. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes. He expressed the view after coming back through America^ - I  have  had -it confirmed from other sources - that our American friends do not take too kindly to the fact that we will be exporting 1,500,000 tons -of  coal  from New South Wales in the last half of this calendar year. We must avoid any price war. The Japanese want our coal so badly - it is of such good quality - that there is room for every one to get a share of the market at reasonable prices. </para>

                        <para>-  Has the Minister for National Development seen a statement to the effect that the Western Australian Government has received a further 200 applications for permits to prospect for iron ore? When a deposit of iron ore is found by a prospector and the discovery is reported to the Department of Mines in the State concerned, does that department make the relevant information available to the Commonwealth Government? Can the Minister state the extent to which discoveries of iron ore have increased since the lifting of the embargo on the export of iron ore? </para>

                        <para>- I  am sorry to say that  I  have not seen the newspaper report to the effect that the Western Australian Government has received an additional 200 applications for permits to search for iron ore. That is certainly a very interesting situation. I was confident that there would be an expansion of prospecting activities, but the fact that there have been 200 new applications certainly indicates a considerable increase in activity. Generally speaking, these matters are for the States to determine. The mines departments of the States do what is needed and work in very close co-operation with the Bureau of Mineral Resources. They have a gentleman's arrangement; each knows what the other is doing. The Commonwealth would not come into the matter officially until such time as the State concerned had sponsored an application for permission to export iron ore. The Bureau of Mineral Resources would then make inquiries to satisfy itself about the extent of the deposit and the arrangements that had been made and would make a recommendation to me.  I  am confident that there would not have been any re-assessment of iron ore deposits since permission to export was given.  It  is a big job to measure and assess deposits, and  I  do not think that the work involved would be justified at this stage.  I  think we would need to wait for a year or so to see what the results had been </para>

Is it correct that that figure represents, not the 2.7 per cent, of the working population to which the Government has referred, but no less than 4.2 per cent.? </para>

                        <para>-  I have not seen the report which is attributed to the financial editor of the " Sydney Morning Herald ", whoever he may be. If it is accurately passed on to the Senate by Sentor Sandford, all I can say is that, having regard to the figures which are compiled by completely impartial persons who have access to the registrations, the figures given by the financial editor of the " Sydney Morning Herald " are completely wrong. The facts indicate not only that the number of unemployed can be less than 177,000, but that it is in fact very much less. The figures showing how many people were registered as unemployed  at  the end of last month will be published shortly. I have no idea what the total will be, but I am quite sure that it will be much lower than the figure of 177,000 that has been mentioned, even though it will include the men at present on strike at Mount Isa and those who were temporarily laid off by General Motors-Holden's Limited. </para>

                        <para>-  I address a question to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Last week I asked a question about the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the " Chifley Era ". I now ask the Minister: Has his attention been directed to a telecast from Melbourne last Monday night, quaintly titled " University of the Air ", in which a political symposium was presented for the instruction of viewers? Is the Minister aware that the two members of the panel were Professor Harper - not a Liberal-Country Party protagonist - and Mr. Sam Cohen, the latter giving a straightout Labour political view of the Australian scene? Is this Mr. Sam Cohen the person who has been endorsed by a section of the Labour Party in Victoria as a Senate candidate at the next election and is he the  president  of the Jewish Council against War and Fascism, which was described last year by Mr. Jacobson, the  President  of the Jewish Chamber of Deputies, as  a  Communist front organization? Is it fair that, within two months of a general election, and following Professor Crisp's effusion of last week, the Australian Broadcasting Commission should run this series of undiluted Labour propaganda? Does the Minister know whether next week's " University of the Air " will feature Dr Evatt, Mr. Calwell, Mr. Ward or Dr. Burton? Does the commission intend to run a similar series, covering LiberalCountry Party leaders, at this stage, so close to the date of the general election? Even though the writs for the election have not yet been issued, is it intended that this propaganda series will be taken into account when assessing the amount of television time to be made available to the Labour Party in the election campaign? </para>

                        <para>-  I did not see the telecast to which the honorable senator has referred. I do not know Mr. Sam Cohen, but if his interests are as diversified as the question implies, he certainly is a man of many parts. I do not share Senator Hannan's concern about what might be described as the apparent liberal allocation of free time by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to Labour interests. I have a profound respect for the good judgment of the Australian people, and I am quite sure that the more they hear  of  Labour philosophy in the next few weeks the more enthusiastically will they support the Government on 9th December. The matters referred to by Senator Hannan have been brought to the attention of the Postmaster-General, who is having them investigated. When the investigation has been completed, I shall convey the results to Senator Hannan.</para>

            <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. Is it a fact that in our immigration laws there are some twelve or fourteen provisions which allow Asian people to live in Australia either permanently or under contract but which make it perfectly clear that personswho live here under contract shall leave at a specifice time? Also is it a fact that almost all Asian countries have clauses in their immigration laws which exclude certain nationals from living in their countries? As there is serious lack of knowledge in both Australia and overseas regarding our policy, will the Minister consider giving wide and repeated publicity to the provisions allowing entry of Asian nationals into Australia, (a) by publicizing in the press and relevant clauses, and (b) by having printed small pamphlets of a size suitable for distribution? If desired, such pamphlets could be included in every passport issued so that Australians intending to travel overseas can familiarize themselves with these aspects of our policy, thus enabling them to answer correctly any queries or citicisms arising from unimformed sources in foreign countries.</para>

            <para>The question that Senator Buttfield has asked is of great importance. I do not think that we can make too much information available to our people about the immigration laws in Australia and how they affect Asians and others, particularly in comparison with the immigrations laws of Asian coutnries themselves. That aspect is very often forgottten or overlooked. The question is of such importance that I htink it would be far better if the honorable snator were to put it on the notice-paper. I shall then get the Minister for Immigration to prepare an answer for her.</para>

Is he aware that the Queensland Budget for 1961-62hasbeen referred to as a " booze and betting " budget because of new levies to. be. imposed?Doesthe Minister know that both State. Government and Opposition members claim that Queensland's unsatisfactory financial position is due to the parsimonious and. selfish attitude of the Commonwealth Government? In the light of the unsatisfactory position in Queensland, will the Government give an assurance that it will undertake major developmental works in that State in an endeavour to assist.it? </para>

                    <para>I come now to the substance of the question. The cash allocation to Queensland last year, by comparison with the position three o rfour years ago,showed a very substantial increase. Last year Queensland was provide dwit h£106,000,000  £20,000,000 more than it was provided  with in 1958-59. The total cash provision to Queensland from the Commonwealth- Government in the last four years has amounted, to no less . than £386,000,000 In those circumstances the honorable senator should not talking terms of parsimonious support, because to doso represents aprejudiced approach to the question. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator has asked also whether the Government will carry out, developmental works in Queensland. He is as well aware as I am that the Commonwealth Government is finding £20,000,000 for the reconstruction of the Mount Isa railwayand £5,000,000for beefroads.As I told him the other day, I think 60 per cent. of the total oil subsidy paid in the last twelve months, has been paid to people looking for oil in Queensland. There are quite substantial programmes for assisting the search for minerals in Queensland. A few days agoI mentioned that the work of the Bureau of Mineral Resources has unfolded the possibility of additional tin deposits in the Cairns area.If that forecast proves to be accurate, that tin wil lmake a very nice contribution to Australia's economic welfare. Senator Dittmer flogs a very dead horse when he tries to create the atmosphere that this Government is not supporting Queensland and ensuring that that State goes ahead. </para>

<para>On a point of order, Mr. President, I should like to ask you whether it is not a fact that Ministers are not compelled to answer any question. Ishoudl also like to ask you whether it is not a fact that, at least over the 30 years that I have been in the Senate,if a senator asks a question and inadvertently addresses it to the wrong Minister, the practice has been for teh appropriate Minister courteously to answer the question. If your answer is in the affirmative, do you not think it would have been courteous for Senator Wade to answer my question about Neptune bombers?</para>

            <para>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that no more money can be made available to Victoria and Tasmania under the States Grants (Mental Institutions) Act of 1955? Also, were the State Treasurers asked to submit their plans for financial assistance in respect of mental health and mental institutions for the future, and is the Commonwealth Department of Health examining their proposals? Has the Minister said that the making of additional grants to Victoria and Tasmania would not necessarily be held up because of the failure of other States to spend their allocations? In view of the importance of an early decision on this matter, can the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government is prepared to put a time limit on the discussions, and if agreement between all States is not reached, whether the Government will make grants to Victoria and Tasmania, which have already proved their ability to prosecute a vigorous mental health programme?</para>

                    <para>Both Victoria and Tasmania spent their allocations some considerable time ago. I think that Victoria was the first, and Tasmania the second to do so. It is a fact that the Treasurers concerned have been advised that it would not necessarily delay consideration of further assistance to Victoria and Tasmania if the other States had not spend their allocations. I have no knowledge about a time limit. I shall consult the Minister on that matter and let the honorable senator have that information. </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question, which I direct to the Minister for Civil Aviation, by stating that some time ago I raised the matter of the spread of hours by aircraft crew flying passenger planes from the eastern States to Perth and back. The Minister then told me that this was not a general practice, but later, in a written reply during the recess, he informed me that it was the practice with Electra aircraft that crews fly the return trip between Melbourne and Perth, because of the special skills necessary to operate Electras. Yesterday, in reply to a question by Senator Cooke regarding the cancellation of Monday's 11.55 p.m. flight from Perth, the Minister stated that the flight could not be carried out because two crew members out of three had exhausted their flying time and could not fly again until the next morning. My question is: Is it customary for airline Viscount crews to fly this return trip, that is, from Adelaide to Perth and Perth to Adelaide? What is the rest period between the forward and return journey? Is this practice common to both airlines? Is there any provision for relief crews to be available in Perth so that cancellations of services will not recur because of crew shortage? </para>

                        <para>- The particular instance arose, as I explained yesterday, out of a most unusual sequence of occurrences. The flight from Adelaide was undertaken to replace a flight then in progress by a DC6B aircraft. The crew at Adelaide flew to Perth, and one or two of the crew were then out of hours and could not go back before the following morning. </para>

The expectation was that the aircraft arriving would be a DC6B. The whole matter, as I explained in answer to a question yesterday, is currently under review. I pointed out that it was a most unusual occurrence. Nonetheless, I am having a look at it to ensure that the possibility of its occurring again is reduced to an irreducible minimum. </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service a question which is related closely to one asked earlier by Senator Sandford. Can the figures presented to the Senate concerning unemployment be accepted as the positive maximum number of unemployed persons in Australia? Alternatively, do the figures represent only the number of persons registered for employment? If the answer to the latter part of the question is in the affirmative, on what information does the Minister base his statement that the number of persons unemployed in Australia is less than 177,000? Can that information be made available to the Senate? </para>

                        <para>- The figures presented to the Senate are those of people in Australia who have registered for employment. In addition, figures are presented showing the number of people in Australia who are in receipt of the unemployment benefit. The number of persons who have registered for employment includes, as always, transient workers, people who have registered for employment and who have since obtained a job but have not passed that information on to the Department of Labour and National Service, people who have left school and have registered for a job for the first time, and so forth. It may be assumed, therefore, I think, that those people in Australia who are in need of a job will be registered for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Office. Having regard to what I have said as to all the categories of people who may be registered for employment, the figures of the number so registered for employment - that is, those people who have gone to the trouble of saying they want a job - bear no comparison to the figures referred to by Senator Sandford.</para>

                        <para>- Senator Cooke has always evinced a great interest in this subject. Yesterday, he sought to know the number of poliomyelitis cases that has been notified this year and last year. At the time I did not have the information. However, I have since had an opportunity to read the interim report for 1960-61 of the Director-General of Health. On page 4 of that report it is stated that 176 cases of poliomyelitis were notified during the year and six other cases still await confirmation. There were 86 confirmed cases in 1959-60. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen any recent specific statement by the Western Australian Government regarding the building of a naval base in Western Australia. All that I can say in reply to Senator Tangney is to repeat what I have said on previous occasions in reply to similar questions asked in this place. The establishment of a naval base in Western Australia would cost tens of millions of pounds and would require either a great addition to the defence vote or a great reduction in the defence effort at present being made. I would add that, although I have seen newspaper reports concerning the future of the Singa pore naval base, I emphasize that they have been no more than newspaper reports. The base is a British base and anything that may happen to it in the future is a matter for Britain and the country in which it is situated. Nothing has happened yet. </para>

It has been Commonwealth policy for a number of years to support the road safety campaigns conducted by the various State organizations, some of them being governmental or conducted by government departments, and others being committees consisting of people drawn from the general community. I cannot say offhand how much the Commonwealth contributes towards road safety, but its contribution has been significant. The actual implementation of recommendations for road safety practices is not and never could be a Commonwealth function. I will see that the matter raised by the honorable senator is brought to the notice of my colleague, Mr. Opperman, in order to ascertain whether any further information that may be of assistance to the honorable senator may be provided. </para>

                       <para>The Government announced some time ago that it was willing to discuss with the State governments and the industry organizations several issues arising from the report and recommendations of the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry. The two principal items for discussions are in respect of a new five-year stabilization plan to succeed the present agreement which terminates on 30th June, 1962, and the reconctruction of that section of the industry which the committeee believes is in unsatisfactory economic circumstances. Negotiations with the industry organiszations on new stabilization proposals will commence at an appropriate time, when the ideas of the Government and the industry have been fully formulated. The reconstruction aspects are to be considered at the next meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council which, on present inidcations, will take place early in 1962.</para>

            <para>On 6th September, Senator Laught asked that a list be prepared shwoing Commonwealth departments, commissions, instrumentalities and agencies within South Australia for the ten annual periods since 1st July 1950. In reply, I would point out the parliamentary appropriations are not restricted, generally, to expenditure in any particular State. The Commonwealth's expenditure is recorded in respect of each vote from detials of individual payments which are brought to account through the Sub-Treasury in each State and in each Commonwealth Territory. An attempt to allocate the expenditure between States would be a major undertaking and, moreover, the analysis would be of very doubtful value. Expenditure brought to account by a particular Sub-Treasury may include, for example, payments to interstate and overseas suppliers. Furthermore, expenditure in one State is often for equipment and supplies for projects in another State. In short, the payments recorded in any Sub-Treasury do not purport to indicated the expnediture which may be attributable to Commonwealth activities or services in that State or Territory.

                            <para>I thank the Senate for its indulgence in enabling me to reply to the attacks to which I have referred. They related, apparently, to the issues of an anonymous circular regarding a member of the victorian branch of the Australian Labour Party- Mr. S. Cohen. Attacks have been made on me, my supporters and my party. Those attacks appeared in the official Australian Labour Party columns of the Melbourne "Herald" of Tuesday last, 3rd October, and the Melbourne "Sun News-Pictorial" of Wednesday, 4th October. They were added to in a press statement made by the Honorable A. A. Calwell, the Leader of the Opposition in another place. The attacks which appeared inthe Melbourne "Herald" and the Melbourne "Sun News-Pictorial" are the culmination of a series of insulting personal attacks which have been made on me, no doubt with a view to the election on 9th December, by the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour Paryt whose name, according to my last information, was Cyril Wyndham. I assume that is still his name! In the Melbourne "Herald" of Tuesday last, Mr. Wyndham, referring to this anonymous circular of which I, my supporters and the Australian Democratic Labour Party had no knowledge, went so far as to say that it was diabolical political treachery, issued by the enemies of the Labour Party "to bolster the declining D.L.P. vote for Senator McManus." When one considers the result of the last Victorian election, the suggestion that the D.L.P. vote is declining shows great optimis on the part of Mr. Wyndham. Not satisfied with having said that, on the following morning he published this statement in the Melbourne "Sun News-Pictorial"-

                            <para>- I was named in the other statements. As regards Mr. Calwell's statement, with due humility I suppose I would be regarded as being a leader in my party - considering there are only two of us, anyway. Mr. Calwell made his statement without a shred of evidence. I have great sympathy for the members of his party in this chamber. I recall how their feelings were harrowed when an attack was made by Senator Cole without evidence they said, on some one. I remember how deeply hurt they were that that kind of thing should have been done. But I am not going to imitate Senator Poke, who suggested that Senator Cole ought to be deported for attacking a person without evidence. I am not going to ask that Mr. Calwell be deported. I would not want Mr. Wyndham to be deported. He is the greatest asset that the D.L.P. has in Victoria. </para>

I understand that leave was granted for the honorable senator to make a statement to protect himself against some attacks that had been made on him. I direct your attention to the fact that he is not protecting himself but is attacking other people, including members of the Australian Labour Party.

                    <para>Neither I nor any associate of mine hashad anything to do with the issuing of the pamphlet, and neither has the D.L.P. I say with great deliberation, in view of Mr. Calwell's attack on me, that he, I know, has many good friends among the Jewish, community in Melbourne. He knows the sources from which that pamphlet emanated. He knows, too, that those sources have noassociation with the D.L.P. and that the pamphlet involves a faction fight among, supporters of his own organization. I therefore invite anybody who wants to make an attack on me or my party to produce the evidence and we will reply to it. We have a pamphlet and we have statements, made in it. There is no attempt to reply to the statements in the pamphlet. Instead, there is action to create a diversion in another direction. I conclude by saying, that the attacks that have been made on me have no basis whatever in fact, and neither have the attacks made on my associates and my party. What has happened in regard to the circular is that there is a faction fight amongst the supporters of the Australian Labour Party. We have noassociation with it, other than that we are looking on at it from a ringside seat. </para>

                        <para>. - 1  am tempted to enter this debate because, in my fairly long experience of the Senate, I have never seen a more extraordinary bill introduced in this chamber. Almost the sole purpose of the measure is to prop up a public company. Over the years, I have heard the supporters of the Government continually praising the efforts of private enterprise to run this country. We have been told that the only way for Australia to prosper is to give private enterprise the opportunity to compete in various fields of activity and that only in that way will there be efficiency. On this occasion we have an example of a privately operated enterprise being opposed to a government enterprise. Despite the fact that the private organization is a vast one, we now find that the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> and the Government deem it necessary to subdue the government organization and prop up the privately owned organization. I think that that is an admission by the Government that private enterprise has fallen down on the job and has not been capable of a sustained effort in competition with the well-run government enterprise. </para>

But what do we find in this bill? As I have said, it is the most extraordinary measure that I have seen a government introduce. First, the Government says, " We will do everything we can to prevent our own airline from being successful, and then we will see that the other airline not only has all the advantages but makes a profit of something like  10  per cent." I do not know why it does not apply that line of reasoning to all the other private enterprise undertakings, such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Why not give them a protection to make  10  per cent.? The Government is saying to a public utility: "We feel that you ought not to have competition that will compel you to bring down your charges. You ought not to render to the public the best possible service at the lowest cost. What you ought to do it to see that your shareholders receive the benefit of a profit of not less than  10  per cent." </para>
                    <para>That is the problem that brings me to my feet. lt appears to me that the Government has caught a tiger by the tail and dare not let it go. The Government says, " We want to have two airlines.  We  have T.A.A., which is operating successfully and economically and is setting the standard in Australia. We have also the private airline, which is not doing very well. We will have to prop it up and see that it does not have to meet too much competition. Above all, we must assure the shareholders, not that the private company will earn a reasonable profit, not that it will earn a profit of  6  per cent, or  7  per cent." - that is higher than the profits earned by many industries in Australia to-day - " but that it will earn a profit of not less than  10  per cent." The Government goes on to say, " We shall ensure that Ansett Transport Industries Limited will make a very handsome profit and, in addition, will be permitted to allocate a certain amount of money to reserves ". </para>
                    <para>Down through the years we have seen private companies setting aside money for reserves and, after  a  while, making bonus issues of shares, so that the shareholders receive the benefit of the reserves. The Broken Hill organization now has something like  £65,000,000  in capital and I make bold to say that no more than one-half of that sum was subscribed by the public. Down through the years big industrial concerns have been able to capitalize their reserves by bonus share issues, thus giving the benefit of the reserves to their shareholders. That is very nice for the shareholders. The Government is saying that Ansett Transport Industries Limited will be allowed to set aside reasonable sums as reserves. Who is to say what is  a  reasonable sum? The people who will set the money aside for that purpose will  be  the directors of the company. </para>

                            <para>-  My colleague will find it for me. It is in the legislation, and I will read it out in a minute. My colleague now says that the matter was referred to in the Minister's second-reading speech. When, a Minister makes a second-reading speech, it is right for an ordinary member of the Parliament such as myself to accept what the Minister says in that speech as representing the intentions of the Government. In the passage in the second-reading speech, dealing with this matter the Minister used the delightful term " reasonable, private, enterprise standards ". If I could obtain shares in a show that made a profit of not less than 10 per cent. all the time, after putting aside certain amounts to reserve and after meeting depreciation charges and taxation, that would suit me. I should think that I was on a pretty good wicket. What the Government considers to be reasonable in this connexion, I do not know, but the Minister said- </para>

                    <para class="block">As I have said, I do not know what the Government wouldregard as a reasonable allocation to reserves, but I do know that if I were adirector of the company, knowing that the profits were guaranteed by the Government orknowing thatmy competitor would be compelled to run his business in such a way as not to prevent me from making a profit of 10per cent,, Icertainly shouldallocatea very adequate amountto reserves. I should also ensure, if I were a directorof the company, that depreciation would be well covered  -that  the value ofbuildings, land- equipmentand everything else would be written down to such a degree that, ifitbecame necessary, they could well be replaced out of the reserve set aside. We see that reserves, depreciation andtax charges will be taken intoaccount. </para>
                    <para>Ansett Transport Industrie's  has  a number ofsubsidiarycompaniesand the position could arise thatlosses incurred by subsidiaries were covered by themajor undertaking. It could be possible for losses incurred by subsid iariestobecoveredby the airline. For instance, Ansett Trans port Industries operates coach services. Not very long ago passengers were carried free of charge from airports to the city offices of airlines, but now they have to pay for that service. If the Ansett coaches were not doing very well, would there be anything to prevent Ansett-A.N.A. from doubling the charge made for transport from airports and using the extra revenue to offset the losses on the coaches? </para>
                    <para>The act provides that the Minister, not later than one month before the commencement of each financial year, will determine the percentage of the capital of the Australian National Airlines Commission that would represent a reasonable - he uses that delightful word again - return to the Commonwealth for the operations of the commission in that financial year. If he found that the private airline was not earning enough money, he could alter that determination at any time during the financial year. He is taking that power to himself. He is not satisfied with taking power only to set a target for T.A.A. for twelve months. He is not satisfied with having power to say, "In the next financial year T.A.A- must make so much profit. This will give its competitor a chance to make a similar profit but, even if it makes less, this will remain the target." </para>

                    <para>We haveseen some extraordinary things happen in this country. We have seen monopolies arise and gain control of a whole industry. Althoughtheyhavebeen inefficient, they have still been able to make profits. Because of the conditions under which they have operated, they have been able to mulct the Australian people in whatever profits they wanted to make. I thought that was an extraordinary position. We are in that position to-day, and apparently it is intended that we shall go a step further. Not only is there a monopoly, but the Government's policy is to hamper a government enterprise which is competing against a private monopoly show, so as to give the private monopoly all the advantages. The Government says to its own industry, in effect: " We want this private show to make a considerable profit. We want it to flourish and to have such reserves that at any time it will be so solid and strong that nobody can run it out of the air. We want to see that year after year it makes a profit of at least 10 per cent, after covering all the other contingencies that private industry in other fields has to .meet." The Government also decides to give the private airline these advantages for another sixteen years. </para>

                    <para class="block">The onus -is to be put on the Minister himself to specify the dividend target. What a responsibility to put on &gt;a Minister! As we were told by the Minister in the second-reading speech, .the Government has decided on a profit of 10 per cent. The Minister has pointed out also that the Australian National Airlines .Commission is at a disadvantage because of the ^greater spread of overhead of its principal competitor. The Government is taking that into consideration, of course, in determining what the dividend rate . shall be. The Minister himself will weigh the position up and then authorize the specified dividend target of the commission. </para>
                    <para>The Government is not concerned about the commission at all. It is not concerned about how much money T.A.A. returns to the Commonwealth; it has never been interested in that. The Government has never taken any account of that factor previously, but suddenly it is interested in how much money T.A.A. is to make for the Commonwealth. Anybody can see that the whole thing is a subterfuge. </para>
                    <para>Let us consider these two airlines. TransAustralia .Airlines is running successfully, making a profit and .offering a great service to the people of Australia. It is a government show. .The other line .is .a private enterprise undertaking. The Government has said that it is determined to have two airlines, but it is also determined that the private enterprise airline will .do very well. That is why it has cooked .up this scheme. The Government says that T.A.A. has to return a decent dividend to the Commonwealth. That is just a lot of hooey. Nobody believes it. The -Government has imposed on T.A.A. a target rate of profit , which can be reviewed at any time during the year if so desired. In effect the Government is compelling T.A.A. to add to its expenses a certain amount of money which will have to be recouped either by charging the public more to travel, or by effecting some economies in the organization. .After all, the ' government airline is a pretty efficient organization now. It has demonstrated that by making the private enterprise show look so foolish that . it has had to be given all these advantages by the Government. </para>
                    <para>This legislation .will, in effect, cause T.A.A. to charge the public more "for air travel, lt is only in that way the organization will make a profit of 10 per cent. As a matter of fact the Minister might feel that in one year things are not too good and he may decide therefore that the profit target should be 12 per cent, or 14 per cent. There is nothing to stop him from doing that; it is up to him. If he so desires there is nothing to prevent him from determining that the government airline shall pay a 10 per cent, dividend, or any other percentage that he determines. This arrangement will leave the way open for Ansett Transport Industries Limited to charge such fares that it will be able to compete inefficiently with T.A.A. and still make a profit. I never thought 1 would see the day when this type of proposition would be put up in the Senate. The Government is determined to make huge sums of money available to a private enterprise organization, to enable it not merely to struggle along, but also to make a handsome profit for its shareholders. </para>
                    <para>What do the people of Australia get out of all this? I suggest that they will get an inefficient airline charging more for its services than ought to be charged. They will also get a government airline which is compelled not to compete against the private airline. Other honorable senators have pointed out just how the government airline has been hampered. My leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> pointed out last night very pertinently that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reg</inline> Ansett had written a letter in which he said that these were the sorts of things that he would like to have done. The Government acquiesced in the whole lot of them. The Government has given preferential treatment to this airline. The Government has given it all the money it wanted, and is now going to see that its profits are assured. </para>
                    <para>I repeat: What do the people of Australia get out of all this? Can the Government guarantee that they will get an efficient airline? It cannot. The Government itself has said that the only way in which this system of air services can work is on the basis of free competition which brings about efficiency. The Government has eliminated free competition with the result that inefficiency will follow. The people of Australia will not get an efficient airline out of this arrangement. All they will get will be the delightful responsibility of keeping Ansett-A.N.A in the air whilst their own airline is <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> hampered that it cannot develop and give to Australia the type of service it ought to have. </para>
                    <para>If an organization such as Ansett Transport Industries needs this artificial assistance in order to keep its aircraft flying, it is an inefficient show. If it were efficient it would be able to compete with T.A.A and give a good service to the people of Australia. This is the first time in my experience I have seen a small group of shareholders given this preferential treatment by a government, and being enabled to make a profit as a result of government legislation. The Government is blatantly handing this plum to Ansett Transport Industries and I feel that its action on this occasion surpasses anything I have ever seen before. </para>

                        <para>. -  I should like to refer to the note on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> finished his speech. Anybody who was listening to him would have thought that this Government had money directly invested in Ansett-A.N.A. That is completely untrue. The Government certainly has given guarantees, but the moneys that have been borrowed by that company are covered adequately by mortgages over assets. It is quite untrue to imply that the Government has lent money to Ansett-A.N.A. </para>

                    <para>There is another misconception in respect of the terms and period of operation of these civil aviation agreements. The original 1952 agreement was for a period of fifteen years and normally would have expired in 1967. What appears to have been overlooked is that sub-clause (5.) of clause 3 of that agreement provided as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>No guarantee shall be given by the Commonwealth under this clause in respect of, nor shall any then existing guarantee apply to, any moneys borrowed by the Company after the expiration of a period of fen years from the date of the commencement of this agreement . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is, from 1952 to 1962. The period of five years after 1962 covers the repayment of loans outstanding in 1962. The agreement itself expires in 1962. So, it is for a period of ten years, not some of the periods that I have heard stated in this chamber. </para>
                    <para>This 1961 agreement extends the period in which guarantees can be given from 1962 until 1972 and allows, as was the case in the 1952 agreement, a period of five years for the repayment of loans. Sub-clause (6.) of clause 4 of the agreement which is now before the Senate reads as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>A guarantee shall not be given by the Commonwealth under this clause in respect of any moneys borrowed by Ansett Transport Industries Limited or Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited after the expiration of a period of ten years commencing on the eighteenth day of November, One thousand nine hundred and sixty-two. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">So, this agreement provides for the period up until 1972, but also provides for a period of five years after that year for repayment. However, moneys cannot be lent under this agreement after 1972. lt is essential that while any loan is not repaid the Commonwealth should have full access to the accounts of Ansett Transport Industries Limited. Clause 16 of this 1961 Civil Aviation Agreement, under the heading " Commonwealth access to Company's accounts ", states - </para>

                    <para class="block">So, for a period of five years after this agreement expires, as far as loans are concerned, in 1972, the Commonwealth still will have access to the accounts of Ansett Transport Industries Limited; that is, until 1977. </para>

                        stated that the crosscharter arrangements between AnsettA.N.A. and Trans-Australia Airlines had been to the disadvantage of T.A.A.

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have said that this agreement is a blow to T.A.A. and a straight-out, direct assistance  to  Ansett-A.N.A. Will they please remember that up until now that private operator has had a ceiling of £9,000,000 on its drawings, and this agreement curtails that to £6,000,000? Also, in the past AnsettA.N.A. enjoyed the assurance that if it could not raise on the loan market the £4,000,000 loan that had been guaranteed, the Government would find that money. The clause to that effect has been withdrawn from the agreement. No longer is the Government responsible for finding that £4,000,000. </para>

Is it- not the responsibility of the Government to carry out the policy on which it was elected? Goodness gracious me,- 1 believe it is If members of . the Opposition went to the -people and said that theybelieved in a nationalized' airline, I' would expect them to honour their promise, if they were elected. They probably would honour their promise and nationalize the airline.

                        - Yes: The secondfeature of the bill is that there- will be no increase in navigational charges greater than 10 per- cent, per annum. Thirdly, if there is any increase in tax on' aviation- fuel, theincrease will ' be related to the increase in tax on motor fuel. Fourthly, the bill' will consolidate rationalization procedures:
                    </para>
                    <para>The Airlines Agreement Act of 1959, which introduced detailed provisions- for the rationalization of aircraft flights, was designed to ensure- that neither airline had excess capacity and that, the- acquisition ,  of  additional, aircraft would, be governed by principles that ens-used., that, neither aircraft had a qualitative advantage over the other. The bill: provides- for the purchase of jet aircraft, for delivery not before June, 1964. Re-equipping with jets by then will mean that we shall not be. disposing of other aircraft before they have reached the end of their life. The. jets, by that time, . should take up the normal, increase in traffic, which is running at the rate of - 6 per cent, a year. We may expect an increase of 18 per cent: in traffic, in three years. The report of Trans-Australia Airlines states that; the three Electra aircraft in 1959-60 carried 27 per cent, of the traffic, so the introduction of two jets will mean that we shall not have to get rid of the front-line aircraft that we have to-day. The jets will take up the normal 6 per cent, increase in traffic. The. two jets should meet, the 18 peri cent, increase. The bill is being introduced now, I: understand, because if orders are. lodged by June, 1962, the aircraft ordered will probably not be delivered until June, 1964. I am comforted by the Minister's statement that neither airline will be permitted to obtain an advantage in delivery dates. . Section. 13' of the Airlines Equipment Act i of- 19-5.8 is admirably- designed to achieve this- objective andi it is- therefore proposed- that1 all' applications- for turbojet aircraft, will. be. determined in accordsance with the principles of that act. </para>
                    <para>Iri passing, I mention that I have notheard any- one make reference to -the type of' jet aircraft- that may, be considered; The only, information,that I.have been, able to. obtain is that at this point it appears that four pure jet aircraft may be con? sidered. These are. the. De Havilland Trident, the. Boeing 727,' the French Caravelle, and. the British Aircraft Corporation's aircraft known as XXXX 111. Only time will tell which . of " these will' be. chosen. Government guarantees to Ansett-A.N.A. in the past could, have reached a ceiling of £9,000,000: This bill reduces the ceiling to- £6-000,000, and removes the provision that th'e Commonwealth will find up to- £4,000,000 - if ' the- company is-- unable to raise the total amount by way of loan'. </para>

                            <para>- No. According to the Minister,- the cost of the aircraft, dependent upon the type- selected, will be between £1,200,000 and- £-2,000,000. Having regard to the minimum requirements over the ensuing ten- years, the Government has decided that the- £9,000,000 ceiling considered appropriate in 1952 should be replaced by similar arrangements authorizing guarantees for the repayment of loans not exceeding at -any one time £6,000,000. This- figure will, of course, enable the company to purchase significantly more than the two turbo-jet aircraft con&gt; templated for 1964. </para>

                    <para>The Minister went on to say that it was the Government's intention to take whatever steps were reasonably necessary to ensure that the commission- was- in- a position to purchase all turbo-jet aircraft for which a certificate was issued. It- seemsprobable that the commission will be able to finance at- least- the first of the turbojets from its own resources, but in any event* appropriate steps will: be taken to ensure that it is not prejudiced, in playing its rolein the two-airline policy, because of lack', of capital or limitation of its borrowing, powers. The Minister also said that further purchases by the company would be geared to purchases by the commission. That is an important factor. </para>
                    <para>It is rather, significant, in view of Her Majesty's Opposition's attitude, that all of the proposals of the Minister have met, with, the approval of both the commission and Ansett-A.N.A. Figures in relation to the growth of T.A.A. have been given, but one set of figures that J.' have not heard mentioned relates to the number of. personnel employed. In 1948-49, T.A.A. carried 454,759 passengers and at that time its staff, numbered 3,393. That is shown by the 1949 report. In 1961 the number of passengers carried jumped to 1,071,000 - well", over double - but the staff. had increased to only. 4,168. An increase in staff of only 775 has accounted for more than double the. traffic. </para>
                    <para>T.A.A. issued a. rather, interesting publication on- its fifteenth- anniversary. It makesme, smile when, the Opposition keeps saying, that this Government is* trying to driveT.A.A. out of the air and doing everything in- the world- to impair?' it's growth and existence. For twelve- out of the fifteen years of its life, T.A.A. has been- run by this Government, and since 1956 it has been in the very capable hands of my Western Australian colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge.</inline> It is significant to look at the period from 1956 to 1961, but I shall go back a little further to examine the position of this airline that the Government, according to my friends opposite, is still trying to drive out of the air. </para>
                    <para>In May, 1951, two years after this Government took over,- T.A.A. carried its 2;000,000th passenger. In- 1954 it carried its 4;000,000th- passenger and one year later it carried- its 5,000,000th passenger. This is the airline- that is being restricted and curtailed! In 1959, the- total number of passengers carried had jumped to- 8,000,000. In 1960 T.A.A. became the first Australian airline to carry 1,000,000 passengers in twelve months. This is a- very fine record for an airline that is- being, kicked and subjugated by all sorts of restrictions! By June, 1961, it had carried its 10,000,000th. passenger. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Acting* Deputy President,</inline> I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a&gt; later stage: </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of this bill and the associatedmeasure, the Cattle and Beef Research Bill, is to introduce certain amendments to the existing legislation to meet the position arising from the issue by certain meat interests of a High Court writ challenging the validity- of the cattle and beef research legislation of I960". It may facilitate consideration of these bills if I review briefly the situation which- has held up the active, approach to beef research that is so important to the welfare of the Australian beef' cattle industry. The cattle and beef research legislation provides for the collection of a levy on all cattle slaughtered for human consumption over 200 lb. dressed weight. The levy is payable by the person owning the cattle at the time of slaughter. The maximum rate of levy is 2s. per beast. </para>
                <para>The research scheme was developed on the premise that while the owners of the stock at the time of slaughter would be responsible for the payment of the levy, the impact of the levy would actually be borne by the cattle-producing section of the industry through adjustment of the livestock purchase price in the same way as allowance is made by the meat works operators in the ordinary course of events for changes in the supply and demand situation, overseas market price trends and outlook, killing charges and freight or other operating costs. </para>
                <para>After the slaughter levy came into operation on 1st July, 1960, meat operators began to deduct the amount of the levy from the selling agents' invoices in respect of cattle purchased at auction. The result was that the selling agents, with no legal right under the legislation to deduct the levy from the account sales of the vendor of the cattle, had in many instances to bear the impact themselves. In the case of private treaty sales, meat operators were deducting the levy from the account sales of the producer without any apparent difficulty. </para>
                <para>Following representations by various interests, my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline> met a combined deputation of meat industry and cattle producer representatives on 28th July, 1960. At that meeting the meat operators contended that they could not make allowances for the amount of the levy in their buying limits at auction sales, and, like the selling agents' representatives, they requested that the existing legislation should be amended to ensure that cattle producers are made directly responsible for financing the research plan, since the major producer organizations had sponsored the plan and had indicated the willingness of the cattle raisers to finance it. The cattle men in turn maintained that in fact the producer interests would bear the levy through adjustments in the purchasing limits of the meat operators. The Minister informed the deputation that, if after a reasonable trial, the scheme proved to be unworkable, he was prepared to consider an alternative method of collection if the industry as a whole submitted and supported a satisfactory proposal. Subsequently, an announcement by the selling agents that they intended to take concerted legal action to recover the short payments that had been made by meat operators in respect of the cattle slaughter levy culminated in the High Court action. Following the issue of the High Court writ the Minister for Primary Industry agreed to suspend the collection of the cattle slaughter levy as from 14th October, 1960, pending the decision of the High Court as to its validity. </para>
                <para>In an endeavour to find a satisfactory solution to the problem various alternative methods of collection other than by way of a slaughter tax were examined, including a stamp system on cattle sales and a tax at the point of purchase with authority for selling agents to make an immediate deduction. It was found that all the alternatives examined contained serious practical or legal difficulties. The fact that some of the big operators own large properties and breed cattle themselves for slaughter is an added complication. The crux of the problem, therefore, is that the meat operators and the selling agents both want the legal authority to pass on the incidence of the slaughter levy to the last vendor of the live-stock. </para>
                <para>The main meat producer organizations have now agreed in principle to the amount payable in respect of the levy being deducted as a separate charge from the account sales of the vendor and the amendment proposed has the full support of all sections of the industry. This bill provides for the present scheme to be extended to give meat operators and selling agents the legal right to relieve themselves of the incidence of the levy at the time the cattle are purchased for slaughter. The levy itself will be payable by the owner of the stock at the time of slaughter, but the amendments proposed will ensure that the impact of the levy will in fact fall on the vendor of the cattle as was the original intention of the plan. </para>
                <para>As a further practical step towards resolving the present issue the Government on the recommendation of the industry has decided to exempt all parties from financial obligation as from 14th October, 1960, when the collection of the levy was suspended, until 14th October, 1961. In order to implement the recommendation of the industry it will be necessary to provide for the revocation of the levy for that period and at a later stage I shall be introducing the Cattle Slaughter Levy (Suspension) Bill for this purpose. </para>
                <para>Representations were also made by the industry requesting that the levy collected prior to the High Court challenge should be refunded to the selling agents in all cases where documentary evidence established that the agents concerned had in fact borne the impact of the levy. The Government was not agreeable to this course and meat operators have since indicated that they are prepared to forgo any claims to refund of levies paid by them to the Commonwealth and that they would negotiate with the selling agents regarding moneys that had been deducted by them in respect of their purchases of the cattle on which they had paid such levies in the period concerned. This offer was made by the operators in the full knowledge that if the agents were not satisfied with the settlement arrangements, they would still have the right of recourse to legal action. </para>
                <para>On the general issues relating to the High Court action the principal concern of the Government was to overcome the present impasse and get the scheme operating again as quickly as possible with the maximum of goodwill all round. This attitude was also evident on the part of meat producers and consequently, no action was taken by either party to proceed with the High Court writ. The Commonwealth legal advisers did, however, hold the view that the Commonwealth may well have succeeded in maintaining the validity of the existing legislation, but in order to remove any doubt as to its validity, provision has been made to amend the Cattle and Beef Research Act, by describing the research that may be undertaken as research that would be of benefit to the export of beef and the raising of cattle in the internal Territories of the Commonwealth rather than as research described in general terms not expressly related to Commonwealth powers, as in the existing legislation. </para>
                <para>While it is regrettable that the active approach to beef research has been delayed through the present unfortunate stalemate, the important consideration is to get the beef research scheme on the move without further waste of time. As recently announced, the Government has agreed to make available substantial finance for cattle roads in northern parts of Australia to assist in developing the beef industry. It is essential that increased research activities should go hand in hand with these developments. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>-  Prior to the suspension of the sitting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I stated that in June last Trans-Australia Airlines carried it 10,000,000th passenger. I was supporting my contention that, far from the Government curtailing the activities of T.A.A., it had a magnificent record in respect of the government-owned airline. If we look back to the days when this Government took over from the Australian LabourParty, we see that the airline's front-line fleet at the time consisted of five Convair 240's, three DC4's, nineteen passenger DC3's, four freighter DC3's, and four DH84's. To-day, we find that the airline controls three Electras, twelve Viscounts, ten Friendships, two DC6B's, three DC4's, eleven DC3's, four C47's and two H12E helicopters.I should have thought that if the Government wanted to do as the Opposition suggests we would nothave seen such growth. </para>

There was also a5 percent. dividend in1958,  1959  and  1960. </para>

Let us consider the operations of this airline that we are said to be curtailing and trying to kill.If we refer to the airline's annual report for  1959-60,  we see, first, that it is controlled by six very solidcitizens, one of whom, I believe, was appointed under aLabour government. At page3we note that the trading profit for the year was  £352,938,  the highest earnedbytheairline. I understand that  this year'sprofit will be higher still. The reportstates that trading during the year was buoyant. The number of passengers carried was 24.1 per cent, higher than in 1958-59. The total payroll was. £5,296,4.82, which, was paid to a staff of 4,168 persons, or an average amount, including overtime, of £1,289 for the year, or about £25 a week.

If I remember correctly, Ansett Transport Industries Limited employs about 6*000 people.

                <para>The report contains some figures which  1  should particularly like to have recorded in " Hansard ". To my knowledge, they have not so far been referred to during this debate. They show how each £1 of revenue is made up. Passenger fares and charters accounted for 16s. Id. in the £1, or 80.6 per cent.; freight, 2s. 6d., or 12.4 per cent.; mail, 8d., or 3.2 per cent.; and incidentals, 9d., or 3.8 per cent. Of the total revenue, 36.2. per cent., was spent in remunerating staff, which accounted for 7s. 3d. in the £1; 17.9 per cent, was expended on fuel and oil consumed by the aircraft fleet units, which was 3s. 7d. in the £1; 10 per cent, was provided for depreciation and obsolescence of fixed assets, which was 2s. in the £1; 33.5 per cent, was expended on services and other expenses not elsewhere classified, which was 6s. 8d. in the £1; 2 per cent, was set aside for payment of a five per cent, dividend on capital, which was 5d. in the  £1;  and  .4  per cent, was retained to strengthen the financial position of the business, which was Id. in the £1. </para>
                <para>In order further to indicate T.A.A.'s consolidation under this Government, I think it should be noted that while the assets of the organization were about £4,500,000 at 30th June, 1949, shortly before the Government took office, they now amount to more than £17,000,000. I remind the Senate that since 1957 T.A.A.'s passenger traffic has increased by more than 35 per cent., while that of the Ansett group has increased by only 21 per cent. How can honorable senators opposite substantiate their claim that the Government is trying to drive T.A.A. out of the air? If they look at the annual reports of the airline when they were in office and compare them with the. annual reports since then,, they must agree that the organization has been expanding and has been doing a remarkable job. </para>
                <para>This is a good bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I think its. provisions, wilt keep Australia in the forefront of civil aviation.

Much of the credit for that record is due to the Department of Civil Aviation, and to. the administration of the Minister.. I congratulate both the department and the.

                    <para>.- My remarks will be very brief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President. Senator Cole</inline> and I, representing the Australian Democratic Labour Party, will support the bill. The policy of our party is opposed to monopolies, whether they are run by private enterprise or by the State. As we have said on previous occasions, notably a couple of years ago when a somewhat similar bill was being discussed, because we are opposed to monopoly we are prepared to give the private airline a reasonable opportunity to compete with the State airline. I emphasize that we are in favour of giving the private airline a reasonable opportunity to compete with the State airline. A couple of years ago I expressed doubts as to whether a private organization could compete with the State in a field so costly and so difficult as that of air transport. Although I was doubtful that a private organization could compete successfully with a State organization in such a field, I believed that if the private organization sought the opportunity to do so it was entitled to be given its chance. However, I expressed the view at that time that if ever I thought an inordinate degree of protection were being given to the private airline, my opinion would change. I have examined this legislation very carefully and I do not think it proposes an inordinate degree of protection. There are one or two points on which I am not entirely certain but, taking the legislation in general, I feel that we are entitled to give the people running the private airline an opportunity to prove that they can compete successfully. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There are very sound arguments in favour of having two airlines, if you can keep them in operation. First, I believe that monopoly is bad, whether it be State monopoly or private monopoly. Therefore, I am in favour of having two airlines. Experience in other fields where monopolies exist shows that, under monopolies, the tendency is to give the public inferior services. Secondly, I believe that from the defence viewpoint it is an advantage to have two airlines with modern aircraft, providing transport opportunities, employing skilled staff and training skilled staff. I believe that where there is competition there is more efficiency. We must pay some regard to the fact that both airlines have notable records for efficiency, and J believe that to some extent that is due to the rivalry between them. In my view, with two airlines in competition you get better aircraft, better facilities and better services. </para>
                <para>I have a lot of respect for the Minister's judgment, and I listened carefully to what he had to say. I would not like to think that we were being unfair to either airline in this matter, and I believe the Minister's statement that in this instance he is actuated by a desire to be fair to both sides. I would not like, in particular, to see action taken which would result in the private airline closing down now, because that could lead to considerable unemployment and the dispersal of a skilled organization which could be very valuable to us in time of war. I emphasize that T am careful to examine all bills of this nature because I do not believe that we should give inordinate protection to the private airline. In this case I do not think we are giving protection beyond that which should be given. </para>
                <para>I have read the debates that occurred when we considered legislation similar to this two years ago and I have been struck by the gloomy forecasts that were given then on this side of the House regarding the effects of the legislation on TransAustralia Airlines. Reading the debates, one imagined that T.A.A. would have to close down, but, in fact, the reports of the airline indicate that probably it has never been better off than it is now. </para>
                <para>I have listened to the suggestions that this legislation will be a bonanza for the shareholders of Ansett-A.N.A. I am not an expert on the stock exchange - I have never had enough money to acquire the necessary knowledge - but I looked at the financial columns of the Melbourne " Age " during the luncheon period. I saw that the 5s. shares of Ansett Transport Industries Limited are valued at 5s. 8d. to-day. That does not indicate that they are regarded as gilt-edged securities. I read also in the Melbourne " Age " that the shares dropped Id. yesterday. That does not indicate to me that people with money to invest consider that those shares are 100 per cent, investments. Let us be quite candid. Having regard to the difficulties with which a private body is faced in competing with a public body, I suppose many shrewd people say to themselves, " It may be that the private body will not make a go of this, so I do not think I should put my money into it ". </para>
                <para>Statements have been made to the effect that you cannot socialize air transport because, under the Constitution, there is no power to do so. My mind goes back to the days of the bank nationalization legislation, which I supported. I remember that at that time some people in the party to which I belonged asked, " Why did the Prime Minister take legislative action to nationalize banking when we could have done it so much more effectively and easily by using our powers to compete the private banks out of existence? " </para>

                    <para>. - in reply - I want to devote the opening sentences of this speech to an assessment of the approaches made to the airlines question by the Government parties and by the Opposition. I think that is necessary because some of the speeches that have been made by honorable senators on the other side of the chamber may have left on some minds the very strong impression  that,  despite all that happened in the past,  the  Labour Party is not now in favour  of a  government monopoly of airlines.  Those  speeches may have given the impression that what happened in 1947 or thereabouts happened almost by mistake, and that from the time when the High Court of Australia ruled against the Labour Government  in  relation to the operation of interstate airlines the Labour Party adopted  a  completely different approach to the problem and is now not intent at all on establishing a government monopoly. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Let me refer to a publication which, I should think, will be widely used as a Labour Party handbook during the forthcoming election campaign. It is the biography of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> written by Professor Crisp. To give Professor Crisp his due, he acknowledges in the preface that he has been a supporter of the Labour Party all his life. Certainly, nothing that he has written in the book would induce me to believe that the book was not written for the express purpose of supporting  the  Labour Party. Therefore, what is written in it can be taken as accurate from Labour's viewpoint. At page 178 he refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley's</inline> approach to nationalization in the following passage - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In addition to the evidence relating  directly  to this issue, it is worth recalling that in another matter dealt with at the same time - air transport - Chifley was unhesitatingly for nationalisation. Replying to the Second Reading debate on  the  Australian National Airlines Bill in July, 1943, he said: " I have supported no other Bill so strongly and warmly as I support this one. I was a member of the Cabinet committee which recommended it to the Government. My only regret is that the Constitution confines the Government to interstate airlines, but I do not despair about the prospects of our controlling intrastate airlines. The proper monopoly, if there is to be one, is a government monopoly. That is our purpose." </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Having regard to the policy laid down at that time, it is rather surprising to hear in this debate that some members of the Opposition retire blushingly from that policy. In point of fact, they do not. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> said yesterday that after the defeat in the High Court on the airlines issue there was a realization by the Labour Party that it could not nationalize air transport, but the fact is that from then on the Labour Party, then in government, pursued with even greater vigour a policy of driving out private enterprise and of establishing a government monopoly.  It  will be recalled that at that time action was taken by the Labour Government against private enterprise in this field. It introduced a scale of air navigation charges which were designed to be crippling. There was the uncontrolled competition of the government airline against the private entity, the expropriation of the private airlines, particularly the expropriation of the private airline which operated to Darwin. to which I shall refer a little later. To come more up to date, 1 recall that ii was only in 1957, when the issue of airlines was attracting the attention of the public, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell,</inline> the present Leader of the Labour Party, said that when his party came to office it would tear up the civil aviation agreement of that year. It is only eighteen months ago that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitlam,</inline> the heir to the throne - with his eyes on the distant goal - said that there will be a government airline, and one airline only within the foreseeable future. 1 suggest that it is difficult for the Labour Party now to establish that it does not intend, as it always has been intent upon, to establish a government monopoly and to cripple private enterprise in this field. </para>

                <para>Now let me come to the debate itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> led for the Opposition with his usual vigour. While not wishing to be offensive to the  Deputy  Leader o) the Opposition in the Senate, I must say that he never fails to remind me, when he speaks on airlines, of the tipster who stands outside the gate at the races selling tips to those people who are going to back their fancy inside. Like that tipster, who is usually unreliable, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> has been selling the wrong tip for too long. He has a decreasing number of supporters who are all a little tired of this story that the Government has been intent upon killing Trans-Australia Airlines. Contributions from my side of the chamber, for which I am grateful, have indicated unmistakably that the progress made by T.A.A. under this Government has, in fact, been remarkable when compared with the progress of any other airline in the world. </para>
                <para>The Government's approach has never been, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> repeated throughout his speech, one of concern only for T.A.A. The Government's approach has been that the airline industry is valuable and essential, and that the Government has the obligation to look after, not only one part of that industry, but the entire industry. The Government's record shows that it has done this with success. The really galling part of the success of this policy, so far as the Labour Party is concerned, is not that T.A.A. has not made progress, but that it has. The Opposition's big beef about the success of the Government's policy is that while T.A.A. has been making giant strides forward, the private enterprise operator has been going forward in consonance with the general march of progress in this country. </para>

                <para>In pursuing the line that he invariably takes, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> said that the Government has taken action after action to cripple the government airline, and he quoted a number of instances. The first action was the tax on aviation kerosene. He said that that tax was imposed so that T.A.A. would not reap the advantage of having purchased the Viscount aircraft. The fact, of course, is that T.A.A. operated Viscounts using av-ker for two or three years before a tax was imposed. The tax was not imposed until the private enterprise airline had arranged to purchase aircraft which, like those operated by T.A.A., used av-ker. </para>

The debate was the most pitiable that has ever been initiated by an opposition in this chamber. The Opposition failed completely to establish the point it wanted so badly to establish, namely, that the cross-charter agreement, entered into by the commission of its own free will, operated to the commission's disadvantage. If any confirmation of that fact is needed, surely it is provided in the measure now before the chamber. To the full agreement - which is annexed to the first bill with which we are dealing - the commision subscribes its name. That agreement provides for the continuance of the cross-charter deal until the first of the jets are commissioned. </para>

                    harked back to the choice of aircraft. He said that in 1957 or 1958 the Government again sorely handicapped T.A.A. by imposing on it  a  certain type of aircraft. He said that the Government refused T.A.A. permission to purchase Caravelle aircraft. I will remind the Senate of the circumstances of that. The Government said to both airlines - I repeat, to both airlines - " No pure jet aircraft will be introduced into Australia at this time ". The Caravelle was then available and it was  a  pure jet. The Government said that neither the Caravelle nor any other pure jet would be admitted into Australia at that time. Having regard to the experience of the last four years, who will say that that was not the wisest decision that the Government could have made at that time? From our studies of jets and their operations round the world we were aware that they imposed great strains in the provision of the necessary ground facilities in this and other countries. In our opinion, there were aspects of their operations which would take a little time to assess properly. How right did our decision turn out to be!

                <para>In 1957, lacking all the ground facilities that were needed for the introduction of jets and also 'lacking the operational experience -which is always desirable, we said, " No pure jets shall be used on the domestic airlines at this time". Pure jets were excluded. I suggest that that was the wisest decision that could have been made at the time. It applied equally to both operators. Incidentally, both operators then turned elsewhere and bought two different types of aircraft. Both operators bought Electra aircraft and both operators bought Viscount 800 aircraft. No handicap was suffered by T.A.A. as a result of that decision. </para>

We have sustained that policy for ten years and we plan to sustain it further. That is why we do not sell T.A.A. As an earnest of the Government's intention, I remind die Senate that the preamble to the 1957 agreement included a passage which said, in effect, " There shall be two and not more than two operators on the trunk .routes, one of which shall be the commission". What nonsense it is for members of the Opposition to say continually that we intend to sell T.A.A. or we intend to cripple it, when, as a basis of the policy that we follow, the preamble to that agreement contains a provision that there shall be two airlines, one of which shall be the commission. For good measure, that provision is written into the agreement that we are now discussing. </para>

                    criticized rationalization. He said that it has worked harshly. It has worked so harshly that after four years' experience both operators have concluded that it has been so good that they should agree to extend it for a further ten years. Both operators have signed an agreement to that effect. The honorable senator also referred briefly to the Government's desire to standardize equipment. The Government has never expressed any desire to do that; it has always spoken in terms of parity both of quality and quantity. In my second-reading speech I referred specifically to the fact that the aircraft, whilst being similar types in general, need not be of the same make or the same model.

He said Queensland was pioneered by TA.A. What utter rubbish!

                <para class="block">Darwin air route? It includes one of the most cruel and vicious actions of a Labour government. A Labour government expropriated that air route from a private enterprise group for £25,000. The route was conducted as a monopoly for ten years after that happened. A profit of about £1,000,000 was made over that period of ten years by the monopoly that was established by the Labour government. </para>
                <para>The honorable senator said that TAA got nothing out of the New Guinea airlines. What about the Lae, Rabaul and internal services? Did it not get the services to Honiara and Hollandia? Who gave the honorable senator his information? Obviously he does not know that T.A.A. received those benefits. </para>
                <para>Then he gave us some of his views on intra-state operations. It is pertinent to say here that, in any event, intra-state operation accounts for only 10 per cent, of the passengers listed in Australia. But, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly,</inline> why do we not let T.A.A. operate intra-state? This is a great little idea! The story of the feeder airlines in Australia is a stark one, whether we like it or not. With the exception of the Guinea Airways group in South Australia, no feeder operators, regarded as a whole, can operate at a profit within Australia. Each and every one, with the exception of the Guinea group, has to be subsidized. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> says that there are two operators in New South Wales. Both of them, for the purpose of bringing this modern, very desirable form of transport to country people, are subsidized. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly's</inline> serious suggestion, made in this place, is that T.A.A. should be admitted to New South Wales, so that instead of subsidizing two airlines we can subsidize three airlines. I put it to the honorable senator that even his keen affection for T.A.A. should not carry him to the point of absurdity. </para>

We do it now because the guarantee provisions of the existing agreement cut out in 1962, and both airlines - and for that matter the Department of Civil Aviation - must know in good time what the position is going to be so that both airlines and the department may plan for years ahead. These things cannot be done in 24 hours or in a month. They must be planned ahead. Because the guarantee provisions will expire next year, we are taking the opportunity this year of letting the airlines and the public know what the position is to be. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Senate. I shall not detain it a great deal longer. The point then, so said the Opposition, was that this Government was going to run T.A.A. into a loss so that the Government would then have justification for selling it. Of course the record, so frequently referred to throughout this debate, shows that far from that occurring, in the following year the profit went to £283,000, in the year after that to £254,000, and last year to a record of £363,000. This year that record profit will be improved upon, lt is a bit difficult for the Opposition to set itself up as a reliable prophet in view of what happened in that respect, particularly as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> this morning seemed to be taking the opposite view that by forcing up the profit level we are going to make the airline so profitable as to wreak disaster on the industry just the same. </para>

                </continue><para>I want to say something about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> speech. It is regrettable that I have not the time to refer to other aspects of the debate. He referred to the emergence of a third operator. He said that if that should occur it could be disastrous to a two-airline policy. It is theoretically possible for a third operator to attempt to start an airline in this country but I do not think that it comes within the bounds of practical business.  1  do not think that any one in Australia or elsewhere would propose to put into the establishment of a third airline in this country the many millions of pounds that would be required for that purpose. If that remote possibility did come to pass, it would be a difficulty which the Government would have to face and solve. Let me say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that in those circumstances this Government would administer the civil aviation laws of the land, and the relevant regulations made under those laws, in a completely constitutional way. We would not attempt in any way to evade the Constitution. </para><para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    suggested, as he did on another occasion, that the rationalization proposals might offend section 92 of the Constitution. I think it is well known that I never argue legal points with a lawyer. When a legal point arises, I myself generally run for a lawyer. However, on this occasion, not in any dogmatic way, I say to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    that the rationalization effected under this legislation is effected by way of a mutual agreement reached between the two operating parties. That, I think, may place a completely different complexion on the matter.

                    referred to what he called the hypocrisy of the Government in maintaining an overseas airline as a monopoly - a hypocrisy apparently stemming from the fact that whilst we have one overseas airline, we encourage a two-airline policy domestically. I point out to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    that he is trying to compare two things that are not alike. I am sure that he knows that. In any event, he should not draw the conclusion that because we do not have two Australia-owned overseas airlines there is no competition on overseas air routes. Our overseas airline is to-day more than just an airline. It is an instrument of government policy in many respects. There are good reasons, extending far beyond the factors that we are discussing here, why a government, in this modern world, should own or at least control its own international airline.
                </para><para>I should like to refer to many other points that were raised. One of them was the letter that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> circulated to all members of the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition took the view that receipt of this letter had prompted the Government to take certain action. 1 ask the honorable senator to look objectively and fairly at the letter. It did not say anything that was not in fact well known to everybody who had addressed himself for a long time to the problem of civil aviation in Australia. Every point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> raised was one that had been discussed and canvassed in airline circles for years. </para><interjection>

                        <para>-  Exactly. There is no doubt that many of the things to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> referred were not fully understood by many members of this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> took the opportunity of circulating a comprehensive statement in what was, whether youlike him or not, a characteristically forthright and courageous way. He did not address himself only to Government supporters. He addressed himself to honorable senators opposite - his enemies - just as much as he addressed himself to Government supporters. The fact that he wrote as he did had no weight at all with the Government and in no way influenced the introduction of this legislation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>One of the important things about this legislation is that the majority of its provisions - indeed, its main provisions - have been accepted and adhered to by the two operators concerned1. Both operators have said that the things about which there has been so much complaint - the provision of jet aircraft, the provision of guarantees and advances for T.A.A. to buy those aircraft, rationalization and even to some extent comparable cost structures - are all necessary in a two-airline policy. The fact is that they have been accepted not only by Ansett-A.N.A. but also by T.A.A. As has been pointed out by one or two speakers in the debate, a noteworthy signatory to this agreement on behalf of Ansett-A.N.A. is none other than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Jones, the Labour Party candidate for Henty in the forthcoming elections. Whilst honorable senators opposite have criticized the agreement and all that it contains, one of their endorsed candidates has signed it on behalf of the private enterprise entity. I mean no offence at all to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> or to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> - I listen to them with great respect on many matters that are discussed here - but dealing with the operation of airlines, although I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Jones, I would be prepared to accept his view rather than theirs. </para><interjection>

                        <para>-  He should. Why is it that honorable senators opposite do not agree with him? The bill proposes amendments to the act. Those amendments will govern the conduct of civil aviation in this country over the next fifteen years. I suggest that a review of the debate would show clearly that not one of the provisions of this measure has come under serious challenge from the Opposition or from any other quarter of the chamber. Honorable senators opposite have spoken against the bill for political reasons only. They have not taken any of the proposals individually and tackled them on their merits. Although I could say a lot more, I will leave the matter there. </para>

                    <para>. - The agreement embodied in the second schedule binds the two airline operators not to introduce jet ; aircraft before 1964. That is a great improvement on the Electra aircraft episode which the Minister so glibly glossed over in his reply to the second-reading debate. He did not say anything about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> wanting to purchase a certain type of aircraft, of the Minister saying, " No, you musthave Viscounts ", and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> thengoing to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and telling him he wantedElectra aircraft. The Minister did not say that the Prime Minister replied, " All right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett,</inline> have Electras". The Minister did not tell us, ofcourse, that he had to bow to what his chief had said. We all have to bow to superior authority at 'some time or other, however nauseating it may be to doso. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Although the Minister said nothing about that matter, he did make one rather remarkable statement. He said that the reason why he did not agree to T.A.A. introducing Caravelle jet aircraft, was, in effect, that the aerodromes andrunways were not suitable for them.  I  hope  I  am quoting the Minister's words correctly.  I  should hate to follow his example and put up an Aunt Sally only to knock it down, which is the easiest way to debate anissue.  I  hope  I  may take it that whatI have said, in fewer words, is an accurate interpretation of his remarks. Surely the Minister is not trying  to  convince tire Parliament and the People of this country that 'he wasso ignorant of the position when T.A.A. asked for permission to purchase Caravelles. As I have said, he stated, in effect, that if TA.A. bought Caravelles they could not be used. </para>

                        <para>- That also seems remarkable to me. As the Minister has said, T.A.A. has achieved great success. Every one must agree that that is so. But we are claiming that it would have been much more successful if it had not been hog-tied. I personally am delighted with its success, and I think that the Minister is. too. Nevertheless, our claim is that if he hart got out of the way and allowed it to compete as freely as he has so often claimed it has, we both could have basked in the greater glory of that enhanced success. Instead, the airline has been pulled back to the field. </para>

                <para>The Minister's remarks in his reply to the second-reading debate astounded me because I do not think for a moment that the people who run T.A.A. have so little knowledge of the aircraft industry that they would want to purchase aircraft of a certain type for their fleet if, as the Minister said, they were unsuitable, not in carrying capacity but because of something to do with runways. I am pleased that the two airlines are to be given a fair go when they are able to obtain jet aircraft. At least, the Government is not saying that operator A may obtain jet aircraft earlier than operator B. I hope that no one will say that TA.A. must purchase some other type of aircraft. If that happens and there is interference, I will be well on the side of T.A.A., although I suppose it will not matter very much whose side I am on. 1 am sorry that 1 am not a shorthand writer and was not able to take down the actual words that the Minister used. As I have said, I thought they were rather remarkable. Over the years the Minister has acquired an extensive knowledge of the airlines industry and I am sure he will admit that if T.A.A. had been allowed to buy Caravelle jets when it asked for them, this country would have had jet aircraft in about 1957, or seven  yeaTS  before we will in fact have them. I do not think that even the Minister could convince me that if T.A.A. had bought jet aircraft, runway difficulties or other factors would have been allowed to prevent their use on the main Australian trunk routes. </para>

                    <para>. -  There are a number of points in the schedule to which I wish to advert, but at the moment I will advert to one only. I notice that four parties to the agreement are referred to in the first paragraph of the schedule. They are the Commonwealth of Australia, of the first part; the Australian National Airlines Commission - that is T.A.A. - of the second part; Ansett Transport Industries Limited, of the third  part;  and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, of the fourth part. I was under the impression that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had changed its name to AnsettA.N.A. It appears from the way in which the company is described here that it has not done so and that it is operating under the trade name of Ansett-A.N.A. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>When I first read this bill, that left me in some doubt and confusion. I suggest that it would have been of advantage to insert after the words "Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited " the words " carrying on business under the trade name of Ansett-A.N.A." I ask the Minister whether Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is in fact carrying on under another trade name. If that is so, I mildly regret that that fact was not recorded in the agreement in such a way as to bring a description of the company up to date. </para>
                <para>There is another allied matter to which I wish to refer. Clause 3(1.) of the agreement begins with the words - </para>
                <para>The Commission and the Company . . . </para>
                <para>When I reached that point, the questions that arose in my mind were: " Which company? Are we now referring to the party of the third part, Ansett Transport Industries Limited, or to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? " Two companies are mentioned, and then there is a reference to " the Company ". I found the explanation in clause 23, where the following definition appears -  " the Company " means Ansett Transport Industries Limited and every company or firm in which Ansett Transport Industries Limited has from time to time, whether directly or indirectly, a controlling interest. </para>
                <para class="block">That definition picks up the two companies, Ansett Transport Industries Limited and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, in addition to every other company in which from time to time, whether directly or indirectly, they may have a controlling interest. 1 now take the Minister back to 1957, when I was very critical of a similar provision in the legislation of that year, naming the parties and requiring Ansett Transport Industries Limited to be bound in respect of subsidiary companies in which it had a controlling interest. I pointed out then in my second-reading speech and at the committee stage that that left the position open to Ansett Transport Industries Limited to form a new company, which would not be bound, and I said there was a danger that, with the acquisition of Butler Airlines, a third operator would be in the field immediately and that that operator would not be bound by the rationalization agreement of 1957. I put that argument very strongly, and I should like to read to the Minister the reply that he gave. At page 1461 of "Hansard" of 21st November, 1957, he is reported as having said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I am advised by the law department that those provisions are expressly to apply to all airline companies in which A.T.I, has a controlling interest. These words speak at all times during the continuance of the agreement so as to include companies in which A.T.I, acquires a controlling interest at a later date. Any other interpretation would be meaningless since at the present time A.T.I, only has a controlling interest in A.N.A. and Ansett Airways. Both these parties are parties to the agreement. Furthermore, the fourth recital declares the parties' intent that the agreement shall be construed having regard to the stated objectives of the parties. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I am delighted to know that the Minister has abandoned that viewpoint and that the term " the Company " is now expressed to include not only Ansett Transport Industries Limited but also all the companies in which from time to time that company, whether directly or indirectly, has a controlling interest. </para>

                <para>At this time, 1 wish to direct attention to what I consider to be a grave defect in the agreement of 1957 in not extending the agreement so as to pick up companies that might be formed at a later date by Ansett Transport Industries Limited. The Minister said it was not necessary to do so because the agreement was wide enough for that purpose. However, I direct attention to the fact that in more than one place in the agreement before us the viewpoint I have just expressed has been adopted. It is made perfectly clear in the new agreement that the term " Ansett Transport Industries Limited ", picks up Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, in which the organization has a controlling- interest, and other subsidiaries in existence now, and also picks up, in future, any other companies in which Ansett Transport Industries have either a direct or indirect controlling interest. </para>

I look forward with extreme pleasure to the occasion that he has forecast when he and I might stand together and hold the same view on some particular point. As for the rest of his comments in connexion with the choice of the Caravelle aircraft, I put the following proposition to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, entertaining as. 1 do the faintest suspicion that, in the unlikely event, of the Labour Party becoming a. government, he may well be the Minister for Civil Aviation. If he obtains that portfolio, he will find he is in what can be fairly described as a skin game when it comes1 to dealing with airlines. Whether the airline concerned is government-owned or privately owned, it knows how to go about getting its own way. </para>

                        <para>- No. Although the position was as I described it in respect of the introduction of Caravelles, it was not beyond the thoughts of the Australian National Airlines Commission, or the thoughts of the other entity, to take some further action, if such a course suited it, which would have got further again in advance of the date on which the Government desired to undertake it, or thought it wise to undertake it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not withdrawing one bit from what I said before. I am merely explaining that had the facilities been developed to a desirable point, that would have been a factor which any airline wanting this particular type of aircraft would have regarded. It would have ordered the aircraft and during the time lapse before the delivery date pressure would have been applied to the Government to provide the necessary facilities. </para>

                        <para>- Let me repeat what I said when I replied to the second-reading debate. I said that the introduction of the Caravelle aircraft would have posed very severe problems in the provision of facilities. The plain fact is that we were not ready to introduce pure jet aircraft on the domestic airlines. If I look for support for that statement I look to the experience of many countries which now acknowledge that as a result of a too-early introduction of pure jet aircraft they made mistakes which subsequently proved most costly. They found that their facilities subsequently proved to be deficient or unsuitable in some way. The provision of appropriate air terminals is only one instance of this. Because of blast and excess noise special treatment has to be given to an air terminal which is servicing jet aircraft. Many airports in other countries found that out to their great cost. I am not now referring to the highly technical matters. </para>

                <para>The honorable senator reminded me that in  1957,  and since, I have referred to the cost of the introduction of pure jets. I am glad he raised the point, and I took a note of a comment he made when he was speaking. He commented on the probable ability of the commission to provide sufficient funds from its own reserves to purchase these jets in  1964.  The point he made was interesting because in  1957  T.A.A. did not have sufficient funds to provide for Caravelles. Now, however, the commission may be able to find the funds from its own reserves to meet this cost in  1964,  only because, by that time, its depreciation reservations will have been built up to a level to provide sufficient reserves. That was certainly not the case in  1957.  At that time it would have meant an excess subvention to purchase the Caravelles, and at the same time a pretty significant writeoff in the values of the existing aircraft. </para>

So, I will just let that matter go. 1 thought that for the sake of simplicity and in order to get through this legislation we would take the clauses in the agreement one after the other, but the Minister does not seem to want to do that. The agreement provides for each airline to have only two jets. This agreement is for ten years. How do the operators get on after that time? Is there any way that the Government can re-impose the stranglehold that it has got used to over the years? I am not saying that the Government will do that, but I would just like to make certain that it will not. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to raise another matter. What is the purpose of laying down in clause 8 of the agreement that the air navigation charges payable by each airline will not be increased by more than 10 per cent, each year? With great respect, the Government does not know how much the Tullamarine airport will cost. It is true that in the initial stages the jets may be able to land at the present Melbourne aerodrome. That is a matter for the experts and not for me. But still, the Government has no idea how much the Tullamarine airport will cost. It seems to me that 10 per cent, is a small percentage for increases in air navigation charges. Is that provision in the agreement because the agreement will operate until 1977 and therefore it will bind future governments as to what they can do? It seems rather remarkable to me that this Government should attempt to bind a future government on financial matters. This involves the finance of the nation. Is that provision in the agreement so that the Government will ensure that both airlines will continue to fly? </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Over the years the States have complained about the tremendous amount of interest they have to pay on their railway debts. If the Government keeps on putting money into aerodromes and the airline industry year after year, as it has been doing, the time will come in the not-far-distant future when the amount owed by the airline industry to the Commonwealth is nearly as much as that owed by the State railways. I believe that both Trans-Australia Airlines and the private airline are entitled to be run as businesses. The people will probably want this great facility of air travel even if fares have to be increased so that the airlines can repay the Commonwealth for the work it has done and so that the government airline can earn a profit. According to the second amending bill - I hope that I am not out of order in alluding to it - the Government estimates that the rate should be 10 per cent. net, which could be about 16 per cent. gross. It seems to me that both airlines are being pampered very greatly. I know the Government's concern for both airlines; I am not implying that it is not concerned for them. But it seems that the Government is making the taxpayers who do not use the airlines pay for a service that is used only by a section. The Minister must have some estimate of the cost of Tullamarine airport. I have referred to only one capital city. What about the others? </para>
                <para>I have not great hopes that the Government will increase the amount that each airline pays for ground services. I am concerned that these amounts may be increased by not more than 10 per cent. each year. Is it the Government's intention to increase them each year by 10 per cent.? There is nothing in the schedule to indicate that this will be done. The provision is for an increase of not more than 10 per cent., not of the cost but of what the airlines are paying now. Neither is paying much. The people as a whole are subsidizing this industry greatly. I suppose that this is not the only country to subsidize such services, but I should like to know what the Government proposes to do. If there is to be no increase between 1961 and 1964, will the Minister cast his mind a little further afield? Is it the Government's intention to apply a 10 per cent increase when jet aircraft are introduced? </para>

                    - I do think so. 1 think , that in the modern world the proposition that roads are more a defence measure than airports is not one that can be sustained. Quick movement of troops by aircraft is an essential of defence. I think it is fair to say also that in respect of development airports can more fairly be charged -with a larger proportion of cost than can roads.

                        <para>-  I am putting it as .a great .difference -in degree. I am making a case for the proposition that civil .aviation charges have within themselves costs which can definitely be attributed to both development and defence. If we have regard to that factor we must try to assess what should be recovered and over what period it should be recovered. We could move in on the airline industry to recover next year, let us say, an .attributable cost of 50 per cent, of the facilities provided. But in so doing we would probably get the result that the operators would have to increase fares to such an .extent that the number of times an airport was used would be greatly decreased and there would be no profit at all in the airline industry. Considering those factors and having regard to the -experience of the past - taking into account, as I mentioned in -my second-reading speech, the estimated growth in traffic - <inline font-style="italic">1&amp;</inline> 10 per cent, increase in the basic costs of an industry of this nature is assessed to be reasonable. Inevitably there will always be dispute as to the exact figure, both as to attributability and the extent of the increase that is permitted. After long consideration the Government believes that this assessment is the right one or as nearly right as it is possible to obtain. </para>

                    referred to factors .that should be considered. The level of air fares was the first factor. I have already explained that .by taking action to increase costs," and, as a consequence, fares, you will decrease the density ,of usage of the airport and of the airways facilities. Thus, with fewer unit charges, you will defeat your own purpose as well as creating an effect on the airlines. The rate of growth is another element that is very pertinent to the whole proposal. A reasonable return on capital, having regard - I say this quite unblushingly - to the delicate -financial state of the industry, and to its obvious vulnerability to changes in costs and economic conditions, is fairly a factor that should be considered.

                    <para>.- I ask the Minister: How can 'he reconcile the binding of future governments to this agreement? The agreement will be in force until 1977. The Government proposes to bind , future governments, irrespective of their political colour, not to increase the tax on aviation fuel except in accordance with increases in the tax on motor fuel. Does that not take certain rights away from future governments? The people of this country may want to change the government. What right has this Government to bind future governments? Is the Government taking this action because it fears that it may not have the numbers in the Senate .after 30th June next? Let us look at these matters from a practical, political point of view. It is palpably wrong for the Government to bind future governments until 1977 on matters relating to taxation. I would like to hear some of the constitutional lawyers on this point. Is the Government acting in contravention of the Constitution? I arn amazed that any government would do this. In acting in this way the Government is not playing the game with the people. </para>

Having regard to that factor, to the factors that I have mentioned earlier and to the fact that re-equipment calls for the investment in this industry of vast sums of money, the industry is entitled to know and must know what its basic costs will be for a long period ahead. It is entitled to know by bow much its costs will be increased. If it is any comfort to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to know that this clause will have the effect of preventing a government hostile to a private industry airline from attacking that airline by the air navigation charge, as was attempted in the past, or by the fuel tax, then I say that that is an additional, but not the basic, reason behind this clause. </para>

Can the Minister tell me why the matter of air routes has been taken out of the hands of the Co-ordinator of Civil Aviation? Under the 1952 and 1957 agreements the coordinator had power to deal with routes as well as other matters. I cannot see in this clause any reference to routes.

                <para>I refer now to clause 13 of the agreement, which deals with the functions of the arbitrator. That person is to be appointed by agreement between the parties or, in the absence of an agreement, is to be a justice of a federal court other than the High Court. I ask this question, with great respect to the judiciary: Is it the intention of the Government to have the same judge act continuously as arbitrator so that he will gain an insight into the airline industry? </para>

That is a much better provision than was contained in the old agreement. Will the Government instruct the company that it must keep a special set of accounts for its airline? I remind the Minister that the Government is dealing with Ansett Transport Industries Limited which, as has been stated, has quite a lot of ramifications. Some of its activities may be incidental to the airlines industry, but they are not actually part of it. It is the intention of the Government to have access to the company's accounts only as they affect the airline industry? </para>

                    (Tasmania - Leader of the Opposition [4.29].  -  Did I understand the Minister to say that one of the reasons for providing that air route charges would not be increased beyond a certain percentage and that excise duty on aviation fuel would not be increased beyond a certain quantum for a period of sixteen years was to prevent a government other than one of a complexion similar to that of this Government from altering this Government's broad policy? I presume the same reason would apply to clause 20 of the agreement, which extends the 1952 agreement for an additional ten years beyond 1967. If I understood the Minister correctly in the first place, is not that the main, indeed the only, reason why the Government has extended the term of operation of the agreement? I can understand some extensions of the agreement until the proposed jet reequipment programme is complete. Is there any other reason for extending the agreement apart from the Minister's desire to tie the hands of a future government of a complexion different from that of this Government? That is the main question that I direct to the Minister.

                        <para>. - Earlier I gave a very real and very substantial reason for the provision relating to fuel tax and air navigation charges. I indicated that an investment running to many millions of pounds will be involved, that the re-equipment programme to commence in 1964 will run for a period of ten years, and that payment will extend over a period of fifteen years. So the provision relating to fuel tax and air navigation charges really becomes conterminous with the completion of the re-equipment programme. </para>

                <para>Paragraph (b) of clause 19 of the agreement relates to the purchase of aircraft from a Commonwealth authority. When the 1952 agreement was framed, what was in mind was the disposal of the aircraft then held by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines.  They  were DC6's. Having regard to modern circumstances and the all-up weights of the newer aircraft, such as the Electras, the Viscounts, and so on, which exceed 50,000 lb., a weight limit of 50,000 lb. is considered adequate to cover aircraft which might be available in the future for disposal from a Commonwealth authority. </para>

                    <para>.- This is the most remarkable clause in the bill. The Minister stated in his second-reading speech - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In contrast, in order to meet reasonable private enterprise standards, Ansett Transport Industries Limited must have a target of the order of 10 per cent, after tax and a reasonable allocation to reserves. </para>
                <para class="block">The Minister did not use the words " should have "; he said " must have ". That means that Ansett Transport Industries Limited, in order to be satisfied with the return from its airline business, must receive 10 per cent, on its capital after payment of tax and allowing a reasonable amount to be set aside for reserves. During the second-reading debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> paid particular attention to this clause. He wanted to know  the meaning of the word " reasonable " in the passage to which I have referred. As the present rate of company tax is, I think, 8s. in the £1. Ansett Transport Industries Limited, in order to make a net profit of 10 per cent, would have to make a gross profit of 16 per cent, or 17 per cent. Much depends, of course, upon that very pleasant word "reasonable". The level of 10 per cent is not mentioned in the bill, but the Minister mentioned it in his second-reading speech. We can assume that he expects T.A.A. to make the same profit as Ansett Transport Industries Limited - that is, 10 per cent. I believe that at present T.A.A. is making  a profit of  3  per cent. or  5  per cent. Perhaps the Minister will help me there. </para>

                        <para>-  I thought it was  5  per cent., but in the second-reading debate I was contradicted when I mentioned that figure. Incidentally, does T.A.A. make a profit of  5  per cent. after payment of tax and after reasonable allocations to reserves? In his second-reading speech the Minister said that Ansett Transport Industries Limited must have a target of the order of  10  per cent.

The sub-section refers to the concurrence of the Treasurer, but the concurrence of the commission is not required. The words used are " after consultation with the Commission ". I have had some experience in recent weeks about consulting with people. Consultation means nothing. When the Minister has the concurrence of the Treasurer, he will be able to go ahead and do what he wants to do.

Would not that be a little hard on the commission? If I went into business five or six years ago, when the rate of interest was, say, 4 per cent., and borrowed money then, and if somebody went into business a few weeks ago and borrowed money at 7 per cent., would I be penalized by being required to pay extra tax because I had borrowed my money some years ago at the lower rate of interest?

                        <para>- Farmers do not  always borrow money in order  to  see  them  through one- season. If a farmer obtained a long-term loan some years ago, he' would; now be in a much better position than one who negotiated- a loan recently, although T admit that it would be very difficult to do so. It seems to me to be remarkable that T.A.A. is to be penalized and made to- pay extra tax because three or four years ago it borrowed money at a lower rate of interest than that at which its competitor is able to borrow to-day. What does the Minister regard as the current rate of interest? Is it the 9 per cent, which Ansett Transport Industries Limited is advertising in the- press that it is willing to offer on money lent to it? Or does the Minister regard the- current rate of interest as the normal bank interest rate? </para>

Any one who starts in business to-day can look forward to the time when, because of a case put up by the present Minister for Civil' Aviation, he will have to pay more tax than a competitor who started in business at a later date, because he borrowed money before his competitor did and at a lower rate of interest. </para>

The position now is, in effect, that T.A.A. may be able to obtain money at 8 per cent, and Ansett Transport Industries Limited may be able to obtain it at 9 per cent, on the outside market. They will not be able to obtain the money from banks at the moment, although, of course, they may be lucky. At the present time Ansett Transport Industries is advertising in the Melbourne press offering 9 per cent, for money invested for five to seven years, and a lower percentage for a shorter period. I shall leave the matter at that, although I assure the Minister that he will not get away with this one, because I think, with great respect, it is the greatest piece of bushranging that has taken place since the famous Kelly was shot. </para>
                <para>Paragraph (b), sub-paragraph (ii), of the proposed new section states that the Minister and the Treasurer shall take into account -  the fact that moneys representing provision made by the Commission for staff superannuation are available for use in the business of the Commission; </para>
                <para class="block">I suppose that T.A.A., following the usual practice of government instrumentalities, accepts the risk of its own superannuation scheme. All superannuation funds either invest their money or, as is done in this instance, use it in the business with which they are associated. Trans-Australia Airlines could do the same as its competitor may or may not  do,  namely,  go  to one  of  the insurance companies and obtain a cover. A number of firms do this. I think  the  Australian Mutual Provident Society has a group superannuation insurance scheme. However, T.A.A., following the usual practice of government departments, accepts the risks in connexion with its own superannuation scheme. Why should it be penalized for doing so. If it so desired T.A.A. could pay the amount into a society or insurance company such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society. I do not know whether there is any provision in the Public Service Act to compel T.A.A. to have its own superannuation fund. This matter is  of  the greatest importance. I understand that  the  amount in the fund could be as much as £3,000,000. </para>

                    <para>.- 1  thank the Minister for his courtesy. All that I have been saying is related to the fact that the Government is proud of the success of T.A.A. over the years. The Opposition's contention is that if T.A.A. had not been shackled its success would have been much greater, and the people  of  Australia would not have had to pay as much in air fares. This practice in relation to superannuation funds is one of the many ways in which the Government has hamstrung T.A.A. </para>

                <para class="block">I suppose the sub-paragraph means that the Minister and the Treasurer will take that matter into account in assessing the 10 per cent, profit that the Government wants from the commission. I assume that the sub-clause means that in assessing, the 10 per cent, profit for the government airline only the money that Ansett Transport Industries Limited has invested in its airline operations will be taken into account, and that the Minister and the Treasurer will not go into the other ramifications of that company. </para>
                <para>The Minister and the Treasurer will also take into account the operation of developmental services and essential rural services. 1 think I can see the hand of some one in that provision. I suppose that the service from Melbourne to Corowa could be called a rural service. That term could really apply to all services to places away from the main capital cities. Of course, that will not hurt Trans-Australia Airlines so much because the Government will not allow it to provide intra-state services in New South Wales and some of the other States. That fact must be taken into account, too. </para>
                <para>In order to carry out the intention of this clause, the Government will have to say to T.A.A., " You will have to raise your profit percentage from 5 to 10 per cent.". The Minister, in his reply to the second-reading debate said that I said that T.A A. was run very efficiently. I think I said, in effect, that if it was not run efficiently the Minister had to carry the responsibility for that, however fair or unfair that might be. This provision means that the Government will absorb almost the whole of the commission's present profit because the tax will be doubled. If the tax is 5 per cent, on £5,000,000 and my arithmetic is correct, the commission will pay £250,000 in tax. If all or portion of the provision for superannuation is to be taken into account, it must be remembered that the superannuation fund has certain liabilities each year in respect of people who have retired. The clause contains some nice words, such as the word " reasonable ". I remember a song about sweet reasonableness, but it did not pet the one who practised it far. T do not like the use of the word " reasonable " in this bill. </para>
                <para>The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said that Ansett-A.N.A. must return 10 per cent, after the payment of tax and after a reasonable amount was allocated to reserves. He also said that his desire is to put the two operators on the same footing. That can result in only one thing - an increase in fares. Otherwise, he must admit that the government airline is being run inefficiently. This is just one of a long list of conditions that have been referred to more than once to show that the Government's great desire is to make things harder for T.A.A. and to help the private airline. T.A.A. would have made much greater profits if the Government had acted on our advice. I think this is a remarkable clause to incorporate in a bill. Why should the Government worry? Is it so concerned about what profit the private airline should make? The Government has helped it. The Government has a great desire to see that two airlines function in Australia. It is giving the private operator everything that it thinks should be given to that airline in order to keep it in the air. Surely to goodness, that can point to only one thing; namely, that Ansett-A.N.A. wants to be assured of the 10 per cent, profit which the Government says it must have. The operative word is " must ", plus, plus. The Government intends to tell T.A.A. that it must do certain things. </para>
                <para>In the debate on the previous bill - if I may allude to it for a moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman</inline> - the Minister said that in all probability T.A.A. would have sufficient capital to meet its own jet purchases in 1964. What is the Government doing? Does it desire to take away some of that capital so that T.A.A. will have to borrow money? As I said, I believe this is a frightful clause, and its insertion in the bill is just one of a long list of things the Government has done to hamstring and hurt T.A.A. It has done nothing else but that. If the Minister thinks that airline is inefficient, I say to him with the greatest respect that his job is to see that his officers make it efficient. I do not think that it is inefficient. Therefore, the extra tax will have to be taken out of what is left over - I think the Minister said last year that the amount was £250,000 or £350,000  -  or fares will have to be increased. I ask the Minister to tell us what he believes the airline ought to do. </para>

                <para class="block">I ask the Minister whether that is concerned solely with the activities of companies engaged on the trunk routes. As the clause is expressed, it relates to all activities by privately owned air transport undertakings in Australia whether operating on trunk routes or not. If the consideration goes outside the Ansett-A.N.A. group, as defined in the definition of " the Company " in the agreement, under this legislation what right has the Minister to have access to the records of all the privately owned air transport undertakings? If the provision contemplates public companies, which publish balance sheets and profit-and-loss accounts, that would not be sufficient guide for him at all. There would be no opportunity for the Minister to know whether any concealed reserves had been created in one way or another out of profits. What is the scope of the activities of the privately-owned air transport undertakings contemplated in the clause? In the event of the Minister's not relying upon the profits that have been made by those bodies, and deciding to rely upon what they are expected to make, what would be the measure for determining their expectations? </para>
                <para>Does the Minister take any power under this legislation to ensure that he gets adequate information from the privately owned air transport undertakings? I point out to the Minister that he is required to take into account the profits, in relation to capital employed, that have been, and are expected to be, made by privately owned air transport undertakings in Australia. The term is quite wide enough to apply to every such privately owned undertaking. .Does the Minister think that it is completely relevant to look at the earnings of companies that are concerned with intrastate operations alone? Are they to be taken into account in conjunction with the earnings of interstate operators? What access will the Minister have to accounts? I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> asked for a definition of commercial rates. I merely put it to the Minister that " commercial " might have a different interpretation according to whether one talks of banks, finance companies, or companies which borrow on unsecured notes or on secured notes. There is need for a clear definition of " commercial ". </para>

Commercial rates would range from 7 per cent., the highest bank rate, to nearly double that amount, which is paid to attract money to industrial undertakings. The Minister may take his pick. The rate may range from 7 per cent, to 15 per cent. All of those rates would be commercial, whether in relation to banks, finance companies, pastoral companies, or other undertakings. There needs to be some clear definition. Otherwise, the scope of the Minister to determine what is a commercial rate is altogether too wide. </para>

                <para>I should like the Minister to indicate which of the five items appearing in proposed section 32 (2.) (b) might clearly be expected to favour T.A.A. on the adjustment, and which might be to its disadvantage. I put it to him that the first might be expected to be entirely against T.A.A. It means that the Minister has to take into account matters tending to create disparity of costs between the commission and the private undertakings, including Joans made by the Commonwealth to the commission at rates less than current com mercial rates. As I understand it, if the Commonwealth lends money to the commission at a lower rate than that at which private companies can borrow on the open market, the commission will be required to earn the difference between the two interest rates, in addition to paying tax, making appropriate provision for reserves and earning L0 per cent., assuming that to be the determination. So there would be four elements that would have to be covered in the total profit earned. That provision would be adverse to T.A.A. </para>
                <para>So also would be the next one, and 1 shall refer to it. The Minister is to take into account all matters tending to create disparity between the commission and privately owned air transport undertakings, including - </para>

So there are two provisions that obviously would operate to the detriment of T.A.A., forcing it to make more and more profits, </para>
                <para>I should like the Minister to give an indication of how the next three provisions will operate because in none of them is laid down the principle to be followed by the Minister in making a determination of the percentage of profit.

                <para class="block">That may operate in favour of T.A.A., which I understand has no other activities than the provision of air transport facilities, whereas Ansett Transport Industries Limited is concerned with other activities in transport, apart from air transport. Would the Minister explain whether it is intended to divorce the non-air activities of Ansett Transport Industries Limited from its air activities. Will they be disregarded in establishing par? Who. will make that assessment? Will it be the officers of the Minister's department? Is there any provision whereby the Auditor-General might  survey that field? The fourth, provision to be taken into account in these matters is - the operation of developmental services and essential rural-, services.. </para>

                <para>If T.A.A. operates a route without competition, what factor is to be taken into account - mileage flown, passengers carried, gross revenue earned, or net profit? There is merely a general' intimation to the Minister to have regard' to the extent of the non-competitive air transport operations of T.A.A. and Ansett-A.N.A. No principle as to- the application of those factors is laid down in the bill. When the Minister is in a position to reply, I' should like him to indicate how those five factors will operate and what principle he will apply. Let me say in general, on. this clause that I. agree entirely with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> has already submitted to the committee. It is obvious that if the Minister had to make a determination to-day he. would arrive at a figure of 10 per cent., after allowing for taxation and reserves of an. unspecified amount.. While on the matter of reserves I would like to ask the Minister what he considers a* reasonable amount for T.A.A., on its. present; statement of accounts, to put away each year, ft is clear from the nature of events that T.A.A. must put away, over the life of an aircraft, the amount of depreciation involved. There can be no argument about that. Normal business practice is to- put" a certain sum away each year if profits permit. </para>

                    <para>-. - I feel that I must, briefly at least, rise to protest at the provision in the bill relating to loans made by the Commonwealth to the commission, at interest rates less- than current commercial rates. This matter goes beyond party- politics. The stage has now been reached where this chamber must consider whether it will bring to bear the. degree of responsibility that it should accept with regard to the wording of bills of this character. Let me ask the Minister what I consider to be a perfectly valid question-. If he were seeking a loan and some person in the money market told him that he could have £5,000 at- current interest rates, would the Minister entertain for one moment acceptance of the loan on those terms without' knowing what, was meant by current interest rates, or even what the person offering the loan considered were current commercial interest rates? I suggest that, this provision outrages every principle associated with the proper drafting of bills. No matter what answer the Minister may have to my question, he cannot dispel or destroy the objections that have been taken to this measure by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> and his <inline font-weight="bold">deputy,. Senator Kennelly.</inline> This is not a matt en in which we; on. this: side of the chamber alone- should take an interest. Honorable senators, opposite should ask themselves whether, in view of the illustrations given by me and by my leader and  deputy  leader, we should pass a bill that sets out interest rates in such a loose way as to be impossible to define. I suggested, by way of interjection, that if the Minister is not prepared to alter the clause to provide in a more direct and understandable way the interest terms that will be applied to loans, he leaves himself open to the charge that the bill has been left deliberately vague for some purpose that may perhaps be questionable. Unless the Minister can give a very much better reason for retaining that wording in the bill than has been suggested up to date, the Government will have to accept the fact that we view these proceedings with the gravest suspicion and feel that there is something sinister in the very vagueness of the proposal. </para>

In view of what I said this afternoon about the Government's attachment to a two-airline policy, I would have thought that I had made it completely clear that nothing we propose to do under any legislation will have the effect of damaging Trans-Australia Airlines or detracting from its viable and efficient operation as an airline service. </para>

                    implied that what I said in my second-reading speech could mean only that the Minister for Civil Aviation would insist that T.A.A. pay a dividend of 10 per cent. That is not a fair representation or interpretation - it is not even a reasonable interpretation - of what I said. I said that an organization such as Ansett Transport Industries Limited must, in present circumstances and in to-day's economic climate, after making a reasonable allocation for reserves, pay a dividend of the order of 10 per cent.

                        <para>- After taxation. Proceeding from that point, it cannot be assumed by any manner of means that a 10 per cent, dividend would be required or expected from the commission. Indeed, the legislation goes to some pains to indicate that in determining what dividend shall be paid certain factors shall be taken into account vis-a-vis Ansett Transport Industries Limited as a group, and having regard to the particular circumstances that apply to the airline industry and to the commission in particular. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> who claimed that the use of the word " reasonable " was capable of a most sinister interpretation. </para>

                <para class="block">That legislation was introduced by me when I was Minister for Shipping and Transport. It was administered by me for a couple of years. I have never heard any suggestion of complaint from the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission during the time I was responsible for administering the act, or since, to the effect that that provision was used in any way that could be regarded as other than reasonable and in accordance with commercial practice. In the legislation now under discussion, because of the particular circumstances applying to this industry and to this single entity, we go rather further and state what particular factors should be taken into account in assessing what might be a reasonably commercial dividend. 1 indicate to the Senate that they are only factors. There is no specific arithmetical number or value that can be applied to any one of those factors or to all of them in toto. They are factors to be taken into consideration. When being taken into consideration they will be assessed, separately and together, reasonably - certainly not in a manner which would impose upon T.A.A. some financial burden it could not bear or which would have the  effect  or reducing the  efficiency of  the airline as a commercial entity. Indeed, this is no more than a provision which has the effect of saying to Trans-Australia Airlines, " You are a commercial entity operating in competition with a private enterprise group, lt is required of you that the dividend you return shall be commercially reasonable in every respect - not excessive, but only reasonable." 1 go further and point out to the Senate that a Minister making this determination exposes himself and his determination <inline font-style="italic">te</inline> the world. Having made the determination and having advised the Australian National Airlines Commission that its dividend in the ensuing year shall be at a certain rate, he may be questioned about it in this place. Moreover, it will be referred to in the commission's report, which will be submitted to the Parliament under the terms of the Air Navigation Act. In those circumstances, surely any attempt by any Minister to do anything that was in any way unreasonable would be subjected to a most searching examination and, if necessary, most scathing criticism! </para>

                        <para>- I answer that question by saying that an examination will be made over a wide field and that the accounts of both trunk operators and feeder operators will be considered in making the assessment. They will be weighed. I should say now - I speak offhand - that greater weight would be given to the accounts of the trunk operators than to those of the feeder operators. There has been a lot of discussion about the commercial rate. I feel that the real point has been lost sight of. </para>

                        <para>- If you read the " Hansard " report, I think you will find that I said it could be the bank rate.  1  think the honorable senator has lost sight of this point, which is very pertinent: The commercial rate to which reference is made in the bill is obviously the commercial rate that is applicable to a particular transaction. It cannot be said that the commercial rate might vary from  5  per cent, to  15  per cent. The commercial rate we are discussing is the rate applicable to the type of transaction now under consideration. Surely that is obvious. </para>

                        <para>-  Judged by any standard, the rate that is paid by Ansett on his unsecured or unregistered notes, or whatever he calls them, is not a commercial .rate. That is a rate which is offered for a long, unsecured loan. A commercial rate is a rate properly made against approved security. In Ansett's case, that rate is not 9 per cent. If I am looking for a commercial rate in Ansett's case, I look at "the rate of interest he is paying to the Commonwealth Bank, which is 51 per cent., to the rate of <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent, he is paying to the Australian Mutual Provident "Society, or to the rate of <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> per cent, he <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> paying to the Bank of America in the case of an Electra loan. They are commercial rates. It cannot be held that a rate .of interest paid on an unsecured or unregistered deposit is in any sense of the .term a commercial rate. I repeat: The commercial .rate in this case is the rate applicable to the type of transaction under consideration. That, of course, will vary from time to time and according to differing -circumstances. </para>

                <para>It has been suggested that this necessarily will lead to an increase of fares. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> that that will not necessarily be so. There are various factors ;in this industry which I believe can have the effect of increasing revenue. One of those factors - I have referred to it ion a number of occasions to-day - is the growth of traffic. That growth will enable us to increase the load factor, which is now fixed at 68 per cent. An increase in the load factor of something like 1 per .cent, would increase the dividend rate by substantial proportions. Those are the .kinds of things towards which we are looking :and towards which, as ordinary commercial people, we would be expected by this Parliament to look in order to meet the requirements of this provision.

                <para>On the subject of reserves, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> realized fully when he posed that question to me that it is one which it is almost impossible to answer in definitive terms now, having regard to the fact that T.A.A. is a government organization and therefore is in a different category in many respects from commercial organizations. For example, I refer to the division of the act which relates to the finances of the Australian National Airlines Commission and particularly to its capital. The act states that the capital of the commission shall consist of the amounts advanced by the Treasurer before the commencement of the relevant section, and so on. In view of the fact that that capital is so closely and restrict'ively confined, consideration of reserves and of provision for reserves is something which, I am sure the honorable senator must agree, cannot be embarked upon in a debate other than at a time when a review of the finances of the commission is being made. I tell him frankly that J would not hazard a guess as to what would be a fair percentage, or a fair amount, to .allocate to reserves, short of a close analysis of -the finances of the commission at an appropriate or relevant date. </para>

                <para class="block">The prescribed account under the proposed section is one to which all amounts that represent insurance premiums which otherwise would be payable to insurance companies are to be credited. There are various provisions as to what shall be credited and debited to the account. I point out that the Government in November last addressed itself to insurance companies and superannuation funds and intimated that it would compel them to deposit 30 per cent, of their annually available funds in government securities. The Government abandoned that element &gt;of compulsion a few months later and settled far .a system of incentives, and the reverse, to induce such companies and funds to invest a minimum of 30 per cent, of their funds in governmental or semi governmental securities. </para>
                <para>In this case, Trans-Australia Airlines is putting aside into this account about £338,000 per annum. It had a credit in June, I960, of approximately £500,000. It made no profit from that business. It made a loss on its self-insurance in that year, but the last figures that are available show a credit of approximately £500,000. In view of the fact that over a period T..A.A. will be compelled to put the whole of that money into Commonwealth securities, I ask the Minister whether the Government has considered giving the organization the benefit of the taxation concessions that are available to insurance companies under the legislation which was passed earlier this year. I recognize that those concessions favoured insurance companies. The Minister may remember that the .companies were required to carve up 'their accounts so as to show the various elements in their business, such as superannuation, general insurance business and the rest. Although T.A.A. cannot be .said to be engaged in the insurance business, it is carrying its own insurance. It has a completely separate insurance fund, and I submit that its position in that respect is analogous to the position of an insurance company. Having regard to the element of compulsion in respect of investments by T.A.A., which does not apply to any other concern in Australia, has the Government considered giving the airline a taxation remission, on the lines of that .granted earlier this year to insurance companies, in respect of income arising from the investment of that insurance fund? It would be about £2,500 a year. I suggest that .that should be done, in view of the element of compulsion. If the Government has not considered this matter, will it do so with a view to enabling T.A.A. to get the benefit of a concession that is extended generally to insurance companies and superannuation funds? </para>

                    <para>. - This question' was 'examined very closely by the Government when the legislation was being considered The .honorable senator has referred to the tax commitment of Trans-Australia Airlines. I think he will understand that a characteristic of airline operations in Australia to-day is that, because of the depreciation reservation which must be made, no airline company - neither T.A.A. nor Ansett-A.NA. - is liable to pay income tax. It might be seven, eight, nine or ten years before T.A.A. pays income tax. Therefore, the suggestion that a taxation concession be granted in respect of investment income is not relevant at this stage. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I think the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> put the position very clearly when he said that internal accounting such as this in T.A.A. or in any similar company could not be compared with the insurance operations of an insurance company as a whole. The types of business are completely different. An insurance company collects premiums and invests the whole of the proceeds for the purposes of paying bonuses and the like. What T.A.A. does is designed to provide cash to cover a catastrophe or any similar circumstance. It is not insurance in the widest sense of the word. If a loss were incurred because of the need to pay out as the result of an accident, T.A.A. would reap a commensurate taxation benefit, but beyond that no provision is made. </para>

                    <para>. - I thank the Minister for that explanation. I am amazed to hear that T.A.A. is not subject to income tax payments and that it is not expected that such payments will be made in the foreseeable future. The balance sheet for 1959-60 - the latest one available - shows a reserve for income tax of £172,238. I cannot believe that that reserve would have been made if there were no expectation of income tax having to be paid. Perhaps the dividend of 5 per cent, paid to the Government is regarded as interest on capital? Is that the explanation? </para>

On the face of it, if a net profit running into some hundreds of thousands of pounds is made and is passed over to the Government in the form of a dividend, there is a taxation element in that.

                        <para>-  I am sorry. Tax on capital profits has been paid in the past from year to year. The reserve for income tax shown in the accounts for 1959-60, amounting to about £178,000, is only a prudent and not over-large provision, having regard to the fact that within seven or eight years the commission may well have to make very large income tax payments. At present it enjoys a taxation remission because of the large depreciation reservations that are permitted. When they cut out, the commission will walk straight into trouble with taxation. </para>

I take it that this item covers not only the rehabilitation of people suffering from some physical defects, but also the provision of surgical appliances which I believe the Department of Social Services does provide, under certain conditions, for people undergoing a process of rehabilitation. 1 wish to direct attention to what I consider to be a serious deficiency in the rehabilitation service, not so much as it applies to a person who is entitled to some form of rehabilitation assistance under the existing Social Services Act, but as it applies to people who have gone through the process of rehabilitation, but who still suffer from the after effects of their disability, even after they have been placed in industry and have achieved an earning capacity. </para></talk.start><para>I have in mind a person I know in South Australia. His case is not an isolated one. He is working in a normal occupation on a salary that is by no means a high one. From time to time, because of  a  severe physical disability, he has to buy what are known as calipers to assist him in walking. This person is suffering the permanent after effects of poliomyelitis. I understand that the Department of Social Services has its own surgical appliances and surgical limb section and that to a limited extent it does assist people who go through the process of rehabilitation. The point I desire to make is that the Government, through its social services legislation, should  make  some effort to help people suffering from severe physical disabilities. It should make some provision to remove from them  the  financial burden associated with the replacement of artificial aids and surgical appliances. </para><para>Some of these appliances cost up to £50 or £60, and for a person receiving the basic wage, or perhaps a little above the basic wage, that constitutes a very serious financial liability. In many cases it overshadows the home of the person concerned and causes suffering to his wife and children. If left to himself he has no means of remedying this situation. People in circumstances such as this have come to me and asked whether there is any government agency which can assist them. I have had to tell them that unfortunately no provision exists in the Social Services Act nor in any other act in the field of social welfare, which will remove from them the financial burden of finding the money required for the replacement of artificial aids for walking or surgical appliances such as calipers, surgical boots and other things which cost so much. </para><para>These matters are not covered by insurance because no insurance company has any provision for the payment of a reasonable premium to assist people in this  category.  The result is that they are left friendless and without an opportunity to obtain financial assistance to help them replace an artificial aid or surgical appliance which is necessary if they are to continue in some useful occupation. I do not think that would cost the Government much - perhaps a few thousand pounds each year - if some agency already exists in the artificial limb or surgical appliance field- If there is no such workshop' or field' of endeavour, it would not cost the Government much ra all to do something along that line to remove the great financial burden* that is associated with cases of the character 1 have mentioned. </para><para>Because these people are not many in number and their voices are not heard so much in complaint, despite the disabilities they suffer, sometimes we Rave a tendency to forget about them; but when they bring their troubles to us, it brings home to ms very forcibly the disabilities under which some people labour and how little it would cost the Government to do something in this field'. I hope that the Minister in charge of these estimates will convey this request to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline> and give it appropriate sympathetic consideration. </para><para>A member of Parliament is placed in a very difficult position when people in these unfortunate circumstances come to him and he has to tell them that the onus; is on them completely because no provision is made to solve their problems. Quite frankly; for financial! reasons they just cannot? solve their own' problems; If a breadwinner, who is suffering from the after effects of poliomyelitis, has- to purchase a surgical appliance, that very purchase means that his wife and family may have to go without- some of the most necessary things of life. I know that the Government does many things in the field of social services and that the scope of social1 services' has been extended over the years. I am aware that a large proportion of the national' expenditure goes into social welfare. Despite that, I believe that we. should turn our thoughts to these matters whenever we can; and especially at a time such as this when- we are discussing the estimates of the various departments. That is the time for us to pin-point these needs in the hope that,, although the Government, will not or cannot do anything immediately, at least it will keep in mind' the plight of a group of unfortunate people in out midst,, who are. not many in number, but. are. suffering from tremendous disabilities. </para><para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland) [8.32].  -  I should like to ask three questions First, I refer to Division No; 360  -  Central; Administration - subdivision 2  -  Administrative Expenses - item 03, " Publicity - Pamphlets and films, £4,000 ".

I have said previously in this chamber that, although the Department of Social Services publishes from time to time some very fine booklets and pamphlets which are beautifully illustrated, the conditions of entitlement to pensions are not publicized widely enough. I think I can say without fear of contradiction that not 10 per cent, of the people who are entitled to the special pension which is payable to an age pensioner who has no income other than the pension and who lost a son in either World War I. or World War II., are aware of their entitlement. Indeed, the number of people who are entitled to that special pension and are not aware of it is absolutely amazing. I suppose the department might say that if these benefits are available, the people who are entitled to them ought to know about them; but this is not an easy matter for an aged person. Many aged people even fear making a simple application for the age pension and cannot follow the intricacies of the Social Services Act. Whilst I give the department full marks for some of the beautifully illustrated booklets that it has produced from time to time, I suggest that the appropriation for publicity shows that the wording of the act in respect of entitlement must be too obscure and difficult for the ordinary pensioner to understand. I have found out just how little is known about the entitlement to 'the special benefits provided under the Social Services Act. My experience has taught me that it is impossible to estimate the amount of money that is lost by people each year in the pensions field because of lack of knowledge of their entitlement. How many honorable senators have not had a member of the public come to them and say, " I do not think I am entitled to any sort of a pension because I have more than £1,000 in the bank"? I think every honorable senator has been in that position, not just on one occasion but on dozens of occasions, if they do their job as I think they all do. Regardless of how easy it is to escape responsibility by saying that people ought to know these things, and if they do not know them that is their own fault, the fact still remains that hundreds of thousands of pounds remains in the coffers of the Government each year because of the ignorance of people of their entitlement to pensions, in the field not only of social service payments but also of repatriation benefits. Any one taking a callous attitude might say, "Look how much money the Government saves ", but my understanding is that the legislation is designed to provide benefits for the people. Upon complying with certain conditions, an applicant may receive a part pension, a full pension, a supplementary payment, or a special pension, as in the case to which I have referred, namely a person of pensionable age who lost a son in World War I. or World War II. As  these entitlements exist, no avenue which would enable people to have sufficient knowledge to avail themselves, not of any charity, not of snide acceptance of something to which they are not entitled, but of the full benefits of the legislation, should be left unexplored. At present, there is insufficient publicity on entitlements under social services legislation. I do not think that it is possible for the Department of Social Services to circularize every person and provide information about qualification for pension benefits. I know that some members of another place have gone to the trouble of putting a letter into every home in their electorates, giving information as to entitlements, and the response received showed very clearly that the Government escapes the payment of many hundreds of thousands of pounds to people who are entitled to benefits. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is my opinion that the Commonwealth should provide information centres separate and apart from ordinary social services centres, to which people could go with queries about anything in the social service field. There they could be advised by somebody who was prepared to take a personal interest in their particular problems. In rebuttal of that suggestion, it might be said that already there is adequate provision at the various social service centres throughout Australia, but I know that senators on both sides of the chamber will agree that the average person seems to have some sort of fear of going to the social service centre to ascertain his entitlement:. There seems to be some sort of repression that leads him to believe that the people at those centres will not extend sympathetic consideration. That is not true, of course. </para><para>Whatever criticism I may level from time to time about the limitations of social services, I hold a very sincere belief that the acts of the Commonwealth are administered almost exclusively by very decent people who have much human understanding. But that does not dispel from the mind of the average pensioner the fear that when he goes to social services centres he will be grilled. This fear places some sort of restraint upon him. In many instances, aged persons become confused and do not know quite what to do. I am not talking in language that nobody in this Senate understands. I know that instances such as I am citing occur every day in the life of a senator or of any member of the Parliament. </para><para>I suggest that the department provide information centres, separate and apart from the places where it administers its usual business. These should be advertised as providing an exclusive service to advise people of pension entitlements. If this were done, it would go a long way towards bridging a gap that exists now, despite publicity issued from time to time by the Department of Social Services, and would assist those persons who, sometimes because of age, sometimes because of the lack of somebody with a bit of knowledge on their side, fail to obtain their entitlements and, as a consequence, are being unfairly treated. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>940</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KAW</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WEDGWOOD, Ivy</name><name role="display">Senator WEDGWOOD</name></talker><para>. - 1 refer to the proposed grant of £13,920 for the housekeeper service. I believe that this service would benefit greatly from increased expenditure by the Commonwealth Government. The amount provided has remained stationary for many years.

In my own State, Victoria, I understand, 111 municipalities are now participating in home help or housekeeper schemes. As I said a few nights ago, this is a field in which the expenditure of more money could give greater benefits to people who are in need and would at the same time save the Commonwealth a considerable amount of money in respect of expensive building programmes and social service benefits. </para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt in the mind of any person who has any knowledge of the housekeeper service as to its benefit, not only to the aged, but also to mothers who, whilst in hospital and on returning from hospital, have no other way of having their families looked after.

Although the scheme is basically for beneficiaries under the Social Services Act, it has been widened somewhat over the years by permitting other people to take advan- tage of the expert services available on payment of charges for the work that is done for them. Persons in receipt of the sickness benefit or an invalid pension who enter a rehabilitation centre are provided with these appliances free of charge during the period that they receive treatment. The appliances are, generally speaking, of a type that will last for many years. Those people who are beneficiaries under the Social Services Act receive their appliances free of charge, but those who pay for the rehabilitation service pay for their appliances. I think I am correct in saying that to a major degree the appliances are made at workshops of the Repatriation Department. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>941</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JUM</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DITTMER, Felix</name><name role="display">Senator Dittmer</name></talker><para>-  The department has its own organization in most States. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>941</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7A</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SPOONER, William</name><name role="display">Senator SPOONER</name></talker><para>- Some proportion of the appliances is made at the repatriation workshops.

When we are dealing with the Social Services Act it is pretty difficult to deal with these people who are not beneficiaries under the act. A good deal of thought would have to be given to the matter before extending social service benefits to somebody who was not eligible under the act. </para></talk.start></continue><para>On the subject of publicity, which was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey, Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson,</inline> the department goes a long way in its endeavours to meet the situation. It not only issues the information sheets with which I think everybody is familiar but it also takes pains to ensure that supplies of the sheets are available at all post offices, where people collect their social service payments or where they go to transact business. The brochures are made available also at all immigration centres and at all offices of the Department of Labour and National Service. Supplies are sent to trade unions and to the personnel offices of commercial and industrial firms. They are sent also to charitable organizations and to social workers. There is a fairly large scale distribution of publicity to ensure that everybody who is eligible for social service benefits will receive notice of those benefits. From my own experience I would say that the department's objective is to have a wide publicity of the benefits available. I doubt whether much more can be done effectively than is now being done. However, that does not mean that the door is closed to any suggestions. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>Annabelle Rankin made "Some comment about the appropriation this year being smaller than in previous years. It may be interesting to have a break-up of the appropriation. Reprinting of leaflets accounts for £1,300. The sum of £1,000 is set aside for the making of films. The sum of £1,700 - I think this is the explanation that the honorable senator requires - is a carry-over from last year for the cost of printing the booklet about social services about which some complimentary remarks were made. Only £1,700 is sought this year for the booklet. The major expenditure on the booklet was incurred last year. Because the major expenditure on the booklet was incurred under last year's Budget, this year's expenditure has fallen. </para><para>With regard to the housekeeper service, it must be remembered that it is in effect a supplementary service. The amount that the Commonwealth spends on the service is not as great as the amount that is spent by the States. The States are interested in this matter to a far greater extent than the Commonwealth. The amount provided by the Commonwealth is supplementary to the State provisions. The amount provided for New South Wales was £5,900; for Victoria, £4,100; for Queensland, £2,100; for Western Australia, £1,000; and for Tasmania, £500. The Commonwealth has not attempted to go into this service to any appreciable extent. It has been content to leave it as a State activity. </para><para>The final matter raised was in relation to the United Nations. The provision in this item is to meet contributions towards the fares of recipients of United Nations awards of social welfare scholarships. The 1961-62 provision is a contribution for the return fare of a fellow from the University of Queensland, who will return from the United States, and for the fare of a departmental officer going overseas.

The department's annual report sets out the grants to different types of eligible organizations that were approved up to 30th June, 1961. Approval has been given for 616 grants to organizations. Of that number, 343 are classed as grants to religious organizations. Grants totalling £5,700,000, to provide accommodation for 6,237 persons, were approved for those organizations. There have been 252 grants totalling £3,800,000 approved for charitable or benevolent institutions, to provide accommodation for 3,897 persons. A total of £228,000 was approved for four grants to ex-servicemen's organizations, to accommodate 221 persons.

I appreciate the reply that was given to me a little while ago by the Minister for National Development. When I spoke earlier I said that I was aware that the department did certain things. The Minister agreed with me and he displayed one or two brilliantly illustrated booklets issued by the department. But I believe that those booklets do not convey the information that people desire to have. Although a tremendous amount of information is available, the fact that pension entitlement has become very complicated since the introduction of the merged means test has been overlooked. People need to be supplied with more than a limited amount of information published in a booklet which leaves them to read between the lines in order to ascertain what they want to know. </para></talk.start><para>Let me illustrate my point. In the booklet which the Minister displayed to honorable senators a moment or two ago there is a reference to entitlement to the benefits of the pensioner medical service. The reference simply states that in certain circumstances pensioners are entitled to medical service but that it is subject to a means test. Such a statement does not convey much to the ordinary man in the street who does not know that, if he is a single pensioner or a widower, he cannot avail himself of the pensioner medical service if he earns more than £104 a year. In the case of a married couple, of course, the relevant figure is £208. It may be argued that if more detailed information were published in the booklet it would constitute an invitation to pensioners to limit their earnings. Some of the shrewd ones do that already. The only pensioners who are not able to adjust their earnings so they may become entitled to the benefits of the pensioner medical service are those who do not understand the provisions of the act. </para><para>I suggest that, although the department goes to the trouble of placing these booklets in post offices, benevolent institutions and other places, and although other information is made available in leaflet form, the need of these people is not met. In my opinion, the situation could be met adequately if at every social service centre in Australia an information service was provided. I suggest that the most effective way in which to advertise that information service would be to use the medium of television. People who had a pension problem could be told that they could receive sympathetic advice from the information centre. I believe that when people became aware of that service thousands of them would avail themselves of the opportunity to ascertain whether they were entitled to a particular benefit. </para><para>Let us assume that the provision of such a service cost another £50,000 a year. I do not think it would be too much to ask for. I do not think the Directors of Social Services in the States would be astonished at the result, because they know that the present media of publicity are not reaching the pensioners. But I believe the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline> would be astounded at the beneficial results which would flow from the establishment of such centres and would be more than pleased with the improved public relations. I feel quite strongly about this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman.</inline> I am not suggesting that the method I have advanced is the best one; possibly other means of publicity would be more practicable. But I believe that something along these lines is needed and that until some such service is provided people will continue to be treated unjustly because they are not getting something to which they are entitled under the legislation passed by this Parliament.  We  ought to do something more practical in this field and let people know where they stand. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>944</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6W</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role>Leader of the Australian Democratic Labour Party</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLE, George</name><name role="display">Senator COLE</name></talker><para>. -  Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> I also refer to the pensioner medical service.

I have spoken frequently on this subject, having seen something of the dire hardship that exists because of this limitation of income. I speak mostly of superannuated people in Tasmania. In many cases railways workers took out their eight units of superannuation which entitled them to  £208  per annum on retirement. One such person of whom I know thought that he would help himself and his wife, who is much younger, by taking out more units than that, with the result that his superannuation was  £214  per annum. The  £6  that he received above the permissible maximum amount of  £208  prevented him from entitlement to benefits under the pensioner medical service. I may say that that man suffered a very severe illness involving an operation which cost him about  £400. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The value of the superannuation units recently was increased, so that people who took out eight units, which entitled them to superannuation of  £20^  per annum in previous years, now find that those eight units are worth about  £220  per annum. Of course, they had no option but to take the superannuation units. I know that the Department of Social Services has treated such people well and is still giving them medical cards although the superannuation they receive exceeds the stipulated maximum of  £208.  Therefore, the law has been changed to a certain extent, the limit of in come being  £220  or  £222  in those cases. Incidentally, that amount of pension exceeds the pension of  £214  per annum received by a person whose case I have brought to the notice of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline> on previous occasions. It is time that the Government took action in this matter. As I have said, the maximum amount has in fact been increased, not by law but out of goodwill.

Expenditure under this head last year was about ?61,000 and the estimate for this year is ?25,000  -  a reduction of about ?36,000. The estimate allows for the cancellation of the service provided by the Royal Australian Air Force at Darwin, and for search flying by private aircraft, requisitioning of airline company aircraft for which payments will be effected by the department, search and rescue exercises, droppable equipment, &amp;c. The reduction has been made possible by virtue of the fact that within the last two years, rather than have the Air Force conduct this service, the Department of Civil Aviation has, within its own organization and by co-opting the civil airlines, managed to provide what is in fact an equally efficient service at a considerably lower cost to the taxpayers.

The proposed vote for this year is about ?12,000 greater than the expenditure last year. The proposed appropriation provides for additional payments of rates to local authorities resulting from an increase in leases of sites and buildings under the Airports (Business Concessions) Act. Collections from leases are a credit to this revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> asked also for information about Division No. 263  -  item 08, Aviation research. The proposed appropriation shown for that item is ?4,000, and for the next item - item 09  -  which relates to incidental and other expenditure, the proposed appropriation is ?70,000. Unfortunately, there has been a misprint. The sum of ?70,000 relates to aviation research and the sum of ?40,000 relates to incidental and other expenditure. The provision in respect of aviation research, which is ?70,000, is a new provision. It covers the following projects previously included under item 09, Incidental and other expenditure: Provision of civil aviation facilities at aeronautical research laboratories, on which ?59,000 will be spent; applied electronic research, which will cost ?3,000; aviation medicine, ?6,000; other projects such as airport investigation and research, ?1,000; and flight testing of aircraft to establish performance and handling characteristics, ?1,000. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>946</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>- This document has been reprinted and the figures to which the Minister referred have been placed in the proper places. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>946</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JQN</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COOKE, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator COOKE</name></talker><para>. -  I refer to Division No. 262, item 01, Aerodromes, and also to item 03, Search and Rescue Services.

Recently the Minister and I had a very pleasant trip through that area, and the Minister admitted that the facilities we"* insufficient, particularly the facilities for passengers. He said that, in view of the delays to services that occurred, there was room for a great improvement of the aerodromes in the area.

I know, and the Minister knows, that the late running of planes <inline font-style="italic">fa</inline> sometimes beyond the control of the air operators, but nevertheless great inconvenience is sometimes caused to people who are proposing to travel by air. These people do not live in places where they can get a taxi and drive to an aerodrome. They cannot always be contacted by telephone and told that the aircraft has been delayed. I think that some provision should be made whereby it is imperative and not left to the discretion of the officers concerned, to inform intending passengers of delays caused by the late running of planes. I know that one person who was severely ill had to wait for more than sixteen hours at an aerodrome where the facilities were very poor. He was waiting to be transported to Perth. I am not saying that the delay to the aircraft could have been avoided, but I contend that the passengers should have been warned of the altered schedule. </para><para>I ask the Minister to give the Senate a full report of what the department proposes to do to improve facilities for people who have to wait at these aerodromes. The provision of cocktail lounges in easy-living areas is very commendable, but better facilities than are now provided are needed in these northern areas. If an air service is not able to advise people of the late running of planes, a government agency should accept the responsibility to see that people are informed. That onus should be placed on government employees in those areas north of the 26th parallel in Western Australia. No doubt the Minister will have a good story to tell about this. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>947</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JQP</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COOPER, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator SIR WALTER COOPER</name></talker><para>. - I should like the Minister for Civil Aviation to give me some information about Division No. 263, item 05, dealing with subsidies to air services.

I thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to be there. I think the Department of Civil Aviation is to be commended upon the facilities provided at Broome, Derby and Wyndham, which are situated in the tropics in an area which may be called a high rainfall and a dry area. The reason for that description is that a very high rainfall occurs within a short period and for the rest of the year conditions are dry. </para></talk.start><para>Very frequently airports in this area are out of commission because they do not possess all-weather runways. On one occasion the Wyndham airport was out of commission, the Ord River was in flood, the Ivanhoe airstrip was out of commission and an injured worker at the research station on the Ord River needed to be transported to Wyndham for medical attention. Last year I asked the Minister to provide facilities for night landing at the Wyndham airport, which is down in a basin and it not a good airport for aircraft to land on other than in daylight hours. I understood the Minister to say last year that the necessary warning lights would be placed on the hills surrounding the airport. I should like the Minister to tell me whether that programme of work has been carried out, and I should also like him to tell me when it will be possible for the department to construct all-weather runways at the various north-west airports. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>948</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. - I shall deal first with the query raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper in respect of the subsidy payments of £500,000. This subsidy is paid to air operators which provide services of a developmental character in the isolated parts of Australia, and to those operators who provide services to rural areas regarded as being of an essential character. These developmental services are provided by such airlines as Connellan Airways Limited in the Northern Territory, and, of course, MacRobertson Miller Airlines along the coast and in the Kimberleys of Western Australia. Other airlines which provide these feeder services and which receive subsidies are TransAustralia Airlines - for its services in the Channel country and the Gulf country of Queensland - and East-West Airlines Limited and Airlines of New South Wales Proprietary Limited - for the rural services they provide in New South Wales. </para></talk.start><para>The payment is for developmental services. In each case it is worked out on a basis which is appropriate to the particular operation, having regard to the very peculiar difficulties that each of those airlines encounters in the provision of these services to the most isolated parts of Australia. For other services to rural areas or country areas, which are not regarded as developmental services, provision is made for the payment of a subsidy on the basis of a percentage of the value of the equipment used. Over a number of years £500,000 has been allocated amongst those various types of operators. That has ensured the provision of air services to areas of this vast country which, in many cases, would be without communications if there were no air services. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline>reminded me of a trip that we made together through the northwest and Kimberleys areas of Western Australia a couple of years ago. I regret that apparently he has not been back to those areas since then. Had he been back, I am sure that he would acknowledge that a very real improvement has been effected in the airport facilities in that part of the continent. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline>referred to the terminal building at Broome which was opened very recently. A new terminal building has been provided at Derby. The Wyndham terminal building is in good condition. A small but new terminal building has been provided at Onslow. In that respect the airports are well-equipped. I do not think any complaints could be made about the facilities for passengers. It is true that in the more isolated places, such as Hall's Creek and Fitzroy, the passenger terminals are bough sheds, but the passengers who arrive at those terminals for onward transport generally arrive as the 'plane lands, having seen it from within the town and got some one to drive them out to the terminal. Usually only one or two people embark at those very isolated airports. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline>referred to the condition of the runways. Considerable work has been done at some of the airports. I believe it is fair to say that the remaining airports that require treatment are Wyndham and Carnarvon. Wyndham presents a particular problem. I was there with the Director-General of Civil Aviation and technical officers earlier this year and we had the opportunity to examine the runways on the spot. They present something of a problem for the technical officers. We have not failed to spend money on them in the past; nor has there been any failure to maintain properly the runways at Wyndham. However, the soil is of such a character that, probably because of the incidence of the wet season, subsidences occur suddenly and unexpectedly. The matter will be investigated again during this wet season. I do not expect - indeed I am sure - that a great deal of the ultimate work will not be done this year. It will probably be included in the Estimates for next year. </para><para>At Carnarvon there is a unique problem. The surface of the runways at Carnarvon is quite sound; but after a sudden downpour of rain, which is a characteristic of that part of the coast, it becomes slippery. The surface remains sound, but while it is wet it is slippery. I understand that scientific people have been taken there by my department to try to find a way of mitigating that condition until such time as funds are available to surface the runways completely. I hope that what I have said has indicated to both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> that this part of the country, which depends so much on air services, is not being overlooked by the Department of Civil Aviation. </para><para>I noted particularly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline> said about the provision of cocktail bars at the bigger airports. I know that a balance has to be maintained among the various expenditures. One of the favorable aspects of a concession at a big airport is that it produces revenue which enables the department, in the long term, to spend money on the more outback places. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>949</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNR</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HANNAFORD, Douglas</name><name role="display">Senator HANNAFORD</name></talker><para>. -  I direct the attention of the Minister for Civil Aviation to Division No. 263  -  Development of Civil Aviation - Item 06, " Aerodromes - Development grant, £350,000 ".

I ask the Minister what the policy of the Government is in regard to the development of the light aeroplane airstrips which abound throughout Australia. I understand that every encouragement is given to local government authorities to take over those airstrips. They serve a very useful purpose. I have seen them in operation in various parts of South Australia. The Royal Flying Doctor Service, in particular, depends upon them, and they are also used by people who operate light aircraft in some of the remote parts of our country districts.

The vote to which he referred covers the allocation made for local ownership. The local ownership policy pursued by the Government over the past three years has been extremely successful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> asked whether I could provide the information in some detail. I can do so, but it is in the form of a very helpful pamphlet, and I suggest that he might have a look at it and obtain the details. I regret that I am not able to provide the vital statistics on this particular aspect of policy, but I can tell the honorable senator that the figures are most impressive. In Queensland and New South Wales, many local authorities are now the proud possessors of their own airports and are making a very good job of them. I believe that this has given them an increased sense of pride and community. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline>referred particularly to Millicent, which is an airport developed under the local ownership plan by the Commonwealth and local authority in partnership. It is covered by the maintenance provisions of the plan. I know that at present it is not being used, or is being little used, because of operational difficulties or exigencies of the airline that traverses that part of the country. But the airport is there and it is used by a number of local people operating light aircraft. When the commercial service resumes operation, it will be of great benefit to that district. </para><para>The provision of lighter aerodromes - authorized landing grounds, as we refer to them - poses a somewhat different problem. Some of these, of course, are required by individual persons or firms for their own benefit and for the promotion of their own businesses. I am sure that the honorable senator will agree that it is not the function of the Department of Civil Aviation, nor of the Government itself, directly to promote commercialism to the extent of providing airports for the expansion of private businesses, but many authorized landing grounds which have a community value are supported by the Department of Civil Aviation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>950</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JQN</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COOKE, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator COOKE</name></talker><para>. -  I thank the Minister for the information that he has given to the committee as a result of my questions. I now wish to raise two other matters. I refer to Division No. 261  -  Administrative - Salaries and Payments in the Nature of Salary - Temporary and Casual Employees. I note that the proposed appropriation for this purpose is a little less than 50 per cent, of the proposed appropriation for salaries of permanent employees. The proposed appropriations are £1,961,000 and £4,761,000 respectively. Most transport agencies require a certain degree of knowledge and efficiency of their casual employees. Although these could not be described as skilled or trained personnel, they absorb a good deal of knowledge about the service in which they are engaged, and they perform an important function in transport. </para></talk.start><para>Will the Minister consider an increase of this ratio between permanent employees and casual employees, with a view to enabling casual employees and temporary employees to become permanent? It is not an economy to employ casual and temporary employees. As a matter of fact, the usual trend in industrial awards is for these people to be paid a premium because of the temporary or casual nature of their employment. There is absolutely no benefit to any department in the continuous employment of employees of this type. The employees are required. Why not give them the privilege of permanence, with the opportunity of providing, by means of superannuation or otherwise, for their retirement. They are persons who, although not skilled, are, as a result of their association with the industry, efficient and good servants. This is one department wherein an adjustment such as I have advocated would be of benefit to all concerned. If this matter has not already been given consideration, I ask that it be considered in the coming assessment of staff. </para><para>I want to refer again to another matter that I mentioned when I was last on my feet. The Minister said that facilities for people waiting at aerodromes were reasonable, in view of the department's difficulty in providing better facilities. I ask the Minister whether it is competent for the department to instruct persons in charge of aerodromes, and airlines providing services, to advise passengers when there is a delay of more than two or three hours. This advice should be conveyed by means of telegraph or telephone or in some other way. The intending passengers should be advised, when an aircraft is late, of the time at which it is likely to depart. In the metropolitan area, one is sometimes required to spend two or three hours at an airport. Recently in Perth we had a delay of 24 hours. I have known delays to be as lengthy in the north-west. People coming from stations have very poor quarters, providing no services at all, in which to wait. In some cases it has been necessary to obtain hotel accommodation in town for sick persons. I do not think it is unreasonable for the Minister to make it incumbent on persons responsible to ensure that, in cases of inordinate delay, passengers shall be notified at the earliest possible moment of the estimated time of departure. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CANT</inline>(Western Australia' [9.59]. - I refer again to Division No. 262 - Maintenance and Operation of Civil Aviation Facilities.

I am well acquainted with the difficulties that confront the Minister and his department in respect of the Carnarvon runway. I think that the Carnarvon runway is badly sited, because it is flooded every time the Gascoyne River breaks its banks. The runway is situated in an old river bed. Has the Minister given any consideration to using in the construction of the runway at Carnarvon materials that are used by the Main Roads Department of Western Australia? Over a number of years, the Main Roads Department has found that the local materials are unsuited to road construction. Considerable research has been undertaken in an effort to obtain a mixture of soils and sands suitable for road (surfaces. A mixture of clay and sand forms the base upon which the bitumen sealing is placed. Has the Minister or his department conferred with the Main Roads Department on this matter with a view to obtaining a good surface for the Carnarvon runway until such time as the department can see its way clear to provide an all-weather runway, preferably at a site other than the present site of the aerodrome? </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>951</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. - I will reply, first, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke,</inline> who referred to the employment of temporary staff.

A good deal of it is done by people who choose transient employment rather than permanent employment. Also, many of the tradesmen employed see advantages in not accepting permanent employment. I refer particularly to maintenance staff and employees in similar capacities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline> will be aware that under certain conditions temporary employees are permitted to contribute to the superannuation fund after a period of three years. I am informed that that privilege is available to many temporary employees who have remained with the department for longer than three years. In addition, the department constantly transfers to the permanent staff employees who show any inclination to remain with the department and seek permanent status.

My officers were made to leave the town, despite the fact that they had made it clear that if they were permitted to remain, knowing where the flood waters may first breach the levee, they would be able to seal the levee and to hold the aerodrome intact. To the people in charge of the evacuation my officers suggested that one of their number should take his wife and the wives and children of the other officers away from the town, leaving the two remaining officers to look after the aerodrome. Unfortunately, that proposal did not find favour with the evacuation authorities. All officers of the department were moved from the aerodrome and the levee broke at the point where my officers expected it to break. The net result was that the Department of Civil Aviation had to spend about  £20,000  to restore the aerodrome. That expenditure could have been avoided. The situation did not make the responsible Minister very happy. However, I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> will obtain some comfort, as I do, from the fact that I have now made arrangements with the authorities concerned in Western Australia to ensure that in similar circumstances in the future such a state of affairs will not be permitted to occur again. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The nature of the soil of the aerodrome and the problems of compaction are not unknown to my staff there.

I am not at all sure that the expenditure of this money is not a waste. It seems that the Commonwealth is to pay  £50,000  to the States to enable them to employ administrative officers on road safety work. In addition, the Commonwealth is to spend  £100,000  on publicity. I have seen some of the publicity that has been provided by the Commonwealth, but I do not think it is of any use. For the life of me, I cannot see how that publicity will affect the speed-hog who drives on our roads. That kind of person does not take any notice of the publicity that appears in the press or on posts on the side of the roads. </para></talk.start><para>I ask the Minister how it is proposed to get at these speed-hogs in order to protect other people. I do not think we can protect the speed-hogs, but we may be able to protect other people. These people who speed are quite unpredictable; they slide out of a line of traffic at enormous speed and endanger others who are travelling ahead of and alongside them. Yet it is proposed to spend  £100,000  this year on erecting placards and on publicity through such media as television. As I said earlier, I am inclined to believe that this expenditure is a waste of money. I ask the Minister whether it is possible for the proposed expenditure of this money to be reconsidered. </para><para>I turn now to the proposed contribution to the maintenance of the Eyre and Barkly highways. It is proposed that in this financial year  £46,000  shall be allocated for this purpose. The information contained in the brochure supplied by the Minister discloses that this item covers an annual contribution of  £25,000  towards the maintenance of the Eyre highway between Penong in South Australia and Norseman in Western Australia. This highway extends over a distance of  723  miles. If we divide  £25,000  by  723  we arrive at an allocation of  £35  a mile. Probably this allocation supplements other moneys that are provided by the States. The expenditure of this sum of money would be just sufficient to macadamize one chain of road in every mile or, if the road has been already macadamized, it would enable about one and a half chains in every mile to be sealed. I have worked out that it would take 53 years to macadamize the road or to provide some form of sealing. </para><para>I ask the Minister to ascertain whether it is possible to obtain more than £35 a mile to improve the highway. There are many parts of the Eyre Highway that are in such a condition that any one who tries to drive a motor car on them after rain finds that the car turns round and looks at him. </para><para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WALTER</inline>COOPER (Queensland) [10.21].  -  I invite the Minister's attention to Division No. 368, Other Services, item 02, which relates to shipping services to Papua and New Guinea. I notice that the amount to be provided this year has been reduced by a quarter, or from £100,000, as it was last year, to £75,000. I realize a subsidy is paid to Burns Philp &amp; Company Limited which operates two ships between the Australian mainland and New Guinea. Is the reduction in the proposed expenditure due to the fact that the ships will carry less freight, or to a reduction in the amount of subsidy? I also refer to Division No. 372, under the heading of administrative expenses. Item 09 relates to Overseas Telecommunications Commission - Payments towards cost of coastal radio service. This year, the amount to be provided is £280,000, whereas last year the amount expended was £347,382. Does that mean that it is expected that less use will be made this year of the telecommunication services? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>953</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8N</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TOOHEY, James</name><name role="display">Senator TOOHEY</name></talker><para>. -  I refer to the proposed expenditure on the promotion of road safety practices. I think we are tackling this problem at the wrong end. It is my humble opinion that the holocaust on our roads to-day is in large part due to the fact that the roads are carrying a type of vehicular traffic for which they were not designed. Those of use who can remember travelling over the Hume Highway before the advent of the great transport trains which now use it day by day, will recall that the highway then had almost a billiard table surface and that it was possible to drive for long distances without encountering any of the hazards that are met with now. That is a part of the price that we in Australia have to pay for the lionizing of private enterprise. </para></talk.start><para>Our roads problem is being aggravated by the fact that people are using the roads for the carriage of huge quantities of goods in great transports. This form of transport destroys the roads, and the operators of it make little or no contribution to their reconstruction. Whether we care to admit it or not, there is no possible doubt that many of the fatal accidents and other accidents in which people are maimed or injured are due to the fact that these large transports are involved. 1 want to make it perfectly clear that I am not reflecting on the ability of the people who drive the transports because I think that in the main they are very capable drivers. What I am suggesting is that because of the way in which our roads are constructed, the gravest possible danger is being created for everybody who uses them. </para><para>These great overland trains - that is what they are - are using roads that were surveyed and constructed some twenty or 30 years ago for traffic of a vastly different character. I suggest that the matter is so important that road safety authorities in both the State and Federal spheres should face up to this basic factor in the toll of the road. As we know, the arterial roads between the capital cities of Australia sometimes have a width of no more than 20 feet of bitumen. In many instances the bitumen is undermined by the weight of the traffic travelling over it and thus becames a serious hazard in wet weather. So long as circumstances such as those continue to exist we shall continue to see the road toll grow. </para><para>Safety campaigns involving the use of advertisements on television screens, in the form of posters, and so on, could play a part in improving the situation, but until we build roads that will carry huge vehicles safely and also permit the safe movement of other types of motorized traffic, we shall continue to see the road toll increase each year. I suggest that the only alternative to such campaigns is to negotiate an agreement with the States, if that can be done, in respect of the heavy forms of transport that I have mentioned, because at present our roads are not suitable for them. In other countries where people are more enlightened in these matters there are highways designed specifically for heavy transport. I understand that where such conditions exist road travel is much safer than it is in Australia. I should Like to know the Minister's views on this matter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>954</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> has spoken of the possibility of building in Australia a ship for Antarctic exploratory work.

The honorable senator addressed himself particularly to accidents which arose from speeding. Expressing a personal view, may I say that I could not agree more with him. If the origins of road accidents were to be traced, I am sure it would be found that most accidents were directly related to speed. May I refer to action which recently has been taken in my State. The Government there has introduced a new code of speeds, and a remarkable transformation has resulted. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> well knows, traffic control is a matter for the States. There is no doubt that where a policy aimed at the elimination of speeding is rigorously pursued the benefits can be seen by way of a  fall in the  rate of accidents. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline>addressed himself to the construction of roads and their use by heavy vehicles. He said that our roads were not built to carry the types of vehicle and the heavy loads which in many instances they are now called upon to carry. I think that that is correct. The honorable senator asked for my views on the subject. I certainly do not want to brush him aside. I have views on the matter and have expressed them at road safety conferences many times. Nevertheless, this is a matter for the States. The types of roads that are constructed and the traffic codes that are adopted are matters for them. Over the years considerable pro gress has been made by the States towards the adoption of a uniform traffic code. I am not suggesting for one moment that that in any way solves the problem that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> has raised, but it gives us encouragement to hope that the co-operation which the States have displayed in attempting to develop a uniform traffic code may extend to other practices and have a very beneficial effect on road safety generally. </para><para>Consideration interrupted. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>954</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Wood</name></talker><para>-  Order!
