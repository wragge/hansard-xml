                        <para>-  I direct to  the  Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs a question which relates to a decision of the United States Supreme Court declaring valid the action of the United States Government in forcing Communist parties in America to register as arms of the Soviet Union. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the nature of that registration and of any other relevant factors associated with this procedure? Can he say whether such action would be available to the Australian Government in like circumstances? </para>

                        <para>-  For some time, I think, there has been in operation in the United States of America legislation which requires persons who are working as lobbyists in Congress or in the country generally, in the interests of a foreign country or, indeed, of a particular industry, to register themselves as working in the interests of either a foreign country or a particular industry. I believe, though I am not sure, that the case referred to by the honorable senator arose out of this legislation. It was believed that members of the Communist Party ipso facto worked in the interests of the Soviet Union and therefore should be made to register, in effect, as lobbyists for the Soviet Union. The United States Supreme Court agreed with the proposition that members of the Communist Party did in fact work in the interests of the Soviet Union. I do not know the state of the law in Australia well enough to say whether such a proposition would be tenable in Australia, but I shall look into the matter and let the honorable senator know what I am able to learn about it. </para>

                        <para>-  I understand that greatly increased numbers of cattle are being offered for slaughter in New South Wales, due mainly to seasonal conditions. During the last two years, marginal seasonal conditions have resulted in many cattle being held in store. Generally, New South Wales has enjoyed a good season this year, and that, of course, has resulted in many more cattle being fattened and offered for slaughter. The United Kingdom meat market has been depressed in recent months, but the situation is improving, and upward trends are now apparent. Of course, the American market is our best market today. That market is steady. All in all I believe, it provides the industry with some ground for optimism. </para>

It hopes to present its report to the governments concerned, both Commonwealth and State, with the least possible delay. It is the hope of the Commonwealth Government that from the report will come recommendations from the growers, and that the Government will be able to offer them some measure of assistance in overcoming their difficulties. </para>

In view of the urgent need to increase Australia's export trade, and to find alternative markets for our dairy products, having regard to the threat that the European Common Market arrangements at their worst may present to Australia, can anything be done on the Commonwealth Government level to develop the Japanese market? Will the Government seriously consider ways and means by which that market can be developed? </para>

                        <para>The Australian Government is well aware of the potential market in Japan for Australian dairy products. This matter was discussed with the Japanese in Tokyo about a year ago and, as a result, an Australian delegation visited Japan and had discussions with the Japanese authorities responsible for the dairy industry. The outcome of these discussions was that the Japanese system of calling tenders for butter contracts was adjusted. The Japanese Government's practice is to authorize importers to call tenders for butter when the demand exceeds local butter production. </para>
                        <para>At the present time there is a group of Japanese businessmen visiting Australia at the invitation of the Australian Dairy Produce Board to investigate cheese manufacture. In addition to the general assistance being offered to the visitors by the board, the group is being received by the Government and all possible assistance is being rendered to it. The chief interest of the visitors is Australian cheddar cheese for processing, which is currently being exported to Japan at the rate of approximately 40 tons per month. It is the expectation of the board, which regulates these exports, that they will increase substantially in the near future. </para>
                        <para>Concerning the desire of the honorable senator to further the interests of Tasmania in this field, I suggest that he arrange for the various commercial interests in his State to make their approach regarding participation in this trade to the Australian Dairy Produce Board. </para>

Will the Minister look, into this matter and have the original parking area restored to the taxi-cab drivers? </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service: Is it not a fact that when the Government introduced legislation to grant long-service leave to waterside workers the Australian Labour Party bitterly opposed it and said it would cause increased stoppages and strife on the waterfront? Also, is it not a fact that the time lost on the waterfront in Australia during September of this year was the lowest since records were commenced in 1949? Does not this indicate that the legislation is proving to be valuable to the waterside workers as well as to importers and exporters? </para>

                        <para>-  When one casts one's mind back one recalls that when in May last the Government introduced a bill that instituted long-service leave for waterside workers and provided that waterside workers could become either temporary or permanent employees upon the division of rosters, and that penalties for taking part in unauthorized stoppages would fall on the. individual instead of on union funds, the legislation was opposed by the Opposition. The argument advanced against the bill was that it would lead to greater disruption on the waterfront. That has been proved to be quite untrue. The honorable senator is quite right in saying that in September last the number of hours lost through stoppages on the waterfront was lower than for any other September on record. In fact, the number of hours lost in September last was of the order of 2,500, as against an average loss of 65,000 hours for previous Septembers. Those figures illustrate the advantage that has flowed to this section of the Australian transport industry as a result of the passing of the legislation in question. </para>

                        <para>- Senator Scott is quite correct when he says there has been what might fairly be described as a dramatic increase in the volume of coal being exported from New South Wales. My recollection is that during the last three months of this year our exports of coal are likely to be about 900,000 tons. Undoubtedly a very big market for our coal exists in Japan. In order to carry out their plans for expanding their steel industry the Japanese will need to import 20,000,000 or 25,000,000 tons of coking coal in the next five or six years. Australia has the coal available for export, and it could be exported without detrimentally affecting our steel industry. The New South Wales Government has embarked on a plan to modernize the coal export ports. The Commonwealth is assisting in that programme. I am very optimistic that we shall win an increasing share of the Japanese market, and that we shall do a very substantial trade with Japan, thereby substantially increasing employment opportunities in the coal industry. </para>

                        <para>-  The number of persons registered for employment has been quoted quite frequently in the Senate. My recollection is that the present number stands at 112,000. I am unable to give the honorable senator any information about the number of man-hours lost  as  a result of persons becoming unemployed. I have not made any computation along those lines. Senator Brown spoke in terms  of  the loss to the country, but we must look also at the other side of the ledger, and see what gains have accrued to the country as a result of the Government's policies. We must bear in mind that the Government's policies have made Australia internationally solvent, although there was a time when there were grave possibilities that we would become internationally insolvent. If we bear in mind that the price level has steadied and that inflationary trends have been halted, those advantages far exceed any disadvantages that may have flowed from the Government's policies. I have said previously that one must be careful when dealing with this subject. To the persons affected by unemployment the problem is a personal one. According to my calculations the number of persons registered for employment to-day is about 50,000 greater than the number normally registered for employment. The effect of the unemployment situation and its extent can be grossly exaggerated. </para>

                        <para>-  I am sorry if I overlooked answering part of the honorable senator's question yesterday. I do not think it is possible to say now when the conference of interested parties in this matter will be held. The venture is a very big one. The storage contemplated is very big. I should think that the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will need to confer closely with their technical advisers on the variations that may occur in using storage in various ways. The Premiers will have to be informed on that matter before they meet in conference to discuss the alternatives described in the report of the River Murray Commission. I do not know how long that process will take. The Commonwealth has said: "  Here  is the report. That  sets out  the basis upon which we will be willing to provide the money. When you are ready to do so, come and talk to us about it. We will be willing to convene a conference at which the Prime Minister will attend for at least a part of the time." The Commonwealth has cleared the decks so that the project can go ahead in accordance with a timetable, and on conditions agreed upon by the three State governments concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Senator Laught has asked a question which is rather difficult  to  answer. I believe it is well known in mining circles that the ore available at Radium Hill is so much below standard that, when existing contracts expire, it will be difficult to sell the products of the mine in the present competitive market for uranium. I think the committee appointed by the South Australian Government has confirmed that view. As matters now stand uranium is in over-supply and it is apparent that in future uranium will be available at prices much lower than those obtainable now or those that were obtainable previously. There are in Australia mines that will be able to produce uranium at prices which will be quite competitive in the new era. I refer, for instance, to the mines at Rum Jungle and Mary Kathleen and on the Alligator River. They will be able to produce at competitive prices all the uranium oxide that we require. As I understand the position, the mine at Radium Hill will not be able to do that. Therefore, I do  not  think that I can offer much consolation to Senator Laught. The circumstances of this mine are well-known to my department and to the mining industry generally, and it will not be easy to find a solution to the problem. Another use might be found for the treatment plant, but that use would have to be associated with a mining concern rather than with a government department. </para>

                        <para>- The answer is, "No". I cannot dissect from the total number of man-hours lost on the waterfront the number of hours, if any, that were lost as a result of lack of work on the waterfront. Possibly Senator Poke did not understand me, or I did not make myself clear, when I spoke previously. When I referred to 2,500 hours having been lost on the waterfront last September, compared with the average loss of 65,000 hours for previous Septembers, I was referring to hours lost as a result of stoppages or industrial disputes. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that I can add very much to what has appeared in public print on this matter. Manoeuvres are taking place in East Germany of troops of the Warsaw Pact countries. These manoeuvres have resulted in considerable troop movement from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other Warsaw Pact countries into East Germany. At the same time the Russian strength in East Germany - constantly present as a garrison to hold down the East German population - which previously had been some 20 per cent, under strength, has been brought up to full strength. A considerable area of East Germany has been declared a military zone and has been closed to normal traffic. I think that the conclusions to be drawn from this unusual display of military strength are a matter for judgment rather than something about which a definite statement can be made here. The other manoeuvres in West Germany, to which the honorable senator refers, were manoeuvres of troops stationed in West Germany, and did not involve the importation into that country of new or large numbers of troops, as did the manoeuvres taking place in East Germany. </para>

                        <para>In the Penguin municipality on the north-west coast of Tasmania, there are several known small iron ore deposits. The largest of these deposits is the low-grade deposit at Blythe River which forms part of the 'boundary between the Penguin and Burnie municipalities. The deposit is near a bitumen road and is 7 miles from the port of Burnie. </para>
                        <para>At present the iron ore deposits of Tasmania are reserved from occupation under the Mining Act for the purposes of investigations being undertaken by the State Department of Mines. The State Government hopes that it will succeed in proving the existence of a deposit of sufficient volume and grade for the establishment of a local steel industry. The small deposits in the Penguin municipality may prove to be of sufficient size to be useful supplementary sources of ore for such an industry, which would have as its principal source of ore the large Savage River deposit near the west coast </para>
                        <para>I am informed that a sample of ore from Savage River was recently sent to the United States for a smelting test which will be carried out within the next fortnight. This test and the investigations of Tasmanian iron ore deposits which are now proceeding will provide basic information as to the prospects of developing Tasmania's iron ore deposits for the purpose of setting up an iron and steel industry in that State. In the meantime the State Government is not issuing leases that permit the export of iron ore. </para>

                        <para>- Recently, Senator Wright raised the question of introducing a subsidy on superphosphate. Having conferred with the Treasurer about this matter, I am now able to say that one of the many proposals which came up for discussion when the 1961-62 Budget was being framed was the introduction of a subsidy on superphosphate. After careful consideration of all aspects of the proposal it was, however, decided to take no action in the matter. As the current usage of superphosphate in Australia is approximately 2,000,000 tons per annum, the annual cost of a subsidy would be £2,000,000 for every £1 per ton of subsidy. </para>

The Soviet delegate at the United Nations has attacked the United States' plan and in doing so has. again cast doubts on the sincerity of the Soviet claim that they genuinely seek disarmament. </para>

                    <para>The principles contained in the Joint Statement of Agreed Principles for Disarmament Negotiations prepared by the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union are also welcome to the Government, not least because they are the first positive result of the bilateral discussions which have been taking place since 19th June. The statement, like the declaration, lays stress on the need to implement disarmament in stages; on the need to have balanced disarmament; and on the necessity to combine measures of control and verification with the process of disarmament. But the Soviet Union insisted during negotiations that it could not accept the inclusion of a sentence in the statement which called for verification, after disarmament, of forces and armaments to ensure these did. not rise above the prescribed levels. In agreeing to delete this sentence before the statement was publicized, the United States made it quite clear that it in no way abandoned its belief in the necessity for such a provision. It is the inclusion of this  provision  in the United States Declaration which has brought protests from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gromyko.</inline> 1 need say no more regarding the necessity for control and verification during and after disarmament. What I do wish to suggest to the Senate is that the publication of agreed principles does not mean that the Soviet Union is necessarily ready to negotiate an effective disarmament agreement. In the Joint Statement of Agreed Principles the Russians appear to subscribe to the need for control of disarmament. But what does the Soviet Union mean by control? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gromyko</inline> said on 24th September that the Soviet Union proposed that control should be implemented through an international disarmament organization based on the " troika " system. This proposal, with each of the three delegates able to exercise a veto, would make any control system completely ineffective. </para>

He may remember that I asked whether that work could not have been done at the Port Augusta railway workshops. At page 23 of the latest report of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner there is a reference to salvage, and the following statement is made: - </para></talk.start><quote><para>Disposal of obsolete locomotives and rollingstock continued and towards the end of the year tenders were invited for the purchase of considerable tonnages of reclaimed second-hand 50 lb. rails from the Central Australia Railway. Salvage of materials received full attention, and a special area with security fences has now been set aside to facilitate these operations. </para></quote><para class="block">I  think that is a step in the right direction. At this time when we are putting forth our probing questions it is perhaps fitting for us to remember that the Commonwealth Railways made a handsome profit last year. We should commend those associated with the railway operations. Can the Minister inform me of the ramifications of the salvage work being conducted by the railway authorities and the extent to which, if any, they salvage obsolete stock? Can he also say how the salvaged material is disposed of, and whether the salvage operations should be extended as a means of bringing about further economies? </para><para>The next matter I propose to raise comes within the scope of the section headed " Employee Welfare " at page 24 of the report. I am reminded that some time ago I was approached by certain people regarding the immunization of employees against influenza. I understand that in about March of 1960 notices appeared in the Commonwealth railway workshops and at railway centres in the north of South Australia suggesting that employees should avail themselves of the opportunity to be immunized against influenza. I was informed on that occasion that the cost of the immunization was 15s. for a doctor's visit, 7s. 6d. to cover the cost of the serum and 12s. 6d. for the services of the sister in attendance when the injections were given. I must confess that when the matter was first brought to my notice I overlooked seeking information at question-time. I was just reminded of it as I read the section relating to employees' welfare. Although it is a step in the right direction for the Commonwealth Railways to make its employees aware of the need for immunization, it seems that the cost is rather high. </para><para>I make no definite statement on this point and I may be wrong when I say that I understand that in some Commonwealth departments employees may avail themselves of immunization facilities at no cost to themselves. If that is so, it seems to me to be rather discriminatory that employees of Commonwealth railway workshops should have to pay the fees that were mentioned to me some time ago by one of the persons interested. Can the Minister inform me whether my statement in relation to costs is correct and, if it is, whether there is any way in which those costs can be reduced or eliminated altogether? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1015</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KBW</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WRIGHT, Reginald</name><name role="display">Senator WRIGHT</name></talker><para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> has referred to the sale of obsolete stock, I want to bring up again the matter to which I referred last night.

I am informed that salvaging is carried out to the maximum extent. The fencing which is referred to in the report and which no doubt is known to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> is indicative of the progress that has been made in salvage operations in recent years. Indeed, the salvage yard at Port Augusta has grown quite a bit over the last few years.

I am told that the welfare carriage is made available for this work, but I repeat that I am unable to say anything about the scale of costs.

However, I shall institute further inquiries to ascertain the actual costs involved and, if possible, obtain a comparison with the cost of comparable services in other Commonwealth instrumentalities. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>has referred again to the Auditor-General's comment on obsolete locomotives and rolling-stock and has asked why no real progress has been made in the book treatment of the sum involved. I am informed that in the main the disposal of salvaged stock occurred within a compressed period immediately after the acquisition and commissioning of the diesel locomotives. The sum of £900,848 was accounted for, in the main, by the sale of locomotives as scrap. The problem arose as to how to apportion that recovery against the Commonwealth accounts over a period of years. I said last night that it would be unrealistic to treat that as a recovery attributable to any one year and that discussions were proceeding between the Department of the Treasury and the Commonwealth Railways with a view to establishing how this amount could be treated, not in one year but over a period.

I wish to compliment the Commissioner for Railways, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. K.</inline> A. Smith, on completing his first year of office. I have read with interest the report on the Commonwealth Railways. That report contains some most encouraging data. My first observation is in relation to freight facts. It will be seen that in 1959-60 revenue from freight amounted to about £4,000,000. In the last year revenue from this source amounted to about £4,500,000. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> reports, freight traffic rather than the carriage of passengers is the lifeblood of the Commonwealth Railways system. </para></talk.start><para>I think it is wise to pause for a moment to examine this matter of freight, and to ask ourselves whether sufficient freight is being carried by the Commonwealth Railways. In particular, we should see whether Commonwealth departments should be urged to use the Commonwealth Railways more than they are doing at present. As a South Australian I am aware that a tremendous amount of freight is carried by road from Adelaide, in particular to Woomera. That traffic causes a good deal of congestion in some of the smaller country villages and towns in South Australia. Correspondents from Port Augusta have from time to time written to Adelaide newspapers quoting the number of vehicles passing across the Port Augusta bridge heading for Woomera. Obviously, Port Augusta, which is the headquarters of the Commonwealth Railways, is very interested in the amount of freight carried by road to Woomera, which is a Commonwealth settlement. </para><para>Dealing with local goods traffic on the Trans-Australian line the Commissioner for Commonwealth Railways in his latest report states - </para><quote><para>The overall revenue from local goods traffic consigned to the Woomera Rocket Range and the Maralinga Proving Ground increased when compared with the previous year whilst salt traffic from Winninowie was slightly less. </para></quote><para class="block">I am pleased to note that increase, but this Government should do 'everything to ensure that the maximum amount of freight destined for Woomera is carried by the Commonwealth Railways. A tremendous amount of freight goes to Woomera because Woomera produces nothing in the way of foodstuffs. Everything used in Woomera must be freighted there to support a fairly large and vigorous population. I think that a determined effort on the part of the Government could increase the amount of freight handled by the Commonwealth Railways. Port Augusta largely depends for its existence on the Commonwealth Railways, and is vitally interested in their development. </para><para>I commend the Commissioner for Railways and the Minister for Shipping and Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Opperman,</inline> on the drive that is being made to increase passenger traffic on the railways. I was privileged to travel for at least SO miles on the inaugural run in August last year of the Wildflower train. The Commonwealth Railways instituted that service to attract people who were interested in freighting their cars as far as Kalgoorlie and then proceeding the rest of the way to Perth by car through country that is normally arid, but which is very beautiful at that time of the year. The fare charged is attractive, and I believe that the service proved so successful that it was repeated this year. </para><para>Dealing with goods traffic the commissioner states - </para><quote><para>Special attention was again given to the problems of conveyance of perishable traffic for Northern Territory destinations. </para><para>An innovation was the introduction of what is considered to be the longest milk run in the world. Frozen milk in cartons is brought from Clare in South Australia by road to Port Pirie Junction, where it is loaded into this department's ice-cooled containers for conveyance to Alice Springs. In this manner, fresh milk is available to Alice Springs' residents as a regular measure for the first time. </para></quote><para class="block">Clare is a most delightful part of South Australia, and is a most productive area. </para><para class="block">By dealing with perishables in this way a good deal of assistance will be given to the agricultural, viticultural and fruit-growing areas of South Australia.

I hope that soon a daily service will be operating on the transcontinental line. I hope also that a much speedier service will be operated to Alice Springs. </para><para>I compliment the Minister on his running, of the Commonwealth Railways, but I would like an assurance that everything is being done by way of negotiations with the Department of Works and the Department of Supply to ensure that the maximum amount of freight is carried by the railways. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1017</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. -  I am not surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> has. referred again to the carriage of freight to Woomera. For the last few years he has shown a continuing interest in this aspect of railway operations. He will have noticed the improvement in this regard as recorded by the Commissioner for Railways in hismost recent report. That improvement ispartly the result of better liaison between the Commonwealth Railways, the Department of Supply, the Department of Works, and the service departments. In the early stages of Woomera it was sometimes difficult to consign goods by train because much of the equipment was scientific equipment and was packed into special containers, placed on trucks either at the point of manufacturein Australia or on arrival in Australia, and taken direct to Woomera on those trucksso that it would not be disturbed. As thingshave settled down there has been the improvement that has been noticed by theCommissioner for Railways. </para></talk.start><para>I am sure that the commissioner and the Minister for Shipping and Transport will be as pleased as I am at the compliment paid by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> to the people concerned' with the conduct of the Commonwealth Railways. It is only fair to say that the Commonwealth Railways provide a servicefor communities that are difficult to service because of their isolation. The railways have been responsible for innovations not only in respect of the carriage of goods, particularly perishables, to isolated places, but also in respect of more technical matters, particularly in relation to rail laying and the like, in which the Commonwealth Railways lead the field. That is something that is worthy of note, and I express my pleasure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> has spoken as he has. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1018</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KBW</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WRIGHT, Reginald</name><name role="display">Senator WRIGHT</name></talker><para>.- Dealing with the sale of obsolete stock, in respect of which £900,000 was received, I should like the Minister to tell me to what accounts the moneys received were credited as they came in year by year. It is obvious that they must have been credited to some Commonwealth Railways accounts. That being so, it is, I suggest, a false entry to keep the original asset at cost in the books. It seems to me that this is a matter that cannot be passed over without a specific explanation, and I suggest that such an explanation is due to the committee. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1018</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>.  - The proceeds of the disposals were credited directly to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, not to a railways account, in compliance with a practice which has prevailed for many years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> takes the view that that is not a satisfactory accounting practice, and I am quite sure that many people take a similar view. This is one of the accounting difficulties with which I had to deal when I was the Minister for Shipping and Transport. It may be that an overhaul of many aspects of the accounting system used by the Commonwealth Railways is overdue. I should not argue against that proposition. However, the fact is that the practice which has been followed since the inception of the Commonwealth Railways, however unsatisfactory it may be, was followed at this point of time. The Department of the Treasury and the Commonwealth Railways are now considering this aspect of railway accounts, which has been underlined by the disposals that 'have been made since the introduction of diesel-electric locomotives. All that I can say at present is that the problem is there, that it is acknowledged as being there, and that work is being done with a view to introducing a better accounting practice in order to dispose of the problem. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1018</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8N</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TOOHEY, James</name><name role="display">Senator TOOHEY</name></talker><para>. -  I wish to refer again to the disposals question. I assure the Minister that I do not intend to make any criticisms, but merely to seek information so that I shall be able to understand the position. The Minister has already given me some information in reply to a question that I asked of him in relation to this matter, but possibly I did not make quite clear what I wanted him to tell me. First of all, I want to know the types of obsolete stock that are being disposed of. The Minister said that tenders were called for the purchase of such stock. I should like to know whether the calling of tenders is the only procedure adopted, or whether there is any selling direct to individuals. I should like to know, further, whether the purchasers of the obsolete stock are Australian firms or whether, in the main, they are overseas firms. I think that those are fair questions and have a bearing on the protection of materials which may be of some use to Australia. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1018</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KBW</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WRIGHT, Reginald</name><name role="display">Senator WRIGHT</name></talker><para>.- I am indebted to the Minister for what he has said about the continuing difficulty of accounting for sales of obsolete stock, but the fact that he has revealed that this difficulty existed when he was the Minister for Shipping and Transport two years ago, or perhaps a little longer, indicates that the accounts in this field are not receiving the care and attention that they require. Recently the Government overhauled the accounts of the Post Office and put them on a commercial basis. I would have thought that the Commonwealth Railways would have been one of the first government instrumentalities to have its accounts put on a commercial basis. In my view, the delay that has occurred in this matter reflects no credit on the Auditor-General, the Department of the Treasury or the Commonwealth Railways. I shall be watching to see whether this item occurs in the accounts next year. If it does occur, that will be a matter which, I should think, this committee would not be inclined to permit to go on for one month longer. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1018</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. - Perhaps I may reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> first.

That makes the position very difficult for school-teachers who have to accept transfers to outer areas of the various States. The academic year commences in February and ends in December and the transfers are generally for a period of two years. Under this system of administration a school-teacher can claim the allowance for only one year, despite the fact that he has been in the zoned area for a working period of two years. </para></talk.start><para>In the first year of his transfer period, the academic year starts in February and the financial year ends on 30th June; so he is unable to claim the zone allowance for that financial year.

At the end of the second year of his transfer period, the financial year commences on 1st July and the academic year ends before 31st December; so, whilst the school-teacher is in the zoned area on transfer for a period of two years he is entitled to the zone allowance for only one year. I believe that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> should consider whether something can be done about that matter. </para><para>I refer now to superannuation benefits.

If the worker, on the termination of his service, elects to receive weekly payments in lieu of accrued long-service leave or other accrued leave, that amount is treated as wages and is fully taxable. If a worker wants to receive weekly superannuation payments to supplement his social service benefits, he has to pay tax on the superannuation payments, although if he elects to receive a lump sum payment only 5 per cent, of the amount is taxable.

This item covers payments to the Australian Wool Realization Committee towards the expenses of the continued operation of the wool statistical service which has been provided for some time by the committee for supplying detailed statistics in regard to the wool clip and wool prices. These statistics are in addition to those normally supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. Before 1939, reliable statistical information on the Australian wool clip was very limited. Wartime requirements and the subsequent operation of the Joint Organization called for the collection of detailed statistics based on physical appraisement of almost every lot of wool offered for sale. The statistics, which covered detailed price and market information, were the most comprehensive ever available on wool. With the winding up of the Joint Organization's activities, the statistics became unnecessary for that purpose. It was decided, however, to continue the production of them in the interests of both wool-growers and the Commonwealth Government. The machines and staff are under the direction of the Commonwealth Statistician, in conjunction with the Australian Wool Bureau. The amount of this contribution represents approximately the cost of statistical machines and the salaries of the operating staff. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1022</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3W</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CANT, Hartley</name><name role="display">Senator CANT</name></talker><para>. - Division No. 191 includes an appropriation for the expenses of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation.

The man on the lower scale of income, who has a family, does not pay a great deal in taxation in any case. Therefore, be gets little or nothing out of the taxation deduction and he is compelled to make a substantial sacrifice for a conscientious reason to send his child to a non-governmental school.

The answer is that when the matters to be included in the terms of reference were being considered, since it obviously was impossible to refer a large number of taxation matters to the committee, a selection necessarily had to be made of those which should receive priority. The subject of zone allowances was not considered to be sufficiently important or appropriate for particular reference. I point out that it took the committee more than two years to take evidence and present its recommendations to the Parliament. That is understandable, and I do not speak in a critical way at all.

The work is done by officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, which is reimbursed the cost of the salaries of the officers so employed, and it is also paid a commission on total sales. The commission on sales is recovered from the client departments as an on-cost on issues. The salaries of officers employed on the work of the board, and miscellaneous expenditure such as that on advertising and the testing of samples, are the only charges against this vote. </para><para>Reference was made to the fact that the Attorney-General had stated that no further developments had occurred in the review of the board's constitution and functions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was good enough to say some days ago that he was interested in this matter, and I have had an opportunity to make inquiries at the Treasury. I am informed that in 1956 the board decided to review the situation and, as a preliminary, to examine the extent to which departments were making use of the facilities provided by it. Unfortunately, difficulties in obtaining staff have created problems in connexion with the work of the board, and it has even proved impracticable to complete contracts for supplies before the expiration of existing contracts. In these circumstances, other work has been put aside in order to give priority to the issuing of tenders and the making of contracts for obtaining supplies for the Commonwealth. Until the arrears of work have been overtaken, and the placing of contracts is up to date, it is not possible to give to the various matters related to a review of the constitution the concentrated attention that is necessary. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1024</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2N</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RIDLEY, Clement</name><name role="display">Senator Ridley</name></talker><para>asked about the appropriation under the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve.

This is really an extension of the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus.</inline> The legislation provides that a person may claim a concessional deduction of £100 for school fees, books and uniforms. There has been no change in the amount since 1956. In that year the allowance was increased from £75 to £100. As an example of the degree to which costs have risen, I point out that since 1956 the term fees charged by a well-known girl's' college in South Australia have risen from £25 to £36. I believe a very sound case can be advanced for a revision of the allowance and for the allowable deduction to be increased from £100 to £150. This matter is exercising the minds of quite a number of people in' South Australia and I have no doubt throughout the entire country. </para></talk.start><para>I refer now to the position of a widower who has to employ a housekeeper.

I compliment the Commissioner for Taxation upon having been able to keep collections of taxes well in hand. Some years ago there was a tendency for outstanding taxes: - especially income tax - to amount to a considerable sum-. In some years the outstanding amount was much more than £100i000,000, and even close to £200,000,000. Despite the fact that the last collection year was a rather difficult one for the Commissioner of Taxation,, it is interesting to note that the total amount of outstanding tax was down to approximately £78,000,000. </para></talk.start><para>The branch does the Government a service in ensuring that taxes are paid; otherwise the Government's Budget would go astray to a considerable degree. I believe the real reason behind the success achieved by the branch is that it acts fairly and, in the main, it is precise. I repeat that, considering the difficult nature of the financial year which has just passed, the action of the branch in keeping outstandings down to as low as £78,000,000 is commendable. To reduce that amount still further no doubt would cause considerable hardship in some quarters. </para><para>I have referred before to the other matter to which I invite attention. In making the submission again this year I derive some encouragement from the fact that the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation also has paid some attention to it. I refer to the fact that some taxpayers are relieved of the obligation to furnish income tax  returns. It is well known that every person having an income of £104 or more is obliged to furnish a return. It is interesting to note in the statistics published by the Commissioner of Taxation in his thirtyninth report that during the assessment year 1958-59, which is the latest complete year for which such statistics are available, mere were 3,921,000 payers of income tax in Australia. Persons with taxable incomes between £105 and £199 number 158,000. From those 158,000 persons only £203,000 was collected by the Commonwealth. I imagine that it costs at least £1 to process a taxpayer's return. I do not think the cost of processing a return would be less than £1 when one takes into account the time of officers, the time of typists, materials used, and the time occupied in filing. It is clear, I submit, that the Commonwealth receives 26s. or 27s. from each of those 158,000 taxpayers, but the cost to the Commonwealth of processing each of those returns is 20s. The figure of £104 was fixed many years ago when money had a different value from what it has to-day. I submit that a fair minimum figure to-day would be £208. If that figure were adopted the Government would be saved the trouble of sending out 158,000 assessments and would lose, according to my statistics, only £203,000. The Committee on Taxation, after a thorough investigation into this matter, reported in paragraph 458 - </para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the minimum taxable income should be increased from £105 to £209 per annum. It further recommends that a " shading in " method be provided so that the income tax payable on a taxable income between £209 and £213 (inclusive) would not exceed one-half of the excess of the taxable income over £208. </para></quote><para class="block">The shading-in method is a well-known taxation procedure adopted to ensure that those persons whose incomes are just a shade over the limit are treated fairly. I urge the Minister to adopt the practice recommended by the committee. My reasons are, first, that it is uneconomical to tax people whose incomes range between £105 and £208, and, secondly, that the Committee on Taxation has reported favorably on this matter. Thirdly, to accept the committee's recommendation would be to give a measure of natural justice to a number of people with small incomes. In its report the committee desig nates what we generally term smaller people as junior employees, part-time workers, seasonal workers, trainees, apprentices, superannuitants, persons with small incomes from property, and many others. If the Government adopted the committee's recommendations it would render a measure of justice to those people to whom I have referred. After all, if they were exempt from the payment of income tax they would still pay considerable amounts in taxes of other kinds, such as sales tax and excise duty. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1026</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2N</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RIDLEY, Clement</name><name role="display">Senator RIDLEY</name></talker><para>. - I refer again to Division No. 207 - Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve.

The increase in the appropriation sought for this purpose this year is accounted for by the fact that increasing use is being made of machinery of this type. The question of whether it would be better to purchase these machines leads to a number of considerations. In this particular field quite a remarkable number of technological advances is being made from month to month. In these changing circumstances it is not considered wise to buy equipment now, particularly as the cost of such equipment runs into millions of pounds.

I understand that refunds of instalments deducted under the pay as you earn system run to approximately £80,000,000 a year. The scale of the instalment deductions is designed to ensure that wage and salary earners will not normally be required to make further payments at the end of a financial year. Because of this fact, and also because it is not possible precisely to forecast the various concessional deductions that will be claimed by each taxpayer, refunds have risen to the magnitude mentioned - that is, £80,000,000. I make the comment that I believe it is the experience of most employers that many employees treat the pay-as-you-earn system as a form of compulsory saving and that they do not claim at the beginning of each year the deductions in respect of dependants that they are entitled to claim. The employees prefer to establish a credit with the Taxation Branch.

I ask the Minister to tell the committee whether this is a new item. I do not recall having heard such an item discussed previously in a debate on the Estimates. It seems to me to foreshadow the beginning of the practice of giving the Treasurer petty cash. In this instance we can open our eyes quite widely, because £16,000,000 is the sum that the Treasurer is to be given for general purposes, without a specific appropriation. The old-fashioned community in which I live regards it as a matter of alarm that the State Treasurer is given an advance which, I think, will be £10,000 this year. It may be that the Treasurer in. Hobart is more disposed to spend money in a way that would excite suspicion than is the Treasurer in Canberra, but I think that we should consider this matter from the viewpoint of principle. </para></talk.start><para>I want to know whether this item or a similar item has been commented upon at any time by the Public Accounts Committee and, if that is so, whether the Minister will refer us to the .statements that were made.

Unless the Treasurer and his officers are bound by law to apply all of this money to specific purposes approved by the Parliament, I see a danger to the principle of parliamentary control of expen diture. It cannot be denied that if, say, £500,000 was spent for a particular purpose six months ago, the Parliament, it it disapproved of that expenditure, could only sigh. In my view, the only way in which the Parliament can keep control of the public purse is to have before it for approval the purposes for which appropriations are sought. 1 ask the Minister whether he will give us some information about the origin of this item and its justification. </para><para>While I am on my feet, I refer him also to paragraph 39 of the latest report of the Auditor-General In that paragraph the Auditor-General goes through a process which seems to me to be quite superfluous, in that he gives, in effect, a reprint of departmental accounts.

In the recital of the departmental accounts in paragraph 39, there is a reference to "Pensions of officers, £3,240,642".

In doing so 1 refer to the very helpful document that, for the first time, has accompanied the Treasury Papers. It is a white paper on Commonwealth payments to or for the States. I think the Parliament should acknowledge the production of this document. First of all it is a specific contribution by the Treasury on the history  of  this important subject - the financial relationship between the States and the Commonwealth. The Treasury has done the Parliament a real service in preparing this record. In the second place, we ought to devote a little attention to the document because I believe it sounds the deathknell to those who espouse the now expired hope, </para></talk.start><para class="block">I would think, of making the States financially responsible for their own revenues.

The total general revenue grants received by the States from the Commonwealth have increased during the ten years from £130,000,000 to £302,000,000; The size of those figures is sufficient to show, I submit, the increasing dependence of the States upon Commonwealth revenues for their essential functions. Then there are grants that have been made by the: Commonwealth for various specific purposes. Included in those grants are moneys made available for roads. Those grants have increased over the ten years from £30,600,000 to £92,400,000. The total contribution made by the Commonwealth to State revenues for all purposes, general and specific, has risen since 1951 from £165,100,000 to £394,700,000. If one were to look at the public accounts of the various States I feel sure that they would show a correspondingly increasing dependence on Commonwealth moneys. It would be quite futile to lament this matter, but I think it is possible to reflect  a  little upon it, and to see whether or not we are of the view that we have now reached a definite stage in this important issue of Commonwealth-State finances, where a system has been evolved of Commonwealth dominance and State dependence. Realizing that finance provides the sinews of government, and is the key of government, I think we ought to have some regard to the possible effects of future payments, both legislative and administrative, between the Commonwealth and the States. </para><para>The system of uniform taxation which originated during the war as a revenue system was applicable only for the period of war, but it will be remembered that by a deliberate decision in 1946 uniform taxation was continued for a period, then expressed to be a period of five years, subject to a certain formula. It was proved during the decade of the fifties that that formula was quite insufficient for State requirements. We found that supplementary grants were necessary year by year. As I said on a previous occasion, those supplementary grants were provided by this Government in a generous attempt to underwrite and supplement the State finances in order to guarantee the continued solvency of the States with their expanding needs throughout that decade. Nevertheless, those grants were made solely on the decision of the Commonwealth Government. When the central Government decides of its own volition that a substantial amount of money shall be given to the States, a great inroad is made into the principle of the responsibility of the State governments. </para><para>Honorable senators will remember that one State felt that its capacity to rely upon revenue raised by itself was such that it should seek again to be self-reliant in its own finances. That State was Victoria. It actually litigated the matter before the High Court of Australia. It claimed that the Commonwealth did not have priority in the field of income tax. However, for ' all practical purposes, that appeal to the court was ineffectual. </para><para>After certain discussions about whether or not the States could ever be induced to resume their responsibility in this matter, the Commonwealth came forward with a new proposal in 1960, 1 think it was. When re-imbursements and supplementary grants were running at the rate of about £220,000,000 a year, the Commonwealth negotiated with the States for the purpose of meeting the threat which, had then developed to the whole system of special grants per medium of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It will be recalled that, in that year, not only were South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania claimants before the commission, but that Queensland actually put in its claim and Victoria threatened to put in a claim. Obviously, a problem of very great proportions was threatening the Commonwealth. </para><para>Proposals were put forward that the amount given to the States should be enlarged. In other words, the States were given the gold treatment, and offered an advance on present accruals of about £20,000,000 to £25,000,000. After a little hedging, the amount that was provided was £242,500,000. That amount was to be distributed amongst the States on a basis of which population was the main index; but the basis also included two other factors which, I believe, are very significant from the stand-point of the Australian economy. </para><para>One factor in the arrangement by which that sum was agreed upon by the Commonwealth and the States was that the States would continue to meet 'the Commonwealth pay-roll tax on the various State instrumentalities, such as railways, transport commissions and hydro-electric commissions. The other point was that there should be an increment in the formula, dependent upon the average wage being paid throughout the Commonwealth. As I understand the position, it was not the basic wage, but the average wage actually being paid. </para><para>It seems to me that those two factors hinge the continuing financial assistance to the States by way of tax reimbursements, to which the Commonwealth has committed itself over the period of this agreement, to the rising cost of wages in the economy. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1030</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRG</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LILLICO, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator Lillico</name></talker><para>-  The period of the agreement is five, years, is it? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1030</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KBW</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WRIGHT, Reginald</name><name role="display">Senator WRIGHT</name></talker><para>- I think it is five years, but I am subject to correction on that.

I rose to say that in my view the agreement sounded the deathknell of any claim by the States to a recovery of their independent responsibilities, certainly in respect of income tax, and in my view in respect of the whole field of public finance. May I be permitted to add that for six or seven years I had been convinced that the income tax field was indivisible, and that because of its complex nature - involving as it does matters of policy - it was not capable of being divided between the central government and the State governments, particularly in the opinion of the individual taxpayer, who looked askance at the prospect of receiving- </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1031</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KBL</name.id><electorate>QUEENSLAND</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WOOD, Ian</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Wood</name></talker><para>-  Order!

The division of income tax would have been unacceptable to the individual taxpayer who may have been made the victim of two contrary policies - one expressed from Canberra and the other from the State capital. It always seemed to me that other fields of public finance - perhaps without amendment of the Constitution, but certainly with amendment of the Constitution - could have been divided between Canberra and the State capitals, because they were fields in which the States could exercise their financial responsibilities. Various suggestions in relation to divisions have been made from time to time. The Constitutional Review Committee, which was representative of this Parliament and reported some two years ago, gave very extended consideration to this subject, and found it insoluble. Nevertheless, up to that stage, the problem was thought to be a practical one. In my view, if the agreement to which I have referred operates for some five years, it will mean that the re-division of fields of public finance will no longer be a matter of practical politics. </para></talk.start><para>I mention that in the hope that members of this committee will let us know what their thinking is upon this important matter. It is important, as I see it, in two respects, first, from the point of view of public finance, which is the means whereby economy is preserved in public development; and secondly, from the point of view of constitutional, responsible government, because elected, democratic government, either State or Federal, cannot exist by simply expending money to curry favour with voters while giving to other governments the responsibility for raising the money. The two functions are inseparable from the point of view of properly constituted, democratic and responsible government. I say with great regret that I believe that the States, by subscribing to this agreement, have renounced that responsibility and, correspondingly, that right. I cannot foresee the effect of that in ten, fifteen or 25 years' time, but the possibility of its withering the whole status of the States and their financial responsibility is plain. If that develops, it will have important repercussions upon this Commonwealth. </para><para>Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. </para><para>Proposed expenditure noted. </para><para>Department of the Treasury - Capital Works and Services. </para><para>Proposed expenditure, £1,770,000. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WALTER</inline>COOPER (Queensland) [8.0].  -  I refer to Division No. 850, item 01, Buildings, works, fittings and furniture, £1,620,000".

In that connexion, I bring to the attention of the Minister the continued financing of such public works from current revenue votes, a matter that I ' think is of great importance. In an answer given by the Minister this afternoon I understood him to say that during the last ten years no less than £1,300,000,000 had been spent from ordinary revenue from year to year on Commonwealth capital works. I think I can rely on my memory to say that an additional £700,000,000 or £800,000,000 has been expended from Commonwealth revenue to supplement housing schemes and public works in the States, so that a total of about £2,000,000,000 has been drawn from revenue and used for public capital works. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not intend to ask the Minister to engage in a full-dress debate of this subject to-might, because no doubt he will remind me at once that we had a full discussion on it about .eighteen months ago.

If the earnings of the people are to be taken by taxation and put into public ownership to the tune of £2,000,000,000 in a decade, that makes a substantial contribution to public ownership at the expense of private property. If the process, is continued indefinitely it will have an avalanche effect on our community.. </para><para>Recently, I mentioned the subsidiary question of how these matters are to be reconciled.

Apparently the policy is that officers of the Northern Territory Administration shall serve in the Territory for a minimum of two years. I am one of those who believe that it might be better, in the interests of the Territory and of the efficiency of the Administration, to increase the minimum period of service to three years. We know that some people who go to the Northern Territory find that they like the place and want to stay there for longer than two years, but there are others who go there and then decide that they want to leave as quickly as they can. The greater part of the first twelve months of service by such people is taken up with settling in, and the greater part of the second twelve months of service is taken up with thinking about leaving. I do not think that that tends to make people give of their best. For those reasons, I think it would be better if the minimum period of service were extended to three years. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In Division No.  751,  I refer also to General Services, item  07,  "Transport of stud stock to the Northern Territory - Subsidy ". The appropriation sought this year is  £15,000.  The appropriation last year was  £20,000,  almost all of which was spent. I think it is a pity that a reduction has been made this year, because this subsidy is one of the incentives that is given to people who are running stock in the Northern Territory. It is a very valuable incentive. Will the Minister tell me why there has been a reduction of  £5,000  this year? It may be on account of the drought; I do not know. I will be interested to hear his explanation. </para><para>I should like also to refer to the item relating to operational expenses for the Water Resources Branch. It is pleasing to see that this year the proposed vote for that purpose is  £187,000.  Last year  £140,000  was voted, of which over  £123,000  was spent. Apparently the financial arrangements for the sinking of bores in the Territory have been liberalized considerably. I understand that unless a bore produces water, the cost of the boring operation is not charged to the owner of the property concerned. That means that what are known as dud bores are not charged for. This must be a great help indeed, and I am very glad to see the increase. </para><para>I turn now to the item dealing with technical stores. Last year there was an appropriation of  £159,000  and the amount expended was only  £12,757.  This year  £46,700  is to be appropriated. The Minister may be able to enlighten me on this item, but I understand that the reason for the very large under-expenditure last year was that orders placed were not supplied during the financial year. This appears to be one of the great drawbacks to the development of the Territory - the time lag between ordering materials and getting those materials into the area where they are required. I appeal to people living in the capital cities to see if they can expedite the delivery of these orders. I suppose, after all, that people on the spot get greater preference, but that is entirely wrong. The people in the Territory are dependent on these things to a greater degree, possibly, than people in the south. It will mean much to the development of the north if we can get these stores and materials up there in something like reasonable time. That is not being done at present because of a variety of circumstances. I hope that the Minister will take note of what I am saying and that we will see an improvement in the delivery of technical stores. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1036</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8N</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TOOHEY, James</name><name role="display">Senator TOOHEY</name></talker><para>. -  T should like to ask the Minister two questions. The first concerns community activities. I see that last year  £20,000  was appropriated and  £19,988  expended. This year only £10,000 is to be appropriated. Probably there is  a  very good reason for the decrease. </para></talk.start><para>My second question relates to stores  and  material, particularly petrol, oil  and other  lubricants in respect of which £102,000 was appropriated last year but apparently only £19,000 was spent. This  year  it appears that 26,400 will be sufficient  to  meet the need. That is a tremendous  drop  from last year's appropriation, but again  no  doubt there is some reasonable explanation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1037</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> referred to appointments to the Public Service.

The reason for the estimated decrease in the value of claims to be received is that both the Alice Springs and Katherine sales were cancelled last year, and as a larger percentage of subsidy claims is received well after the event, it is expected that there will be a reduction in expenditure in the coming year. </para><para>In reply to the query about the Water Resources Branch, the main reasons for the increase of £63,000 over last year's expenditure are, first, that adequate and exhaustive ground water investigations are essential if the greater number of bores to be drilled in 1961-62 are not to contain an unacceptably high proportion of unsuccessful bores. The estimate is based on the number of boring rigs on hand, plus the rigs on order. Secondly, the hydrographic section will in 1961-62 have a greater number of installations to maintain resulting from this year's new constructions, and in addition further new stations will need to be built. Thirdly, the greater holding of plant in 1961-62, which will be operating to a maximum capacity, will demand greater expenditure of repairs and maintenance than was the case last year. There is an increase in the provision for unsuccessful boring. Under that item the appropriation is £46,700. There is an increase in the provision for payment of wages under all categories, particularly in respect to the manner of drilling rigs where the increased expenditure will be £11,000. Those figures appear to tell the story of increased activity in that field. </para><para>The third query was in relation to technical stores. The increase over the expenditure for 1960-61 is to increase stock holdings of commonly used items. Owing to the long supply line and the seasonal demand for stores, added to the fact that several welfare settlements cannot be reached by surface transport at times in the wet season, there is the necessity for large ordering of stores prior to and immediately after the wet. It is essential that stock holdings be maintained at a level where all demands can be satisfied within a reasonable period.

It appears to me to be fantastic that we should be paying concessions to Commonwealth Hostels Limited for hostels that are run by the head office here in Canberra. This is one of the things that the people who live in the Northern Territory are complaining about all the time. The Government transfers the control of something to people in Canberra who do not know the first thing about the Territory. Commonwealth Hostels Limited is a company that has been set up by this Government to run certain hostels. We do not know who is in the company because we do not receive a report from it. Apparently, a subsidy of £18,000 is made for tariff concessions. I ask the Minister what hostels are carried on by Commonwealth Hostels Limited in the Northern Territory.

The matter of the subsidy to be paid in 1961- 62 is still under discussion with the company, and at this stage it is not possible to make more than a tentative estimate when providing for a subsidy of £18,000, which is the amount that was paid in 1960-61.

The functions of the Mines Branch are the administration and development of mining, the giving of technical advice to mineowners and the operation of batteries. No provision has been made for the operation of the Maranboy battery, as there has been a decline in activities on that field. Provision is made for the operation of the battery now under construction at Mount Wells. The major part of the increase in provision, as compared with expenditure in 1960-61, is due to the expected opening of the new Mount Wells battery which, it is thought, will commence operating in the third quarter of this year. Also, the diamond drilling programme will be increased by the addition of a third drill in the latter half of the year. Outstanding commitments for drilling equipment carried forward from 1960-61 total £6,600, mainly in respect of diamond bits.

I should like the Minister to tell me what progress is being made in developing the buffalo-meat industry in the Northern Territory. A few years ago, we were exporting 80,000 to 100,000 buffalo hides a year to India for manufacture into belts. That avenue of <inline font-style="italic">export is now</inline> closed, but since then a market for buffalo meat has developed in Australia, and in countries close to Australia. We talk about the expenditure of £25,000,000 on roads to assist the beef industry, but it will take years to build those roads. Here we have at least 100,000 buffaloes a year available for slaughter for their meat. This industry would not be a doubtful proposition. Buffaloes, killed under proper veterinary inspection, are a valuable source of meat. The meat could be shipped abroad, although our near neighbours are not anxious to introduce pleuro-pneumonia into their countries. I would like to know what has been done to export buffalo meat. I know that buffaloes are killed by tranquilizers and that they are cut up on a plastic sheet spread on the ground. I know that the meat is taken to Darwin and exported from there. Much of the meat comes to Adelaide and finds its way into smallgoods. A valuable market for our buffalo meat exists in Hong Kong and elsewhere. We must ensure that the meat is subject to proper veterinary inspection. I believe that the export of buffalo meat could bring a good deal of revenue into the Northern Territory.

The Government proposes to appropriate this year only £52,000 under this division, but I feel that if Norfolk Island is worth keeping it is worth developing. The Administration is. to be congratulated on being able to carry on with a grant as small as £32,000. There is not a great deal of potential on the island for the development of primary or secondary industries, apart from the whaling commission and the growing of a little bean seed, but there does appear to be an opportunity for the development of the tourist industry. I should like to know what revenue accrues to the island from the tourist industry. I understand that New Zealanders visit the island more than Australians do. Norfolk Island is ideal for the development of a tourist industry. It is difficult as yet for private enterprise to do much about developing the tourist industry on the island. The first need is to build roads. That work may have to be done out of the grant to the Administration. I wonder whether the Government is prepared to approach the Australian National Travel Association and ask it to set up a small branch on the island in order to encourage tourists from Australia and abroad. It is an ideal place for tourists. The weather is good throughout the year and it is a beautiful spot. If one of the airlines could be persuaded to provide a regular weekly service to the island, instead of the present fortnightly service, that would help a good deal. </para></talk.start><para>I notice that an appropriation of £20,000 is sought for the restoration and maintenance of historical structures.

The island has not many basic export products. Through the years its export trade has depended upon a variety of things which have in turn found and lost popularity.  I  remember that in the 1920's, when Australian bananas were suffering from some form of blight, a very useful market for Norfolk Island bananas was developed in Australia, but when the Australian banana industry was rehabilitated that market was lost. For a while there was an effort to encourage the export of Norfolk Island pines, but I understand that the people of the island were averse to that trade being developed to a degree that would tend to denude the island of pines. The main export of the island at the moment is bean seed. Oddly enough, the islanders have to import foodstuffs which one would expect to be produced on the island. Eggs, for instance, are imported. It is true to say that a good deal of the island's export trade - probably the larger part of it from time to time - is with New Zealand. </para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline>referred to the possibility of developing the tourist trade and asked whether it would be possible for a weekly rather than a fortnightly air service to be provided. Until a few years ago Qantas Empire Airways Limited was paid a subsidy to provide a fortnightly service to the island.. The subsidy required was fairly substantial, although the figures escape me at the moment. I was looking at a document recently relating to the operation of this service, and I saw that it involved a. substantial loss. I know that the Norfolk Island Administration is keen to develop tourist traffic, to the island,, having regard to the fact that, the economy of the island, is not very soundly based. The Administration is currently exploring the possibility of developing that tourist traffic and has not. overlooked the assistance that would be. given in that, regard by more regular air services. An increase of the frequency of the air services would, however, involve a larger subsidy, and no decision has. yet been made in that matter. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline>referred also to the item relating to&gt; the restoration and maintenance of historical structures. She: is well aware, of course, of the old buildings' there. In recent years, they have: fallen into an even greater state of disrepair. The Minister and the Administration are very keen that those historical buildings shall be preserved in the state in which they now are, and £20,000 is sought for that purpose. This will not be the first, occasion on which money has been spent on restoring the historical buildings on Norfolk Island. I remember that about ten years ago the Minister sent an architect to the island to examine the condition of the buildings that remained, and subsequent to his visit a substantial amount was spent on restoration work. Nothing has been spent since then. This will be a reactivation of the programme. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1045</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ORMONDE, James</name><name role="display">Senator Ormonde</name></talker><para>- If, as a tourist intending to visit Norfolk Island, I did not want to fly, how would I get there? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1045</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>- You would go to Fiji and pick up a small' trading vessel there. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Proposed expenditure noted. </para><para class="block">Papua and New Guinea. </para><para>Proposed expenditure, £17,463,400. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator MATTNER</inline>(South Australia) [9.48J. - The appropriation sought this year in respect of Papua and New Guinea is £17,465,400;.

I think the honorable senator has done well to point to this aspect of the development of the Territory, because, as he says, what we are doing in regard to education in New Guinea is frequently not understood overseas. The expansion of education is reflected in an increase of the operational expenditure from £2,040,285 in 1960-61 to a proposed expenditure of £2,432,000 this year. In addition, provision has been made under capital works expenditure for £954,700 to be spent on school buildings and school residences during the year. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Education services are provided for Europeans, Asians, mixed-blood people and native people. Education for the native people is, however, the major commitment. Schooling is basic to the social, economic and political advancement of these people.

In particular the missions provide for most of the elementary village education, but at the end of the last financial year there were 21 post-primary and secondary schools be ing conducted by the missions catering for 851 pupils. Further assistance will be provided to the missions for the establishment and operation of teacher-training institutions and associated schools through the extension of the loans scheme which previously applied for the establishment of hostels. I think those facts will indicate to the honorable senator not only the work that is being done but also the importance which the Administration attaches to schooling. It will indicate that active measures are being taken by the Administration to fulfil the need. </para><para>Proposed expenditure noted. </para><para>Proposed expenditure - Papua and New Guinea - Capital Works and Services, £531,000; Cocos (Keeling) Islands, £43,500; Cocos (Keeling) Islands - Capital Works and Services, £8,000; Christmas Island, £100- noted. </para><para class="block">Repatriation Department. </para><para>Proposed expenditure, £98,751,000. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WALTER</inline>COOPER (Queensland) [9.55].  -  I should like to say a few words on the proposed expenditure of this department. I base my remarks on the item dealing with salaries and allowances in Division No. 671. I should like to sound a note of warning about the difficulty of obtaining staff, particularly specialized staff, in the Repatriation Department. The staff required is chiefly in the medical section and is associated with types of work such as pathology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work. I have visited the various States and have discussed staffing matters. I have found that the States offer far greater remuneration to specialists of the type I have mentioned than does the Commonwealth Public Service Board. During my period as Minister, I know that the department lost very valuable medical men, and others of the type I have mentioned, because it was not paying salaries as high as those offered to such personnel by the various States. </para><para>In the case of social workers, the Repatriation Department is paying a maximum salary of £1,500 a year, whereas the States offer £300 a year more than that. You cannot expect people to remain in the department just for the sheer love of the work when they are being offered higher salaries to transfer to the States. There is no doubt that some of the best types of employees in the Repatriation Department have found their way to the States, and I do not think they can be blamed. At one time the position was reversed. Commonwealth departments paid higher remunerations than were paid by the States, but at present the States are offering a higher remuneration 'than that offered by Commonwealth departments. I think that the Public Service Board should do something about this problem before it is too late. People of the type I have mentioned cannot be trained in a year or so. The work they are doing is most important and requires years of training. This is especially so in the case of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and social workers. The skill of these people is important for the welfare of the patients. </para><para>I repeat my hope that the Commonwealth Public Service Board will look into the matter and do something to ensure that the Repatriation Department does not lose the cream of those engaged in the classes of work I have mentioned. It is some years before they become efficient, and not everybody can do this type of work. This work is most important to the patients, who are the responsibility of the Repatriation Department. I hope that the Public Service Board will investigate this matter and ensure at least that the present staff are retained. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1047</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KSN</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MARRIOTT, John</name><name role="display">Senator MARRIOTT</name></talker><para>. - I feel rather privileged to be able to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper in the debate on these Estimates. We all know that he had a record term of office as Minister for Repatriation until he resigned. My complaint is that this year there seems to be a lack of action by the department in making known to ex-servicemen the amendments to the act and regulations. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper will agree that, during his period of office, soon after the amending bill became law advertisements setting out the amendments were published in the newspapers. That is very important to people in country towns throughout Australia. We know that in the capital cities there are officers of the Repatriation Department to whom ex-servicemen can apply; but our experience in Tasmania is that in towns other than the capital city an inquiring ex-serviceman goes to the local sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia to obtain information. At this stage I cannot obtain a copy of the recent amendments to the act and regulations in order to let R.S.L. subbranches in Tasmania know what they are. I believe that the department should follow its previous policy. If my memory serves me rightly, the department published in the press what the amendments were and how they affected ex-servicemen. </para></talk.start><para>We in this Parliament and the Government must realize that at the present time there appears to be a boycott of the National Parliament by the main metropolitan newspapers in Australia. Very little information has gone out to the Australian people through the metropolitan press during this session of the Parliament. In the previous session information on happenings in and decisions by this Parliament were published, but it is not being published now. I believe that the Government has to wake up to that fact and take action to tell the people what it has decided to do for the taxpayers, including ex-servicemen. I hope that the department will take note of my request that it make available through the press details of the amendments to the Repatriation Act and the regulations under that act. </para><para>The other matter on which I wish to speak is the limb factories conducted by the Repatriation Department. Those factories lead Australia in the provision of artificial limbs. I believe that they are doing an amazing work, not only for ex-servicemen, but also for other people who come within the regulations and are able to obtain artificial limbs through the Repatriation Department. When a government department is the leader in such a field, and is really working outside its own sphere, I believe it should recoup some of its expenses. I should like the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> and the department to investigate the charges made to people, other than ex-service men and women, who are privileged to go to limb factories run by the department for the provision, maintenance and repair of artificial limbs. From my experience, I believe that the charges are too 'high -and that the department may be making a profit which it should not be making from this activity. The work is of the highest standard. </para><para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland) [10.6]. - I refer to Division No. 671, sub-division 2, item 06 - Payment for services of Registrars, Police and officers of Postmaster-General's Department.

That means that /this year's appropriation is quite a few thousand pounds less than last year's expenditure. I can only assume that there has been a reduction in the number of temporary and casual employees. I should like an explanation of that item from the Minister. Haying regard to the need for streamlining many of the activities of the Repatriation Department, one would imagine that there would be an increase rather than a reduction in the number of employees. </para></talk.start><para>I also refer to Division No. 673, item 01 - Small business loans. This year, the estimate is £5,000. Last year, the appropriation was £15,000, of which only £6,724 was expended. If the Minister is able to give an explanation of the reduction from last year's appropriation and expenditure to this year's appropriation, T should like to hear it. It appears to me that unfortunately this reduction is part of a pattern that we are witnessing throughout Australia at the present time. I refer to the take-overs which are forcing small business people out of business. One is tempted to imagine that this is par,t of that unfortunate plan that is developing .throughout Australia. I suppose it may be said that with the passing of years the number of applications for small business loans is not as great as it was; but I do not think that would account for the large reduction in the appropriation for this item.

He does well to point to the difficulties that the department experiences in respect of recruitment of medical officers. </para></talk.start><para>There are shortages in the medical technologist group, despite widespread advertising and considerable discussions and action jointly with the Public Service Board. Causes are general shortages in the community and certain disparities between Commonwealth salary rates and the rates in some States. Vacancies for pathological technicians and social workers are general, and other categories such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and dietitians, are more acutely short in some States. Action taken by the department includes systematic comparison with rates approved by State authorities and other hospitals. The following action has been approved by the Public Service Board. In respect of pharmacists in Victoria, a special allowance of £220 per annum is made, following comparable State rises, to bring Commonwealth remuneration into line. A similar approach has been made for Western Australia. In respect of other categories in that State, where shortages are very acute, special allowances, or the provision of higher tentative classifications, have been approved. These have been partially successful. In regard to pathological technicians, more technicianintraining positions have been provided, and a review of the grading structure has been made with a view to improving it. The disturbing number of vacancies for social workers has been discussed with the Public Service Board. Currently, a review oi State rates is in hand, which is aimed at remedying disparities, and a submission will shortly be made to the board. The department has joined the Department of Social Services in a social worker cadet scheme. </para><para>A cadetship scheme for pharmacists has been approved and arrangements are being examined, whereby students of the Victorian College of Pharmacy could do part of their training at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg. Generally, as part of its industrial programme, the department is reviewing the structure of all the medical technological groups, and will continue to take up with the Public Service Board areas where disparities are occurring. This will indicate to the committee that the department is actively pursuing the matter of these discrepancies, in an endeavour to rectify the position. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline>said that information in connexion with recent increases in repatriation pensions was not widely known. Indeed, he implied that sections of the community, to wit, some branches of the Returned Servicemen's League, were having difficulty in getting the information. I regret this most sincerely. I understand that advertising has taken place and that through public advertisements variations in rates have been notified. The date on which new rates will apply has also been notified. However, I am sure that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Osborne,</inline> will be as concerned as I am if the position is that these matters have not been brought to the notice  of  the public by sufficiently intensive public relations. I  shall certainly  refer to him the comments made by  the  honorable senator. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline>also referred to limb' factories and to the excellent craftsmanship which was very evident. I agree with him. The limb factories of the department, which were established and developed under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper, have earned for themselves a very high reputation. It is truethat their products are sought by all people who have need of these appliances. It has not been brought to my notice that the charges, made to people who are not beneficiaries under the Repatriation Act are excessive. I always understood that the charges were quite realistic, but in view of what has been said I shall see that this matter, too, is brought to the notice of my colleague. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>Annabelle Rankin referred; to payments for the services of registrars, police and officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, and asked for explanations of the reduction of about £105,000 in the appropriation.

The replacements  of"  temporary officers by permanent officers and the abolition of some positions account for the difference. Predominantly, this has been, brought about by a transfer to the permanent staff of men previously in temporary employment. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> will agree that this is a move in the right direction. He also sought information., on the decrease in the provision for small business loans. I am sure that he had a bit of fun with the committee by suggesting certain reasons for this decrease; and finally,, of course, he came out with the logical explanation that as the years go by claimsare fewer. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1049</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K4S</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SANDFORD, Charles Walter</name><name role="display">Senator Sandford</name></talker><para>-  I did not give the explanation.

Last year the appropriation was £61,000. I also refer to item 07, " Fares and expenses of war pensioners under review, £50,000 ". Is it possible for assistance to be given, from either of those proposed votes, to ex-servicemen who are seeking to obtain pensions and to comply with the onus of proof provisions of the Repatriation Act? No doubt other honorable senators know, as I do, of the stereotyped answer that is often given to ex-servicemen in such cases. They are told that until fresh evidence is presented their claims for repatriation pensions cannot be reconsidered. </para></talk.start><para>I join very happily in commending <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurman, Mr. Robson</inline> and the other members of the Repatriation Commission on their most sympathetic and helpful attitude to applicants for benefits and to those who represent them. Nevertheless, I think it is time that we provided assistance for ex-servicemen to discharge the onus of proof. As we know, some ex-servicemen ultimately are successful in doing so and are granted pensions, but others cannot afford to obtain the best medical advice, although considerable doubt may exist as to whether their disabilities were war caused. I know of a man who had three medical opinions which indicated that the cause of his disability was not known. He could not prove that the disability was war caused, although there was nothing in his civil life that could have contributed to it. The unfortunate individual gradually became poorer and poorer. He was receiving a pension in respect of certain disabilities which had been accepted as war caused, but the pension was not sufficient to maintain him. He was obliged to give up work entirely. He had had an operation on his head for the removal of a suspected tumour, which was not found to exist. Although he could not prove that the disability was war caused he could not prove that it had been caused in any other way, although the only occas- sion when he had suffered illness was when he was serving in the forces.  His  condition progressively deteriorated until he reached the stage where, as a comparatively young man of less than 60 years of age, he was obliged to relinquish work altogether. </para><para>Where an ex-serviceman's case has been rejected by a repatriation tribunal, is it possible for assistance to be given to him to enable an examination by an independent specialist to be made? I point out that in Division No. 677  -  Miscellaneous - item 06 relates to assistance under special circumstances to ex-service personnel or their dependants. The proposed vote is a very small one. This year, the amount is £300. Last year the appropriation was £200 and expenditure £177. I take it that it covers ex gratia payments. I suggest that an ex-serviceman who is in indigent circumstances and is trying to prove that his disability was war caused should be entitled to assistance from the Repatriation Department in obtaining the best possible medical opinion, whether on the recommendation of the Returned Soldiers League or of responsible persons who have examined his case. I know that the doctors have done quite a good job in this field. Many specialists take such cases for compassionate reasons and go to a lot of trouble to try to establish an ex-serviceman's eligibility for pension benefits. In many instances, they do so for nothing. Can the Minister say whether, under any of the proposed votes that we are discussing, assistance of the kind I have mentioned can be provided? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1050</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8N</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TOOHEY, James</name><name role="display">Senator TOOHEY</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> has referred to the allocation of £15,000 last year for the small loans section and expenditure of only £6,724.

I should like the Minister to explain why this year's appropriation is so much greater than last year's. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1052</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline> addressed his remarks to the onus of proof.

I have never found the officers of the department to be other than completely understanding and helpful. When a case fails because the onus of proof has not ;been discharged, it cannot be said that it has failed because of a lack of understanding or sympathy at any level within the department or on the part of the tribunal concerned. I know the type of case to which the honorable senator refers - a man going at long last to an appeal tribunal, having his appeal rejected, still not being well, still doubtful and wanting to get back before an appeal board. What happens? Everything revolves around the provision of new evidence. It has been my experience that in these most difficult cases, which are by that time minutely known to the officers of the department, where an applicant comes along and says he believes that new evidence can be presented, at all levels of the department the greatest assistance is extended to him to see that the new evidence is made available to the tribunal. Where the tribunal agrees that new evidence may exist, the payment is met by the Repatriation Department. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline> was speaking, I took the opportunity of conferring with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper. Nobody would know better than he whether the national executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia had made representations about the onus-of-proof clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper told me that at the national executive level no representations have been made on this point. The national executive expresses general satisfaction in this matter while acknowledging, as anybody must, that there are a few cases that will always remain problem cases and against which, in the last analysis, there must be a question mark. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1052</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ORMONDE, James</name><name role="display">Senator Ormonde</name></talker><para>asked, whether applicants were aware of the avenues available to them to have their cases properly presented to a tribunal.

In regard to item  02,  it is anticipated that payment of pensions by punchcard cheques will be operative in all States during the year. It is estimated that the purchase and hire of machines and the purchase of stationery will result in an increased expenditure of about  £39,000.  In regard to item  03,  postage on punch-card cheques will amount to  £85,000  and increased telephone charges will amount to a mere  £1,750.  In relation to item  04,  it is estimated that expenditure will increase  by  about  £12,000.  Charges for the cleaning of central office and branch offices in Victoria and South Australia, which is now performed by private contractors, will account for an increase of  £13,400,  from which must be deducted the sum of  £1,200  representing savings on cleaning materials. That leaves a net increase of some  £12,200. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1053</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HANNAFORD, Douglas</name><name role="display">Senator Hannaford</name></talker><para>-  I  am afraid the  Minister has not touched on the  matters  that I raised.

I think the Minister told us a few minutes ago of the amount that has been allocated in this financial year for work on the psychiatric ward in that hospital.

We must give credit to the members of the staff of the Springbank hospital for the splendid work they have done in helping to treat these difficult cases. I am sure that that applies to the staffs of all repatriation hospitals throughout Australia. The staff at the Springbank hospital has been labouring under difficulties for a number of years, and during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper's term as Minister for Repatriation requests were made by honorable senators on both sides, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner,</inline> for a new psychiatric ward to be provided. I am glad that at last the Government has seen fit to make provision for work on that ward to be started. Some of the present hospital buildings are many years old. When you are dealing with psychiatric cases, you are dealing with some of the most difficult cases, and up-to-date facilities for treatment are needed. The provision of this psychiatric ward at the Springbank hospital is long overdue. I do not wish to ask any questions of the Minister. I rose mainly to endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper and to express my pleasure at the information that work on this ward will proceed, so that before very many years have passed there will  be  an up-to-date psychiatric ward at Springbank. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1054</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZY</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Civil Aviation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PALTRIDGE, Shane</name><name role="display">Senator PALTRIDGE</name></talker><para>. -  As has been anticipated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> and others, and as I think I said earlier, provision is being made this year for the appropriation of £195,000 for the building of a psychiatric ward at the Springbank hospital.
