<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee earlier this year considered the first set of regulations made under this Act and detected a number of apparent deficiencies. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, the Hon. Peter Staples, MP, then helpfully undertook to amend the regulations to meet the concerns of the Committee. However, the regulations were subsequently disallowed by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present regulations are therefore the second set of principal regulations made this year under the Therapeutic Goods Act. These present regulations include almost all the considerable changes suggested by the Committee. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for his cooperation. Nevertheless, there is one undertaking which does not appear to be included. This was to limit the power of delegation of the Secretary to waive or reduce fees to senior executive officers of the Department. At present this power may inappropriately be delegated to any officer of the Department, no matter how junior.</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Committee I shall write to the Minister seeking clarification. Owing to the efforts of the Committee any adverse exercise of the discretion in respect of fees is now subject to Administrative Appeals Tribunal review. However, there is still the apparent problem of junior officers having the power to waive unlimited amounts of Commonwealth revenue.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance Amendment Bill contains amendments to section 37 of the Insurance Act 1973. These amendments are of a straightforward and noncontentious nature, and are required to avoid potential difficulties which may arise as a consequence of the monetary limit currently specified in that section. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 37 of the Insurance Act provides that insurers whose activities are confined to conducting insurance business with limited classes of persons (generally only members or employees of a company or a particular trade, industry or profession) and whose annual premiums do not exceed $500,000 may be exempted from certain provisions of the Act. Such exemptions are principally concerned with a reduced statutory reporting requirement and, consequently, less resources are required by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to supervise these companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The specified limit on annual premiums was increased to $500,000 with effect from 19 January 1984. Since then, the real value of this amount has been gradually eroded to the extent that one of the insurers operating with a restricted authority under section 37 may shortly exceed the limit. Accordingly, this amendment proposes an increase in the limit on annual premiums these insurers may receive, from $500,000 to $750,000. The exemption granted to the insurer currently approaching the limit is due for review at the end of this year, and passage of the amendment will enable the Treasurer to give consideration to granting a further exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>To facilitate further routine adjustments that may need to be effected to this limit, the Bill also provides that any future increases in the limit on annual premiums specified in section 37 may be effected by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Insurance Act will result in minor indirect administrative savings. There will be no increased costs to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Insurance Amendment Bill 1990 to the Senate, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Australian War Memorial Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 448 and made under the Australian War Memorial Act 1980, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has taken the decision to oppose the Government regulations which allow for an entry fee to be levied at the Australian War Memorial as a matter of principle. I notice that in the House of Representatives yesterday it was suggested that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was rolled by the Party room on this issue. Let me make it quite clear: the Leader led discussion on the issue in the shadow Ministry on Monday, after which a recommendation to oppose the fees was made to the Party meeting on Tuesday. This was wholeheartedly endorsed and let that be the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns that the Opposition has had with respect to the introduction of entry fees at the Memorial have been on the public record for some time. I would like to remind honourable senators of a speech I made in this chamber on 17 December. It is worth re-examining this speech. For instance, at the time I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision that was announced . . . to charge for admission gives the Opposition some major concerns. We accept generally the principle of user pays. But in this case there are very real concerns that we are turning something which is a memorial to our dead into just another museum. </PARA>
<PARA>I also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I urge the Memorial Council to think again. It has no guarantee of funding. It is not giving proper access to the men and women who have fought for this country or the people who have given to the Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA>A few days later I sent a copy of that speech to the Chairman of the Memorial. The disallowance motion being debated here today should therefore come as no surprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the decision of the Memorial Council regarding fees was announced publicly on 23 November, I have had ongoing correspondence with the Chairman of the War Memorial Council, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire. The information received from Dame Beryl has been most unsatisfactory in my view. Dame Beryl had indicated that approximately $1m was expected to be raised each year as a result of the introduction of an entry fee. She failed to make clear whether this was gross or net income. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter sent to Dr Hewson in the first week of February, Dame Beryl indicated that the admission charges would generate $750,000. In just two months, therefore, projected income had declined by a quarter of a million dollars. Once again, there was no indication as to whether this referred to gross or net income. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter I received dated 17 January, Dame Beryl suggested that there had been no discernible difference in the number of people visiting the Memorial in the first two weeks of January. However, sources from within the Memorial have suggested that visitor numbers have in fact fallen quite substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been reported to me that in the first two weeks of 1990, approximately 59,000 visitors passed through the Memorial. In the first two weeks of this year this figure dropped to 44,000. This represents a downturn of approximately 25 per cent. Of course, interpretation of the downturn must be cautious. With no internal validity, it is difficult to say clearly what has caused this downturn. For instance, current economic conditions almost certainly have had some impact on tourist numbers. In reality, it is likely that a combination of factors is responsible for the decline, of which the introduction of a fee would be one. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 44,000 people who visited in that first couple of weeks, I am informed that numbers of people visited the commemorative wall in the centre of the Memorial and then turn on their heel and left rather than go into the galleries. Nevertheless, it can unequivocally be said that the net revenue from these fees would not have been large nor, indeed, even able to be forecast with any certainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Memorial says that it has so far raised $90,000. This has occurred in the first six weeks of 1991 which, I remind the Senate, is the peak tourist period of the year. On this basis it could achieve a net revenue of $750,000 over a full year. But quite clearly, it is most unlikely. Anybody in the tourist industry who tried to undertake projections of revenue based on the best period of the year would be destined to go out of business pretty smartly. </PARA>
<PARA> Also of concern to the Opposition has been the somewhat haphazard and inconsistent implementation of the fees. Ex- service organisations from around the country have expressed their disappointment at the new arrangements which mean that a veteran is required to pay for a visit to an institution whose role it is to commemorate those who have fought and died for our country. I am sure honourable senators would also have received letters from people who have said that veterans of Australia have paid for this Memorial in their blood and in their sacrifice; widows have paid in the loss of their loved ones- does it have to be paid for again?</PARA>
<PARA> Dame Beryl has claimed that those who have donated valuable personal effects and memorabilia-unlike veterans-are admitted free. It is not made clear by Dame Beryl how the word `valuable' should be interpreted. Many people have given items of sentimental value of a highly personal nature. Apparently it is intended that they should queue up to explain their status to possibly gain free entry. Students under 25 automatically receive free entry, yet the men and women who fought for this country are not entitled to that. They have to queue up to claim their status in order to get concessional entry. There is also no clear way of determining who is a veteran. In fact, the question of whether someone is a veteran has been determined by the honour system.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my speech in the Senate on 17 December, we generally accept the principle of user pay. Particularly in times of fiscal restraint, every dollar of expenditure must be scrutinised, although individual claims must necessarily be assessed on their merits. The real issue here is not about potential revenue gains, whatever they may turn out to be, but what the War Memorial signifies and how our national objectives can best be served. It is in this context that we believe that the introduction of an entry fee to the Memorial runs counter to the ideals that inspire it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was Senator McLean who this week described the decision as crass. I am not sure whether I am quoting him accurately, but, certainly, his sentiments were to that effect. He expressed it with very strong feeling, which I support. The War Memorial is a national institution of deep symbolic value to the Australian people and I hope and expect that it will remain so for generations to come. We would not want any Australian to be deterred or prevented from visiting the Memorial because of the existence of a fee. If additional funds are needed to help with the Memorial then there are other options which we urge the Government and the Council to consider and to discuss with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, consideration could be given to the introduction of admission fees at separate museum annexes such as the proposed technology pavilion, for which the Government has already provided the first $5m. Also, it may be that fees could be charged for tourist buses or the use of guides. A levy could be collected from those wishing to use the Memorial's car parking facilities. All of those are acceptable ways of raising additional revenue. Revenue savings may also be possible in the area of administration. I have received information from a variety of sources which suggests that the Memorial Council should be looking at improving its management practices. We urge the Council, particularly at a time when expenditure restraint is called for, to re-examine its own management practices to eliminate possible areas of waste and duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Tate, will be proposing to the Senate that the question of fees should be referred to a Senate committee for investigation. I can see this only as a delaying tactic. If the purpose of that is to enable the War Memorial to explain its position, then it is unnecessary because the Chairman of the Council, in correspondence with me over the last two months, has quite clearly attempted to justify the decision. She has also written to newspapers explaining the basis of the Council's decision. If any further explanations were needed, it was always open to the War Memorial Council Director or Chairman to seek an appointment with me as the relevant shadow Minister. They made no attempt to do so and all communications have been on my initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> In one of her letters to me, Dame Beryl claimed that the question of charging admission to the Memorial has been on the agenda of Memorial boards and councils since the early 1920s. She also said that the issue has been freely debated without any automatic or clear cut decision one way or the other. Information available to me suggests that this is not entirely accurate and that on a number of occasions over the last 15 years, whenever the question of charges was discussed, a firm decision was taken to reject the proposal, and rightly so.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the Opposition is happy to consult with the War Memorial on any alternative proposals for raising revenue, but a committee is not the solution. Dame Beryl has expressed, in correspondence with me, that all political parties are supportive of the need to maintain funding at current levels. She has also said that the funds raised by the entry fee were to help with the acquisition, preservation, exhibition, education and public access programs. She also explained that the Memorial had been seeking and obtaining private sector sponsorship of projects. That is an important avenue of support which needs to be fully utilised. I believe much more can be done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to basics, it is absolutely vital that the Parliament speak clearly, once and for all, on the issue of fees at the Australian War Memorial. We reject them utterly. That has to be the message we give by our decision here today. Any proposal for a committee simply clouds the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition is opposed to the imposition of an entry fee at the Australian War Memorial because we believe that the Memorial is a national institution of deep symbolic value for the Australian people and should remain so for the generations of Australians who will follow. This disallowance motion recognises the importance of these sentiments. Therefore, I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Government to oppose this disallowance motion and I do so while speaking as the Minister in this chamber representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Ben Humphreys. We are not talking about a decision of government; it is a decision of the distinguished Council of the Australian War Memorial. I believe that needs some emphasis and it would explain some of the course of action which has been alluded to by Senator Newman, although I have, after consultation with the Australian Democrats through Senator Paul McLean, modified the proposal I spoke to Senator Newman about just before coming into the chamber. I think the Clerk has arranged for my foreshadowed motion to be circulated to honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the Council is a body of distinguished persons, appointed for the contributions they make to the furtherance of the Memorial's objectives. We know that they are distinguished war veterans, persons with service histories, the current chiefs of the defence forces and former junior Legatees. We are talking about a council which has come to a unanimous decision that in order to supplement the funds available for the War Memorial and its activities an entrance fee should be levied in respect of certain areas of the War Memorial complex. That needs more emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the formal commemorative areas such as the Roll of Honour, the courtyard, the cloisters, the Hall of Memory, all those areas which have a sacred aura and are dedicated in a special way to the memory of those who have fallen in the service of Australia in the various armed forces, have been designated as free, and quite rightly so. All Australians and all overseas visitors can spend some meditative time in those more sacred areas of the Memorial, without having to pay some fee, in order to reflect upon the supreme sacrifice of those who are honoured in those particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA> On the major commemorative days, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, all people would be entitled to enter any area of the War Memorial free of charge. Again, children and students would be entitled to enter any part of the Memorial free of charge because of its educative value. The formation of values and the providing of the history of Australia's commitment to various armed conflicts, all of these matters so essential for the better understanding by younger generations of Australians of our history, led the Council of the Australian War Memorial to decide that youngsters ought to be able to enter the War Memorial free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about the levying of the fee in respect of areas of exhibits which do not have that particularly sacred aura, if you like, and then only in respect of adults visiting those particular exhibits. As I understand Senator Newman, she was proposing that some annexes be able to be visited on the payment of a fee. So she, herself, does not preclude the possibility of fees being charged in respect of the visit to some areas of the War Memorial in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we ought to emphasise that it was the Opposition, when in government in 1980 and when Mr Ellicott was the Minister for Home Affairs, which introduced the provision in the Australian War Memorial Act 1980, section 42, which permits the fixing of charges for entry on to any land or into any building owned by or under control of the Australian War Memorial. So it was the Liberal-National Party coalition Government in 1980 which thought that the Parliament ought to provide for the possibility of the Council coming to the decision which it did last year. In other words, it was the present Opposition when in government which persuaded the Parliament to make this particular enabling provision. The Council of the War Memorial had every reason to think that it was fulfilling a function which had been conferred on it by the Liberal and National parties when in government. Therefore, I guess Council members were totally astonished at the reaction, which was manufactured by Senator Newman, amongst others, when the fee was actually levied. </PARA>
<PARA> The assurances that backed up that general expectation of support from the Opposition parties, which have been referred to in the press recently, I believe, were considerations which swayed the Council so that a unanimous decision was taken by members of that Council only on the basis-as they understood it and as conveyed to them by their distinguished chairperson, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire-that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) had signified their support for the levying of that particular fee. It was only on that basis that the unanimous decision of the Council was forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Opposition has acted as honourably as it should have in this regard--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman speaks of the moneys that might be received from admission charges. It is true that there has been some decline in the amounts that have been received, and it is not clear precisely what has led to that shortfall in expectations. Except for generally speaking, of course, the fact is that with the decline in the tourist trade experienced throughout Australia in this time of depressed economic activity, certain expectations as to the numbers of tourists passing through Canberra, and particularly the War Memorial, have not been fulfilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I believe that a considerable amount of money might have been expected to be raised by this particular charge fee and now it will not be available for the Council of the War Memorial to undertake the tasks which it considered to be important. </PARA>
<PARA> What had been intended, of course, was that the War Memorial would be able to apply the moneys to securing and preserving for many years the materials and the artefacts that are our military history and heritage, including famous national relics, such as the Gallipoli landing boats that are seen only rarely. These are the materials and artefacts which are the essential foundations of the Memorial's programs to educate younger generations of Australians about the impact of war on our people and our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian War Memorial Council took a very difficult decision, but a very justifiable decision, in determining that this supplement to its funds was an essential part of building up sufficient moneys to enable it to maintain the finest possible tribute to the nation's war debt and the sacrifices of our service men and women. It may be that my advocacy is not adequate to the task, and that is why I thought it would be useful for the Senate to have the benefit of a short discussion before a relevant Senate committee of the issues involved relating to this particular regime of charging proposed by the Council of the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to outline my understanding of the Council's decision, but I may not have done justice to its cause. I would be distressed personally if it felt that I had not sufficiently canvassed the considerations which led to its decision. I think that the course of its deliberations perhaps could be usefully outlined to the Senate through the services of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Democrats have indicated that they want the passage of the disallowance motion to go ahead. They want the regulations to be disallowed today rather than have the regulations referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which was the original suggestion I put to Senator Newman earlier this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the decision by the Democrats not to support the referral of the regulation to the Committee, I will be seeking leave, after the disallowance has been achieved, to move a motion in the terms that have been circulated; namely, to allow the issues arising from the making of the regulations to be referred to the Committee. I think that this will give the Senate an opportunity to be better apprised of the considerations which led to the deliberations of the Council and the way that led to its conclusion and its decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It may also give the Australian War Memorial an opportunity to understand better the mood of the Senate in relation to this matter and what might be acceptable. I found it astonishing that Senator Newman, for example, should say in her rhetorical flourish at the end that the Parliament needs to speak clearly. Of any proposal to charge fees, she said, `We reject them utterly'. Yet, as I understand it, Senator Newman has circulated a press release which, amongst other things, says that she would approve or be prepared to support a fee being paid by tourist buses, for example, which, of course, the operators would then pass on to the passengers, to those tourists who visit the War Memorial. In fact, it would end up being a per head fee on those tourists who happen to visit the Memorial via the services of a tourist bus operator rather than perhaps in a hire car or by private transport. </PARA>
<PARA> So some tourists would end up paying a fee under Senator Newman's proposal. What is more, it would be a fee which would be in relation to their visit to the whole of the War Memorial and not simply in relation to the annexes showing various exhibits, which is what the War Memorial Council intends by its particular proposal excluding, as I say, any fee for visiting the more sacred areas: the Roll of Honour, the courtyard and so on. I believe that this particular ambiguity or lack of clarity in the Opposition's position in relation to the levying of fees for visits to the War Memorial is a matter which could also be usefully looked at in a short inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I will be recommending that to the Senate when the regulation is disallowed, as it apparently will be shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> I do believe that we have a situation where a most distinguished body of Australians has deliberated on this matter and come to a unanimous decision that a fee ought to be levied for entrance to certain exhibition galleries of the Australian War Memorial. I believe they were very sensitive indeed to the claims that the areas which are those for more meditative moments-as we honour the dead and commemorate the sacrifices of those who have served Australia in the armed forces-should be preserved for free access. But they have made decisions which would enable the Council of the War Memorial to further the other major task of the Memorial; that is, to exhibit the memorabilia and the artefacts which have been gathered so painstakingly and which ought to be displayed in a fitting manner as a tribute to the service of Australians overseas and as an educative part of the formation, particularly, of generations of younger Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to commend the regulations to the Senate. I believe that they ought be allowed to stand. I believe that, in doing so, we would be doing the right thing by the Memorial and, in particular, we would be passing a vote of confidence in the integrity and the care with which the members of the Council have undertaken their very onerous statutory duties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, obviously, to support the disallowance of these regulations that would impose an entrance fee at the Australian War Memorial. I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that, from the very moment that this proposal became public, the Australian Democrats expressed their opposition to it. Indeed, as Senator Newman has said, I described it as crass commercialism of the worst kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We stated our position as being quite simple in principle-that taxpayers fund wars and we believe that taxpayers should fund the memorial to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in those wars. We were disheartened to find that the Opposition was reluctant to support that position initially. We know, and are grateful for the fact, that finally that support has been forthcoming after intense lobbying from the veterans community. I know that that lobbying has been intense because they have lobbied me intensely and, in doing so, have explained to me that they have had intense negotiations with both the Council and with members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I also know that Senator Newman's commitment to her position was a real one and a very early one. Unfortunately, she did not win the support of her party room immediately, nor did she win the support of her Leader immediately. I have it on good information that it was not an easy cause to be won on the Opposition side. I can understand that because the Opposition supports privatisation as an essential principle and it must have found some conflict in terms of its fundamental philosophical position about privatisation and this suggestion of crass commercialism in relation to the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take long in making my remarks, Madam Acting Deputy President. I accept the acknowledgment of the fact by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) that the War Memorial Council is indeed a group of very distinguished Australians-very distinguished indeed. There is no denying that. But even a distinguished group of Australians unanimously can arrive at a bad decision. I believe it was a lack of their consultation with the veterans community which led them into this bad decision, because the reaction within that community has been very strong indeed. They have found the suggestion of commercialising the War Memorial as utterly unacceptable and they have reacted strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> I think they were even more deeply offended by the fact that Dame Beryl Beaurepaire actually described some of the distinguished members of the veterans community as `fanatics' in expressing that resentment. I think that decision was unfortunate, and the manner and the words with which an attempt was made to justify it were equally unfortunate. I quote from one of those `fanatics', Major General John Whitelaw, who wrote a superb letter to the Canberra Times on 3 February. I would like to read that letter to the Senate because I think it expresses superbly the feelings of the veterans community. It is under the heading of `A tomb most glorious'; it was received on 29 January and published on 3 February. The letter is over the signature of Major General John Whitelaw, Red Hill, and it reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Sparked by controversy about the charges now being levied for entrance to the Australian War Memorial, I consulted my copy of the Guide to the Australian War Memorial (2nd Edition, June 1942). The first edition of this handsome little work was produced for the opening, in 1941. </PARA>
<PARA> I was taken with the quotation on the front piece:</PARA>
<PARA> ``They gave their lives. For that public gift they received a praise which never ages and a tomb most glorious-not so much the tomb in which they lie, but that in which their fame survives, to be remembered forever when occasion comes for word or deed . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA> Also I was impressed by the two opening paragraphs, which show with absolute clarity the nature of the AWM as a shrine in toto: in a spiritual sense the many elements of the AWM and its environs are indivisible. Read them:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Memorial to the Australians who died in the two Great Wars consists of the national collection of war relics and the building in which it is preserved. The collection includes the documentary records of the Australian fighting forces, and the pictures, photographs, dioramas, and material relics in which their story is enshrined. The gathering of these relics began on the battlefield and the decision that they should become part of Australia's memorial was made by the Commonwealth Government on a suggestion emanating from the front. </PARA>
<PARA> Conceived on the battle front, born amid the thunder of the guns at Bullecourt, the Memorial has been raised by the living members of the Australian forces to their former mates. Thus this national collection is unique in that it constitutes not a general museum portraying war, much less glorifying it, but a memorial conceived, founded and, from first to last, worked for by Australia's soldiers, sailors and airmen.''</PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of entrance charges shows the present council does not accept the conception of the memorial suggested by these gallant men in 1917, and subscribed to by the tens of thousands of veterans throughout our land. The council should be replaced by one which will re-establish our memorial as an enduring ``tomb most glorious''. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a superb statement of the intention of those who proposed the Memorial in the first place and of the Government that endorsed it and undertook to fund it, and it is a superb statement of the resentment that is felt throughout the veterans community at large-by more than a `few fanatics', as they were referred to by Dame Beryl Beaurepaire- and I believe by the community at large. It is a superb expression of that deep and profound resentment at this bad decision made by this group of distinguished Australians. The Australian Democrats support the motion of disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, support the motion of disallowance. I was disappointed that Senator McLean sought to draw some political advantage from the fact that the Opposition met on this matter only on Tuesday of this week. There has not been a party meeting prior to that when the matter could have been discussed. To suggest that, because the meeting was not held until Tuesday of this week, there was some reluctance on the part of the Opposition does not do credit to his argument. I have not heard a voice against it in the party room, and there is very strong support for disallowing this and a very strong comprehension of what the War Memorial is and what its role is. Certainly nobody who knows me or has spoken to me about the matter could suggest that I did other than oppose it right from the beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to go back into the history of the War Memorial. I have a few notes I wish to refer to-not in the depth that one might, but I think there are some things that are worth referring to. It was early in 1917 when the war correspondent Mr C. E. W. Bean submitted a proposal for a memorial to the generals at the time. In 1919, the Australian War Museums Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>To establish (from a selection of the Commonwealth share of the trophies and relics) the battle models, the official pictures and photographs, and the historic documents, maps and air photos, so that the `Commonwealth War Museum will be Australia's National Memorial to Australians who fell in war.'</PARA>
<PARA>In 1922, the Committee used the official title Australian National War Memorial, rather than the word `museum', to differentiate it from other memorials, shrines and museums of that nature. From the very earliest time it was to be a memorial to those who fell in war. Bean's draft to Cabinet said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National War Memorial, comprising a monumental building containing the war records of the Australian Forces-archives, pictures and relics and the engraved names of every Australian who fell during the War, thus dedicating to the memory a temple to which for all times students and the people generally will resort in order to have knowledge of their deeds. </PARA>
<PARA>Right at the very beginning it was envisaged that the displays and the engraved names would constitute part of the National War Memorial. To my understanding of the situation it is a very new and contemporary suggestion that there is some distinction between the Hall of Memory and the halls which house the relics and memorabilia of those who were involved. The Australian War Memorial Act was passed in 1925 and the inauguration of it occurred on Anzac Day in 1929. The program includes the words:</PARA>
<PARA>Conceived on the actual battlefront, born amid the thunder of the guns at Bullecourt, this memorial, raised by the living members of the Australian forces to their fallen mates, grew with the vicissitudes of battle in 1917 and 1918 . . . a memorial conceived founded, and from first to last, worked for by Australian sailors and soldiers themselves in honour of their fallen comrades.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not for us to impose a fee on the access to this memorial at this time. The word `museum' was dealt with on other occasions and rejected. In 1941, at the official opening, the words were changed to include airmen in addition to soldiers and sailors. There were memorable occasions. In 1987 there was a program management and performance review of the Australian War Memorial by John White &amp;Associates. Section 20 of that report, referring to discretionary funding, said:</PARA>
<PARA>In this context, it should be noted that there is a strong feeling amongst Memorial staff and interested external groups that the Memorial itself should remain free of commercialisation such as general admission fees or levies. </PARA>
<PARA>I also refer to the plaque at the entrance to the Australian War Memorial, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Australian National Memorial to those who died while serving their country. Visitors are asked to respect the sanctity of the building and its contents. </PARA>
<PARA>That has been there for a long time. I repeat that to me it is a very new concept to suggest that the Hall of Memory is a different place from the rest of the Memorial. Rather than read it out now, I seek leave to have quotes from the official publication at the time of the opening in 1941 incorporated in Hansard. There are some four paragraphs which I think sum up what it was that people were creating at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Memorial to Australians who have died in defence of their country comprises the National collection of war relics and the building in which these are preserved. The collection consists of the documentary records of the Australian Fighting Forces and the pictures, photographs, dioramas and other models, as well as the material relics, of their campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The gathering of these relics began on the battlefields of World War I and the decision that they should become part of the Nation's War Memorial was made by the Commonwealth on the suggestion from the Battlefront in 1917. </PARA>
<PARA>Conceived at ANZAC on Gallipoli, born amid the thunder of the guns at Bullecourt in France, the Memorial has been raised by the living members of the Australian Forces to their fallen mates. It constitutes not a general museum portraying war, much less one glorifying it, but a Memorial conceived founded and from first to last, worked for by Australian Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen. </PARA>
<PARA>The collection has been enhanced by gifts of valuable relics from the governments of Great Britain, the sister Dominions, our allies and in some cases our former opponents. To these have been added, through the generosity of Diggers, and relatives of the fallen, many personal relics of historic interest. The Memorial Building was the design of Emil Sodersten and John Crust. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) referred to the distinguished Council of the War Memorial. I have not heard anyone challenge its integrity. I think its motives were sound in trying to get more funding to display the material which is in its possession. I have seen some of it. I have been into the basement of the Memorial. There is an annex as well which is full of material. I would dearly love to think that it will be displayed and be available. I hope that we as a community will assist in that happening. I think the Council made an error of judgment in challenging access in the way that it has by imposing a fee. I have to say that `fanatics' is an unfortunate word to refer to those who oppose the introduction of the fee. I say that with Mrs Moore sitting in the Gallery today. She is well known to me and was a guide very much opposed to the imposition of an entrance fee. Nobody could call her a fanatic, but she made the stand that she did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have referred to the distinction between the Hall of Memory and the rest of the building. The Minister sought to draw that distinction. I reject it and, as I said, I believe it is a new concept. He indicated that there was a sacred aura about the Hall of Memory which does not apply to the rest of the Memorial. There is a sacred aura about the Hall of Memory. However, I think it is somewhat subjective to suggest that the rest is merely a museum; merely a place to look at things. I think that to many people visiting there is a sacred aura about a number of places. It is different from one visitor to another. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred to the Opposition's amendment to the War Memorial Act in 1980 enabling the Council to set a fee. It was not for the entrance to the Memorial exclusively. It does not set it out. There could be an annex, special exhibitions or an exhibition in the new building which may well attract a fee. It may be established purely as a museum. I think that the Memorial itself, though, in the eyes of those who know it, is a particular building. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the fuss there was a few years ago when the National Capital Development Commission put up a proposal to change the front of the Memorial. It wanted to enclose a bit and do a few things which would have changed the appearance of the Memorial when looking at it from Anzac Parade. The Opposition fought against that. The Memorial is as it is, representing what it represents, and its appearance should not be changed. The fee to go into it should not be imposed. That is not to say that there are not changes to exhibitions and changes which occur in the way they are presented, but I think that if we go back to what was established it is quite clear what should happen and what should not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister seemed to draw some rather convoluted argument to a conclusion, saying that the phone calls to members of the Opposition after the event led the Council to make the decision. It is unworthy of Senator Tate to attempt to put an argument in that fashion. We all know that that is not the way he does things. I received a phone call from the Director of the War Memorial after the event. He rang me at home and told me of the decision that had been made the previous day and apologised for the fact that Dame Beryl had not been able to get on to me herself. I thanked him for the information and I indicated that I understood what they were trying to do in seeing that more of the material was displayed. I would have been disappointed if he had drawn the conclusion from that that I was supporting what he was doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The drop in numbers of people visiting the Australian War Memorial has been dramatic. Numbers were down 29 per cent in January. There is a drop overall in Canberra, as is not surprising, of 12 per cent in tourist numbers. The War Memorial is the flagship of tourist attractions in the Australian Capital Territory. It was overtaken in recent times by Parliament House-naturally, because it is new-but the War Memorial is very significant and its numbers were down 29 per cent in January. That is significantly lower than other attractions in Canberra. I think that there is a message to be drawn from that. I guess we can do anything we like with figures one way or another. I merely mention that there is a very significant drop. In passing, I say that the drop in numbers has had a devastating effect on the shop and cafeteria that operate in conjunction with the War Memorial. I wonder whether the Council ever thought of the small business that operates there when it did what it did and the effect that it would have on that business. There are other artefacts to be shown and I hope that they will be shown. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been quite significant expansion in expenditure and staffing in recent times and I wonder whether, as Senator Newman said, there should be a review of the management of the Memorial in this respect. Maybe there is a case for saying that more money needs to be spent, but that should be made out in a way that the people of Australia will understand it. Perhaps as taxpayers they would like to contribute. There are other ways of raising money. We built an opera house with a lottery once. There are ways that the War Memorial may consider before it again contemplates bringing in a fee to go into what I believe is a significant, symbolic place. There are two such places in this country, in my opinion; one of them is Parliament House and the other is the War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of user pays comes up. For some reason, we are supposed to be committed to that principle, no matter what. That is clearly not the case. It is a general principle that the Liberal Party of Australia agrees to, and I agree to. We did introduce a fee to go to the Australian National Gallery, which is not in any way the same as the Parliament House or the War Memorial. It was opposed, of course, by the Australian Labor Party at that time. I remind the Senate how Labor screamed about that. I can remember Senator Ryan in this place going on and on about introducing a fee for the Australian National Gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor was going to abolish the fee when it was elected. It was elected in 1983 but there has never since been a whisper of abolishing the fee for the Australian National Gallery. Now Labor senators come in here supporting a fee for the Australian War Memorial. How does the Minister reconcile that? I had hoped the Minister would tell us, but he has spoken and cannot speak again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I want to start my remarks by quoting what somebody has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The decision to impose admission charges for entry is a national disgrace. . . . The decision is an insult to every former and current service person and their families . . . And it is even worse that veterans themselves should be charged $2 . . . The war memorial is neither a museum nor a fun park . . . Its intended role is a memorial to honour service people who gave their lives for their country, and all Australians should have the right to visit it free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made by none other than Senator Colston, the Deputy President of the Senate, and I believe it indicates a view that is widely held among members of the Government Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that as the Council of the Australian War Memorial decided that because some top-up for the proper running of the War Memorial was needed, it would need to charge for admission in certain areas. If there is a need for further moneys to maintain the Memorial and to improve it, that is a matter which we as a parliament must face up to. It should not be done, however, in the manner in which it has been done-by levying a charge on the public of $3. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that I sympathise with the Council. It has an enormous job to do. The people who are currently serving on the Council and their predecessors have, by and large, done a very fine job of work on behalf of Australia and on behalf of those who made the supreme sacrifice for their country. For that they deserve our wholehearted support and praise. Therefore, when Budget time comes around we should consider this question more thoroughly than perhaps we have done up to the present time. In that context we could hear from the Council as to what is required. </PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions have been made that more corporate sponsorship should be obtained for certain sections. This is something, as suggested by the Council, that needs to be pursued. But if, at the end of the day, there needs to be some further action taken, it should be taken by the Government and put to the Parliament. I do not think any one of us would begrudge the money required to preserve and maintain properly the War Memorial as an important memorial for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak so that I am on the public record opposing the imposition of an entry fee to the Australian War Memorial. The Australian War Memorial is one of the great institutions of the world. I do not think any other country has a memorial of the calibre and stature that we have in Australia. It is a marvellous memorial to those men and women who served this country in times of our great need. It is a memorial; it is not, as other speakers have said, a museum. It is quite different from the Australian National Gallery and from the National Science and Technology Centre, which are in the Parliamentary Triangle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How we got into this position is one of those completely inexplicable things that happen in life. A very tragic mistake has been made by a body of well-meaning, well-intentioned people. I cannot explain at all how the Council of the Australian War Memorial so misread the Australian ethos that it imagined it could impose a fee on entry to this memorial and not suffer the intense public reaction that it has. Make no mistake about it: there has been a universal rejection. I have not met one person anywhere at any level of Australian society who supports the imposition of this fee. Everyone to whom I have spoken is, like myself, outraged that this should have been done. It is a tragic misreading of the Australian ethos by the War Memorial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Newman said, the Australian War Memorial is one of the most popular sites in the country from a tourist's point of view. It is second only to Parliament House and probably in previous years it outranked Parliament House as a building tourists felt they had to visit. Not only Australian tourists but also international tourists came here because, as I said at the outset, it is one of the great institutions of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to turn this disallowance motion into a political debate but there has been a rather serious misrepresentation of the point of view of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia by both the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, and by Senator McLean, on behalf of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that from the moment I learnt of the imposition of this fee I was totally opposed to it. I raised it almost the same day with the relevant shadow Minister, Senator Newman, who is present in the chamber today, and said that in no way would I support it. It came into our Party room for the very first time this week at our regular Party meeting and the recommendation of the shadow Ministry that the disallowance motion be supported was accepted unanimously by the Liberal-National parties. That is the historically accurate representation of the events. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one in support of disallowing the motion has in any way or at any time reflected upon the personal integrity or attributes of the members of the War Memorial Council. I was saddened to hear that note injected into the debate at one stage. What we are-and what I am personally-concerned about are the actions of the Australian War Memorial Council and that is quite different from reflecting on the personalities of the members of that Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Australian War Memorial Council has made some strange decisions in the last five or six years. When one looks at some of the things it has done, one can see that the Council has made some decisions of which I am sure it is not too proud. I was very concerned, before we rose at Christmas, to read a letter in the Canberra Times from a woman who said that she had been a voluntary guide at the War Memorial for 11 years or 14 years. She was opposed to the imposition of a fee. When she made her views publicly known, she was summarily dismissed from the staff of the War Memorial. I do not know whether that is absolutely true but it certainly was the purport of the letter in the paper. I find that an indefensible action to have been taken by whoever the authority was at the War Memorial. It is just part and parcel of some of the concerns I have about decisions made by the Council in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Council of the Australian War Memorial is very clear. Its duties lie in maintaining as high a curatorial level as possible for the huge possession of irreplaceable artefacts that it has. I have a personal interest in that. My father was an officer in the Australian Imperial Force and he contributed on behalf of his battalion quite a large number of artefacts to the War Memorial, along with thousands of other Australian service men and women. The curatorial role of preserving the collection, cataloguing it and making sure that it does not deteriorate with the passage of time is very important. It is really the Council's prime responsibility, because without this materiel we simply do not have the Memorial. It is far more than the bricks and stones that make up the building. </PARA>
<PARA> The second duty of the Council is to see that that material can be displayed. I remember in 1981 or 1982 a parliamentary committee investigating the Australian War Memorial. I cannot remember whether it was a House of Representatives or a Senate committee, but the central point of its finding was that the Australian War Memorial was grossly underfunded and had been underfunded for years. That was when a Liberal-National party government was in power. Nothing was done about it, and I suspect that the financial situation and financial support for the Australian War Memorial has deteriorated considerably since that parliamentary committee looked at it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental problem we face with the Australian War Memorial is a lack of adequate funding and support. In rejecting the imposition of an entry charge, the obligation is clearly on the Parliament to make the funds available, or more funds available, so that the Council can adequately fulfil its duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to refer to in the political area is the business of the user pays doctrine. Memories must be very short in this chamber, but the principle of user pays was enshrined into Australian public debate by the Whitlam Labor Government. It was not a feature of any of the Liberal governments before that. It came in with a whole variety of charges, principally in the transport field. We have no objection to the general direction of the policy of user pays provided there is an element of fairness and justice in it. There is not much point in going into a deep debate on that but, while we accept that people who gain a benefit should make a contribution to it, we recognise that certain institutions in the country are above mere monetary concerns, and we certainly place the Australian War Memorial, because of its central part in the culture of Australia, outside that value. On behalf of my colleagues I support the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to underline the fact that the coalition is strongly united against this imposition of a charge. As shadow Minister for heritage, I would like to strengthen the case against the imposition of this charge by saying that I am opposed to it. I have been opposed to it, I remain opposed to it and my opposition has been reinforced by the reality of the fall in attendances that has taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would think that a government which claims to be a supporter of heritage matters would regard with major concern a 25 per cent fall in attendance in the first two weeks of January compared with the first two weeks of January last year, at such a place of major significance to our heritage, following the imposition of a charge. We have heard no response from the Government on that issue, but it would seem to me as shadow Minister for heritage that, if we are to substantially discourage people from attending a place of such significance in our heritage as a result of such a charge, that is a real cost to our country. It is a cost that is far greater than the $1m which is the measure of the revenue to be gained from this charge. One cannot simply look at costs in the base and material way that the Government has in agreeing that this charge be imposed because there are far more serious costs, I believe, in discouraging people from visiting a place which is so significant, so substantial, in our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be argued, of course, that because of the recession-the recession we had to have-all tourism is down, all visits are down; that people cannot afford to go to look at anything, let alone the War Memorial. If that is so, this is exactly the wrong time to impose another burden on Australians in visiting a place that is part of our heritage. In fact, it makes the decision to impose a charge all the more indefensible. To resist any suggestions that have been floated around this chamber that the Opposition is not totally opposed to the imposition of this charge, and to enforce the fact that not one voice was raised in our party room in opposition to the shadow Minister's recommendation, I join the shadow Minister in supporting the disallowance of the War Memorial regulations imposing a charge on visiting such an important part of our heritage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That issues arising from the making of the Australian War Memorial Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules No. 448 of 1990, be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report on or before 14 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I foreshadowed that I would move such a motion. I had originally intended that the regulation itself be referred to an appropriate committee. In this case, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs seemed then, and seems in relation to this motion, to be the appropriate committee, dealing as it does with matters arising under that portfolio. I have mentioned to Senator Zakharov, the Chairman of that Committee, that it was my intention to move this motion this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the issues arising from the making of this regulation warrant consideration by a Senate committee. I understand the fact that the regulation is now disallowed, but I think we deserve to know how the Australian War Memorial Council understood its role and what was required of it in relation to the enabling provision that was inserted into its governing Act by this Parliament in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> How did the Council come to its decision on this occasion? It is a decision which has caused division. According to the contributions of Opposition senators and Senator McLean, it has caused some distress and resentment in the community, particularly the veterans community. Now we have the fact of the rejection of its regulation by a majority in the Senate. I believe that in that situation the Council needs to indicate what imperatives led it to be compelled to make such a regulation. I believe that the alternatives that might have been considered and might be considered by the Council in relation to the provision of sufficient revenue and adequate funding to enable it to discharge its duties could be looked at, as Senator Harradine indicated, in a Budget or Estimates committee process, but can also be looked at by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for the Council to get some sense from the Senate Committee of the Senate's mood and its receptivity to any other variation of the user pays principle. With due respect to Senator Newman, the extent of the permissible limits are not clear, in the sense of securing the approval of the Senate, of the raising of the funds from, for example, the levying fee from tourist buses visiting the Memorial and how that is to be correlated with the Senate now telling the Council that it cannot levy a fee for per capita or turnstile type entry of visitors to the Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> A reading of the Hansard would make it very difficult for the Council of the Memorial to proceed safely in relation to fund raising of any kind. We owe the body of distinguished Australians, as they have been conceded to be by Senator McLean and others, the opportunity and the Senate Committee and its members an opportunity to discuss these issues more fully to try to understand the situation. As Senator Harradine has said, we will then be in a position to more clearly understand our responsibilities as senators and as members of parliament and as those who have a role in relation to budget matters in the working of the War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to allow this matter to go to the Senate Committee on Community Affairs for a short inquiry. I do not see this taking a very long time. Two or three witnesses would be all that would be required. We can clarify the situation so that this dreadful matter need not be repeated. I say that it is dreadful because I believe that those in the Council who took part in the decision making and who acted in good faith now find themselves in this position of having been repudiated and rejected by the Senate in the making of this regulation. We ought to do everything in our power to ensure that such a situation does not arise again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware that the Government would be moving this motion this morning until I arrived in the chamber, as Senator Tate has acknowledged. Although he did foreshadow that he wanted to do something about a committee, he was not specific about what he intended. The Opposition has not had time to examine the question in great detail. Therefore, I am in the difficult position, in one sense, of needing to give an answer straight away this morning. But my immediate reaction is quite strong. Therefore, I must state clearly at the outset that we do not see a need for this motion. We do not believe that it needs support or that it should get support. I will keep the reasons short and simple. The motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That issues arising from the making of the . . . Statutory Rules . . . be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders what Senator Tate means by the `issues'. I will come to some of the things he said later. As I can see, there is only one issue; that is, in the terms that the Government often likes to talk, one of access and equity in our national War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, only late last year the War Memorial reported to Parliament on that very question-access and equity. I spoke in this chamber then about that. But it was then very much restricted to the question of access and equity for Australians of non-English speaking background. Obviously a great deal of time had gone into reporting to the Parliament on how the War Memorial was performing in relation to questions of access and equity of people of non-English speaking background. </PARA>
<PARA> The director of the War Memorial, only in August last year-late August I think-said that the question of fees for the War Memorial was not on the agenda. Three months later it was not only on the agenda; it was decided. As I now find, it was decided with no consultation not only with the Australian Democrats but also with the Opposition. When the two coalition spokesmen on veterans' affairs have had no prior discussions or subsequent discussions with the Council of the War Memorial about the question of fees-the director is on the record as having said in August that fees were not on the agenda; we also know that they were not discussed with veterans' organisations-it certainly seems that this has been a question of indecent haste. It also means that questions of access and equity for people of non-English speaking background were given a lot of time and attention-I have no quarrel with this at all-but the same degree of attention was not given to the questions of access and equity for all Australians, and especially those who have actually fought and made sacrifices for their country, and whose sacrifices are honoured and remembered in that memorial. I find that extraordinary. That to me is the issue of the question of the fees. There is no other issue. It was decided to charge a fee; it was decided to limit access to our national Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Memorial has a number of opportunities to put its point of view to the Parliament and to parliamentarians. Only in December it presented its annual report to the Parliament. I spoke on that. I think Senator McLean did too. I do not think there was a great deal of other debate on the matter; I have not checked and I cannot remember precisely. But certainly there were no burning issues at the time except for the recent decision on the fees, on which I certainly spoke and expressed my real concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Memorial, as an independent body, is perfectly able and entitled to express its real concerns about its finances, its directions for the future, its plans, the quandary it might find itself in if it is not receiving sufficient funding from the Government, and proposals it is considering for finding alternative finance. It can, must and should do those things. Then again, twice a year the War Memorial has the opportunity to come before the Senate Estimates Committee to answer questions and to put a point of view on its budgets and policy implementations. The Estimates Committee will be sitting again in just a few weeks time. There will then be a perfect opportunity for the matters to be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Memorial is a statutory body. It must consult with the Government; I am sure it does. If it is not getting sufficient funding from the Government, it should say so. It must and should consult with the Opposition; it should consult with other parties in the Parliament; and it should consult with the veterans' organisations. It has plenty of opportunities, if it cares to take them, to make sure that its situation is well understood by those who play a vital and important role in supporting the War Memorial. It does not need a community affairs committee to investigate its current situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that Senator Tate has made out any real case for referring this matter to any committee at all, let alone Community Affairs, which, as we all know, is usually heavily burdened with legislative matters. The War Memorial and the Government also have access to the 1987 John White study. I think somebody has already referred to that today. There is no need for an inquiry about the way ahead. It has the information. It is a question of making a decision, but not making a decision without proper consultation, which unfortunately was what happened on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate said that we needed to look at understanding the role of the War Memorial and what was required of it by its Act. I do not think there is any doubt about that, either on the part of the Memorial or on the part of this Parliament. Certainly from the debate today it could be quite clearly understood what was required of it in terms of access to the Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> How did the Council come to this decision? That is an interesting side issue, if you like, but it is certainly one that can properly be pursued in Estimates. It has caused distress to all of us, certainly on this side of the chamber, and, I understand, to members of the Government, as Senator Colston is on the public record as having said. It has certainly caused widespread distress amongst those who have had some connection with Australian veterans and war service. </PARA>

<PARA> My fear had been-not being privy to the additional estimates for the Department of Veterans' Affairs and not being sure whether the Australian War Memorial itself would be seeking any funds-that perhaps the more technical point might be taken in the Estimates Committee that, because no funds were being sought for the War Memorial in the Additional Estimates, it was not appropriate that this matter be discussed before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Newman has given sufficient indication that the more usual practice-and the allowance and the flexibility-of Additional Estimates committees would be allowed to prevail. This matter could be dealt with by that Committee and it would be more appropriate than the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs.

Of course, if the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) is not in a position to know whether the Australian War Memorial will be in the Additional Estimates, the Opposition certainly is not in a position to know. But I would have expected that, if the War Memorial needed additional revenue, it would have been necessary for it to be in the Additional Estimates. Certainly I was hoping that it would be appearing before us on the Estimates Committee because, quite understandably, I have a number of questions to raise about the Memorial. If the Minister can undertake that the War Memorial will appear on the Additional Estimates, we certainly will be happy-in fact, enthusiastic-to pursue this issue in that forum.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sloppy manner of presentation of the Australia Council Amendment Bill 1990 is an accurate reflection of the Government's severe downgrading of the Australia Council. This Bill was first presented to the Parliament in mid-1988. The Government was so enthusiastic about pursuing it that it lapsed at the 1990 elections and here we are now, in 1991, at last dealing with it. I might mention that it has been on the Notice Paper all this week. Apparently it has been the least important matter, from the Government's point of view, this week, and has been shuffled off continually, in line with the method of presentation of this legislation since 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, that lack of concern for, and interest in, the Australia Council by the Government is reflected by its failure to appoint a chairman something like two months after the previous Chairman had retired, having completed the maximum term possible. This Government, fired with enthusiasm about the arts, took almost three years to get around to bringing this Bill into the chamber, has taken two months from the end of the term of the Chairman to find another and still has not found one, having hawked it around Australia, and now, at last, we are dealing with the legislation to alter the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill restructures the Australia Council in line with most of the recommendations of the McLeay report, entitled Patronage, Power and the Muse, which was tabled in the Parliament so recently-four years ago! This Government is fired with enthusiasm for the arts, and one can see that by its speedy response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has two major purposes: firstly, to clarify the right of the Minister to give written directions to the Australia Council on any matter except for the making of individual grants, where the Council's independence regarding grant provisions will remain, although the Minister will still be entitled to inform the Council of his wishes in particular cases; and, secondly, to oblige the Council to have regard to Commonwealth Government policies and, where practicable, to the policies of the State and local governments as they relate to the arts-and the Australia Council may comment in its annual report on any such directions it receives. </PARA>
<PARA> While the size of the Council remains unchanged, the chairpersons of all boards are to become ex-officio members of the Council. The requirement for two Government nominees on the Council has been dropped, but provision has been made for the appointment of two representatives of community interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum number of members on each board is raised to nine and the minimum is reduced from six to five. There is to be a special coordinating board which may comprise the chairman, members of council, board members and members representing the community and arts practitioners. Its role is to advise on community cultural development, it will have a maximum of 13 members and no additional funds are required. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was first presented to the Opposition in August 1988, former Senator Chris Puplick was of the view that the Bill as a whole should be opposed because it envisaged an even greater bureaucratisation of an inadequate Australia Council and of the arts in general. That is still the coalition's view. We will be opposing these changes to the Australia Council on that ground. There is no doubt that there is a massive duplication of grants mechanisms between the three tiers of government and an evident need, which is already recognised in part by the Hawke Government, to remove flagship arts companies from the unnecessarily bureaucratic control of the Australian Council; for example, as the Fraser Government did with the Australian Opera-which the Hawke Government has done now-with the Australian Ballet and the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. We need legislation that goes to the heart of the major problems with the Australia Council, not fiddling around at the edges after four years after the McLeay report. The clear evidence that has emerged from Senate Estimates inquiries, for example, is that about half the Australia Council's 1,090-odd grants to organisations are duplicated by grants from State bodies. The question of duplication of functions is simply not addressed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at what should be done to the Australia Council, and the Opposition feels that the Government has not faced up to that in this legislation. Certainly former Senator Puplick had a great deal of difficulty in his dealings with the Australia Council. Certainly he was of the view that it had indulged in `playing favourites with arts grants to a scandalous degree'. As I noted when I was Chairman of the coalition's Waste Watch Committee some years ago, there is no doubt that much of the community arts budget had been used to fund all manner of political activities-much of it looking like square-offs to those bodies whose political objectives had not been met by the Government and were being paid off through the `arts industry'. As it is, large volumes of grants go to trade unions for what are alleged to be artistic matters, but which do not seem to stand up very well to close examination, as was given to it by the Waste Watch Committee. It resulted in the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) admitting publicly on radio that many of those grants were silly. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt, as the coalition maintained in its arts policy at the last election, that there needs to be a major readdressing of Commonwealth-State-local government arts responsibilities. There seems to be a requirement for better representation on advisory bodies for arts consumers and for the States directly. There should be a withdrawal of the Commonwealth from any responsibility for community arts funding because there are better ways of going about it. There should be a greater direct role for the Minister in terms of policy setting for the arts in general and for the responsible advisory bodies. This legislation addresses that in part. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will oppose the Bill on the grounds that it does not resolve the major issues relating to federal funding of the arts, such as the need to establish clear lines of responsibility in arts funding; to avoid duplication of Federal, State and local programs; the need to remove mainstream national arts bodies from the unnecessary bureaucratic control of the Australia Council, as the Government has already done with the Australian opera; and the misuse of arts funding for blatant political purposes, particularly through the art and working life program and direct grants to trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> That is fair enough in itself, but let us examine what has been happening to the Australia Council under this Government. There is no doubt that the status and standing of the Hawke Government's primary arts funding body, the Australia Council, has been severely damaged by the fiasco over its chairmanship. Two months after the retirement of Professor Horne at the end of 1990 the Government still cannot find a suitable chairman of the Australia Council, despite having hawked this highly prestigious job around for months. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that when the coalition went to the last election with a policy of disbanding the Australia Council and adopting the same successful direct arts funding approach as exists in New South Wales under the State arts Minister, the Hon. Peter Collins, sections of the arts community, spurred on by some blatant political public comment by the Australia Council, actively organised to defeat former Senator Chris Puplick at the 1990 Senate election. However, these same people have expressed very little public concern about the Hawke Government's damaging incompetence over the Australia Council's leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall respond to that interjection, because that sort of nonsense deserves it. Former Senator Puplick was beaten by 490 votes and if the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support had bothered to read the newspapers after the event, he would have seen the letters written to newspapers by various arts bodies congratulating themselves for having organised former Senator Puplick's defeat and saying how welcome it was to them. The Minister might like to let a few facts interfere with his mischievous nonsense. These same people have expressed very little public concern about the Hawke Government's damaging incompetence over the Australia Council's leadership and over aspects of this legislation, which I thought may well have worried them, particularly as to the capacity of the Government to direct the Australia Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The standing of the Australia Council within the arts community is important because there is a need for some kind of body, some kind of reorganised structure, in arts funding. Some kind of structure like the Australia Council may be an appropriate one for doing some of the non-duplicated work of individual grants. I have been examining that matter in my review of coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the Australia Council's standing, as such, has been so downgraded by this Government's incompetence-the damage being done to it by the Government's failure to appoint someone-that I wonder whether the Australia Council is at a stage where it is recoverable. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much comment about the Australia Council by people in the media, relating not simply to the failure to find a replacement for Professor Donald Horne. There has been widespread criticism. In an article in the Australian newspaper entitled `Cultural dinosaur needs streamlining', Maria Prerauer states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Council has become an obsolete monster left over from our artistic stone age. It was great when Dr H.C. Coombs, its first chairman, set it up in the late 1960s. Those were exciting pioneering days when The Australian Council for the Arts, as it was first called, began all sorts of projects, established a tradition of government subsidies and made our cultural desert bloom with lively new companies. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> But as we go into the `90s the council has outlived its usefulness-at least in its present form. It needs trading in for a completely different model. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, with quite some flourish, the council has pulled lots of fluffy rabbits out of hats. At one stage talkfests were all the rage. Erudite blokes and sheilas were flown in from around the country to hold seminars and give speeches in this city or that. The converted preached at each other. But it all looked marvellous when immortalised later on glossy paper. Yet what came out of it? Nothing much, unless you count impressing politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> And as for the much-vaunted principles of ``arm's length'' and ``peer group assessment'' when it comes to applications for grants . . . who are they fooling? It's a jungle out there in the arts world. </PARA>
<PARA> Being assessed by a ``peer group'' is very often synonymous with being assessed by rivals. Or, conversely, there's the danger of mutual backscratching. (You scratch mine today, colleague. I scratch yours tomorrow.)</PARA>
<PARA>That kind of criticism cannot simply be ignored. I have noticed, too, a great deal of comment about the failure to replace Donald Horne as Chairman. I might say in passing that I have a great deal of personal regard for Professor Horne. Although I disagree with much of what he has done, he has lifted public recognition of the need for arts funding to a far higher level than existed before. </PARA>
<PARA> He did provide-as, I think, the Sydney Morning Herald said-a high level of intellectual leadership in this area. He has managed to help the Prime Minister by finding appropriate words, such as `the clever country', which the Prime Minister has now decided to latch onto. I suppose that, if we are going to be the broke country, we may as well be the clever one as well. It might divert people's attention away from the reality of just how broke we are. An editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The test of the merit of Professor Horne's arguments is that they are now virtually accepted as doctrine . . . The arts are no longer regarded as a fringe activity indulged in by the basket-weaving class from Balmain. The challenge for the new chairman is to keep the arts up in the mainstream of Australian life. </PARA>
<PARA>If only we had a chairman to do so. We do not have one. In the absence of one, I notice that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio personality, Mr H.G. Nelson, made this suggestion:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the new chairman should be Mark Geyer, the second rower from Penrith. Maybe that's who we need-someone with more biff up the centre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a bit of push in the scrum. I suppose that Mark Geyer would be only one of the many people added to the list of those who are being touted as the potential Chairman of the Australia Council. In a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald, Valerie Lawson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among the many names mentioned as possible replacements are the writers David Williamson and Tom Keneally, public relations man Leo Schofield, Justice Michael Kirby, magazine publisher Richard Walsh, theatre director George Fairfax and a former editor of The Age, Creighton Burns. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious contender is Professor David Throsby, professor of economics at Macquarie University . . . (He is the brother of radio announcer Margaret Throsby.)</PARA>
<PARA> But his name, along with the others, has been put back into the hat. ``It's back to square one,'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that nothing has happened, despite the fact that I understand that many of these people have been approached and have knocked it back-as did Noni Hazlehurst, who was approached a couple of weeks before Horne's time had expired. Fancy a government allowing a situation where this significant role is being touted around Australia and being knocked back by people at the last moment. Noni Hazlehurst, herself, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Being aware that this position is one of the most prestigious and influential appointments available in the Arts arena . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She did regard it as an unusual honour for it to be offered to her but she said, `Thanks, but no thanks'. We have a highly prestigious position being touted around but not filled. Yet initially Professor Horne was appointed to this job seven months before he was due to take it over. He was appointed in 1984 for an initial three-year term. So it is no surprise that he had to be replaced. He was appointed for a three-year term; his chairmanship was then renewed for a further two years; and, then, for a further one year up to the absolute maximum limit of six years. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know who the present favourite is. I do not know who has been offered the position and knocked it back. In the last month I know who was offered it and knocked it back in the run up to Horne's retirement. </PARA>

At present, in view of Horne's departure, there is no New South Wales member of the Australia Council, as I recall. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support who is sitting at the table, may correct me. There has been criticism from places such as Queensland that they are not getting a fair go. I guess that is one of the difficulties we find when we have a body such as this Australia Council. Maybe that is one of the reasons there should be a clear re-examination of the right way of funding the arts so that there is, at least, a perception of fairness in arts funding.

<PARA> Referring to the question of the Australia Council itself now that the Government has managed to downgrade its chairmanship, it is some measure of the lack of importance the Government attaches to this Bill that it has taken about three years to come before the Parliament. Essentially, this Bill is an attempt to find some sort of compromise between the arm's length principle of arts funding, adopted by all Federal governments to some degree since the Council was established, and the widespread criticism of that arts link principle. I understand that the Australia Council itself is happy with this legislation and was involved in the drafting of the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Arm's-length funding has been an article of faith with the Council for many years. This means that grants are determined by an independent statutory body and not directly by a Minister. Theoretically, it means that if a grant is subject to criticism, the Minister himself will not be subject to criticism. There is no doubt that there is a perceived need for that sort of thing when we get public outcry, particularly from minority groups, about a grant on various grounds. The Robert Maplethorpe case in the United States is a case in point where there is strong pressure against the grant of funds for a very significant photographic exhibition which was claimed to be homosexual and obscene. </PARA>
<PARA> Involving that sort of thing in political disputation creates some problems and results in a situation where there is a risk that politics and the arts could well become too closely intertwined. On the other hand, this arm's-length funding does not seriously resolve this issue, if we end up in a situation-which the Government has-where it can give directions. We end up with a situation where if it is a good grant the Government will try to claim credit for it; when it is a bad grant it is the Australia Council's fault. Strangely enough, it has been a different situation in Australia. If it is a good grant the Australia Council claims the credit; if it is a bad grant it is the Government's fault. In practice it is not easy or convenient to enforce this system, at least in public perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a strong argument that an elected Minister with ultimate responsibility for public funds should take the decisions as he or she sees fit in the public interest. The Federal Government has frequently intervened, either directly or indirectly, in the grant giving process. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to remove the Australian Opera from the Australia Council and give it a direct allocation in the Budget was seen by some as an abrogation of the Council's independence, although, as I said earlier, the same thing was done by the Fraser Government with not only the Australian Opera, but also the Australian Ballet and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. Now that the Hawke Government has removed the Opera from the Council again, it clearly underlines the fact that arm's-length funding is not entirely appropriate, according to the Government, in each case. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to the Australia Council Act that will allow the Minister to give directions to the Council in general terms, but on the specific amount of a grant, is another example, if you like, of diminishing the extent of arm's-length funding in my view. For example, it may be possible for the Minister to say to the Australia Council, `Give more to young people's theatre in accordance with our policy, but do not, for example, give x amount of money to the major young people's theatre organisation'. While this may seem clear in this case, it may not always be so because, for example, if the Minister were to say, `Give more to the national opera company'-without saying what the name of that national opera company is; there is only one of them-that clearly means directing funds to a specific company. Undoubtedly, there will be grey areas between the general and specific. In theory, the amendment seems quite sensible, but it will not make much difference in practice. It will simply legitimise what Ministers have always done, in effect, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters to be taken into account by the Council are also of no great significance, but are some sort of welcome change. Under the Act currently the Council has power to cooperate with the States and local government bodies, but in future it shall-I emphasise `shall'-have regard to the policies of State governments and local government bodies. This will impose a duty to consult, but in practice there is usually some consultation between the Council and the State Ministers on matters of common concern, in any event. So in practical terms, it probably will not make much difference. The fundamental question is about what role the Australia Council should have in a field that is pre-eminently one for the States and local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Under any program of worthwhile micro-economic reform, many people would expect to see much of the Australia Council's powers devolved to the States. This is an area of government where duplication of functions can and should be avoided. As I discovered in Senate Estimates-the hearing that I mentioned earlier-1,000-odd grants were made and half of those organisations also received grants from State bodies. The New South Wales Government's view, when I asked it for it, was basically that the national Government should be responsible for major national companies and programs, including Australia's international arts profile and, perhaps, such matters as Aboriginal arts, but it should not be supporting or maintaining services in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Council's future role should be more like that of the British Council than the Arts Council of Great Britain. It should carry the flag for Australian arts and artists in the world, but not be another funding body on top of State governments. That is a point of view that is respectable and should be looked at. There may be a case for having the Australia Council look after grants to individuals. I am certainly examining that in looking at the way this should be restructured. But there are many problems with peer group assessment. There are many problems of bureaucratic duplication. There are many problems relating to what the Australia Council is and should be doing-whether it should be intervening as much as Donald Horne wanted it to in the policy creation process. None of those major issues is addressed in this legislation. This legislation is an inadequate and a belated approach to the problem of what the Australia Council is and should be doing. As a result of its inadequacy and, I say in passing, its lateness, the Opposition will be opposing this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all honourable senators are aware, the Australia Council Amendment Bill is, to a large extent, based on the 1986 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee looking into Commonwealth assistance to the arts. The Committee also investigated ways to streamline operations of the Australia Council. At the outset, I would like to say how pleasing it is to see the Government actually responding in a positive way, even if four years late, to the recommendations contained in a parliamentary committee report, as has been done in this case. The principal recommendations of that report revolved around the need to clarify the communication links between the Minister and the Australia Council. The secondary group of recommendations was to the effect that both the Council and the various arts boards which are responsible to the Council should have memberships which are broadly based to reflect the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in clause 2 of this Bill there is an allowance for members of the community to be appointed to special arts co-ordinating boards. According to the definition of `community interest representative', this should permit people who are not necessarily professional artists, but who understand what community needs are in relation to the arts, to take an active part in this decision making process. This is undoubtedly a significant step forward in the Australian arts scene and we commend the Government for the inclusion of this provision. I noted that on this matter the House of Representatives Committee in 1986, at the time of its report, on page 82 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>That greater attention should be paid to the component of Council and Board membership chosen from outside the arts community. Administrative skills and different representation of the public interest are important . . . and should be actively sought when appointments are made. </PARA>
<PARA>As we see it, this amendment will effectively allow the arts industry to harness the variety of views and talents available in the general community. We hope that the funding and decision making processes of the kind the Australia Council have to make will be enhanced because of that amendment. In fact, this was something to which the House of Representatives Committee gave particular emphasis-the need to have a membership which could be more responsive to the development of community and cultural activities. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe there is, certainly, a need to create an environment which is more conducive to helping the community understand the contributions which both Aboriginal and multicultural art have made to this country. In this way, we believe this reform will encourage the development of an Australian arts scene which is more in tune with the broader perspective of attitudes in Australian society today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that some parts of this Bill are contentious. In particular, I refer to those proposed new sections which deal with the matters which the Australia Council Board will now be required to take into account in clause 3 of the Bill. At first glance, this amendment could be seen by some as raising all sorts of questions-and obviously it has-about the intervention of government into the direction taken by Australia's premier arts funding body. We share some of those concerns. In fact, it is an object of our policy on the arts that the arm's-length relationship between the Government and our arts funding and advisory body be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in this instance, it is not difficult to understand why such a provision has been included. It is true that over the last 10 or 15 years there has been a dramatic increase in our awareness as a society of the importance of the arts in nurturing a culturally diverse national identity. This has been accompanied by an explosion in the variety of arts activities undertaken in Australia. While this explosion of interest has been welcome, it is not difficult to recognise that in many instances there has been little cooperation between Australia's cultural arts-based agencies regardless of whether they are funded by the Commonwealth, by the States or by both. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that there are now so many agencies all up and running at the same time with a variety of activities that it is inevitable that some will be doing the same sort of thing in some cases, while totally ignoring the need for programs in some other area of the arts. The point is that while Australians seek to increase our understanding and experience of the arts, governments should accept responsibility for avoiding, where possible, unnecessary duplication of arts-based activities. </PARA>
<PARA> One aim of this Bill before us today is to overcome some of those problems of policy direction which the arts area has faced in the past. In addition to this, however, we must recognise that in the case of the arts, which is so often at the lower end of the scale of government funding priorities, every dollar spent should be made to count for something. In this context, it is important for all levels of government involved in arts funding, including the Commonwealth, the States and, in some cases, local government, to avoid duplication and to coordinate their efforts wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not arguing for some sort of centralised government control of the arts, but we do see the necessity for some improved coordination in regard to arts activities and arts priorities in this country. Certainly, the sort of recommendations made by the Committee and now set out in the Bill aim to allow for better channels of communication between the Government and the various arts bodies involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we accept the need for the Australia Council, as Australia's prime arts funding and advisory body, to pay some regard to the arts policy of the current Commonwealth Government and following Commonwealth governments `as far as is practicable to do so'. We do not believe that this is an unreasonable request and certainly the significance of those last words which I quoted from the Bill should allow the Australia Council enough flexibility and independence to continue to run its own course. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also somewhat relieved to note that proposed new section 6b (4) emphasises that this new relationship between the Minister and the Council should in no way impinge upon the decisions the Council wishes to make in regard to funding grants. Otherwise, we may well have found ourselves in a similar situation to those States where the ministry of arts model has been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> As some senators will be aware, in some of our Australian States, decisions on arts funding are made on the grounds other than those of artistic merit as a direct result of governments obviously interfering in arts funding-a model which the Democrats reject and which I am sure the majority of artists themselves also reject. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, such arbitrary political decision-making is unacceptable and there is no need for it, certainly not in the case of the Federal Government's relationship with the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> We commend the Government also for the inclusion of proposed new section 6b (3) which, quite importantly, places a statutory requirement on the Minister to table a statement in the Parliament if that Minister does happen to exercise his or her power and gives a specific direction to the chairperson of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> This parliamentary scrutiny of the Minister's decision should not be underestimated. Effectively, these requirements on the Minister at proposed new sections 6b (3) and (4) in clause 3 of the Bill mean that the Minister's new powers of direction cannot be applied to decisions on individual funding grants. We are encouraged that this will be the case. We should never allow ourselves to get into a situation where a Commonwealth Minister, responsible for the arts, makes decisions on individual grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity that the debate provides to place on record the Democrats' strong concern at the decreasing level of funding which has been going to the arts area generally, and to the Australia Council in particular, over the last few years. As honourable senators will appreciate, in dealing with the operations and structures of the Australia Council-which this Bill does-one of the most central issues that should be addressed is the question of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental problem with the Bill, as we see it, is that the reforms to the Council's operation and the introduction of better levels of communication will essentially amount to nothing if that organisation is starved of funds, as is the case with the Council at the moment. In this year's Budget, for instance, we find the Commonwealth Government allocated a total of $57.9m to the Australia Council. On its own, that sounds like an impressive amount but, by way of comparison, we decided to look at the Commonwealth Government allocation in recent years. We were greatly disturbed to find that the Australia Council has been suffering from real cuts to its budget for some time. For example, in the 1987-88 financial year the Commonwealth allocation to the Australia Council amounted to $51.8m. Compared with this year's allocation of $57.9m, this represents an effective real cut in funding to the Australia Council over the three-year period. Regrettably, that underlines what we feel is a very low priority that this Government is placing on the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> In its annual report of 1988-89 the then Chairman of the Council, Donald Horne, said the Council's most pressing issue of concern at that moment was the low level of funding to the Council and the staffing and administrative cuts which had resulted from that. It is interesting to note that Donald Horne sounded what we would consider to be a rather ominous word of warning when referring to the funding cutbacks. He stated in the annual report:</PARA>
<PARA>We must now face the unpleasant consideration that this may have gone too far.</PARA>
<PARA>We hope the Federal Government will take note of that comment and also of another statement from the Council's 1988-89 report, in which Mr Horne stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Council is a service organisation, not just one which provides assessment of applications for grants, then administers them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our staff consult with and provide advice to thousands of artists and arts organisations around Australia every year. And it is the only Federal or State agency commissioning and conducting research on any significant scale into issues which affect the arts and artists. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth observing that Donald Horne made a similar statement of concern in the Council's most recent annual report, for 1989-90-it was a rather personal plea-that the Council's good work and various arts programs are now threatened by the present funding situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats and community based arts organisations are understandably concerned therefore that, as a result of continued funding cuts, community based arts activities have deteriorated to what we consider to be critical levels. We fear that, unless the Federal Government takes note of these legitimate concerns, we stand to lose all the advances made in the Australian arts over the last 15 years, and that would be a tragedy indeed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are realistic enough to acknowledge, taking into account the country's present economic circumstances, that organisations such as the Australia Council are unlikely to receive additional funding from the Government. However, we believe that the point we are making is valid: that at the very least a commitment should and could be made to index the funding which is provided to organisations such as the Australia Council and the Australian Film Commission. This would certainly allow the Australia Council to plan its activities better and would provide the Council's arts boards with a more conducive atmosphere in which to introduce community based programs, knowing that existing funding would be maintained, and not cut. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if we accept that the Australia Council's purpose is to foster the cultural life of a nation and of its people, then how will future generations judge us when they see that successive governments have given a lower and lower priority to the arts? The Democrats-and indeed, I would imagine, most of Australia's arts community as well-will be watching closely on Budget night later this year to see whether the Federal Government is serious about the arts in this country or whether another funding cut will be executed on this funding organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, though, we feel strongly that we, as parliamentarians, need to recognise that government support for the arts is more than just a question of handing out funds. It is actually one of the very best ways available to us to reinforce our national and cultural identity through the activities that are organised by agencies such as the Australia Council in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I rise to support the Australia Council Amendment Bill. I want to use the opportunity to express what I believe is a widely held concern about the Opposition's intentions in relation to the Australia Council. As Senator Michael Baume has already indicated, at the last election Opposition members went to the people with a clear intention to abolish the Australia Council. While I concede that they appear to have backed down from this position, it is still clear that they intend, at the very least, to interfere with the operations of the Australia Council fairly fundamentally, as Senator Baume has already suggested and as Mr Jull suggested in the House of Representatives, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We believe there is a role for the Australia Council, but it will be in a form which is very different from the way it exists today. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of some concern that in the Opposition policy, which seems to be changing with time-I had hoped that these changes were a sign of mellowing but I am not convinced of that yet-no supporting arguments are given for the fairly drastic changes proposed, except some fairly generalised and, I think, prejudiced comments about specific aspects of arts funding, which I will come to. </PARA>
<PARA> Few people with any knowledge of the arts, whatever their views about the Australia Council now and how it is operating in relation to the States, would disagree that it has been a central and important part of Australia's national awakening in the arts since the early 1970s. It is ironic that it is perhaps its success as a generator of arts activities and arts development that has led to some of the more informed criticisms of its current role. It can be argued that the Australia Council has been so successful in encouraging arts development in the States that in some areas the States have overtaken the Australia Council and, to some extent, supplanted its role. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree in that respect with Senator Bourne's comment, that there is a case for looking at some of the contradictory things that are done by the various arts bodies, State and Federal, and the overlapping that occurs. There is a constant need to look at those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is the case, I think, that the States now have a lead in things such as the link between arts and economic and social development. They have a lead in looking at art as part of trade policy. Some States have a lead in the area of public art. They are leading the Australia Council, whereas the Australia Council used to lead the rest of the country. The Council's role in support for individuals and support for arts companies and organisations has been very largely supplanted. All of those things are developing things and need to be looked at continuously, but they do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that we need a total revamping of what has been a very successful institution.</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the informed criticism that comes from arts practitioners of the developing role of the Australia Council, but I worry about what appear to be uninformed and fairly emotionally based responses of members of the Opposition who, with one breath, want to abolish the Australia Council and, with the next, want to truncate it or bring it under political control. They appear to be willing to make fundamental and far-reaching changes which could easily revert arts funding to the dark ages of the Menzies era, the days of Australia's cultural cringe. I think the Australia Council has been very largely instrumental in dragging us out of that situation. They appear to be willing to make these fundamental changes without any supporting arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that the Australia Council is or should be immutable or that it should not be subjected to reasoned criticism. If a good case can be made for change, then change should occur. But no case has been made by the Opposition, in my view. </PARA>

This is why the Cultural Ministers Council meeting in May last year in New Zealand expressed unanimous support for the Australia Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two features of the Australia Council's operations which are of particular importance, in my view, despite some of the comments of Senator Baume. One is the arm's length principle and the second is the concept of peer group assessment. The arm's length principle is specifically designed to take decisions on arts funding away from political influence. Senator Baume seemed to be arguing exactly contrary to that, which I found bemusing. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor David Throsby, who is an economist, who has studied arts funding and who, as Senator Baume has already pointed out, is one of the people, I understand, being considered as a potential chairman, put the case for arm's length funding very clearly when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>A balance is struck between implementing government policy on the one hand, and artistic freedom on the other. Thus the arm's length principle adds a liberal element to the democratic element by placing individual decisions beyond the reach of party-political patronage, general pressure group tactics and outright censorship. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an extremely important principle, which balances the necessary freedom needed for the arts to flourish and the public funding necessary to maintain it. To quote Professor Throsby once again:</PARA>
<PARA>It is acknowledged that the arts right across the spectrum can be and should be critical, subversive, innovative, uncomfortable. If politicians or government departments have too direct a hand in allocating funds, it is argued we will tend to get arts that are safe, conservative and unquestioning.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are not the sorts of arts that I am interested in. </PARA>
<PARA> Peer group assessment is an equally important principle. It is based on the belief that the best people to make judgments about the merits of a particular proposal seeking arts funding are those with direct experience in the field. I simply reject the proposition, which was put in the newspaper quote referred to by Senator Baume, that somehow this leads to cronyism. If I were an artist, I would far prefer my peers in the field to be making decisions about a funding proposal of mine than the prospect of a Minister or a department deciding the matter. Governments of all persuasions tend to be conservative in areas such as the arts where they may be laid open to criticism. There is a tendency towards conformity and safety whenever governments are directly involved in the funding of such activities. Peer group assessment is more likely, in my view, to lead to lively, innovative arts activities, and to keep the arts where they should be-at the cutting edge of change. That is often an uncomfortable position, but it is a very important one in society. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the best way to achieve the rich diversity which should characterise the arts, in contrast to the inevitable safe conformity of a system based on ministerial decision making. It is also an important way, I think, to enhance and maintain the multicultural nature of arts in Australia, and to address all those groups which otherwise would not be addressed and which certainly were not addressed before the advent of the Australia Council. I refer here not only to the many ethnic and cultural groups in Australia, but also to women, Aborigines, the working class movements in the country and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Other areas of constant criticism by the Opposition are also of concern because they demonstrate the same willingness to inject politics into arts funding, which its decision to interfere with the Australia Council shows. The first is its attitude, as frequently expressed, to community arts. The second is its more frequently expressed attitude to art in working life. The community arts, as administered first of all by the old Community Arts Board and now by the Community Cultural Development Unit (CCDU)-which is an awful mouthful but it does much the same thing; that is a change of name which I never did agree with-is an area in which some of the most innovative and essentially Australian creative work is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> I received just yesterday a letter from the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, which informs me-and all honourable senators, presumably-that it proposes to tour India and that it will be performing in Delhi, Bangalore, Calcutta and Bombay. The tour has a potential live audience of 300,000 people and a television audience of 100 million people. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus was developed, encouraged and maintained by the Community Arts Board initially and by the Community Cultural Development Unit since then. It is a classic example of the success of community arts. A second classical national example is the access poster workshops, entitled Another Planet and Redback, which I think everybody-including people in the Opposition at the time-roundly applauded. </PARA>
<PARA> In my area, in the hills of a suburb of Perth called Kalamunda, there are two very interesting community arts projects which have really impressed me. One is the stained glass window at the library. Two professional stained glass artists, Cedar Prest from Adelaide and Judy Kotai from Perth, worked with the community in a collaborative effort to build a most magnificent stained glass window at the local library. The is a permanent monument to community arts in that community. </PARA>
<PARA> The second one in that same area is a project called Then and Now, which was a collaborative effort by two professionals, artist Truda Austen and writer Andrew Landsdowne, and the elderly people from the Jack Healy centre, an aged people's centre in the community. These people used their memories of what life used to be like in Perth and its surrounds to collaborate with the artist and writer in producing murals and other artworks. They also eventually produced a book called The Bogoda Birds, which included references to their stories. These are lasting, tangible things which these people have got from a collaborative effort by professional artists and a local community. I think they are excellent examples of the valuable work that community arts does. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's earlier decision to abolish the CCDU-I am not sure what the Opposition's position is on that now, but having just listened to Senator Baume I imagine it is about the same- would destroy some of the truly indigenous work of the Australia Council. I am glad it appears to be rethinking some of its attitudes towards its earlier position of total opposition, and I hope it also has a rethink on the work of community arts. </PARA>
<PARA> As for art in working life, it is also a frequent target of attack for alleged waste. This seems to be based on a prejudiced belief that the trade union movement is somehow not a legitimate institution. Yet the trade union movement is a major and respected institution in this country. It represents about half of the work force-about three million people. It has a rich and proud history, and a tradition of involvement in the arts. If government funding of arts is about reaching out to all segments of the population, it is crass not to employ the reach and resources of the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that the art in working life program was introduced in the 1982-83 Budget under Malcolm Fraser, and that it represents only about 2 per cent of the Australia Council's annual budget. Yet, because of the prejudice of the Opposition, it gets a disproportionate amount of attention in arts funding questions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting the quality of much of the work being done under the art in working life program, from tangible things such as union banners-which provide a rich source of history and colour on the struggles of working people-to the writing and production of work-related poetry, music and plays. All of this is for working people whose opportunities for exposure to the arts and ability to express themselves in artistic ways are very limited by the nature of their working life. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Australia's identity, some of the greatest achievements have been made in areas of community arts and art in working life. Yet these are areas which appear to be targeted by the Opposition. I hope it will look at these areas again. As I have said, I am pleased to note that arts policy is undergoing a rethink within the Opposition. I have a grudging-and, I hope, realistic-view of Senator Baume that beneath that external image of a philistine, which I think has attached to him since his participation in the Waste Watch Committee and some of the things he was forced to say there, lies a sensitive, cultured and artistic person who will look at this whole question in a much more supportive way--</PARA>

<PARA> The Bill springs from a report into arts funding titled Patronage, Power and the Muse-Inquiry into Commonwealth assistance to the arts by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. The report was provided in September 1986. Of course, being a committee of the House, it comprised Government and Opposition members. The findings of this report were unanimous; that is to say, both the Opposition and the Government, in a display of unity, came to the same conclusions about what should be done. In 1987 the Government responded to that report by putting down a paper and this Bill now arises in order to give effect to that response. With respect to the recommendations of this Committee dealing with the Australia Council, substantially the Bill before the Senate picks up and gives effect to those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> So what we had in the sequence of policy formation and legislation was an inquiry described in the foreword of the report as one of the most complex and comprehensive inquiries conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. A subcommittee of that Committee considered more than 4,500 pages of evidence from almost 100 witnesses at formal hearings all around Australia. It was a comprehensive examination and the Committee came to a unanimous conclusion. The Government responded and now we have a reflection of that in legislation. Yet we find that now, when this Bill is before the Senate, the Opposition chooses to oppose it-and it chooses to oppose it for a number of, I believe, spurious and ill-informed reasons which I will divert to in a moment. But, in replying to what has been put, it is important that the facts of how this legislation arose be understood. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, before I turn to some of the more specific comments of the Opposition, that the first thing that ought to be observed, in all fairness, is that it seems now that Senator Baume, speaking for the Opposition, recognises the role that the Australia Council plays and its purpose, and gives some credence to that; that is to say, unlike in the past, Senator Baume is not calling for its removal or its abolition but recognises that it does have a distinct role, purpose and use. One should be grateful, I suppose, that therefore Senator Baume and, hopefully, the rest of the Opposition have embarked on a learning curve and that they do not now have-if I may use this term-a troglodyte mentality of opposing this body but recognise the utility, virtue and the good value of it. I should pay that compliment of recognition up front. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I have said, a number of criticisms have been raised in the debate. Before I turn again to them I should say in reply on behalf of the Government that I thank all of the three senators who have participated in this debate. While I disagree with what Senator Baume has said, nonetheless his remarks have been useful. Certainly I have valued the observations and views of the Australian Democrats in this. Thirdly, my colleague Senator Michael Beahan has provided useful background to the Government's view of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks, let me turn to some of the specific criticisms that have been made. What I think is the most substantial of those criticisms is one by Senator Baume, on behalf of the Opposition, that there is a need to cut out duplication in funding for the arts in Australia-duplication occasioned by the ability of arts bodies to traffic between the Commonwealth and the States or other sources of funds. Quite clearly, that is a serious and important question. We too have the view that duplication should be removed, and we are working as a government and have been working as a government to do exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases it is fair, I think, for there to be a range of funding sources that arts bodies can go to in order to test their case, and not in all cases is that unreasonable. But the forum in which we have been working to cut out that duplication where it is unnecessary is the Cultural Ministers Council, a council of Ministers responsible for the arts in the various States and in the Commonwealth. That is obviously the forum. That Council has laboured on this subject and produced what it calls `the framework'-a framework which, if I were to speak from my experiences as the Industrial Relations Minister, I might describe as demarcating the various areas in which the States and the Commonwealth should have prime responsibility, so that there is not a duplication of responsibility by both. </PARA>
<PARA> While that broadly answers the demarcation question, there is still further work to be done, and that has to be admitted. The Cultural Ministers Council is still putting further detail onto the framework and I think that is the forum of Federal-State cooperation best equipped to eliminate the unnecessary duplication that occurs. I noticed that Senator Baume, in the remarks he made on duplication, while raising the subject and canvassing it at some length-he is right to do so, in my view-did not introduce any proposals of his own as to how the duplicative processes should be eliminated. That may be because he is not familiar with what I regard as the landmark achievement of the work of the Cultural Ministers Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area of criticism that has been made has been answered to some extent-I think adequately-by my colleague Senator Michael Beahan. I will categorise it, if I may, in this sense: the criticism has been made by the Opposition that arts funding has been used for political purposes. That is a judgment that the Opposition may choose to make. The truth is that arts funding in this country-with the exception of funding of the Australian Opera, which is a specific exception-is made and allocated by the Australia Council, not by the government. This is a body of people appointed because of their expertise in the field, their ability--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but it is because of their expertise in the field, and I do not think that the quality of people on the Council is a question for contention in the arts community. They are respected individuals and regarded as people capable of fulfilling the duties that pertain to them. They make those allocations. This Government does not; we are at arm's length from it and I think that is the appropriate format. But because we are at arm's length from it we are bound, when we appoint a committee of experts, to accept its judgment on these matters and not interfere. If we were to interfere we would be guilty of, in fact, bringing political values into play when these allocations are made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the structure-government standing at arm's length, having a committee of experts who are recognised and respected in their field to make these decisions-is the appropriate structure. But it seems that it is not that which irks members of the Opposition. What gets under their skin is the fact that some trade unions have qualified for grants-and that, because they are trade unions, is political. I must say that that is a fairly warped view of the world. Trade unions, as Senator Beahan said, are recognised institutions in this country. They are recognised at law, are respected, sit on major bodies, advise governments and--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some brief remarks about the accusations of bias over the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) coverage of the Gulf war and to give some support to the comments which have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Honourable senators will recall that the Prime Minister said on 24 January that he believed the ABC's coverage of the Gulf war was biased. This is what the Prime Minister said about the ABC's coverage:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I find it difficult to summon the language to describe my contempt for their analysis by their so-called experts. They are loaded, biased and disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA>Dame Leonie Kramer, one of Australia's leading academics and a former Chairman of the ABC, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Much of what has been put to air in recent weeks at prime time is, indeed, as Mr Hawke has said, ``disgraceful''. But it is also depressing because in the end it's a betrayal of trust, and an insult to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA>Other well-known commentators, such as Paddy McGuinness, Frank Devine, Gerard Henderson and Michael Barnard, in various ways have all effectively endorsed the comments made by the Prime Minister. The ABC itself has indicated that it received more than 1,200 telephone complaints about the ABC's Gulf report during the first week. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the Prime Minister's serious charge, the ABC announced on 8 February that it would launch an investigation into what was described as the `alleged bias and aggressive demeanour of its television and radio coverage of the Gulf war'. The ABC's Managing Director, David Hill, despite reports of some staff resistance, insisted that the ABC had to respond to the many complaints. David Hill was right. In my view he had no choice but to investigate the Prime Minister's charge. The problem, however, that a number of people foresaw was that the ABC was investigating itself. There was a fear that the inquiry would not be as extensive or as rigorous as originally promised. </PARA>
<PARA> According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, the original terms of reference of the inquiry were, among other things, to examine specifically the alleged bias of Dr Springborg and the performance of two of the ABC's leading presenters, Doogue and Olle. However, the terms of reference were, we understand, almost immediately watered down and the specific reference to these three individuals was deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> We read in today's Sydney Morning Herald that the investigation into alleged bias in the ABC's Gulf war coverage has been further watered down. The Sydney Morning Herald reports today:</PARA>
<PARA>The ``fair and thorough investigation'' promised last week by the ABC's managing director, Mr David Hill, appears now to have been so restricted that it has been dismissed by the journalists' union as a ``pretty useless exercise''. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that David Hill argues that the inquiry has not been watered down, but the Sydney Morning Herald writers have learnt that no staff will be interviewed for the inquiry nor will videotape or strips be reviewed. Further, there will apparently be no written report. </PARA>
<PARA> The investigator, Mr Derek White, the ABC's Manager of Corporate Relations, would give only an oral and not a written report to Mr Hill, who would then discuss the matter with senior staff. Paddy McGuinness's article in the Australian of 29 January this year seems, in retrospect, prophetic. Mr McGuinness wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>The very manner in which the ABC replies to criticism really only serves to underline the original criticisms. Always it is judge and jury in its own cause, closing ranks and presenting the results of its own internal investigations (like internal police inquiries), which usually seem to consist only of asking the original authors of a biased item to explain why it was not biased, on the presumption that they are in the right. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Sydney Morning Herald article this morning is correct, it seems that the journalists involved themselves will not even be asked. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the report in today's Sydney Morning Herald is not accurate because, if the Sydney Morning Herald journalists are correct, the ABC is treating the Prime Minister of this country, this Parliament and the Australian public with contempt. What will the public and this Parliament learn from such an investigation as described today by the journalists in the Sydney Morning Herald? Are we finally to expect a brief press comment or statement from David Hill indicating that all is well at the ABC? Whom are the journalists of the ABC responsible to? Has the Managing Director no control, indeed no right, to investigate serious allegations made by the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago the distinguished journalist Sam Lipski advocated that the ABC needs an independent ombudsman. In other words, there would be an independent person who would have the right to investigate and adjudicate on complaints from the public. People who are unhappy with a newspaper article or newspaper coverage they have received at least have the opportunity to write and have their complaints published. If today's Sydney Morning Herald accurately represents the state of play at the ABC, not even the Prime Minister of this country apparently has the right to have his complaints properly considered. What chance has the ordinary citizen to have any complaints against the ABC properly considered if the Prime Minister does not have that right?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has floated the idea of an improved and independent complaints procedure at the ABC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be very brief because the subject matter to which I am going to refer will be an ongoing matter of concern to this Parliament. On 12 February Senator Baden Teague made a speech on the adjournment about China. He commenced his speech by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The time has now come, I believe, for Australia to normalise its relations with China. </PARA>
<PARA>All I want to do today is to say that that speech was made only hours after two Chinese academics and intellectuals named Wang and Chen were condemned to a penal servitude period of 13 years-one on the same day as his first appearance in court and the other the day after he had first appeared. Such is the nature of the judicial system in China. Such is its contempt for the due process of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to analyse much of Senator Teague's speech at this stage because he made it perfectly clear in his speech that he had been told about this or that or the other-using his words. I know Senator Teague is very sincere in his desire to see improvement in the lot of the ordinary people in China. That is a desire that is shared by all members of this Parliament and is shared, I am sure, by the majority of Australians outside of the Parliament. It is shared amongst a number of China experts with whom I have close contact. But I do believe that it is premature at this stage and inappropriate to be calling for the removal of sanctions and the normalisation of relations, particularly on the very day that these two academics were given such severe penal servitude sentences. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague and others who are aware of what happens in China will know that the manner in which Chinese law is applied varies enormously between provinces and within provinces. I quote from Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1990, published by the US State Department, a copy of which has only recently arrived on my desk:</PARA>
<PARA>The People's Republic of China is ruled by an authoritarian government in which the Chinese Communist Party, backed by the People's Liberation Army, retains dominant decisionmaking authority. A close inner circle of a few senior leaders exercises ultimate power. Some of these party elders hold positions within the Politburo, the Central Military Commission and other organs. Others hold no formal positions of authority, but still wield decisive influence by virtue of their seniority in the Communist movement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government seeks to maintain control through a nationwide security network-which includes the Ministry of State Security; the Ministry of Public Security; the People's Armed Police; the People's Liberation Army; and state judicial, procuratorial and penal systems-and through the ubiquitous party apparatus and traditional societal pressure. In 1990 security forces were responsible for human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary arrests, as part of a heightened emphasis on the role of security forces in maintaining political control and social order. </PARA>
<PARA>That needs to be considered when we are deciding what attitudes we should now adopt to the People's Republic of China (PRC). </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the reactions that have taken place, both within and outside China, to the events leading up to and including the Tiananmen Square incident have affected the manner in which China is dealing with its internal situation. It does seem that, in some areas of China at all events, there has been a lessening of the stringency with which certain rules and laws have been applied. But, as is indicated by the US State Department's report Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1990, there still remain consistent gross violations of human rights in a number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Not least of these is the area of freedom of religion. I notice that in Senator Teague's statement to the Senate on 12 February he mentioned the recent visit to Australia of Bishop K.H. Ting, China's leading churchman. Because Senator Teague is a man of integrity and also of knowledge, he indicated that this man holds a very senior position in China's parliamentary body-the National People's Congress and the People's Consultative Congress. It is clear that he follows the China line. </PARA>
<PARA> But the issue of freedom of religion is a deeper thing than the views of an authoritative state. Let us not forget that there are people in China in penal servitude, in re-education camps, who are there solely and precisely because they wish to practise their religion and the state attempts to interfere with their relationship with God. I am sure Senator Teague, being a man of integrity and a Christian person, would be very concerned about that. I believe he has expressed his concern on a number of occasions, and no doubt he expressed it once more to the visitor from China. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area, of course, is the question of workers' rights. There are a large number of workers who have been incarcerated as a result of their taking action to uphold principles which are regarded as totally acceptable by the world trade union movement and by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The ILO undertook an investigation recently and said that it was of interest that the Chinese authorities had come across with more information than they had previously. That was a very interesting statement because in a number of other areas it has been more difficult recently to get information about violations of human rights. But the ILO indicated that at least in that area the Chinese authorities seemed to be more willing to come forward with information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chinese population control program is another area where there are serious and continuing gross violations of human rights, and I would like to have responses from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau to the points I raised in my adjournment speech on 20 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has expressed concern about violations of human rights in this and other areas. I think the cautionary note that he took in his response, as I read it, to Senator Teague's comments is commendable. I read his response, I must say, only through the Australian Associated Press report and did not read it in Hansard, as I must do. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to know the response that has been given by the Chinese authorities or by those international organisations with whom Senator Evans was going to raise his concerns about violations of human rights in the population control area. I would like to hear from Senator Evans at some stage as to what response he has received. We should keep this question in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> All I do today, whilst commending Senator Teague for giving us the benefit of the information he gained from a recent visit to China, is to sound a cautionary note. The Chinese authorities had directed that these trials be wrapped up before the Chinese new year. I do not think it is appropriate that we should be called upon to normalise relations with the PRC at this time. I again point out that the 13-year sentences for Wang Juntao who, as we know, was a 33-year-old newspaper editor, and Chen Ziming, a 38-year-old head of a private social science research institute, are believed to be the most severe terms given to any intellectuals in connection with the protests leading up to the Tiananmen Square incident. I again point out that Wang was put on trial on the day that he was condemned and Chen appeared in court only the day before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond briefly to the remarks of Senator Harradine. I thank him for his kind references to the seriousness with which I reported my own views to the Senate and my recommendation that Australia move to normal relations with China. I note that the timing of my speech, 12 February, was because that was the first sitting day of this session, and it was the first opportunity that I had to report upon my most recent visit to China in December and January. It happens to be a coincidence that 12 February was reported by the Chinese media as the day that the trials arising from the June 1989 events may have been concluded. Certainly, I hope that the trials are concluded. Certainly, I regret not being in any position at all to know what the basis was of the sentences that were given, including the very large sentences of 13 years; nor do I know of the outcome of earlier trials where some of those accused were acquitted on 5 January but others were given sentences of two years and four years. The reason why we do not know is that the trials, whilst open to the family members of those accused-and, it would appear, to some selected persons to make up a public-were not open to the public. They were certainly not observed by journalists or diplomats. It is this regrettable lapse in international standards of human rights and in the procedure of justice that I directly referred to in my speech on 12 February. In particular, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Of course, these trials do `fall far short of international standards', as Amnesty International stated last week. The trials are not fully open to the public, nor are they able to be observed by journalists or diplomats. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, my reference to the trials, which were in general terms known to me only a matter of minutes before I began my speech, led me to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is now my understanding this evening that some radio reports from China today appear to have announced that all the outstanding trials are now completed, with the sentences in these last trials being six years up to 13 years. I certainly hope that the trials are in fact concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> I have, for more than half of my speech, referred to Australian concerns about human rights in China and my own direct concerns about human rights in China. It is in fact one of the driving motivations of my speech, and of my recommendation that Australia-China relations be normalised, that I have the judgment, which others can all weigh, that I believe that our concerns will be better understood, and remedies better given in response to our concerns, by our directly taking our concerns to the Chinese people on the basis of normal relations. I certainly argued in my speech against any sense of congratulation of Chinese behaviour. I refer to my summary in the speech in these words-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for his comment. I said in the conclusion of my speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . those remaining matters in China which raise objections for Australians-and there are significant remaining objections, such as the failure, to date, to allow journalists and diplomats to attend the trials will be much more effectively pursued by our direct dialogue with China on the basis of resuming normal relations. </PARA>
<PARA>I also said a little after that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the resumption of normal relations does not mean that we have forgotten the horror of the Beijing massacre any more than our building normal relations after 1976 meant that we had forgotten the fear, the abuses and the wasted opportunities of the cultural revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the remarks of Senator Evans as they appear in Hansard. He gave them following my speech. I was very glad that he was present in the chamber and listened to my speech. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I can assure Senator Teague that all these things are being very closely considered at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that is always relevant in considering these kinds of issues is the question of timing. It is the case, as Senator Teague himself acknowledged in his speech, that that is a particularly sensitive matter at the moment with a number of remaining trials either taking place or just concluded in Beijing. That is something that the Government, again, will need to bring into account in its deliberations on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note Senator Harradine's references to our concern, as we are both Christians, for all minorities in China, in particular the Christian churches in China. I give notice that I may, in the coming weeks, give an equally lengthy speech about religion in China, or about the state of the churches in China. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the time that was available to me to address the main issue that I was wanting to put to the Senate I did not have time to discuss religion at all except to refer to a number of visitors of standing to this country, including Bishop Ting, whom I very much respect and whom I have come to know very closely over the last seven years, in that we have met on a number of occasions. I know that he and many in China share my view and the view of Senator Harradine that it is entirely regrettable that there are outspoken churchmen who have limited freedoms and even are detained because of their conscientious beliefs, especially the belief within the Roman Catholic Church of a direct loyalty to the Pope. </PARA>
<PARA> This loyalty is objectionable to some elements of the Chinese Government who are critical of any Chinese citizen expressing loyalty to a foreigner. That is why the great majority of the Catholic Church in China, including the great majority of the bishops, have structured the Catholic Church in China to be short of the normal relationship to the Pope that exists, for example, in this country. The great majority of the Catholic Church in China recognise the sensitivity of their own people in government in regard to not having an allegiance to a foreigner. Whilst Senator Harradine and I and many Australians will regard this as unnecessary and regrettable, that is the state of things at the moment in China. It is therefore with enormous regret that we see the conscientiousness of the few leading to their lack of freedom within China. </PARA>
<PARA> As is very evident in the annual report of the Catholic Church of China and of the Protestant Church of China, enormous growth is taking place in the numbers of churches and in the numbers of persons attending churches. In fact, the Christian church in China can hardly keep up with the enormous popularity that has come to it over the last decade. This is the case, for example, in Shanghai, Nanjing, Kunming, Chengdu and Beijing. Recently I visited churches in all those cities and had most careful discussions about religion in China and the state of the church. But that is for another speech. Those matters in my speech that Senator Harradine directly referred to I have now responded to briefly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The loss of civilian life in Baghdad in a bunker or shelter hit during an allied air raid is deeply regretted by all members of the Government. In saying this, I am sure I do speak for all honourable senators. Such sentiments are, I know, shared by all United States (US) spokesmen, who have acknowledged the loss of civilian life as being truly tragic. At this time, the exact number of casualties is not known, but it is clear that a significant number, certainly scores, possibly hundreds, have died. When tragedies such as this occur, it is essential to recall that the coalition has affirmed on many occasions that its forces are not targeting civilians and that the war is not against the Iraqi people. Regrettably, though, during war there will always be, and have already been, civilian casualties on both sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This was not, however, a case of so-called collateral damage involving a bomb targeted elsewhere going astray and causing civilian casualties. On the basis of clear intelligence, the building here was a command and control facility and therefore a legitimate military target in its own right. United States military sources have made the point that the bunker was painted and camouflaged to avoid detection. It contained the telecommunications and other features necessary for such a military facility, and it has been the site for the movement to and fro of military vehicles. I further understand that there has been some signals interception of a kind that confirms that diagnosis.</PARA>
<PARA> While the building was earlier on in the bombing campaign a secondary target only, which explains why it had not been hit before this, it has assumed more importance recently, along with other buildings of its type, as other more central command centres have been damaged by earlier bombing and resources have been redeployed, thus making the facility a legitimate military target from the coalition point of view.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the US military did not know that this facility was also currently being used to shelter civilians. I think we can be confident, on the basis of the assurances given today by US spokesmen that, despite its military nature, had this additional knowledge existed, the building would not have been attacked.</PARA>
<PARA> More generally on the subject of civilian casualties, in responding to a question on that issue on 12 February I made it clear that the Government shares the profound global concern which does exist about casualties on both sides of the current armed conflict in the Gulf, including concern about Kuwaitis and third country nationals who have lost their lives or suffered in other ways as a result of Iraq's brutal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, and of course its use of missiles aimed at civilian areas directly and deliberately as instruments of terror. I referred then to the casualty figures we had had from the Iraqi side, namely, 467 deaths and some 400 injuries. Since then, the Iraqis have been claiming, through US former Attorney-General, Ramsey Clark, that the true figure is something like 6,000 to 7,000 dead-that is, before last night's tragic event.</PARA>
<PARA> There is every reason to believe that the much higher Iraqi civilian figures we are now hearing about have been grossly exaggerated for propaganda purposes. It is reasonable to believe that Iraq has now judged that there is more to gain by publicising high figures, in terms of stirring anti-war sentiment in the West and Islamic countries, than it has to lose from such high figures in terms of domestic morale. This is particularly the case since the means of internal media dissemination are now so limited, making it less likely that these high figures would be widely reported in-country.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I notice that one journalist has called the latest civilian deaths which have occurred `the story of the war'. I think we all agree that this event is horrifying and certainly profoundly regrettable, but the kind of hyperbole that is involved in calling it `the story of the war' is simply not justifiable, even in these circumstances. The truth of the matter is that `the story of the war' remains the calculated, brutal invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and Saddam Hussein's despotic, cold-hearted refusal to get out of Kuwait despite the requests of the entire global community. The onus remains on Saddam Hussein to end the hostilities and thus prevent all further casualties by withdrawing from Kuwait immediately.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been further more balanced press reporting of the McKinsey report on Austrade in today's papers, but let me say that the article which was published yesterday, and indeed some other articles, take a very negative perspective of the findings of the McKinsey review. I remind honourable senators that Austrade was set up by the Government in 1986. It is not, as a government institution, an old organisation; it was quite a young organisation. Its charter was to help Australian exporters access offshore markets. Of course, in its activities there is a particular concentration on manufacturing and service sector exports because many of the arrangements for supporting exports in the resources sector are made by other bodies such as, dare I say it, the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wheat Board and other organisations of that kind. I think that in the period since Austrade was established that task has been carried out satisfactorily. It is a very important task for any institution like this to face up to the challenges of the 1990s, to look at the question of the directions in which Australian trade flows are increasingly developing and to have regard for those sort of factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concentration of the McKinsey report is very much directed towards looking at providing better facilities, better delivery mechanisms, for Australia in those markets, which are more difficult markets because of different business culture, different language, greater intervention by government in the marketplace and those sort of things than, for example, the United States market or the United Kingdom market, where there is much the same sort of business culture and certainly the same language. So, for those reasons, early last year, I with the Board of Austrade initiated a comprehensive review to determine how the organisation might be made more effective. In a very frank review, a lot of faults were found. I venture to suggest that if McKinsey provided a frank review of many other institutions in Australia, including many businesses, many of the same sorts of words would be used. More importantly, new directions and priorities have been identified and recommended.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the Minister confirm that the latest fall out from the Treasurer's scorched earth policies is that the number of unemployment beneficiaries and Job Search allowees has risen by more than 1,000 a day over the last month and by more than 163,000 over the last year? What is the likely cost to revenue of this latest surge in human misery now that the figures are almost 90,000 more than the Budget estimate? In view of the fact that a substantial slice of the more than 200,000 school leavers will shortly be joining the dole queues, how much worse does the Minister expect the situation to get? Will the Minister also confirm that his decision to stop releasing these figures on a weekly basis in order to coincide with the monthly release of the unemployment figures is yet another desperate attempt to censure the recent avalanche of bad news?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I can answer some parts of this, at least those parts which are my responsibility. I did indicate last year that those who are receiving unemployment benefit were rocketing up-I think that was the phrase I used-in numbers. Quite clearly, that has occurred and has continued to occur since I made the remark. I think the Government on many occasions has made it clear that it believes that that will to some extent ameliorate the situation during the second half of this calendar year and beyond. I am one who also holds to that view. The unemployment benefit (UB) numbers rose very heavily in December and not quite so heavily in January. Nonetheless, with every person who is unemployed it is another one too many. None of us would like to see that situation continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of how much worse will it get, it is, of course, the Treasurer's responsibility to make that determination, not mine. So Senator Alston ought to address his questions on those numbers and on the cost of those numbers to the respective Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the release of figures is concerned, we would not seek as a government to dodge the release of unemployment benefit or Job Search allowance (JSA) statistics. The monthly average figures for January have been released today and they coincide with the release of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) labour force figures. Those labour force figures are the official estimate of unemployment, not statistics on unemployment benefit. In regard to the release of the weekly figures, the Department has never published such a series. That is because UB figures are subject to significant fluctuations due to non-economic factors, such as public holidays, and are not reliable indicators of trends in UB numbers.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Department has provided information on request about the current number of UB recipients. Until recently there was only a very small number of requests for those figures. Therefore, despite the fact that they were not reliable indicators, because those who were receiving them were not racing out and using them publicly, they were not going to be used to create any sort of distorted position. The Department's practice, however, has been to release average monthly UB statistics in its four-weekly digest of statistics. These provide a much more reliable guide to UB trends than weekly numbers.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the interest in UB numbers, the new publication being released today is more detailed. It includes an average monthly UB figure as well as some regional information. It should be noted that the monthly labour force figures from the ABS are also available on a seasonally adjusted basis and provide a more accurate indication of trends in employment and unemployment than do UB numbers. Consideration is being given to publishing seasonally adjusted UB figures in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Has the Minister seen recent press reports about the costs to the economy of poor English language and literacy skills among workers? In view of this significant productivity loss and associated industrial safety problems, is the Government taking any steps to address this problem? If so, what approach is being used?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of recent reports, including one from the Bureau of Immigration Research, which estimated that migrants' poor language skills were costing Australian industry in the vicinity of $763m a year. Earlier studies have indicated that the loss to the Australian economy of poor English literary skills on the part of both English speaking workers and migrant workers rates at about $3.2 billion per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has recognised this problem and, particularly in the last 12 months, we have upgraded our response to it. We have, of course, the adult migration education program catering for the English language settlement needs of migrants, and the budget in that area was increased to $82.3m for 1990-91. However, we recognise that there is a significant backlog in the migrant area. This is one of the issues that were addressed by the working party report on post-secondary English language training, released in December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> We also recognise that this problem needs to be tackled in the workplace, particularly because of industry and award restructuring. Because of that, literacy and language development is now an issue for adults in the workplace as well as for children in schools. Because of restructuring, workers need upgraded communication skills, and to this effect in 1990, the International Year of Literacy, our commitment to adult literacy programs was $4.5m a year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as I said, has increased and upgraded its commitment in this area in the last 12 months. In the Budget last August the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that he would conduct a review of all Commonwealth literacy and language programs. In December 1990 he released a Green Paper entitled The Language of Australia: Discussion Paper on Australian Literacy and Language Policy for the 1990s. Public submissions on this paper are being received at the moment and will be received until 31 March this year, and a policy White Paper will be produced in June. While we recognise that we have a commitment, we also recognise that the responsibility needs to be shared by all in the community, whether it be industry, State and Federal governments, employers, trade unions or individuals. To this effect, the Training Guarantee Act allows for employer contributions to both literacy and language training in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I should mention that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training is currently also conducting an inquiry into literacy needs in the workplace. Its report is expected at the latest early in March. The Government does have a commitment in this area. It is one that we recognise implies a shared responsibility. We recognise its benefits not only for the Australian community in the social sense but also for Australian industries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In reference to the appalling carnage caused by an allied bombing attack on a Baghdad bunker yesterday our time, and in light of his answer to a question asked earlier today by the Leader of the Opposition, I ask: is the Minister aware of Australian Associated Press reports that there were several large arrows with the words `Shelter' in Arabic and English near the bunker? Is he aware that a Jane's military analyst reports that the bunker was quite possibly one of 20 to 25 shelters built during the Iran-Iraq war by European firms, each with a lower level use to meet military purposes and an upper level to serve as a civilian shelter, thus making any attack much more likely to kill civilians than to impair military capability? Is the Minister aware that the Pentagon says that it has observed military personnel in and around the bunker, routinely and continuously, and yet apparently failed to see the hundreds of children and women, who, according to several independent reports, had been using it since the war began four weeks ago? I further ask the Minister: does he agree that Iraqi authorities could have been expected to use every available shelter to protect their citizens from the allied bombing of recent weeks, even those which cannot be used as military facilities? Does he agree that there are, therefore, only two possible conclusions to be drawn about the allied intelligence assessments used to plan this attack, namely, that if they failed to conclude that civilians could be present they were hopelessly inadequate, or, if they did so conclude, that they must have been callously disregarded?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The crucial question here is not what the building in question may have been built for or used for in the past, but what it is being used for now. I have indicated the nature, in general terms, of the evidence available to the coalition forces in drawing the conclusion that they did, that this was indeed a military target. I am not aware of any reference to military personnel being sighted moving backwards and forwards; I am aware of references by United States spokesmen, in the material I have seen, to military vehicles being seen moving backwards and forwards. I believe that is the nature of the relevant evidence so far as that is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The possibility always exists that the Iraqis, quite deliberately, maintained the use of the building as a civilian shelter while using it simultaneously as a military command centre. A suggestion to that effect has I understand been made by the presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. The very least that can be said is that the Iraqi authorities would surely have known, when they allowed the building to be used by civilians seeking shelter, that it was in fact a legitimate military target. They must have known that in allowing the building to go on being used, as apparently it was.</PARA>

It refers to the unemployment statistics released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today which show that unemployment in my State is at 10.4 per cent with youth unemployment at 31.7 per cent. I ask the Minister: is it not a fact that a major reason for the unemployment rate is that there are now more people in or seeking paid work than there are jobs available at the same time that existing jobs are being slashed because of the recession? Would it not be prudent for the Government to examine the structure of the work force to ascertain how many people now in the paid work force have to be there in order to make ends meet and could be suitably occupied in other socially desirable occupations? Finally, will the Minister attempt to ascertain, through government sources, of the very large number of married women who have entered the work force in the last five years, how many have done so because the household could not be sustained on one income and do not wish to be in the paid work force but would rather undertake their mothering-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many parts to that question, and I can deal with only a few of them because I take it that Senator Harradine would want a comprehensive answer. Having drawn attention to the very bad unemployment situation-particularly in his home State of Tasmania, where the unemployment rates have now almost reached what they were when this Government came to power-he went on to raise a number of philosophical issues about whether or not people generally are voluntarily in the work force. I think there are an awful lot of people in the Australian work force, whether they be male or female, who are probably not in the work force voluntarily; and that is illustrated in numerous instances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the participation rate in employment has been higher in the last six or seven years and, indeed, higher in the last decade, than it was in the previous decade. Sometimes people try to draw the conclusion from that that a large section of the female work force is, if I can use the term, conscripted into the labour force because of economic circumstances.

<PARA> On the score of the announcement-in the first place I said that I believed that the financial community had responded well, and I repeat that assertion now.

<PARA> The outcome of the conciliation before Commissioner Donaldson was to the satisfaction of the SPC management, all the employees at SPC, and the unions that represent the interests of those employees and, of course, it met the terms of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The agreement was accepted by the employees on 3 January. It achieved savings of over $2m for the next 12 months. The workers' take-home pay will decline by between 2.5 and 2.8 per cent and the agreement will be periodically reviewed. Management has also indicated that, when the company turns into the black, it will introduce a profit sharing scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The only award condition that was varied in the final outcome was that wages were agreed to be paid by electronic funds transfer rather than by wage packet. That was the only award condition that, in the event, needed to be varied. That is a common agreement in trade-offs in the award restructuring process.</PARA>
<PARA> It was possible, when all of these parties sat down, to reach an agreement. It was possible to do it, demonstrating again the flexibility of the industrial relations system, and it was possible to do it in a way in which the objectives of both the workers and the company were met. I believe the industrial relationship has been improved considerably because of the exercise that has now been gone through. SPC attracted public attention because, as we know, the shareholders of that enterprise dismissed the previous board for poor administration and for bringing the company into a non-profit situation.</PARA>
<PARA> The new management negotiated trade-offs on wages with employees in order to reduce their cost overheads so they could bring the company back into profit sharing. It was not a matter of a company being affected by the recession; it was a matter of a company thinking it was a junior high-flying tycoon of the sort we have seen across the financial firmament in this country. It was done through the system. Mr Howard is right; it is an example of enterprise bargaining, but it is an example in which the unions were involved and the system proved flexible to accommodate it. Dr Hewson is wrong when he slams it, as he did, as a case of union standover. That is a cheap shot. In the end, all agreed voluntarily and he and the other H.R.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources who was, of course, the Minister for Resources not so long back. I ask: has the Minister visited the south-eastern forests of New South Wales, Fraser Island or the south-western forests of Western Australia and observed the high level of resource wastage, with perhaps 30 per cent of each felled tree being left unused on the forest floor? What action is he taking to improve the efficiency of timber resource use, given that it would boost productivity and spare substantial other areas of native forest from woodchipping and logging? Does he agree that measures to improve resource productivity, coupled with a concerted move to plantations as a resource base over the next 10 years, are a far superior path to genuine resource security than granting logging companies guaranteed access to native forests so as to simply continue their wasteful practices?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="590" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say straight off that, of course, the management of forests is a matter that comes constitutionally under the powers of the States rather than the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's role in this issue is when questions of export licensing arise, and the environmental issues can then be assessed against that. The primary management of forests is not something for the Commonwealth; it is for the State governments, and each State varies according to the views of that government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have visited the south-eastern forests of New South Wales several times as Minister and the south-western forests of Western Australia, although I have not been to Fraser Island. I must say immediately that there is a big disparity in the management regimes applied by the Western Australian Government on the jarrah forests in the south-west of that State compared to the regimes applied in New South Wales. On a scorecard, I would mark the Western Australian Government well ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter asked me a series of other questions, most of which would take too long to answer fully and completely. Let me give, in synopsis form, as full an answer as I can in the time allowed during Question Time. In the south-eastern forests of New South Wales, when the licence review came up for Harris-Daishowa, the Commonwealth Government played a key role. An inquiry was undertaken by both the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth to identify the areas of sensitive ecological concern and having them taken away from the cutting areas. Working parties were established through consultants to look at the following: how to best use the waste resources on the floors of the forest, the small and the round wood; how to introduce new cutting techniques to get the best value out of logs and introduce a flitch mill; and in that geographical region, with the soil properties and rainfall of that area, how to introduce hardwood native forests to supplement the timber resource in that State so that in future there would be less reliance on native forest resources.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised now that with all of those studies being conducted it is possible to see that the environmental concerns of the forest are met, and that the issues raised in Senator Coulter's question about making sure that the resources are utilised to their maximum capacity are also met. I am advised that an industry development plan for the south-east Australian region is shortly to be brought out by the department.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of plantations, the Government has established a National Plantations Advisory Committee charged with the task of producing a national plantation strategy for this country. The Committee has representations from the relevant interest groups and the best Australian experts on plantation technology. It is expected that it will report in the middle of this year in time to be considered for the Resource Assessment Commission and the Government's ecologically sustainable development working party on forestry. I recognise that that is not as full an answer as Senator Coulter's question suggests he might require, but I think it is a reasonable answer in the circumstances of Question Time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Campbell is referring to the intention of the Parliament, in setting up the structures of the Australian Securities Commission, that there should be a joint parliamentary committee to monitor and to supervise its operations. I believe that this is a very necessary part of this Parliament taking political responsibility for the shape and moulding of the laws regulating companies and securities nationwide, which is the new feature which gives such confidence in the future of companies and securities laws in this Commonwealth of Australia after a period of great fragmentation where the Federal system was quite unable to give the coherent political supervision and direction to these laws, such that we had the debacles occurring in the late 1980s, of which we are all too painfully aware and which led to a loss of investor confidence both domestically and on overseas capital raising markets.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I suggest that a parliamentary process be undertaken whereby perhaps the managers of Government business and of Opposition business in the chambers, together with the Australian Democrats-I know that Senator Spindler has a real interest in this area-and the independents, be informed of the intention to take up the requirement that such a committee be established so that the expectation of this Parliament that it take political responsibility for these laws can be fulfilled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for her question. I know she takes a great interest in these matters because of her responsibilities in outback New South Wales and provincial centres in her home State. I believe it is very important to refute some of the scaremongering that has been undertaken by Mr Ted Pickering to mislead shooters in that State about the true state of the law regarding their possession of firearms which have now been prohibited from being imported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the Australian Police Ministers Council decided that military style rifles, quasi-military semi-automatic rifles, Chinese militia style rifles, Soviet military look-alike rifles and semi-automatic rifles ought not to be imported into this country. That was the decision of all police Ministers, apart from Mr Pickering from New South Wales. That decision of the Police Ministers Council was conveyed to the Minister for Small Business and Customs, who has made regulations to carry that request of the Police Ministers Council into effect.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the decision is totally in harmony with the finding of the National Committee on Violence, which has been trying to reduce the types of firearms in our society which can lead to the tragedies we are only too well aware of, both here and in New Zealand, where arsenals of these weapons can be available to those of disturbed mind to undertake shooting rampages with such terrible loss of life.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the shooters who presently hold such firearms in their possession are concerned, there is no question of that possession being rendered illegal. They hold those particular rifles under State law of New South Wales, and they are entitled to do so lawfully. It means that, from the time that regulation was made, no such weapons could be imported into Australia legally. I am sure that when honourable senators come to look at the regulation they will be well aware that the Senate itself is extremely vigilant to ensure that there is no retrospective application of any such regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume keeps talking about shopkeepers. If shopkeepers hold these firearms and they obtained them before the regulation prohibiting the import came into effect, they hold them quite lawfully and legally under State law. Their possession, distribution, sale, licensing and so on are regulated by the State law of New South Wales. There is no attempt by the Commonwealth to displace or override those particular State laws regulating their possession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Pickering says that Senator Tate has even gone to the ludicrous lengths of banning a type of airgun used in the game Skirmish, in which small paint balls are fired in a simulated warfare situation. Once again Mr Pickering is wrong. The Skirmish guns, modelled on rifles, are exempt firearms and can be automatically imported. Those modelled on a hand gun would be importable if the importer has the permission of the Commissioner of the relevant police force authorising possession. There is no attempt by the Commonwealth to override State law in this regard. I believe that Mr Pickering has indulged in a scaremongering campaign which can mislead responsible shooters and their organisations, with whom I had extensive discussions and consultations leading up to the meeting with the Australian Police Ministers Council. It has led to a situation where they have played a very real part in evolving a list of those firearms which can be legally imported into this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones is referring to a press report. I was quoted in the media-accurately, I must say-today and yesterday. In remarking upon the gazettal of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act dealing with the amalgamation of unions, I said that now there was a device in place to encourage unions to amalgamate along industry lines and that I expected, therefore, to see a spate of amalgamations in that direction. I also said that I believed it desirable that unions seize this opportunity to re-examine their internal democratic workings and look at their structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that I have been consistent in doing, leading up to the debate in this chamber last year, during the debate and now, is asking that unions which take advantage of the amalgamation procedures to form a larger union re-examine their structures to form enterprise branches rather than concentrate on the old State branch arrangement; base their internal democracy in branches formed at that level; and flatten their structures so that the distance between the leadership and the rank and file is telescoped and made more accessible.</PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I believe that representatives in the enterprise should be encouraged much more to go into training procedures through the Trade Union Training Authority to equip them to deal with negotiations which will flow in the enterprise, so that those negotiations can be fairly dealt with between equal partners across a bargaining table and so that the outcomes can be respected by both sides as fair outcomes without one side taking advantage of the other side through superior knowledge or resources.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the Trade Union Training Authority is the right place for this. We have some training packages there now; we are going to review them to make them more relevant to this type of approach. I think this will help particular unions which are concerned about recruiting female members. Women now make up 40 per cent of the work force; they are a notoriously under-unionised area. Unions wishing to be relevant to the needs of female members should look at this sort of approach in order to encourage union membership in that sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator MacGibbon asked me a question relating to sites for the radar installations for Cairns and Coolangatta and whether they have had to be altered because of protests from environmentalists. I did indeed know yesterday, and in fact I should have advised Senator MacGibbon yesterday, that there has been a delay in the commissioning of these radar installations caused by technical difficulties that have arisen. That, as Senator MacGibbon will be well aware, is hardly an unusual problem in the settling down period for very sophisticated equipment. That problem will be resolved shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised me in response to Senator MacGibbon's direct concerns about the installations themselves that it has paid due respect to environmental and community issues in its siting of the radar sensors but that site selections were not altered as a result of the environmental protests.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Cairns, originally Mount Formatine South was selected. However, as it is a World Heritage area and this would involve lengthy approval procedures, the CAA decided that more expedient alternative sitings would be examined. Cairns will be served by three radar sensor units located at two sites-a primary and secondary site at Redden Creek and a secondary site at Hann Tableland. This is necessary to obtain adequate coverage for the terminal area at Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Coolangatta, all potential sites in the Coolangatta vicinity were investigated by a CAA technical team as well as the successful and unsuccessful equipment tenderers during their evaluations. The Mount Somerville site was judged to be the only site which meets the technical and operational criteria required for radar. The site was subsequently acquired and the radar sensors and equipment building have been established there.</PARA>
<PARA> I can confirm that both Cairns and Coolangatta airports have hills and mountains to their west. Given the locations of the airports with respect to the mountainous terrain and also the ocean, the laws of physics applying to electromagnetic effects caused by these two phenomena dictate that radar coverage cannot be perfect at either airport. However, the combined use of primary and secondary sensors at both airports means that acceptable levels of coverage will be achieved. A small area of airspace north of Coolangatta Airport has been identified as not being adequately covered by the primary radar, but the secondary coverage of that area is acceptable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I endorse the remarks made by Senator Hill and say that to the best of my knowledge nobody on this side, and certainly nobody who has been called upon to speak in the debate, was other than enthusiastic about being ready, even though it does not take 20 minutes to say, `I don't agree'. I would be happy for Senator McLean to withdraw his attempt to withdraw the motion and go ahead now if he wants to because I am ready, as is the rest of the Senate. If it is urgent we should do it now, and if it is not urgent we should not do it at all. That remains my view and it only reinforces my impression of the original proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only reason a matter is called urgent rather than a matter of public importance is so that there can be a vote at the end: everybody is made to come in and have a division and it looks nice at the next election time because the numbers were trumped up. It debases the very important back bench and Opposition privilege about motions of urgency. It undermines the significance of this chamber. I think it is a great pity, but there is nothing that can be done to force someone who does not want to debate an issue to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, as many senators in this place will know, Senator McLean, over a very considerable period of time-several years-has been seeking to have an inquiry into these matters. He has been putting a great deal of information before the Senate. The most recent information, which was the subject of considerable acrimony the other evening in the Senate, was the documents which you ruled should not be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean quite legitimately sought this morning, contrary to what Senator Hill just said, to have an urgency debate this afternoon on this matter in anticipation that you may have been persuaded, in the light of further approaches to you, to change your ruling. It was in the light of that that he sought to have an urgency debate because, in his mind and in the minds of the Australian Democrats, this is an urgent matter. </PARA>
<PARA> These documents are very relevant to this particular debate. All Senator McLean is saying is that now, in the absence of these documents, despite what we have heard over here, it is not possible to properly debate this matter of urgency. It is still urgent, but it is not possible to properly debate it. Senator Mclean is merely saying that he will wait until these documents are in the public domain, until other senators have had a chance to look at them, and then the matter can be properly debated, as we believe it should be. </PARA>

<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to establish a Royal Commission into bank practices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware of the fact that on 8 December 1988 I opened for discussion in the Senate the question of serious allegations of bank malpractice and corrupt practice. Honourable senators are possibly not aware of the fact that, prior to doing that, on 30 November 1988 I wrote a confidential memorandum to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and advised him that I had been given certain documents which made very serious allegations about corrupt practice in the Commonwealth Bank. I advised him that I would rather not take the matter to the chamber until I had discussed it with him confidentially and sought a briefing from him. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not receive a reply to that confidential letter to Senator Tate. That left me no option but to take the matter to the chamber. I started to table some affidavits in relation to the serious allegations and on 15 December I tabled the first of a series of affidavits. I have tabled in excess of 80, and they are available to all senators. One would imagine that because senators say that they are prepared adequately for this debate this afternoon they have perused some, if not all, of those 80 affidavits tendered to me by constituents. It would be a part of preparing adequately to consider the urgency of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell) approached me earlier in the day and said he felt that he had not had sufficient time or the sufficient focus to be able seriously to address the matter that was now being so widely canvassed publicly as a result of these efforts over two years. I respected that observation and provided him with an analysis and summary of them. In fact, it was the same analysis and summary that I suggested a few moments ago that I would provide to all other senators before returning to this urgency motion perhaps next week. In other words, I was alerted to the fact that it was indeed a very real challenge for honourable senators adequately to prepare themselves. Despite the lead time, there was a question of focus involved. Therefore, I sought to withdraw the motion with a view to more thorough and responsible preparation for the debate on the motion. That will not now occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The other consideration of which you are well aware, Mr President, is the fact that the Westpac documents are now widely in circulation, portions of them have been printed in the press, they are being quoted in the media and there is some confusion as to whether or not they have been tabled in various legislatures around the country. People are very confused as to whether they are able or unable to use those documents with qualified privilege. It is unfortunate that these ordinary citizens find themselves in that position. Over the last two years I have tabled 80 affidavits, as I have said, out of approximately 400 cases that I have in my files. </PARA>
<PARA> I have twice sought a Senate inquiry into the serious allegations of malpractice and corrupt practice among banks. On both occasions that proposition has been defeated by the combined vote of Government and Opposition. Slowly but surely, the issue has built up in the public mind. One aspect of the issue, managed foreign exchange borrowings, has recently come into higher profile because of these Westpac documents arriving in this country from an unknown source in Belgium. In the interim there has been the formation of the Foreign Borrowers Association, a self-help group of people who have been disabled by the damage that they experienced as a result of having been enticed into the program of Swiss foreign loans by greedy banks between 1983 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in previous debates, and in advancing the case of public interest the other evening in relation specifically to the matter of Swiss foreign loans, banks actually invented a flawed product but an attractive one which they marketed aggressively and convincingly and which was taken up by approximately 1,400 Australians. As Mr Will Bailey and Mr Don Argus attested before the banking inquiry last week, it was taken up not only by farmers and business people but also by local government authorities around Australia, by local government institutions and by charitable organisations. The product was attractive and it was taken up by many. In the words of Mr Will Bailey to the banking inquiry last week, it was vigorously promoted and enthusiastically received by the public. But it was a flawed product. As I said the other evening, Thalidomide was the flawed product that destroyed and devastated Australian lives. So also has this flawed product. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse than that, Mr President, the product was sold with all the risk in the hands of the clients and all the profit in the hands of the banks. En route, the banks avoided tax which by law was to be paid by them but which they passed on to the clients. I am convinced that the banks breached their statutory obligations to the Reserve Bank of Australia. I am convinced that at least one bank, Westpac, has actually lost the key documents which reveal that it breached those statutory obligations. I am also convinced that the key documents in fact have been destroyed by banks in relation to these transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting that, in relation to managed foreign loans alone, banks by their own admission have breached the most fundamental of their obligations-the fiduciary obligation; the obligation to represent the interests of their clients or to consider the interests of their clients as equal to their own. </PARA>
<PARA> I have advanced and argued these cases in the public interest. They have been put on the record not only in the Hansard of 12 February 1991 but in previous Hansards. In the Rigg case and the Rahme case I actually read into the Hansard detailed step by step analyses of the way in which such cases were carried out, as substantiated by the confidential documents of the Commonwealth Bank. I am saying that, in relation to foreign exchange loans, this abuse was delivered on innocent Australians not only by Westpac but also by the Commonwealth Bank. I have tabled evidence to that effect in this Senate over the past two years, evidence which I believe has not to date been addressed as seriously by senators as it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that I have tabled evidence in this place that a scam, known as asset stripping, has been quite common throughout the major banks. I have tabled in the vicinity of 60 such cases, including the supporting evidence. I have named names. I have called upon the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the Attorney-General of New South Wales and the Attorney-General of Tasmania to lay specific charges against specific people whom I have named and I have supported those charges in this place by tabled evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, I am saying that over a period of two years I have attempted to address and to draw to the attention of this Senate the abuse of the fiduciary relationship by banks. I have attempted to highlight the fact that there is a widespread scam in the Australian community in relation to banking. I have alleged that there is widespread malpractice and corrupt practices among bankers, and I have evidenced it. If that is not a matter of urgency, particularly in view of heightened intense public interest in this issue at the moment, I find it very difficult to imagine what is. </PARA>
<PARA> As you are well aware, Mr President, there is in train at the moment the House of Representatives inquiry into banking practice. The terms of reference of that inquiry are quite narrow and they focus on the effect on banking practice of deregulation. I will be appearing before the inquiry on 15 March and I have put before the inquiry the 30-odd speeches that I have made in the Senate and the hundreds of documents that I have tabled in the Senate in that process. I have had discussions with Mr Steve Martin and I am convinced that he is very much aware that the managed foreign exchange borrowings dimension of banking practice in this country is one to which that inquiry must now turn as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that Mr Stuart Fowler, the Managing Director of Westpac, Australia's leading bank, has by four means sought to restrain public attention to the documents now known as the Westpac documents. First, he has done this by placing injunctions upon those whom he believes may publish those documents in three countries: Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The restraints of those injunctions are now in place and being challenged. Secondly, he appeared personally before the bank inquiry and in his opening statement pleaded to the Chairman of the banking inquiry to return the one copy that the inquiry has of those documents. Thankfully, the Chairman refused to return that document and, therefore, the Committee will direct its attention to it in due course-I hope with a greatly sharpened focus by virtue of what has happened in the public media in the last 72 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Mr Stuart Fowler and his Westpac Bank attempted to get back all the copies from Australians who had them. Fourthly, he made major submissions to you, Mr President, to the Clerk of the Senate and to other senators in relation to the tabling of those documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The gravity of the allegations in those documents is reinforced profoundly by the actions of the Managing Director of Westpac in relation to the documents in a panicked attempt to get them back. Nowhere at any time has the authenticity of the documents been challenged. There is no public doubt whatsoever that the documents are authentic. There is no public doubt whatsoever that they are potent and they are, in the words of Mr Fowler himself, devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting to the Senate that in many respects that evidence is no more devastating than the evidence I have tabled in the Senate progressively over a period of two years. There were 80 sample cases of malpractice and corruption beyond foreign exchange loans. I emphasise in my submission to you, Mr President, that foreign exchange loans management-and the utter abuse that that was of the fiduciary relationship-was but one example of such abuses widespread within the banking institution. </PARA>
<PARA> I sat in on the bank inquiry last week and heard Mr Will Bailey and Mr Don Argus, two managing directors of Australian banks, argue that, certainly, the foreign exchange loans experience was unfortunate, but the people entered into them informed of the risk. I do not believe they were informed of the risk and I have tabled evidence to the contrary in previous debates but, as I have said, even if these people were-to use the expression used the other day- `punting', the banks were the bookies, the banks laid off their bets and by virtue of a technique called point taking, they actually changed the odds after the bets were taken. By virtue of a technique called deal swapping, they actually changed the accounts to which transactions had been directed. In other words, they changed the names on top of the tickets that had been written in that betting process, so to speak, and in so doing they reduced the ethics and the ethos of banking to that of the racetrack and the gambling parlour. They rendered a sham, through just that one exercise of foreign exchange loan management, the whole banking institution in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in Hansard previously that, when I was in Zurich three months ago as a member of a parliamentary delegation, we sat before nine leading Swiss bankers. We were discussing why more Swiss bank money is not attracted to this country. Their message to us was quite simple: our corporate image stinks. Their words were not that blunt but their message was that blunt. The corporate dynasties have been propped up by pseudo banking investment and support, evidenced by the collapse of three State banks around this nation. The banking policies of those State banks had propped up corporate bodies which had no substance. They subsequently collapsed, which led these Swiss bankers to this conclusion. They said it would be a decade before the corporate image was rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> In the process of giving us this message, one of the corporate Swiss bankers, Dr Henry Stalder, made a totally unsolicited comment. He said that the senior bankers in Australia who enticed Australian farmers and business people into Swiss bank loans between 1983 and 1987 are nothing short of criminals, should be in gaol, and that he would come to Australia to testify to that effect. I think he encapsulated precisely the morality that has prevailed within banking in relation to the foreign Swiss loans fiasco. </PARA>

I accept your ruling and, therefore, I have to turn to providing my senatorial colleagues-and I have attempted to do that vigorously for two years-with evidence to the effect that we, in this country, desperately need a royal commission to reveal the travesty of banking in this nation. We have not had one since the 1930s. We particularly need it to reveal the disaster of deregulated banking, which is banking in the successful pursuit of profit. Mr Don Argus, the managing director of the National Australia Bank Ltd, in a confidential memo to his managers which I tabled in this place on 25 May 1989 described it as `super profits'. He said that in the climate of super profits what was in his confidential memo must not be revealed to his State managers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go to the subject matter of this debate specifically, there are two questions that Senator McLean referred to in his last couple of minutes which I think are important to correct on the public record. One is that he rather cavalierly talked about the collapse of three State banks. It is fundamental to say that people in public life have some responsibility to uphold the integrity of the Australian financial system. There is one State bank that collapsed, one that has had a substantial asset contribution to ensure that it continues to be viable, and no other that is, by any report that I have heard, under any danger at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not even a second bank. That is the significant point. That does not affect the issue of whether there ought to be a royal commission or not, but it is important that we get it on the record correctly. Secondly, in the last minute or two, he threw in that these problems to which he is alluding-and I am not denigrating the significance of some of them-relate to the deregulation of the banks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Senator McLean said that the shocking thing is that since deregulation we have got profit driven banking. Westpac, NAB and the ANZ have been driven by profits, in some instances for 150 years. That may or may not be a good thing. Both deregulation and the role of private enterprise in banks are legitimate matters of public debate; they have nothing to do with the issue before us today. I really want to knock those furphies, first of all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us now get down to the subject matter of this debate. It is important to distinguish between talking about something important like corruption in the banks or maladministration or abuse of the rights of consumers, and doing something important. Doing something important is not getting up in this chamber and pretending that there ought to be a royal commission. If honourable senators think there are problems so well identified, act against them; do not run around being, as the Australian Democrats always are, the party of mirrors. They always want to look into everything but they do not want to actually do anything about anything. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposing a royal commission in this instance is not the same as supporting or defending everything which the banks have done; that is not the case. There are many reasonable areas for concern about and criticism of the activities of the Australian banks over the last 10, 20, 30 or 100 years-whichever timetable we wish to put. I am happy if I get time today to articulate some of those concerns. But none of them relates to the question of whether there ought to be a royal commission. Royal commissions require more than that there is a reasonable cause for concern about the matters under consideration. That is necessarily one; that is a precondition; I accept that, obviously. The matter must be of profound national importance. And let us not bother to debate whether that is so or not in this instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to give the Democrats the opportunity to compound their ignorance and make it more apparent. Royal commissions are things which ought to be used under rigorous criteria. Firstly, as I was trying to say before, it is important that the issue be of profound national importance. I put that to one side for this debate because that is not the ground of my criticism that this is not the appropriate subject matter for a royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two other essential criteria-and we could create a more complex structure. Those criteria are: there is no alternative forum under which the matter can be properly inquired into and, related to that, were it not for the powers of a royal commission, information that is necessary may not otherwise be available to the public or to those conducting the inquiry. My point is that this matter passes only one of those tests; it passes the test that it is a matter of importance. It does not pass the others. We go from saying that this is important to saying that this is something we should have a royal commission about. There are 100 or 200 important issues at the moment, many of which have been the subject of questions today and of debates regularly in this chamber-we had an urgency motion yesterday about one. But we are not having royal commissions into them. There are other public forums where they can be dealt with, and that is appropriate. As I said, we do not scatter them around like confetti. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a fascination with saying that every problem that arises can be resolved somehow by a judge. So we set up a judicial inquiry or a royal commission, and suddenly it will all be resolved. Many of the matters are much better dealt with here. Others are much better dealt with in the courts or by parliamentary committees. In the end, the decisions on most of them, including matters that are inquired into by commissions, are made by governments and debated here. That is as it should be; it is a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think we are bound to take their answers. When we are, then we have government by royal commission, not government by elected representatives. That is not what I seek. Everyone seems to think that royal commissions are costless; they cost quite a lot of money. Those which have been under way in the last few years-I have just had a quick rule of thumb check of costs-have cost between $3m and $40m, some of them worth every cent. I am not saying that just because they are expensive they should not be held, but it is not something one does at whim. It is $3m of somebody else's money-the taxpayers' money. It is not to be thrown around at whim, and it becomes a lawyer's benefit. Very few other people benefit, but a lot of lawyers do, and some of them make a very handsome living at it. It also becomes an excuse for inactivity: `We will have an inquiry into this instead of doing something about it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is exactly the issue I want to turn to. How does this issue meet those criteria? Are there other forums in which this matter can be addressed? Firstly, there is the Parliament, and no-one could suggest that there has not been ample discussion and ample opportunity for all these concerns to be put on the public record here. It has been going on interminably, and Senator McLean has outlined quite articulately today, and on other occasions, the volume of material he has put before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the Martin Committee, which has very broad terms of reference. The terms of this urgency motion could never be the terms of reference of a royal commission, which would have to be drawn up in some detail, but any reasonable royal commission into bank practices would have terms of reference very similar in areas of inquiry and responsibility to those of the Martin Committee, which talk about choice and quality of financial services, product information, innovation, information to users, access to financial services, the effectiveness of competition, et cetera. Are consumers getting a fair deal? That is the subject of the inquiry. It is perfectly appropriate that Senator McLean should be going before it and putting his material there and that the people on whose behalf he has been making many of these submissions should be making submissions to it and appearing before it. And the Committee is making special arrangements to ensure those people do have the opportunity to appear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Martin Committee is specifically addressing these issues-as it should. One of the reasons it was set up was so that it could. Senator McLean last night, and again this afternoon, made it perfectly clear that he is aware that the Martin Committee is dealing with these matters because he sat in on it while it was doing so. He knows that this matter is under inquiry; that the specific matters of last night's debate have been brought before the Committee; and that the Committee has declined to return the relevant papers to Westpac and has indicated that, at the appropriate time, it intends to pursue the matter further, as I am sure it should. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also many other relevant forums but, particularly in this matter, there are the courts. There is the question of people's contractual relationships with their banks. When people have not received proper treatment in the implementation of a contract between themselves and their bank-in this case the bank not discharging its fiduciary duty, exercising the proper duty of care-the first and appropriate recourse is to the courts; that is exactly what is happening. I am advised that in a number of cases banks have already reached out of court settlements with clients. In some other cases people have been awarded damages by the courts in matters of the sort that are referred to here. It is not for me to comment on the appropriateness of those decisions; none of us can. I understand that they are under appeal, and that is appropriate too. Let us get the higher courts to determine the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems an odd time to be talking about a royal commission in the middle of the courts' proposal to deal with appeals about decisions on the very matters under discussion, and where it is quite evident that the courts do have the capacity to deal with it because they are in the process of dealing with it. I do not think that royal commissions are something to be set up every time those on the other side are concerned that there is something important, and they are frustrated that they are not the government and therefore cannot deal with it in the way that they would wish. There are particular and specific circumstances that ought to apply before a royal commission becomes the appropriate vehicle of response, however important the matter in question, and these do not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to the question of the Martin Committee. The Chairman of that Committee, Mr Martin, has confirmed to me today that he feels in no way constrained or limited in his capacity to deal with the matters that have been raised here; nor should he, because they seem to me to fit the terms of reference. He has received submissions from the Foreign Borrowers Association and many of the individuals concerned. The Committee has determined to examine it as one of the major issues before the inquiry. As I said before, the Chairman of the Committee has the letter. He is currently keeping it private, but he has indicated that it is a matter the Committee will pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> As Mr Martin has said, Senator McLean and the Foreign Borrowers Association have been scheduled to appear before the Committee to raise exactly these matters, as they should. That is why the Committee has been established. I understand that special arrangements have been made in terms of hearings to facilitate people being able to appear. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that there are some limitations on the powers of any inquiry. It cannot rewrite history. There have been a lot of mistakes made that nobody can correct. That does not mean that they should not be inquired into, but the capacity of inquiries to redress past grievances is limited. That does not change because we turn it into a royal commission. Exactly the same limitation exists in the capacity to redress past grievances. An inquiry is appropriate but the appropriate forum for it at the moment is clearly, in the first instance, the Martin Committee; in the second instance, the courts; and, in the more general instance, the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is fair to criticise the activities of banks during the last decade. It is my view that they failed many small and large customers by, for example, failing to discharge their responsibilities to be the second line of defence for business. When people make a borrowing decision within their corporation or their domestic situation, which is something that is beyond their capacity to service, they think that they have got it right but they expect their bank to check. Most of us around here know that if we went to borrow some money the bank would probably fairly promptly say to us, `On the salary you get, you cannot repay that loan, Senator'. Fair enough, but a lot of small and large corporations went to borrow money for projects which would never generate and have never generated the revenue to service the loan. They got money from the banks without the normal rigorous scrutiny that we are entitled to receive from our banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks are seeing that loss on the balance sheet, but perhaps not as much as they should because, when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) criticised them a year or so ago, there was some evidence that they were trying to keep up the margins on the customers who had survived to try to cream back some of the profits that they had lost by bad lending decisions. I think that that is a valid criticism of the banks. We do not need a royal commission to make it. We have already made it. The Martin Committee will be looking at that matter again, but the Treasurer has already made those comments in public. They are on the record. They are a proper matter of public debate. The banks have endeavoured to defend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the banks could also be found guilty of stupidity in some of the decisions they made in what seemed to me to be a panic reaction to retain their market share when the foreign banks were allowed in. To rebuff the attempts by the new banks to move into the corporate sector and to retain their large clients, they made a lot of bad decisions to provide loans to those clients. We do not need a royal commission to find that out. A lot of liquidators around Australia are finding that out already, to the great chagrin of many and to the great damage to Australia's business reputation, as Senator McLean stated. I think that he is correct about that point. A lot of other people are to blame for that, not just the banks, but they must take their share. We do not need a royal commission to find that out. We know it all too well. I think that it is a cause of some concern that at the moment the banks are blaming everybody but themselves. They appeared before the Martin Committee and they laid the blame for the poor image of the banks and the economic consequences of their decisions at the feet of the Government, the dishonest entrepreneurs, the foreign banks, the decline of the Australian market, and even the media; everybody but the banks was to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a lot of players in the game who need to share some of the blame, but there is not the slightest doubt that the banks are among them. We do not need a royal commission to find that out. We do not need a royal commission to tell us that the banks assumed that the asset boom was going to go on forever, that they could lend on the inflated asset values that people were placing before them and that somehow or other those projects were going to generate revenue to repay that loan. </PARA>
<PARA> There are quite a lot of grounds for criticism. In whatever time scale one likes, Australia's banks have done a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. A lot of people have thrived. A lot of businesses have been well served by their banks over many years. A lot of householders and depositors have been well served. A lot of others have been very poorly served. They are institutions made of human beings. They make mistakes and miscalculations and they do things they should not do. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia at the moment we are in a situation where the Martin Committee, with broad terms of reference, is looking into the matter. What is it that the Martin Committee cannot inquire into or that the courts cannot deal with that a royal commission would? We have not heard anything about what the terms of reference of that royal commission would be, but by any reasonable stretch of the imagination, based on the urgency motion and the speeches of Senator McLean last night and today, it is hard to imagine what are the terms of reference of the royal commission that the Martin Committee, the courts and this Parliament, in terms of general debate, do not have the capacity to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we need to be prepared to make criticism of institutions in Australia when they fail in their responsibility to the public, to their shareholders and to Australia as a whole. I do not think that the banks or other institutions have been exempt from that criticism. I think that at the moment they are feeling somewhat shellshocked. They appeared before the Martin Committee as if they felt that the world was picking on them. I do not believe that they are entitled to that view. Much of the criticism has been valid and the rest of it is certainly only that robust debate that goes with a democratic society and free speech in a democratic society. I value that and they should value it as well, even though we do not enjoy every particular piece of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an obligation in this Senate in public debate to apply some rigour to the demands that we make for the actions that need to be taken. In the demands for royal commissions that are made lightly and spread thinly around this country-as I say, distributed like confetti-we need to say, `Does this matter meet the tests that there are no other forums in which it can be debated and no other manner in which the necessary information can be made public?' Notwithstanding the importance of the issue, it manifestly fails that test and, therefore, there is no case for a royal commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an embarrassing situation we have today. I see there are not many people in the gallery and through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I welcome them here. I feel obliged to apologise to them for the embarrassing performance that they have had to witness. They have seen a senator invite two members of the Government-one a Parliamentary Secretary-and two members of the Opposition to prepare themselves for a debate on what he says is a matter of urgency, knowing that certain documents that he wants to rely on are not available although he said that he would make some extra effort to get them. The senator came in here, after everyone else had been wasting their time preparing for the debate, and said, `Oh, I think I will call this off. I cannot get the documents I want. There are some Westpac documents that I want and without them I cannot possibly debate this matter.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an embarrassment for two reasons. Firstly, by his own admission Senator McLean admits his advocacy skills are so low that there is a matter of national importance which he cannot advocate be investigated without having a couple of extra bits of paper in front of him. It should be an embarrassment in itself that someone with advocacy skills so low has managed to slip himself into the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> But the second embarrassment is that the senator has shown a gross discourtesy to other senators. He has basically said, `You can waste your time getting ready for this debate but I know in my heart of hearts that if I do not get my way and get these few extra documents, I will call the debate off at the last minute without letting any of you know'. What a monumental embarrassment and insult to this Parliament this exercise has been. Fortunately the situation has been saved by Senator Hill moving a motion to invite the senator to proceed with his case, whereupon the earlier suggestion that his advocacy skills might not be up to it was put to the test and quite rightly, as I estimated, failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan took up the point very well when he asked what case had been made for saying that the existing structures already in place in relation to these matters which the good, honourable senator-perhaps a bit less so today than yesterday-wanted to have investigated were not suitable. That is what I wanted to hear. Why is the Martin inquiry not satisfactory? I have some problems with that inquiry and I will deal with them in this debate. But why would other forums be unavailable to address the problem that the senator sees? Why are the courts inadequately addressing this matter? Let us have some evidence put before the Senate as to why the existing structures are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from this embarrassing start, we basically had no criteria in the motion at all. It was a case of, `Let's just have an inquiry into banking practices in general'. We were given no particular definition of what banking practices we should inquire into. Really, that was a bit substandard; one would fail a matriculation essay on the basis of, `Oh, you should have an inquiry into the banks'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean is required at least to spell out, as was not done in the motion, exactly what it is he wants to get to. I suppose we should have guessed that he wanted to get to banking practices as they relate to foreign exchange loans. That would have been a much more substantial motion to put before the Senate because we would all have known exactly what it was he wanted to talk about. In that case he might have got a debate he would have been more happy with. He was either not capable of doing that or he simply decided on a `This will do; she'll be right, mate' attitude, which should not be acceptable in this chamber. As I said, it is a monumental embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to understand that this has just been a political exercise today by the Australian Democrats to create another opportunity to draw attention to the fact that the President has not allowed the tabling of what Senator McLean refers to as `these Westpac papers'. It is fair enough for the senator to want to go on television again tonight, wear his heart on his sleeve and say, `I tried yet again to get this information before the public and yet again I was refused, bleat, bleat, bleat'. As Senator McMullan pointed out, the bottom line is: in the two years that Senator McLean has been coming in here, pouring stuff onto the record, when has he come up with a substantive suggestion about what to do about these problems?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not see any articles from Senator McLean on how to deal with foreign exchange practices in the banks. I certainly do not see any articles from him in the things I read; I certainly have not seen any private member's Bills on how to handle it. As Peter Ward pointed out in the Australian, the crows are running round under the clothesline of politics, picking up the cake bits that are left, spitting a few out into the chamber and marching on, hoping to look after some narrow little interest. And they are not even looking after that properly. It is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> What we wanted to hear, and what we did not hear, was anything about why only a royal commission could get to the bottom of this matter. Not only did we have this general motion-just assume for a minute that we had a specific motion on the practices of banks as they relate to foreign exchange loans-but we were not told why only a royal commission could deal with this. Senator McLean did not tell us where the Martin inquiry criteria are inadequate; he did not tell us why the courts would not be able to handle the problems that he sees; he did not tell us why the court system is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if there is a lack of information on this material. I have turned my mind to an article by T. J. Valentine-thank heavens the days have gone when one would have assumed that it was `Mr' Valentine; it may well be `Ms'-entitled Critical Issues Arising out of the Martin Inquiry. T. J. Valentine works at the Sydney University of Technology and makes a number of very substantive points in relation to that inquiry and its inadequacies. These are summarised on page 12 of the article and I will briefly refer honourable senators to some of them. The point is made that there are important questions arising out of the terms of reference given to the Martin inquiry. As the author sees them, these are:</PARA>
<PARA> the Inquiry should look at the effect of deregulation rather than competition;</PARA>
<PARA> this examination should focus on all the effects of deregulation and not only on the direct effects on retail customers;</PARA>
<PARA> the Inquiry should consider the basic question of whether social reforms and redistributive policies should be implemented through controls on banks;</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be the view of the Democrats. The author goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> the profitability of banking is a fundamental question for the Inquiry;</PARA>
<PARA>The author also says that specific interest rate margins are not in themselves very meaningful and makes the point that:</PARA>
<PARA> there are many influences on aggregate interest rate margins and it is unlikely to be profitable for the Inquiry to devote a lot of time to them;</PARA>
<PARA>Finally the author says:</PARA>
<PARA> the discussion of competitiveness is likely to be restricted to the retail sector and in the end will resolve itself into a discussion of the efficiency of current retail financiers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just one person's view. But we had no evidence from Senator McLean that he had turned his mind to what could be done to improve the terms of reference of the Martin inquiry. We heard no reference to a recent conference on Australasian finance and banking in November 1990 where one of the keynote speakers, Professor Edward Kane of the Ohio State University, made such a substantive suggestion about what could be done. He suggested criminal liability for public officials who create the impression that a particular investment body is safe when it is not. That may be an unfair paraphrasing of what the good Professor suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> But I am trying to point out to the chamber that there are many articles around and plenty of informed views as to what could be done to improve banking practices in Australia. And yet we hear zilch from the Democrats in relation to this matter. There is no indication that they have read anybody else's views; they are just pushing their own barrow. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard no indication from the senator who proposed this motion-and in fact no reference from Senator McMullan-to the Industry Commission inquiry, which put out an issues paper in February this year entitled Availability of Capital Inquiry. Under the Industry Commission Act, without limiting the scope of the inquiry, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has specified that the Commission should give regard to a number of things, one of which is the lending practices of the banking and finance sector. So one of the terms of reference of the Industry Commission inquiry specifies that, without limiting the scope of the inquiry, the Commission look at the lending practices of the banking and finance sector. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard nothing from Senator McLean, who says we must have a royal commission into this, about why he is dissatisfied with what the Industry Commission will find out. That tells us that Senator McLean is pushing his own barrow. He has drummed up a broad term of reference for a matter of urgency to put forward today; he has not put the work into seeing what everyone else is doing; he potentially wastes the time of other senators getting ready for a debate; he marches in here and says, `I am not ready to go forward. I haven't got the material I need. My advocacy skills are not up to scratch. I cannot do it without that'; and tries to pull off the whole debate. It is a monumental disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me commence my conclusion by agreeing with Senator McMullan. When we call for a royal commission, not only should we have a very clear idea about what we want to have investigated but, once we have a very clear idea about that rather than some general ballpark idea such as that put forward by Senator McLean, there are three tests that need to be satisfied. One is that our area of interest is a matter of national interest. Obviously, the banking sector and its practices are a matter of national interest. They are of concern to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the Australian Democrats, who by the direction of their preferences put not only this Government but also the Victorian Government in office, had had the courage to say in this debate that they are responsible for putting in office the Government some of whose spokesman told people in Victoria that their money was safe in Farrow and denied that there was any problem with Tricontinental and the State Bank of Victoria. These are the people that the Australian Democrats put in power in Victoria, and I do not notice them standing too closely behind them now. I do not blame them for running 100 miles from that decision. It was a very bad one and I hope they do not make it again next time. But no doubt they will be like bamboo in the wind seeking the greatest short term opportunity and probably make the same mistakes again. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to hear the next speaker talk about Victoria and why the Democrats backed the State Government in Victoria, which they clearly did. In fact, they announced after the election that, but for them, the Labor Government would not have been elected. I can imagine how Victorians must feel about them now. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone in here agrees that banking practices are a matter of national interest, but the second two criteria have not been met by this speaker and cannot be met by the next one. They have to show that there is no other suitable forum. Senator McLean is prepared to go before the Martin inquiry. I do not know whether he even knows about the Industry Commission one, because he has not mentioned it. I suspect that he does not. The next speaker might like to make some reference to that matter. The honourable senator may be able to peddle off his bundle of papers there and see how well he gets on. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean has not made a case for there being no other forum for these matters to be addressed. He has not made a case for saying that information would not be available to anybody other than a royal commission. He has not made a case to say that the Parliament is ineffective in this matter and cannot get the information. Quite the opposite; he has told us that he has gone along and provided the information. He has given the Martin inquiry all this information. He is not prepared to wait and see what it says. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean has not told us why the courts will be inadequate in this area. We know that what he has tried to do is get some information that the courts have onto the record here. He has actually made a case for us that the Martin inquiry has this information and the courts have this information. He has blown the third criterion right out of the water. He simply has not made his case. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been an embarrassing debate to participate in. For someone to put forward a motion so badly prepared and try to pull it off, then, under pressure from both sides, which have done the work and have prepared for this debate, put forward a limp wristed effort to say that there should be a general inquiry, a general royal commission, into banking practices without satisfying those three criteria is a monumental embarrassment, a disgrace and a waste of taxpayers' money. I hope the electors who cast their votes in favour of the Democrats think more carefully next time than they obviously did last time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just had a demonstration from Senator Vanstone justifying Senator McLean's suggestion that honourable senators need a little more information before they participate in this debate. Although the information was available, having been tabled and introduced by Senator McLean over a period of two years, Senator Vanstone asked a series of questions, and when she ran out of questions she resorted to political invective. She did not provide any matters of substance; she did not advert to the practices of the banks, which are the subject of Senator McLean's complaints. She did not have at her fingertips any of the details which have been tabled. She was not able to refer to any of the matters of substance which do, indeed, deserve a royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The integrity of our financial system is surely a matter of national importance, and Senator Vanstone has admitted that. She should have gone a little further and admitted that the banks are an integral part of our financial system. If the community cannot rely on the integrity of our banks, then clearly the financial system as a whole will collapse. The level of supervision of these banks by the Reserve Bank of Australia, by the Government, and by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in particular, is very much in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of the State Bank of Victoria, the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia, and the level of bad debts that the banks are now using as an excuse to continue to widen their margins to try to retrieve their profits from people who are placing their savings deposits with them are all matters that were always on the public record. The banks have certainly shown that they are inept and immoral, that they have contributed to the disaster of deregulation, to the boom and bust of our economy. We now know that it goes further than that. We now know that the foreign exchange speculation scheme was actually breaking down in the fiduciary aspect of banks, which they should observe. We know that the scheme was giving bank customers all the risk and the banks all the profits, and that the community was losing in addition because this was coupled with a tax avoidance system. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the options we have as parliamentarians to take action on an issue of such national interest and importance. It was put to us that we could do it in Parliament-that we could pass motions, pass private member's Bills and do all sorts of things. Let us have a look at that proposition. We know that these measures have been on the table of Parliament for two years. We also know-and if Senator Vanstone had waited for the documents to be provided to her she would have been reminded of it-that Senator McLean actually wrote to the Minister for Finance quite early in this period of parliamentary action and that no action came forward in response from the Government, either from the Minister for Finance or from the Treasurer. Yet Senator Vanstone continues to claim that that is the proper action. Is she prepared to let her constituents wait for two years while the financial system falls about our ears? I do not believe that that is the right course of action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe she is. Let us take a further step. Let us look at what Senator McLean is trying to do now. He is met by the claim of legal professional privilege when it is quite clear that it does not extend to statements in parliament, particularly not when they are made in the public interest. We are told that court proceedings have been instituted by the Westpac Banking Corporation to suppress the Government. Even if those proceedings were successful and the ruling went in Westpac's favour, it would not prevent these documents from being tabled in this Parliament under professional privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are told that the sub judice rule is in place to prevent Senator McLean from adverting to the documents that he wishes to introduce into this Parliament to ensure that action is taken. Yet this damage to any of the participants in an action must surely be weighed against the much larger issue of public interest, security and particularly the fiduciary aspects of our banking system. I believe that in this case it is quite clear that our parliamentary system is failing us. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the next possibility. We are told that we can go to the courts. Who should go to the courts? A parliamentarian? A senator? Why should we go to the courts when we have the forum here, which we should use in the public interest to get action on this particular issue? Should the people who have been swindled of their savings go to the courts? Will they get legal aid?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone, as I am, is a member of the cost of justice inquiry. We have been looking at the fact that most people in the middle income bracket simply cannot afford to achieve justice in this country's courts. Maybe the people who have been swindled to the extent that they are very poor and have gone bankrupt can get legal aid and start legal action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean tells me that in this matter there is no access under commercial litigation. So the courts are basically closed. What do we do? We are told to go to the Martin inquiry, which has limited resources and a limited time frame and, I submit, does not address the terms of reference that need to be stated for this problem to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will read some of the terms of reference under consideration for this royal commission which, on the basis of the facts and on the basis that no other action is possible, should be established forthwith: the nature of the fiduciary relationship that exists at law between a bank and its clients; the avenues of redress that may be open to a client who considers that a bank is in breach of its fiduciary obligations. We have just canvassed the possibility of doing it another way. Let these people use an avenue which we can provide. This Parliament can open the door. It can institute a royal commission into this problem of the fiduciary obligations of the bank, which so clearly have been broken. </PARA>
<PARA> Another term of reference is: whether any current or recent practices by banks may be viewed as contravening the fiduciary duties to clients; and the extent of any such practices and the action that should be taken by the Government to prevent them and to compensate those adversely affected by them. These are fairly general questions. No doubt, the Martin committee could address some of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the specifics. To what extent have clients of Partnership Pacific Ltd or Westpac Banking Corporation suffered losses in respect of their foreign currency transactions as a result of the dishonest activities of Partnership Pacific or Westpac Banking Corporation? This is going fairly close to the bone, but these are the issues before us. They affect people who have been swindled of their savings. More than that, they affect the integrity of our banking system as a whole. What we, as parliamentarians, need to ask ourselves is: are we prepared to take effective action not only to assist those individuals who have suffered but also, perhaps even more importantly, to ensure that in future the Government, whichever government is in power, will take the necessary action to supervise banks and the financial system as a whole. This includes non-bank financial institutions, which the Government, at this stage, still refuses to acknowledge as its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Through a private member's Bill I am trying to ensure that the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank of Australia accept responsibility for non-bank financial institutions. It is in the hands of parliamentarians to ensure that in future our banking system is run for the benefit of customers, the community as a whole, and that our financial system retains-I should say rebuilds-its integrity for the benefit of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, I strongly support Senator McLean's call for a royal commission into these banking practices. He will submit to honourable senators further information which will enable them in due course to address the questions of substance which Senator McLean is raising rather than their descending into the sort of name calling that we witnessed before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of urgency we are discussing and, indeed, the very urgency of the matter, have been canvassed very well by my colleague Senator Vanstone and Senator McMullan. I reinforce the shame that Senator McLean should feel about his actions this afternoon, particularly in disturbing the time of honourable senators, which we all know is under great pressure. Senator McLean suggesting that this is a matter of urgency and then withdrawing it, clearly makes a farce of the word urgency. It is clearly not a matter of urgency at all; it is another Democrat political point scoring exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want the people in the gallery and other people listening to these proceedings to understand that, at the instigation of the Australian Democrats, I, Senator Vanstone, Senator McMullan and Senator Cooney have been involved in this debate this afternoon. As pointed out by Senator Vanstone, Senator McMullan is a parliamentary secretary. Senator Vanstone is the deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. A lot of very valuable work is done there. Senator Cooney is the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a meeting to go to this afternoon for the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which is currently doing a very detailed inquiry into the Estimates committee process and many other processes. All of that was held up by Senator McLean. All of the work of all of these senators was held up by Senator McLean, who came into this place, tried to withdraw his urgency motion and then, obviously because of his embarrassment over the situation, had to proceed. So indeed it is not a matter of urgency; it is just a part of Senator McLean's preoccupation with bank bashing, which is all that one can describe it as. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a royal commission, which is the centre of this matter that we are debating today, was canvassed very well by Senator McMullan. Clearly the prerequisites for the need for a royal commission have not been met. They have not been put before us by Senator McLean, who did not address in his speech the matter of a need for the royal commission. </PARA>

This is the piece of paper I devoted to Senator Spindler-I got hardly one word out, and I think it was really nothing more than a doodle, which is how one could describe Senator Spindler's contribution to this debate. I guess the contribution that Senator McLean made was, as usual, not much of a contribution; it is usually a dribble of interjections through other people's speeches. I guess he tests the patience of people such as you, Mr Deputy President, who are in the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem with this motion is that it places all of the blame on the banks. It focuses attention for the ills of the Hawke-Keating Government on the banks. It has done so in a way that is not conducive to the public debate and to the very public interests that Senator McLean would have the people believe he so much protects. He is like Don Quixote, going around tilting at windmills. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the problem is that Australia is in a deep recession. Farmers-the sorts of people Senator McLean refers to, who have had a problem with these foreign currency loans-receive letters every day telling them that their farms will be sold up and auctioned. Every day small businesses are closed down at enormous rates. Thousands of people are going on to dole queues. More often than not, they are receiving the bad news in an envelope--</PARA>

Thousands of people are going to their post offices every day dreading to get the bill from the energy commission or the water authority because those rates and charges have gone up and dreading to get the window faced envelopes from the banks. Thousands of people out there are getting bad news from the banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is good politics to blame the banks because that is where they are getting the bad news from. That is the politics of it. Whether Senator McLean will admit it or not, he knows that that is the politics of it-and bank bashing is good politics. But it is not good for Australia. In his speech Senator McLean referred to the fact that these people who took out these foreign currency loans were not warned of the risks. That may or may not be the case; it is not central to this matter of the royal commission. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that, if the banks did not warn the Australian people who took out those loans of the risks, did Senator Spindler warn the people of Australia about the risks of electing Labor in Victoria and federally-because there were some big risks? The warnings that we were given by the Government-by this joke of a Prime Minister, Hawke, and his Treasurer (Mr Keating)-were that there would not be a recession, there would only be a slowdown, and that interest rates would come down. If the Trade Practices Commission looked into those sorts of warnings for the Australian electorate, there would be more than a royal commission: they would all be in gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have now been promised, and it was repeated in Question Time today by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, that we are going to have a recovery in the second half of this year-a recovery in spring.

Let them go out, and let the people of Australia understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem, as I have said, is that this bank bashing-which is all this exercise is about-effectively shifts the blame for the hurt, the pain and the agony that have been imposed on the Australian people by the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party by their conspiracy to re-elect this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem, of course, is that the deregulation of the banking system, which the Democrats cannot and do not want to understand and cannot support, was the right thing to do. It implemented the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, headed by Sir Keith Campbell. Unfortunately, the trouble which has been recognised by most financial commentators since then is that deregulation stopped too soon and did not go far enough. We have not seen the micro-economic reform and deregulation in the other areas of the Australian economy that were needed to get this economy on the move. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasurer Keating's trying to push the micro-economic reform agenda harder now and trying to put a bomb under the Government to get micro-economic reform up and running-obviously something he failed to do in the last three years-is so crucial because there cannot be one section of the financial markets and the economy deregulated when the rest is just tied up in regulation and red tape which do not allow this great country of ours to get moving and get our economy growing. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is the Democrats' solution? The coalition's solution is to have privatisation and deregulation and to allow Australia's enterprise and individuals to get working in synchronisation with a deregulated financial system. The Democrats' solution, if they can possibly come up with one-all they seem to be doing again is dribbling away with their ceaseless interjections, flouting the Chair--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank you for that ruling. I was trying to point out that the Democrats' solution to the problem that they perceive with the Australian economy is, as Senator McMullan said, to use mirrors and have inquiries into everything. As Senator Powell, this failed Leader of the Australian Democrats, has said, her solution is to re-regulate-when the whole of the Australian political movement is towards deregulation. There is no argument any more, except from a few in the left wing of the Labor Party and from these people who are further out to the left of the Labor Party-these fairies at the bottom of the garden or, to use Senator Macdonald's words, the political ladies of the night. They are the only people who want to go the other way. They want to go back to the sixteenth century. They want to go back to Eastern European solutions and to Soviet solutions. They want to re-regulate. They can keep pushing that if they want to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that there is no need for this royal commission. There is the Martin inquiry, which will do good work. As the Chairman of that inquiry said recently, and I am sure Senator McLean knows, it is an inquiry that will not bank bash. He said he was not in the business of bank bashing, but that is what Senator McLean wants. He wants a royal commission to go on his crusade of bank bashing. </PARA>

<PARA> To get back to Senator McLean's motivation, he has had this two-year crusade. He has become a crusader. He sees himself as a crusader. He loves it. He likes the idea. He wants to make his mark on Australian politics by this crusade against the banks, and good on him. All of us have some issues that are close to our hearts and that we crusade upon. I have crusaded on a few myself. I am crusading to have some propriety in our appointment of ambassadors to foreign postings. I am crusading to make sure that the Australian Securities Commission works. I have got my own little crusades. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do not do what Senator McLean has done-and it is unfortunate that he probably does not realise it has happened to him, but it has. He has let it affect him personally. It has become part of him. He is no longer objective about this issue. It is now crucial to his performance in politics and to his political survival for this crusade to keep going and rolling and gaining momentum. It is like a train that is out of control. It has overtaken him. He has lost his objectivity and this bank bashing, which is gaining him cheap political points, no longer is serving the public interest that he says he seeks to serve. He has again shown the Senate and the people of Australia an example of that, because it has affected his integrity. He does not know it, but it has.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two issues arise in this debate which, although closely related, are distinct and focus should be kept on that distinction. The first is whether banks have engaged in malpractice and, if so, what should be done about it. That issue has arisen because of allegations made against them on the basis of material brought forward by, amongst others, Senator McLean. He has been pre-eminent in bringing the conduct of Australian banks under community scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impression gained from what he has put forward is that banks have a case to answer, and he should be congratulated on that. If I may speculate as to the future, it is clear that the issue of how banks, and one in particular, have conducted themselves during the 1980s will become the subject of much scrutiny in the coming months. If at the end of that scrutiny they are seen to be what Senator McLean now alleges, then he will have achieved much for the community. Given the fact that there are investigations of banking institutions going on now and that, hopefully, fruitful material will come out of them, he should be congratulated on bringing that about. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue is the process by which the allegations against the banks are to be dealt with. Included in that question is how the material to which I have referred is to be treated. I refer to the material that Senator McLean has tabled and put forward in this chamber, together with the letters that he has been prevented from putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Process may appear to be a dry subject but it is the cornerstone of civil liberties. Process involves the structure established to see that every person in this society receives fair treatment. Proper process includes the rules of procedures of parliaments and courts, guidelines for police investigation, rules of evidence, strictures on tribunals that they apply natural justice in their deliberations, a system of appeals, the need for investigators to obtain warrants to search property and people, and conventions directed to ensure that legislation acts for the benefit and not the detriment of citizens. There are others, of course. </PARA>
<PARA> The central concern in this debate is what is the proper process to deal with allegations made by Senator McLean. He says that a royal commission is the proper process. Ultimately it may or may not be, but the time is not yet ripe for that question to be determined. For a start, Senator McLean himself says that the letters he has been restrained from tabling are essential for a proper decision to be made. They are not available. The issue of what should happen about them has yet to be resolved. The courts have issued injunctions restraining their release to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The courts cannot restrain the determination of Parliament and cannot restrain the processes and proceedings of this chamber. Quite properly, Parliament is independent of the judicial arm of government. On the other hand, the fact that it is independent does not mean that Parliament should ignore what the courts do. Our way of life, our civil liberties and our regard for our fellow citizens require that each of the three arms of government-the legislature, the Executive and the judiciary-should respect what the others do. If an unhappy strain is placed on the relationship between those three bodies, then our way of life is put at risk to a greater or lesser degree depending on the strain imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case the courts have made orders restraining the use of two letters. Certainly it is within the power of this chamber to ignore those orders. Senator McLean-I heard him on this subject the other night and again today-has put forward powerful arguments as to why we as senators should ignore them. If we did, certainly we would place considerable strain on the relationship which the legislature has with the judiciary. There are times when that strain must be placed. The question is whether it should be in this case. I shall return to that topic a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> There is always a risk in calling for inquiries. I listened to a powerful address by Senator Kemp earlier today. He always puts his arguments powerfully and lucidly. He was discussing a call for an inquiry into the reporting of the Middle East war by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I think that there is great danger in Parliament deciding whether the ABC is biased and doing something that may affect its independence. There might be a case for that but if we call for and go ahead with inquiries into the ABC or bodies that should be independent of this Parliament, we will put considerable strain on the sinews that tie this community together. My view is that we should not interfere with the ABC in the present circumstances and that, if there is any case in which we should, it should be a very powerful case indeed. I raise that question to indicate that calling for an inquiry and going ahead with an investigation of particular institutions, although at times necessary, should only be done with the greatest of care. </PARA>
<PARA> The rule of law, the guidelines to our actions, suggested by social propriety and our sense of justice should work not only for the poor and the deprived and for middle Australians, but also for the rich and powerful. The rule of law is only a proper, universal and good rule of law if it operates for all sections of the community, be they high or low, powerful or weak, rich or poor. I am not saying that such a consideration has crept into this debate but if a proposition were put forward that Westpac or any other bank should not have the full benefit of the law because of its position of power in the community, such a proposition should be condemned. The problem with the legal system in Australia and with those who want to make use of it is not that the corporations and the banks, such as Westpac, can readily go to the courts and pay to do so. The problem is that those less powerful than Westpac cannot take that course. </PARA>
<PARA> The real scandal is not that the law is available to the rich and the powerful but that it is not as available, as it should be, to those who are not in that position. The failing of the law is not that it vindicates the rights of the rich and powerful but that it fails to do so in respect of those who are not. </PARA>
<PARA> The editorial in today's Sydney Morning Herald was based on material which Senator McLean has in my view properly put forward. It also referred to letters which he properly argued in this chamber he should be allowed to put forward. When he was not allowed to do so, he accepted that decision. So he has acted with propriety. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Following that publication on January 29, and another report on January 30, determined measures were taken to stifle further public discussion. On January 30 Westpac moved the Supreme Court of NSW for orders restraining the publishers of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age (which had also published details of the letters). Interim orders were readily granted by Justice Young restraining both newspapers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that word `readily' because the inference is that Mr Justice Young in some way was at the beck and call of Westpac, that in some way he did not do his duty, that in some way he ignored the public interest. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Attempts by this newspaper-and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which was made subject to similar orders-to have the injunction lifted have been firmly rejected, first by Justice Powell, and on Tuesday by Justices Samuels, Clarke and Hope sitting at the Court of Appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>Similar restraints were placed on other newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say this: not only is the inference that Mr Justice Young has in some way failed to do his duty but so has Mr Justice Powell and the Court of Appeal. No matter what the delinquencies of Westpac may be and may hereafter appear to be, it seems to me to be lacking in propriety to suggest, without sufficient evidence, that the courts and the judges who occupy those courts have in some way failed in their duty and even, may I say, neglected the public interest in the interests of a rich and powerful institution in this land. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, if this chamber ultimately accepts the letters that Senator McLean clearly and so vehemently believes should be introduced, it should do so with proper respect to the courts which have considered the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that at some stage those letters will become available by some means or other. Without having seen them, it seems to be appropriate that that occurs. But that is a different question to the one we are talking about today, which is the proper process that should be used to bring this matter before the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, based on the injunctions issued by the courts, it would be certainly in my view inappropriate at this stage to have the executive arm of government-that is the only arm of government that can do so-introduce a royal commission. It is to Senator McLean's credit that he has worked as hard as he has in this area. But in my view, in pressing as he has for a royal commission at this stage, he has pressed too readily to rush into a situation which is not appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the previous speakers for their contributions to the debate. I am conscious that some of them quite obviously found themselves with a lack of time and resources to adequately prepare for it. That was the difficulty that I was attempting to address earlier. However, we have had our debate and I would like to address some comments to the contributions of other senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will start with Senator McMullan. The essential thrust of the arguments against this proposition that there be a royal commission focus on the fact that the inquiry into the Australian banking industry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-the Martin Committee -is in place. Essentially, it was being argued that it will do the job for us. I admit that in my discussions with Mr Steve Martin, the Chairman of that Committee, he has suggested the same to me. I disagree with that for reasons that I will elaborate on. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is, I believe, that the Martin Committee has been convened to do other things. It may well be that, in that process, it will be revealed to it-and I would be very surprised if it is not-that there is sufficient concern and despair among Australians about the banking system as to warrant a royal commission. It may well be, as Senator Cooney just said, that that is an outcome. It may well be that the events of the past 72 hours and the debate in this chamber today will sharpen the focus of the Martin Committee on, particularly, managed foreign exchange loans. I am sure that evidence will come forward in the next few weeks that there has been rampant corruption in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that today we have done no more than simply sharpen the focus of that Committee. But I still argue that such a committee is under-resourced. It has already said that it will have to extend its reporting period from six months to 12 months. Senator McMullan has already acknowledged that submissions have been pouring in. I went around Australia pleading with people to make submissions to the Martin Committee because I trust its integrity. I believe that it will sharpen its focus. I believe that it will finally lead to a royal commission into banking. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept Senator Cooney's proposition that, perhaps, the route to go along is by a public inquiry with a recommendation for a royal commission. I hope that today's debate has sharpened the focus sufficiently to ensure that as an outcome. But I still say that the Committee is under-resourced to perform the enormous task which it has in front of it. I still say that it is lacking in the expertise to do so adequately. In the last 48 to 72 hours alone-and I am not a lawyer-I have had to cope with an extraordinary barrage of legal argument. That will be the nature of what these people are up against. I do not believe that, with the best intentions in the world, with the best hearts and minds that they can bring to the inquiry, they have the sort of expertise that will allow them, with all the integrity in the world, to address adequately the magnitude of this challenge that they have before them. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, I must say that in the final analysis the Committee will produce a report that will come back to the Parliament and be politicised in exactly the same way as all of the propositions that I have brought forward to this chamber over the past two years have been addressed in political terms. That is what has happened to that material; it has all been addressed with political perception, political minds and political attitudes. Sadly, I think that will be the outcome of a report that comes back to a parliament. Only a royal commission will have the resources, the expertise, the detachment, the objectivity and the non-political perception to deliver to Australia what it needs in relation to this enormous challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan said it can all be resolved in the courts. He should tell that to the people who have taken banks to courts. He should tell that to the thousands of bankrupt, demoralised and distressed people who have tried to take banks to courts. It is like sending good money after bad. The banks have got unlimited resources. They have got access to the best legal minds. They delay, they settle out of court. They extend the thing until people actually break under the strain of trying to resolve their problems in the courts. It is a futile exercise in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA> With the best intention in the world Senator Cooney, Senator McMullan and others may say that that is the way we should go. Senator Tate, as the Minister for Justice, has said that that is the way we should go, stating confidence in the judicial system, as he should. I frankly tell him that the human dimension of it is not like that. Let him tell Don Benson-who has been in my office over and over again and who cannot get legal aid because it is not available-to pursue commercial litigation. I interceded three times to Mr Wheeler, who would take the decision about legal aid, in saying that in the public interest Don Benson should be able to pursue his case in the court and get legal aid to do it. Last week he got a `no' answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Let him say that the courts are the way to go to Patricia Poulos who was told three days ago, when she went into court, by the judge that he would not consider her case unless she had legal representation. She stood in front of him and said, `I have spent $1m on legal representation trying to take on Westpac for years. I am broke. I am destitute. I am bankrupt and I cannot get legal aid'. He should tell those people that the courts are the way to go. I am sorry, the courts are not the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone says, `Offer solutions'. I am an elected member of parliament representing constituents. I am not the Treasurer of the land. He is the one who is supposed to provide the solutions to a corrupt bank system. I do not pretend to have the solutions. I think the challenge is of such magnitude that it has to be addressed by not only a bank inquiry, but eventually a royal commission out of which, when we know the dimensions of the problem and the realities of the problem in a non-political, non-emotional sense, we might be able to formulate some solutions to a sick, corrupt bank system. It is pathetic for us to be asked here to stand up and provide the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pursued the matter, as Senator Campbell said, vigorously. I think he said I was on a crusade. Of course I am on a crusade. I do not apologise for being on a crusade, it is a very important one to be on. I do not believe that Senator Campbell has read one single word of what I have put before the Senate in the last two years. Frankly, it is absurd to think he stands up here and says that he is adequately prepared even to address the proposition. He attacked my integrity and it was withdrawn. I thank Senator Cooney for saying that he believes that I have acted with propriety for the last two years. I thank him for that. That is pretty important to me; it keeps me going. </PARA>
<PARA> When all this is said and done, I can give the Senate some names. None of this brings any joy whatsoever to the hearts of people like Batiste, Gilliland, Rigg, Blake, Corrye, Bayes, Benson, Somerset and Rahme. I could go on and name the 80 people whose cases I have tabled in this Senate. There is no joy for them in what they have heard here today, many of whom have been before the courts. Many have suffered broken marriages and many have lived with the consequence of trying to deal with the people who have prostituted their fiduciary obligations to clients. There is no joy in what we have heard today for those people. I have had thousands of phone calls on this issue. I have had hundreds and hundreds of letters. I will read one to the Senate that I got today. I read it just before I walked in here. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator McLean,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to you primarily to encourage you to continue your efforts to see justice done in the ongoing saga of the ``Overseas Loans Affair''. It is heartening to myself and my wife that someone is prepared to stand up and be counted, and endeavour to see justice done against the corporate giants of our banking system. </PARA>
<PARA> Our own case is typical of so many of the cases involving small people. In 1984, I approached Westpac, Nowra for a loan of $250,000 to purchase a piece of farming land in South Australia for our daughter and son-in-law. The cost of the land was, in all, $360,000. I was told by the Bank that an offshore loan, in Swiss Francs, was ``the way to go'', as returns on rural land were low. I had no experience in this field, and had never heard of such loans. In fact, I had only borrowed small amounts of money for short periods of time prior to this. I had practised as a Dentist in Nowra all my life and had always banked with Westpac. I was subsequently told that the minimum loan was $500,000, that we had adequate assets, and I could invest the balance through the Bank and the loan would ``cost me nothing''! Being conservative people, my wife and I, after some deliberation, decided we did not wish to make money from the loan. At this stage the Bank manager was quite irate, and although finally agreeing to the reduced amount, said we would have to pay all costs etc., for both the original and new ``Facility Letter''. This we did and still possess these original documents, unsigned. The Loan was finalised for $250,000 on February 14th, 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of threatened penalties for early withdrawal, and the impact the whole affair was having on our health, we obtained a loan from A.N.Z. Nowra in August, 1986 and terminated our loan and all financial relationship with Westpac. During that 18 months we sought advice from Westpac officers in Sydney and Wollongong, but their attitude was deceptive, callous and non caring, and we were told to start liquidating our assets. It was a period in our lives we wish to forget. </PARA>
<PARA> As we knew in our hearts we had been wronged, we subsequently took action in the Supreme Court of N.S.W. Commercial Division, to recover our losses of some $330,000. We were encouraged by the Legal profession who felt we had a watertight case, and the Bank would settle ``out of court''. Of course it did not do so and employed top legal Council. After two days in the Witness Box, with no former experience in such happenings and deteriorating health, I withdrew from the case and subsequently paid Westpac expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> We now live a quiet lifestyle, our health has improved, but look back with horror on what occurred to us after a life of hard work. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know that similar experiences were had by hundreds of people around Australia from all walks of life, and whilst we may never see justice done in our own case, it is satisfying to know there are individuals like yourself who are prepared to pursue these matters. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a report into the death of a young man who died in custody on 5 July 1985, aged 26. The report shows that he had a most deprived life until the time of his death. What must be noted is that the death in this case and many others in prison-not only amongst Aboriginals but generally-occur amongst people whose background is deprived. We must be conscious of that fact and see that the remedy to a lot of the problems we have in gaols lies not simply in making the gaol a better place- although that is part of the problem-but in creating a society where everybody has an opportunity to take his or her proper place in the sun. I refer to page 4 of this report where it establishes what I am talking about. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The deceased was born in Townsville on 16 June 1959. His father was an Aboriginal man from Barambah (Cherbourg) Queensland. His mother, an Aboriginal woman, was from Cloncurry. The deceased was the youngest of five children. He, like some of the other children, took the maiden name of his mother. The parents were formally married in the European sense in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the year of his death. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>His youngest brother, Walter, resided in the Mosman Hall Psychiatric Hospital in Charters Towers for a number of years and died there in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>He was less than 26 when he died. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>He had one other brother and two sisters. </PARA>
<PARA> His father was an unskilled labourer who moved around a good deal in search of work. There is material from which one could draw the conclusion that the deceased's early life was difficult. He himself is reported as having said of his parents that both drank heavily and that there was a good deal of domestic violence. He was educated at State primary schools and left school at the age of 14 having completed Grade 7. He spent some time at least in an opportunity class. </PARA>
<PARA>Page 12 of the report, going on to page 13, gives the reasons for his being in gaol. They were all matters which arise from an inability to live a happy domestic life free, from drinking and from such things, all of which are consistent with a childhood and a young adulthood when he did not receive the proper example of how a happier life could be led. What comes out of this report, and many others, is the fact that the society in which we all live does contain glaring injustices which must be cured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support the comments made by Senator Cooney, in general terms. He has outlined the tragic circumstances that have been recorded on the death of this particular Aboriginal person. Having had some experience of working with Aboriginal people and knowing first hand of their difficulty in accommodating themselves to our legal system, which is entirely foreign to their culture, I believe that so far at least we have made insufficient provision in our legal system to accommodate the cultural values and the heritage of Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Shortly, the Senate will be considering legislation which seeks to attempt in one small area to engage in positive discrimination. I wish to say even now that the Australian Democrats will support that positive discrimination treatment of Aboriginal people, and that we should attempt to extend that into other areas of our legal and administrative systems. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to congratulate Australian Defence Industries Ltd (ADI) on this first report that it has made since it was set up in 1989. It took over the defence production operations of the Department of Defence on 3 May 1989, and so this report for the year 1989 to 30 June 1990 is on its first year of operations. It has a very pleasing result, being able to report having made a small after-tax profit in this first year of its operations. It is engaging already-and this is detailed in the report-in a major restructuring process. That has not been completed, so the fact that it was able to turn around what was a very heavily subsidised operation by the Defence budget into an operating profit without having completed that restructuring is a matter for congratulation of the new management and of the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The company still has a very large task ahead of it in carrying out the restructuring operation from what was clearly a very inefficient operation. Indeed, the report notes that in the last five years of operations under the Department of Defence there had been a loss-in the shape really of a subsidy for its operations-of over $1.3 billion. That is an indication of the task that has been presented to this company. It is already showing good results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the company, Mr Fynmore, notes in his report that this restructuring will be a rehabilitation exercise after many years of supervision by a succession of Government departments-I think he means largely by the Department of Defence. Of course, the obvious question that arises from this experience of the company and from the report-as clearly outlined here-is the fact that the operation of the former Defence factories production facilities was very inefficient. If that is now clearly established by this experience of commercialising these operations, one must ask how many other Defence related facilities will be labouring under the same poor management. It is quite clear that there is a major task of restructuring many aspects of the Defence Force's infrastructure. It will be a daunting task but it extends from logistics supply to communications and maintenance operations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a task that simply must be undertaken. This report indicates that it can be successfully turned around from loss making to, as I said here, even a small profit. So the message of this report is that there is an urgent need for the Government to tackle this problem and, although it is being tackled in relation to this particular Defence function, it needs to be tackled in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of matters that arise out of the report that the Government has to tackle quickly. One is the capital structure for ADI, which has taken over many properties and production facilities but is burdened with a loan from the Government to cover those assets. The loan is interest free, but it is not a very satisfactory way for a company's capital structure to be commenced. The Government really must get onto solving that. The other matter relates to the restructuring process. I believe that the company is on the right track with this process and it should be supported by the Government in its efforts to implement what is a very difficult and, in many cases, sensitive process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tabling of this report is very timely, coming so soon after the speech by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to the National Press Club in February in which he said that a major lesson for the future relates to the need to control and reduce the international arms trade. I realise that much of the output of Australian Defence Industries Ltd (ADI) is geared to the requirements of the Australian Defence Force, but it has also been a component of the Government's push to double military exports. For example, at the Asian Defence Services Exhibition in Bangkok in December 1990, ADI was advertising its latest mortars, promising `a 25 per cent increase in lethality'. At this exhibition there were 200 companies from 24 countries, while customers included the infamous Chief of Intelligence of Burma's military junta and a representative of the Cambodian guerilla army. Given the concern of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about Myanmar and Cambodia, I find it ironic that ADI was peddling its wares in the company of such customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister for Defence is reconsidering his Department's support for the Australian International Defence Export Exhibition 1991 in Canberra this November, then perhaps he should also consider the Department's active support for arms bazaars in the region. Conversely, arms bazaars, which used to be commonplace in northern hemisphere countries, especially North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, have often been cancelled owing to community pressure. So a major arms race is under way in our region, the same region where `the threat ` to Australia is supposed to come from, and here we are peddling our mortars and other military equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last year the United States of America Arms Control and Disarmament Agency pointed out that South East Asia was emerging as the growth area for world arms transfers, having increased its share of the world total from 6 per cent of arms sales in 1977 to 23 per cent in 1987. That is quite a big jump. The Middle East is an obvious exception. Australia wanted to get in on this market as well. Following the South East Asia industrial mission in December 1988, Australian Defence Industries opened its first overseas branch in Kuala Lumpur in March 1990. It is interesting to note that the Manager was formerly Defence Attache at the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. </PARA>
<PARA> Another dispute concerning ADI during the past year has been in regard to its efforts to sell 76 millimetre ammunition to Sri Lanka, a tragic country torn asunder in recent years by a bloody civil war. Fortunately, Senator Ray stepped in to stop the sale last July after details were leaked to Channel 7, but it should not have ever got to that stage. Another ADI product which the management hopes to promote is the rifle pictured on page one of this report, the Austeyr F88 assault rifle. The company has rights to sell this weapon in the Asia-Pacific region as well as other parts of the world, although I note that in terms of exports it has so far sold some 18,000 to New Zealand, as indicated on page 11 of this report, and that has been its major market. </PARA>
<PARA> In economic terms, I realise that ADI made a profit this year, as Senator Durack said, but the trade journal Defence Industry warned in December last year that individual enterprises are having much more difficulty than was first anticipated in translating defence related production skills into defence related exports. According to Trevor Thomas, editor of Defence Industry, this is particularly the case because of the shrinking of the international defence market, forcing a concentration of overseas competition into the South East Asian region, originally considered of significant potential for Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director noted the difficulties of sales in South East Asia in his review of operations on page four, confirming the Defence Minister's warning that detente in Europe would mean a flood of arms into South East Asia. This is not something that I think we should be happy about. I welcome the Defence Minister's concern about the international arms trade. However, I point out once again the contradiction with his desire to promote defence industries in Australia which can only keep prices down by exports. This economic logic, of course, applies to all other companies in this field around the world, so I suggest that ADI could usefully look at ideas for economic conversion in the year ahead with a view to transforming its image and producing socially useful goods for export. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague Senator Durack in commenting on the report of Australian Defence Industries Ltd (ADI), and I welcome the fact that new management procedures are clearly in place. I find it quite intriguing that the Commonwealth is not currently charging any interest to ADI on the loan that has been left in. This compares quite keenly with the arrangements which were made for the Defence Housing Authority, which was set up with $750m only to find that it was a loan, not a grant, and it was at market rates. I have mentioned that before in this place, and I think that Senator Tate is mentioning it, but it is intriguing that the two organisations should be treated so differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Chairman said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>The task of rehabilitating a business of this size after many years of supervision by a succession of government departments is not to be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. The restructuring which is under way is badly needed and the enormity of the task is almost appalling. I am glad to see that two of the divisions in the new company look as if they have a future, whereas there are two that are going to have great difficulties in dealing with productivity and the rigidities within union structures that are standing in the way, as is mentioned in the Managing Director's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention the multi-year contracts which this organisation is now signing with the Department of Defence. It is an excellent idea so that both parties can plan production, investment, financing, et cetera, and it is one that I certainly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about this operating profit after tax for the year because when I looked at it closely I found that without the interest contribution from the short term deposits, the company would in fact have shown a loss. These short term deposits were for funds which were needed to compensate the company for the large loss-making contracts it inherited from the Commonwealth. It was only in May last year at the additional Estimates hearing that I was asking questions about these costly contracts which had to be taken over. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate part of the answer that I received at the Estimates hearing at the time, which lists the major projects which were undertaken by the former factories and which have been taken over by ADI and which have required large compensation payments to ADI in order to make it profitable. </PARA>

<PARA>I concur with the Managing Director's statement that the restructuring of the ammunition and heavy engineering businesses will provide the key to future profitability. The ammunition division is very concerning. There have been problems in the past with quality control. There have been questions about deliveries. There is a problem with the balance between commercial and defence imperatives. This is one area where the commercial imperatives are being challenged by the need for defence objectives to be incorporated. It is something that will have to be resolved but it will be extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that the clothing section is now under way with the new female army uniforms. That is something I have been pushing for a long time but I question whether the clothing component of the factory justifiably remains in government control. It seems to me that it would be more appropriate if it were out in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Naval engineering is an area which has its outlook clouded by pressures on the Defence budget. The implication of the two-ocean naval policy and the potential entry of more companies into the refit business means that the outlook is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA> We should give attention to the weapons and engineering section. Almost all its major projects are under licence from foreign countries. We have licences from Austria, Belgium and the United Kingdom. We need innovation in this country. It is urgent that the skills and abilities of personnel in Australia are harnessed so that we are no longer dependent upon the brains of other countries. This is supposed to be the clever country. We should be getting the benefits of licensing our innovations to others. I know that the quality of the barrels produced in Lithgow, for example, are of great value to small businesses around Australia, notably in my home State of Tasmania, at Kempton. Indeed, the work is first class. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a few comments on the Advances to the Minister for Finance for December 1990 and January 1991 and the supporting applications for the issue from those Advances. </PARA>
<PARA> On numerous previous occasions I have noted with concern the use increasingly made in recent years of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for purposes which I think can very well be argued are contrary to the legal position so far as the use of the Advance is concerned. Advances to the Minister for Finance are supposed to be only for payments which are `unforeseen and/or urgent'. There have been numerous examples in recent years where those criteria quite obviously have not been met. </PARA>
<PARA> Over several years now we have had examples of payments to the States under special deals made around the table at the Premiers Conference in June each year. In all instances these deals have been made with States that have Labor governments; the three States concerned being Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. In all those instances, deals have been made under the table at the Premiers Conference. The funds have been allocated, so-called urgently, despite the fact that the requirements for them have been known for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of putting the payments through the Advance to the Minister for Finance is that they escape much of the normal public scrutiny of expenditure by the Government which occurs if the normal Appropriation procedures are followed. I take this opportunity to call again on the Government to look very closely at the legality of what it is doing in its use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents before the chamber also highlight some of the extra payments that the Government did not anticipate at the time it drew up the 1990-91 Budget. For example, the figures contain an amount of $22.1m, which has been paid through the Advance to the Minister for Finance for the Australian Tourism Commission to produce and run television and print consumer advertising programs in Australia's key overseas tourist markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst welcoming that very worthwhile initiative-and the Opposition supported and welcomed it at the time-it is important to note that it is a very large amount of money. It should have been subjected to the normal budgetary consideration processes. But I find it quite incredible that the Government did not include it in its August 1990 Budget, which was delivered only four months prior to the Government's decision to make that payment in December. I think this is yet another example of the way in which the Government is demonstrating at the moment a total lack of fiscal responsibility and, even more seriously, a level of incompetence in the management of its financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday in the Senate Senator Cook said, `We have already run a very, very tight fiscal ship'. If this sort of payment to the Tourist Commission-and there are many others in the Advances to which I could draw the chamber's attention had I the time-is any example of the Government's definition of `very, very tight', it is no wonder that the Budget for this year has unravelled to the enormous extent that it has. It is no wonder that the Australian economy, as a result of that plus other mismanagement by the Government of its policies-let alone the policies themselves-have brought the Australian economy to its knees. </PARA>
<PARA> I would mention one other payment in the time available, and that is the extraordinary act of grace payment to Australia Post of $15,294 for outstanding accounts for postal services provided to members of Parliament prior to 3 May 1990. The supporting application from the Department of Administrative Services to this payment says:</PARA>
<PARA> Following advice from the Attorney-General's Department on 18 May</PARA>
<PARA>of 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>this Department ceased payments to Australia Post on behalf of members who had expended in excess of their $9,000 entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will recall that Parliament has had considerable debate on the extraordinary payments made just prior to the last election by way of increased postage allowances to members of the House of Representatives. Quite obviously, those payments were made to Labor members in the many marginal seats held at that time to enable them to flood their electorates with the additional postage. The payment was subsequently ruled illegal by the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Why would the Attorney-General's Department advise the Department of Administrative Services to cease making these payments to Australia Post in the way that it did? The answer would appear to be that Attorney-General's was obviously advising caution until the matter was settled. This was despite the Government's assertions in response to questioning last year by the coalition that its decision to write off the amounts was based on the Solicitor-General's advice that the Government was legally able to do so. That advice, of course, was subsequently produced into the Parliament, very belatedly after continual pressure from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I note this payment; I have only just come across it in the last couple of hours and it is certainly something I will pursue because it looks very odd. I believe it is another example of the way in which the Advance to the Minister for Finance is being used to cloak the normal, proper public scrutiny of the use of taxpayers' money. These statements should be subject to much greater scrutiny than they are. They should be used much more properly than they are. I believe it is a subject that warrants the continuing attention of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I table the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Having been a member of the delegation that went to Scandinavia, my greatest recommendation to honourable senators is that if they get the opportunity to become a member of such a delegation at any stage they should do so. The delegation visited Scandinavia between 20 October and 9 November. It was certainly a most educational, enjoyable, politically advantageous and interesting visit. The countries, while all have relatively small populations, have had a fairly wide influence throughout the world over a long time. Quite a number of Australians originated in those countries. The people are very compatible one with another, and from the point of view of tourism the countries are attractive to one another also. It is noticeable that, amongst the Swedes alone, 40,000 come to Australia every year. Socially, the Scandinavian standards have been promoted widely. Scandinavia has often been referred to as a workers' paradise, and many social issues that have been discussed and implemented around the world reputedly come from the Scandinavian countries-for richer, for poorer. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of the four countries it was noticeable that the wages were very high-much higher than in our country-as was unemployment. They were in the phase of a decline in manufacturing as a result. Their governments have heavy industry support, and the economies of all the countries are still basically dependent on primary industry. They have specialised in high quality, high-priced goods, and they have done that very well. Everything there was very expensive to us. For instance, we noticed that items such as a fairly average quality lunch would possibly run to the order of $70 to $90 Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> The social benefits payments are very high and, of course, that brings with it quite high abuse in a system of such a nature. For instance, in discussion with officials of the Stockholm City Council, which employs 70,000 people, we were told that at any stage they would have 24,000 people absent. The other half of that is that the employees do not have to check in until they have been off work for five days. That means that from Sweden one could go to the Swiss Alps for 10 days-leave on a Friday night and come back the following Sunday week-without the need to notify the employer of the absence. As a result, the economies in the area are struggling. We have the same problems that they have; they have been doing it a little longer than we have. It is very difficult to maintain incentive and national debts are very high. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited the parliaments of all four countries. Their systems are quite different from ours and, of course, quite different from one another-except that they are all unicameral parliaments and in each case they have varying degrees of proportional election. I found it quite interesting that they do not have the Westminster type of seating with the adversarial arrangement that we have. They usually have a semi-circular parliament with the President or the Speaker, or whoever it is, in the middle of the long wall. I found it interesting that in one of the parliaments the members sit according to their electorates and not according to their parties. It would probably be advantageous in many cases in that people would treat the person beside them a lot more courteously than they treat the person opposite them, as in our situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited the submarine project and looked at the progress that has been made on our $3.9 billion six submarine project at Kockums. We inspected paper mills and took a particular interest in the question of waste disposal, so that we were able to provide better advice, or better comment, about what is likely to happen with future pulp or paper mills in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We then visited a business the whole function of which is waste disposal. We found that a most interesting project. It is a business that I would dearly love to see come to Australia and, if possible, be established here on some sort of joint venture arrangement. As a result of the visit, I have had discussions with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and arranged contact between the people involved at both ends. I am looking forward to the Finns coming to Australia to follow that up. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited schools in both Sweden and Denmark and were most impressed with the way that they were operated, as distinct from ours, particularly the one in Denmark. It was very much a community centre. It operated from 7.30 a.m. to about 11 p.m. It dealt with students from the age of about 14 upwards. It had a complete integration of all types of courses. It included not only the school library but also the municipal library, all in one. It had theatres; it had training areas for senior management people; and a 25-unit motel was attached for visitors who went there for courses so they could reside on the premises while they were working. One of the big advantages of this is that it prevents the gap that is created when students move from one place of education to another. From the time that students get into reasonable secondary education they are able to stay in the one place until they have finished. It also provides them with excellent training facilities; it has a mixture of everything from engineering to acting. The whole thing was most impressive. There is a considerable amount that the Scandinavians could teach us. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited a sports institute. We were given a taste of the country's culture. We were taken to see Tosca at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm. We went to the ballet Midsummer Night's Dream in the Copenhagen Royal Theatre. We saw the viking ship museum and many other things. I was particularly interested in a gentleman called Mr Tapio Perianen, the director of the Finnish Society of Crafts and Design. He has done an enormous amount to improve the way things are done in the manufacturing of furniture, fabrics, ceramics and glassware. He is interested in better design and better construction. It is really most interesting to see the result this has had in the community at large. A few years ago this gentleman went to Tasmania. He made a great impression there. He has helped people in these areas very considerably. I would like to think that he could come back to see the results of the seeds that were sown by him at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The agricultural system of these countries must be mentioned. After Japan, Finland and Norway are the two most highly subsidised agricultural countries in the world. The average subsidy for every farmer in Finland is over $A25,000. I understand this because Finland wants to keep its farmers in the country. It does not want them to drift into the towns. The only way that this can be done, with land that is rather poor and not capable of very high production, is to pay them virtually a social security payment. This is done by assisting production. This does not suit us but I understand why it is done. The same thing applies in many of the other European countries such as France, Germany and Austria. The success of the Uruguay Round seems to be a long way off when one understands the circumstances behind it. Whilst this does not suit us, I understand the view and accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited many beautiful buildings and we enjoyed lovely scenery. We were most impressed by the way our two ambassadors, Ian Nicholson in Sweden and Jeff Benson in Denmark, assisted us and by the very high standing they had in their communities. I understand that Mr Benson has now come back to Canberra. They had a very good reputation. It is very good to go overseas and see that our representatives are so highly thought of. </PARA>
<PARA> The hospitality of the countries that we went to was absolutely tremendous. The way that they looked after us, transported us and entertained us was excellent, as were the hotels. It was a wonderful 20 days. As I have said before, I recommend to anybody who can get a trip like this to do so. What was important and what greatly assisted was the fact that the group was most compatible. Caroline Jakobsen was a good leader and Peter Grundy an excellent manager and secretary. </PARA>

<PARA>CRIMES (INVESTIGATION OF COMMONWEALTH OFFENCES) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the High Court decided the Williams case (161 CLR 278), in which the central issue was whether, after his arrest, the suspect was detained longer than was reasonably necessary to enable him to be brought before a magistrate. He was arrested early one morning. The police were satisfied that he was responsible for several burglaries in the northern area of Tasmania. The relevant State law provided that he should be taken before a justice as soon as practicable. At the police station he was questioned both about the crimes in respect of which he was arrested and about a number of other crimes, and he made a number of admissions. He was eventually charged on 26 counts in relation to those other offences, as well as the crimes for which he was arrested. He was taken before a magistrate at 10 am the following morning. </PARA>
<PARA>The trial Judge was satisfied that the confessions were voluntarily made, but in his discretion, he rejected them. He held that Williams was wrongfully detained because he was subjected to lengthy questioning about matters other than those for which he was arrested. The High Court, however, held on appeal that ``as soon as practicable'' gave no power to question an arrested person about the offence for which he had been arrested or other offences and did not make justifiable a delay which resulted only from the fact that the arresting officer wished to question him. It had previously been taken for granted that an arrested suspect could be questioned about an offence in the course of deciding upon a charge or charges before taking him or her before a magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA>This decision has created a real and serious dilemma for me. I come to the Parliament with two important competing responsibilities: my responsibility to maintain and defend the civil liberties which we have inherited through the centuries in our common law, and my responsibility to ensure that the laws made by the Parliament are able to be properly enforced, so as to afford appropriate protection to the community. Law enforcement agencies cannot be expected to function effectively with their hands tied behind their backs. Not only must they be able to investigate and prosecute offences effectively, but they need to ensure that they do not proceed to invoke the inexorable machinery of prosecution against a suspect, with all the suffering and expense for the person that that entails, when an early period of questioning and investigation may disclose that prosecution is not justified. </PARA>
<PARA>The solution which satisfies me, and which I trust will satisfy the Parliament, appropriately balances these competing interests in a just and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA>That solution, which I find most fair, balanced and workable, is to provide for a maximum period during which an arrested person may be held for questioning or investigation before being taken before a magistrate. Within that maximum is a defined ``investigation period'' which is a period of active audio/video-recorded questioning or investigation regarding the relevant offence or offences, reasonably appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>The specified period is a maximum period in which a person may, unless a longer period is authorised by a magistrate, be held in custody before being brought before a magistrate. I emphasise the word maximum. It is not a period during which the police may simply hold the person; even within that period the time for which the person is held must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. Any gaps in time apparent from the audio/video-recording would need to be stringently accounted for, even though occurring within the permitted maximum, though some provision may be made for ``dead time'' which I will explain later. As well as the tape-recording, other safeguards are built in-communication with friend, relative and legal practitioner, a right to have the latter present during the investigation period, and special protection for vulnerable groups which I will go into later. </PARA>
<PARA>If an extension of the investigation period is required, which I would expect on the basis of experience in other jurisdictions to be rare, it may be granted for a further finite period up to 8 hours, by a magistrate, or, where a magistrate is unavailable, a justice of the peace, who must be satisfied that this is justified in the particular circumstances of the case. The suspect is entitled to make representations to the judicial officer. Where an extension application is made by telephone or other electronic means, procedural safeguards similar to the usual provisions relating to telephone applications for search warrants must be complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>Any periods of custody of the same person within any 48 hour period, whether for the same or different Commonwealth offences, must, in the aggregate, be within the relevant permissible investigation period. Briefly, that is the outline of my proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>In reaching the position I have just put before you I surveyed, and will share with you, the background against which the issues dealt with in this Bill arise, the work already done in the area by others, and the efforts of other jurisdictions to solve the dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA>As you are aware, section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 applies the law of the particular State or Territory in respect of the arrest, custody, examination and trial of persons apprehended for Commonwealth offences. </PARA>
<PARA>The laws of the States and Territories are becoming increasingly diverse and based on different approaches of principle. This is particularly apparent in the area of post-arrest procedures where there is wide variation in the degree of safeguards provided by legislation extending the permissible period of pre-charge detention. Further divergence is likely to be created by the introduction of corresponding legislation in the remaining jurisdictions. The various State and Territory legislative measures taken regarding pre-charge detention were mainly introduced, as is the present Bill, to deal with the problems crystallised in the Williams case. </PARA>
<PARA>The result of that decision is that, subject to the exception I will mention later, where a confession is obtained from a suspect while he or she is in police custody after the time when it has become reasonably practicable to bring him or her before a magistrate, that confession is liable to be rejected in the discretion of the trial Judge as having been unlawfully or unfairly obtained. The exception is where legislation, either Commonwealth or applied State or Territory legislation, lays down a different rule. </PARA>
<PARA>Four of the five Judges in the Williams case refer to the need to strike a balance between the requirements of effective law enforcement and the long-standing common law protection of personal freedom. They express awareness, too, of the difficulties presented by complex investigations. In this context Mason and Brennan JJ in their joint judgment point out that ``if the legislature thinks it right to enhance the armoury of law enforcement, at least the legislature is able-as the courts are not-to prescribe some safeguards . . . '' (at 296). Wilson and Dawson JJ also recognised that the policy issues involved were properly the province of this Parliament. They said: ``if the law requires modification then it is better done . . . by legislation for there must be safeguards, if necessary in the form of time limits, and they must be set with a particularity which cannot be achieved by judicial decision'', (at 313). </PARA>
<PARA>The questions which I, and the Parliament, have to face are, first, whether we should move at all to alter the effect of the decision of the High Court in the Williams case, and secondly, if we do so, what should be the manner of the intervention, best to balance the community's interest in effective law enforcement and the interest in maintaining high standards of criminal justice in which individual rights are given appropriate protection and respect. </PARA>
<PARA>Law and practice in this area have been uncertain and unsatisfactory since well before the Williams case. In 1975 the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on criminal investigation noted that, although the common law principle that an arrested person must be brought before a magistrate without unreasonable delay had been given statutory expression in most jurisdictions in Australia, the words used to delimit the permissible time period were variable and imprecise. Judicial interpretation of a permissible time ranged from holding ``forthwith'' to mean exactly that in Drymalik v Feldman [1966] SASR 227 (that is, no time at all for interrogation, similar to the Williams position) to holding permissible a time which extended several hours after it became practicable to bring the person before a magistrate, in R v Banner [1970] VR 240. </PARA>
<PARA>Police practice was similarly variable, and the Law Reform Commission found that one of the most frequently voiced complaints against the police was unnecessarily prolonged custody, in some cases up to 3 days on minor public order charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be a precise time limit set for police custodial investigation. It set this at 4 hours with some provision for ``dead time''. ``Dead time'' means those periods of time which it is considered appropriate to exclude from the calculation of the investigation period, as they are all periods when investigations should not, in fairness, take place. They include direct travel time to the police station, time arranging communication with family, friend or lawyer, and time spent waiting for the attendance of a lawyer or prisoner's friend. They also recommended provision for extension of time, in appropriate circumstances, by application to a magistrate, (by telephone if necessary), in no circumstances to exceed a further 8 hours. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission was well aware of, and gave careful consideration to, the objection that any acceptance of post-arrest investigation is undesirable because it is a retreat from the common law principle that arrest marks the point of executive commitment, when there should be a reduction, not an expansion of police power, and when the Judicial arm should take over as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Subject to the dissent of Mr F G Brennan, QC, as he then was, who would have preferred to increase police powers prior to, rather than after, arrest, the Commission felt that this argument was outweighed by other considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>In September 1988 the Committee Reviewing Commonwealth Criminal Law chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs, was asked to report specifically on the issue of detention of a suspect by investigating officers for the period necessary to complete an investigation, and on the issue of introducing a requirement that confessions be tape-recorded. The Committee's report was presented in February 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>In the course of its deliberations the Committee considered the history of the responses to the problem in other jurisdictions. There are essentially two approaches to defining a period of pre-charge detention. One involves providing a reasonable investigation period within a specified maximum period, (with or without allowance for ``dead time''), usually with provision for its extension by application to a magistrate in appropriate circumstances. The other allows a reasonable period of pre-charge detention and provides statutory criteria to define those matters which may be taken into account in deciding what constitutes a reasonable time in all the circumstances of a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>Victoria provides an example of the actual operation of both approaches. The history of the Victorian legislation began in 1983, even before the High Court's decision in the Williams case, after confessional evidence had been held inadmissible in several cases as having been obtained during a period of unlawful detention. </PARA>
<PARA>A committee was appointed, chaired by the then State Director of Public Prosecutions, now Mr Justice Phillips, to address the problem. That committee recommended legislative amendments to provide for a maximum period of six hours, which could be extended on application to a magistrate with the consent of the arrested person. These recommendations were put into effect by amendments to section 460 of the Crimes Act 1953 (Vic) in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>After a period of close monitoring, the police compiled a report detailing a number of deficiencies in the operation of the amendments, and the consultative committee was reconvened under Mr Coldrey QC, Mr Phillips' successor as Director of Public Prosecutions, to examine the effectiveness of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Coldrey Committee recommended that a reasonable time be substituted for the specified maximum period, and that practical criteria be provided to guide the courts in assessing the conduct of the investigators. The maximum period was considered insufficient for major investigations into complex crimes and multiple offences. It also required the interruption of the continuity of the interview or investigation to seek an application for extension of time, and, generally, lacked flexibility. The committee's recommendations were enacted in 1988. It should be noted that the Victorian fixed time provision made no allowance for ``dead time''. </PARA>
<PARA>The law as it stands at present, as is reflected in the conclusions of all the committees which have published reports on the issue, manifestly fails to take into account the legitimate needs of the police in their investigations of crime, particularly of complex and serious crime. It is necessary to make provision in the system for the realities of police investigatory requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Both the Law Reform Commission and the Gibbs Committee were well aware of the concern that by providing for a lawful period of custodial detention there might be a tendency for the maximum permissible period to become the norm, thus endangering civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Coldrey QC, in his report of April 1986 on the Phillips amendment to section 460 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), quoted research findings on a similar Scottish provision for a fixed maximum of six hours pre-charge detention, in operation since 1980. The findings were that the average time a suspect spent at the police station, despite the permissible six-hour maximum was 2 hours and 15 minutes, 20% spent less than one hour and 50% of all detentions lasted less than two hours. Coldrey found that over 99.5% of investigations under the Victorian provisions took place within the six hours but no break-down of figures within that period was available. </PARA>
<PARA>Having reviewed the legislative and case-law history of the pre-charge situation, the Gibbs Review Committee formed the clear opinion that the law should provide investigating officers with a reasonable opportunity to interrogate an arrested person, and conduct other necessary investigations, before taking the arrested person before a magistrate. It quoted Wilson and Dawson JJ in the Williams case as recognising that ``the restrictions placed by the law on the purpose for which an arrested person may be kept in custody have on occasions hampered the police, sometimes seriously, in their investigation of crime and the institution of proceedings for prosecution. And these are functions which are carried out by the police, not for some private end, but in the interests of the whole community'' (at 312). </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee pointed out that the questioning of suspected persons is not in itself an evil, but a necessary and very important part of law enforcement. Objection can only be taken to the use of compulsion to answer questions and to unfair or oppressive methods of questioning, and it is these risks associated with extended pre-charge detention that the safeguards in the proposed legislation address. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations of the Review Committee relating to safeguards which are reflected in the Bill include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> provision for the customary caution that the person in custody does not have to say, or do, anything, but that anything he or she does say or do may be given in evidence, the caution to be given in, or translated into, a language in which the person is fluent, where necessary;</PARA>
<PARA> provision for the person, before the commencement of questioning or investigation, to communicate with a friend or relative, and with a lawyer, and for a lawyer to be present during investigations involving the arrested person, subject to some specified conditions;</PARA>
<PARA> special provisions for the protection of young persons, foreign nationals and Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA> provisions requiring persons in custody to be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity, and prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment;</PARA>
<PARA> provisions requiring electronic tape-recording of interviews, a copy to be made available to the arrested person. </PARA>
<PARA>Both the Law Reform Commission and the Gibbs Committee also recommended the incorporation of measures to control any possible tendency for police to allow the maximum to become the norm. The Commission favoured a formulation requiring police to take a person before a magistrate, or make a release or bail decision ``as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event longer than four hours'' after the commencement of custody. The Gibbs Committee suggested a provision ``that the `investigation period', for which the person may be detained, be defined as a period, not exceeding the specified maximum, during which that person is detained for the purpose of investigating whether he or she has committed an offence'', that is, a period during which active questioning or investigation is taking place directly related to an offence for which that person is being held. </PARA>
<PARA>The investigation period is not intended to provide time in which a person may be simply held in custody while police engage in other activities to which they accord a higher priority. The time is provided for active investigation with participation by the suspect on a voluntary basis, and if the permissible fixed time (after allowance for any ``dead time'') is improperly used, evidence obtained even within that period may be inadmissible. In other words, even within the investigation period, the time for which the person is held must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the usual civil damages remedy remains available, and an externally enforceable police discipline code may be invoked as provided by the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. If a person who is being held, being involved in active investigation or questioning, withdraws his or her voluntary cooperation in the investigation, this fact will be electronically recorded and if confessional material is later obtained, even within the permitted period, there is a real likelihood of its being held inadmissible if the prosecution is unable to discharge its onus of proving the voluntariness of the confession and the propriety of the ``investigation period''. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the most potent safeguard against abuse of the custodial investigation period is the tape-recording requirement. The caution and any other information required to be given to the person under the legislation must also be recorded, together with the person's response, if any, prior to the commencement of the interview. Subject to judicial discretion exercisable in the interests of justice, no confessional evidence will be admissible unless the tape-recording requirements are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>The equipment to be used by the Australian Federal Police, and other Commonwealth investigators subject to the proposed legislation, for the tape-recording of interviews is intended to be composite audio/video-recorders with a built-in, tamper-proof timing device which will show the time and duration of all recorded interviews. Any gaps in time, not identifiable as ``dead time'' (which would usually be independently verifiable) would need to be strictly accounted for, even within the permissible fixed period. </PARA>
<PARA>``Dead time'', as recommended by the Gibbs Committee, is time to be disregarded in the calculation of the ``investigation period'', and an exhaustive list of those periods of time is to be found in proposed subsection 23c(6) in clause 3 of the Bill: reasonable travel time to the nearest premises with the required facilities from the place where the person is taken into custody, any period required to allow the person to communicate with persons that he or she is entitled to contact under provisions of the Act relevant to him or her, any period reasonably required to allow such persons to arrive at the place where questioning is to take place, periods required for the person to be questioned, to receive medical attention or to recover from intoxication, or any period during which an application for extension of time is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA>The maximum periods in the Bill vary slightly from the Gibbs Committee recommendations. It is proposed that no distinction be made between summary and serious offences in relation to the maximum permissible period of detention, which is set at 4 hours. The Committee recommended a 4-hour maximum in respect of summary offences and a 6-hour maximum in respect of serious offences. The reason for not following that recommendation is that such a distinction may lead to evidentiary problems in situations where a person was arrested in respect of a serious offence but, in the final analysis, a charge of a summary offence may be more appropriate. It would be unfortunate in such a case if a more serious charge were adhered to in order to try to ensure that evidence would be admitted. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also proposed that the maximum period for which a young person, that is a person under 18 years of age, or an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander, may be held for voluntary participation in questioning or investigation in relation to any Commonwealth offence, be 2 hours. That questioning, of course, will take place subject to the special provisions in the Bill for the protection of young persons and Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders which essentially involves a right to the presence during any questioning of an ``interview friend'' (specifically defined for each group), whether or not the person has been taken into custody in any of the ways defined. The two hour maximum period will also be subject, as in all appropriate cases involving serious offences (that is, offences punishable by more than 12 months imprisonment) to extension by a magistrate for a period not exceeding a further 8 hours. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the bill proposes that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders be subject to similar special provisions to those found suitable for young persons may strike some as patronising and some as discriminating in an unfair way against non-Aboriginals or non-Torres Strait Islanders. The intention is, and the operation of the provision should be, neither of these things. Firstly, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders come from a vast range of backgrounds, and any particular background may not be apparent superficially to a member of the police. An Aboriginal person from a remote, traditionally-oriented part of Australia may visit friends or relatives in the city, as may a country-dweller. When Forster J first formulated the Anunga rules for the questioning of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in R v Anunga ((1976) 11 ALR 412 at 414), he emphasised that he was ``not expressing the view that Aboriginal people are any less intelligent than white people but simply that their concepts of certain things and the way in which they are expressed may be wholly different to those of white people''. Even if they understand the words, they may not understand the concepts which the English words and phrases express. Cultural values of polite agreement and deference to authority may also affect responses to questioning. Protection in these circumstances is justified as a special measure under Article 1(4) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Furthermore, the Interim Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody refers specifically to the risks associated with the initial period in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>If an investigating official has reasonable grounds for believing that such a person's level of education and understanding is such that he or she is not at any disadvantage in comparison to members of the Australian community generally, then the official is not required to comply with the special provisions; however, he or she should bear in mind that cultural as well as purely linguistic factors may contribute to disadvantage and that the onus will be on the prosecution to prove that the investigating official had reasonable grounds for the belief. </PARA>
<PARA>Other departures from the Gibbs Review Committee's draft Bill are mainly matters of drafting or made for the purpose of clarifying the way in which the provisions are intended to work in practice, particularly given that the Commonwealth legislation has to operate against a background of State and Territory law. A detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum and here I have addressed only its more significant aspects. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the whole emphasis of the proposed legislation is on achieving, with proper and adequate safeguards, that necessary balance between the reasonable requirements of law enforcement and the protection of the rights of individuals which the High Court, constrained to interpret and apply the existing law, acknowledged that it was for the legislature to determine. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislation is essential to provide this balance. The law applying to persons arrested for Commonwealth offences in different parts of Australia is highly divergent and can be expected to become more so as other jurisdictions enact legislation to resolve the problems exposed by the Williams case. Different results can occur in different jurisdictions in similar Commonwealth cases. </PARA>
<PARA>I consider that the concept of a strictly defined reasonable investigation period within a specified maximum period of permissible pre-charge detention, with appropriate provision for ``dead time'', and provision for extension by a magistrate in those very few complex cases where it may be necessary is, of all possible solutions to the Williams problem, the one which best balances, within a democratic society, the community's interest in effective law enforcement and the rights and freedoms of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of mandatory tape-recording of interview with suspects is the best kind of safeguard against any possible abuse of the extended pre-charge period. Together with rights of communication with a friend or relative, (with special provision for the protection of young persons, foreign nationals, and Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders), and rights of consultation with, and the presence of, a legal practitioner, the uniform and mandatory tape-recording of interviews provides the best guarantee of fairness in investigatory procedures operating in Australia at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>I must emphasise that nothing in the proposed legislation alters the law so as to give police a power to detain involuntarily a person who is not under arrest. The Bill does not extend powers of arrest. The right to refuse to participate in questioning or investigation is preserved. The onus remains on the prosecution to prove the voluntariness of a confession and the court retains its discretion to exclude unfairly, illegally or improperly obtained evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The only financial implications arising from the Bill concern the cost of electronic recording which will be required by proposed sections 23U and 23V. It is estimated that the costs involved will be $2,625,000 in 1990/91 and $804,000 in 1991/92. These costs relate to equipment (including cassettes and editing, enhancement and reproduction facilities), building alterations and transcription. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for amendments to the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971 to</PARA>
<PARA> increase the maximum rate of the research and development levy to one dollar per each pig slaughtered and</PARA>
<PARA> the maximum rate of levy for marketing and promotion purposes to two dollars and fifty cents per pig slaughtered. </PARA>
<PARA>The levies are used to partially fund the operations of the Pig Research and Development Corporation and to fully fund the Australian Pork Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Both levy increases have been requested by the Australian Pork Producers' Federation, which is the recognised body representing levy payers. </PARA>
<PARA>Like a number of the levy collection Acts for the industries within my portfolio, this Act provides for the maximum levy chargeable to be contained in the Act and for the operative level of levy to be set by regulation up to that maximum amount. </PARA>
<PARA>The present operational levy rates for research and promotion are at or near the maximum rates provided in the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971. Increasing the maximum rates will give industry the flexibility to increase contributions to research and promotion over some years and thus avoid the need for frequent amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>For the research and development component the operative levy rate within the maximum is set by regulation on the recommendation of the Pig Research and Development Corporation, following consultation with the Australian Pork Producers' Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>The levy raised is matched by the Government for funding of research and development projects up to a maximum of 0.5% of gross value of production of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is keenly aware of the necessity of primary industry research and development. We have encouraged rural industries to increase their contributions to research to 0.5% of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA>In our May 1989 statement ``Research, Innovation and Competitiveness'', the Government reaffirmed its commitment to continued matching of industry levies for funding of research and development up to 0.5% of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian pig industry is currently contributing about 0.35% of its gross value of production to research and development and is planning to increase its levy payments to research and development beyond the present maximum rate. I would like to commend the industry's foresight and support of the need for increased research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>The operative rate for the marketing and promotion levy is set by regulation on the recommendation of the Australian Pork Corporation, again in consultation with industry. The levy is used to fund the operations of the corporation which primarily develops and administers marketing and promotional strategies aimed at increasing the consumption of Australian pork and pork products. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Pork Corporation has been successful in recent years in assisting the industry to achieve increases in the market share of Australian pork as evidenced by the rising per capita consumption of pork meat. </PARA>
<PARA>The operative levy rate for these purposes is currently set at the maximum rate. This Bill will make it possible for industry to seek increases in the operative rate which would allow the corporation to maintain or expand its marketing and promotion program. </PARA>
<PARA>No additional budgetary outlays will result from this amendment. However, it will enable the Government to agree to an industry request for an operative rate increase in the research and development levy, which would then generate additional matching budgetary outlays in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable Senators, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Grape Research Levy Act 1986 to remove minor legislative inconsistencies and improve the operation of research and development in the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 set the framework for the establishment of research and development corporations, and councils for smaller industries, to improve the management of portfolio research activities. There are a small number of drafting errors in this Act, which this Bill will correct. </PARA>
<PARA>While these changes are relatively minor in themselves, collectively they are important and necessary for the smooth operation of the research and development corporations and councils established under the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act remove anomalies in reporting requirements for research and development corporations and councils and streamline reporting requirements for selection committees by allowing the incorporation of their report in the annual report of the Associated Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes references to representative organisations consistent throughout the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. Representative organisations as defined by that Act are declared to be associated with the R&amp; corporation or council, rather than with industry. This Bill corrects inaccurate mention of representative organisations being associated with industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill removes the unintended anomaly of having different reporting schedules for research and development councils and corporations. Annual operational and five year plans for research and development councils will now be submitted in line with timing requirements for research and development corporations. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also provides that the chairpersons of research and development councils attend annual co-ordination meetings along with chairpersons of R&amp; corporations. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also amends the Grape Research Levy Act 1986. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 inadvertently amended this Act and removed the right of relevant industry organisations, whose members pay the levy, to make recommendations to the Minister regarding the rate of the industry levy for funding grape research. This amendment will restore that right. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures set out in this Bill will involve no Commonwealth outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>Administrative savings may be achieved for the research and development corporations and councils through the inclusion of selection committee reports in the relevant corporation's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA>The major impact of the Bill will be the removing of inconsistencies in reporting requirements for research and development corporations and councils, the clarification of the use of the term `representative organisation' and the remedying of the unintended alteration to the process for determining the level of levies in the grape and wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Richardson) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990, Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two treaties here that I wish to refer to. They are the treaties on co-production of films between Canada and the United Kingdom. I am glad to see that Senator Richardson is here. He may well have some interest in this matter from his time as Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems that has emerged is that there is now a difference in definition between a co-production for Australian content in terms of funding film making and the definition of `Australian film' for the purpose of broadcasting on television. This is arrant nonsense. So a film that attracts Australian taxpayers' money, which is regarded as a co-production under the treaties listed here, may well not be an Australian film for television broadcasting purposes and will not be part of a television station's Australian content as required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should get off the pot and do something about this. It has been aware of it for a long time. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) has been totally unhelpful about it. I do not know what the current Minister may be able to do to encourage the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to cease being so pig-headed about it. Quite frankly, it is a nonsense that the economic viability of a film-in the case of these treaties, a co-production film-can be damaged and the prospects of getting funding for it severely diminished because the ABT will not use the criteria being used by the Australian Film Finance Corporation and other government bodies-the 10ba requirement, for example-as the criteria for judging whether it is an Australian film for television content purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> We get the ludicrous situation where two government bodies simply ignore each other. I have heard disturbing news this morning that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has totally rejected the latest suggestions by the Government and, I think, by the Australian Film Corporation that there should be one set of criteria. In a Senate Estimates committee I asked how the resolution of this matter was going. Ms Robinson, from the Australian Film Commission, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the AFC submitted during the Australian content inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Tribunal should consider giving national treatment to approved coproductions because they were approved for the purposes of domestic financing purposes. The Tribunal rejected our submission on this count . . . at the moment-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government and the Australian Film Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>are looking at how we might proceed on that question. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, that was back in September. I understand now that absolutely no progress has been made. To that extent, signing co-production agreements in relation to films, the economic viability of which will depend on their being shown on television, becomes next to meaningless. I hope that a greater sense of urgency will exist within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I would be prepared to suggest to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that, if it does not feel it within its capacity to act in this way and to use the criteria adopted by the other governmental bodies, then it seems to me quite possible that the Act relating to it could be changed to ensure that it does. I believe that there is a clear need for this Tribunal to wake up to the facts of life and to recognise that these treaties, such as the two we are discussing today, should be made meaningful rather than be disrupted by, frankly, a self-important tribunal which does not recognise that it has a duty to act sensibly in relation to a very important industry, the Australian Film Industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points in relation to the Pipeline Authority which were alluded to in its annual report and which I would like to take up and make comment on. They relate also-and it is in this context that I will speak mainly of them-to the allegations that have been made by the Government in recent times about the Opposition's refusal to support the legislation that would have set in train the sale of the assets of the Pipeline Authority to the private sector, a piece of legislation which was introduced last year and which was rejected by the Senate late in 1990, as a result of which the Government has now withdrawn the pipeline sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several points that I really want to stress in relation to this because the Government, in its portrayal of the Opposition's position, has been totally misleading in its comments. It claims that our opposing of the sale was done, in effect, to frustrate the Government's Budget and that the amount of money, therefore, that the Government will get into its coffers this year towards its Budget surplus will be reduced by what it is now saying is the figure of $700m. Apparently, that is the figure that the Government claims it would have got in this financial year for the sale of the assets of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, it needs to be stressed that that is a very rubbery figure indeed. We had long debates about the figure last year in this chamber, in the Estimates committees and elsewhere. It was quite clear from that that the Government was very reluctant to release a figure at all, and when it did produce a figure-eventually Senator McMullan did so in the Senate late last year-it was quite clear that the $700m was part of a range and was very much the upper limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that the coalition opposed the sale of the assets of the pipeline because the Government was deliberately breaching its contract with the Australian Gaslight Co. without any meaningful attempt at proper negotiation of the sale. Indeed, the Government admitted-and it was included in the legislation that this Senate quite properly rejected-that it was breaching contract and that there would be scope for large compensation payments involved; and something like one-third of the Bill before the Parliament was related to how to handle the compensation issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This coalition was not prepared, and will never be prepared, to sanction decisions by this Parliament that deliberately breach the Government's contracts with the private sector or with anyone else. To do that goes right to the heart of the propriety of government and we are not going to be party to reducing the integrity of government. If the Government had approached the sale in a proper manner which respected normal commercial relations, it would have had our support. </PARA>
<PARA> We told the Government that, but the Government spat the dummy and withdrew the whole thing from sale without attempting to put it in a proper form. Privatisation of the pipeline has long been on our privatisation agenda. It still is, but we will conduct the negotiations with full regard for propriety and for normal commercial considerations. Another point I want to make is that it was always highly doubtful whether the sale would have been completed this financial year. To say that this has frustrated the Government's Budget is nonsense. The Government's shortfall this year will be of the order of between $4 billion and $8 billion. At the very most we are talking about $700m for the pipeline-a large amount, but a minuscule amount in relation to the Budget shortfall as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday I and some other members of the Opposition visited the Qantas Airways Ltd jet base in Sydney. It was at the invitation of Mr John Ward via Mr Jull, the shadow Minister. Eight of us attended the base and I wish to say how much I enjoyed the opportunity and the experience. We saw a splendid presentation dealing with the role of Qantas and its activities, and the situation in which the airline at present finds itself with the downturn in tourism and air travel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We visited the apprenticeships school which has now been open for about 12 months. It trains a number of apprentices obviously to a very high standard. We had an opportunity to meet the apprentices and teachers in the school. We also visited the engineering section where work is done on machines. We visited the area and were shown how to escape from a plane. It is set up in such a way that indicates the actual distance a passenger would have to slide if coming out of a plane that came down into water or onto the land. I hope that I shall not be present if that ever happens, but certainly Qantas's record in this regard is one of which we can be very proud. We also went to the maintenance areas and had experience of seeing one of the flight simulators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was a remarkably quick trip to Hong Kong and back. We visited the catering service where Qantas prepares food for 23 airlines that travel in and out of Australia. We did not have as much time there as I would have liked. I hope to return because I found that area and the organisation quite fascinating. Earlier in the day some of us took the opportunity to see the new safety centre, which is a significant advance in air safety and the checking of aircraft safety. There is an opportunity for Qantas to offer this service to other airlines, which I am sure will be taken up. Altogether, it was a most instructive day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What stands out in my mind is the number of people we met who have been with the company for such a long time. The first person who showed us around, Ken Lewis, was celebrating his 25th year of service. The following day we met another man who was celebrating 30 years of service. We came across a number of other staff who had been with the organisation for 25, 30 and even 35 years. That length of service seemed to apply throughout the company. It indicated to me a great sense of purpose, identity and family among those who work for our airline. It is an experience I shall long remember. As I have said, I hope to be invited back again to have a more in-depth look at the catering service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments made by my colleague Senator Reid. I, too, am a member of the committee and I enjoyed the hospitality of Qantas Airways Ltd at its jet base last Friday. Qantas is an exceptionally fine airline and one of which Australians wherever they go throughout the world can be particularly proud. What we learned about the airline, its record, its safety history and so forth will hold us in good stead. We are most concerned about the troubles that are besetting the industry in general, and perhaps to Qantas in particular, largely because of the Gulf war which has led to a decrease in passenger traffic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join with Senator Reid in thanking Qantas for what it has done for Australia and for its efforts in looking after us last Friday. I hope that Qantas will be able to struggle through the present tough times. It is a fine airline and we should all support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having also visited the jet base last week, I join my two colleagues in thanking Qantas Airways Ltd. I also wish to make an additional point as shadow Minister for youth affairs. On the visit I was heartened to see that Qantas is determined to ensure that it maintains its training programs, despite the economic pressures that are being put upon it by both the rise in oil prices as a result of the Gulf war and the falling off in patronage because of people's concerns about flying at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The company found in the last economic downturn that a cancellation of its training programs, certainly a large number of its technical programs, resulted in an acute shortage of skilled maintenance workers when airline business picked up. The result was that Qantas had to do a large amount of its servicing with overseas companies. The United States of America was providing a fair proportion of major service work for Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who saw the Qantas facility at Mascot and the extraordinarily high level of training recognise that there is nowhere else in the world that would provide the same high level of maintenance as that employed by Qantas. As a result I am glad that in this downturn we were given the clear impression that no matter how many staff unfortunately may have to be shed as a result of reduced business, Qantas is determined to maintain its training programs so that it will be able to keep up its extraordinary record-the best of any airline in the world-in terms of lack of accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that the problems facing Qantas are very serious indeed, as indeed they are with all airlines. We have already seen many international airlines in the United States filing for bankruptcy, and ending up totally out of business in one or two areas. It will also mean a reduction in the services to Australia from some European airlines, some of which I believe will withdraw from this service altogether. I am glad that we have an airline as safe, efficient and forward looking as Qantas to provide us with international links, even though I fear that some of its direct services to London may have to incorporate other services, such as Frankfurt and Rome. Therefore, there may be some added inconvenience to passengers, but at least we have an airline that will meet Australia's requirements, particularly if some international operators remove their services from Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just briefly want to endorse the remarks made before the suspension of the sitting for dinner by Senator Reid, Senator Knowles and Senator Michael Baume about Qantas Airways Ltd. They addressed their remarks particularly to their visit to the Qantas facilities in Sydney a few days ago. Unfortunately, I was not on that visit but I have made a similar visit in the past. It is quite obvious that the briefings accorded to them were very similar to the one that I was given-that is, very professional. The briefing, which ran through the operations and the issues facing Qantas, was presented by a very professional team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment Qantas obviously faces, as does every other international and domestic airline, very considerable problems, particularly with the fall off in the international tourist travel due to a variety of reasons, not the least of which those associated with the Gulf war and the increasing price of fuel. I just want to endorse the commendation that my colleagues have made of Qantas. I think it is a great airline. It has had a great past and I hope that it continues to have a great future. </PARA>
<PARA> From the coalition's point of view, that future would be greatly enhanced if the ownership of Qantas were to be put entirely into the private sector. We believe that there is no reason at all why governments should be in the business of running airlines, or for that matter, any other business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of 100 per cent of Qantas has been on the Opposition's agenda for some considerable time. Last year the Government took a decision to open up for private ownership 49 per cent of Qantas. The only reason that it did not adopt the coalition's policy of a 100 per cent sale was that the left wing of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement at the special conference that was held in Sydney to get at least that far on the privatisation debate refused to go any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the constraint on the degree of private ownership of Qantas is that the left wing pressures-the old socialist pressures-still exist very considerably within the Labor Party, despite the Government's rhetoric in terms of its greater adherence to free market conditions and the like. If we strip away the rhetoric, we will find that the performance of the Government is vastly different from that rhetoric. The Qantas example of a 49 per cent sale, as distinct from a 100 per cent sale, is a very good example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I believe that it is extremely important that the sale of the 49 per cent is properly handled. It is a major sale of a part of a government undertaking. Of course, it is not any old undertaking; it is an international airline that has had a great association with the Australian image and Australian culture. So the handling of the sale of the 49 per cent of the equity in Qantas has to be done very carefully indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that, contrary to what I thought was to be the earlier process for handling this sale, in fact the Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales, located in the Department of Finance, is the government agency that will have the responsibility for handling that sale. If that is the case, I can only counsel caution on the Government's part. I have observed very closely the performance of the Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales in respect of the Pipeline Authority and one would hope that we would not have a repeat of that experience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-  I wish to speak to the annual report of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It is my intention to direct my remarks to that section of the report dealing with Antarctica. Honourable senators will be aware that I have pursued a number of reservations, within this chamber and at Estimates committee hearings, about our Antarctic operations. My prime objective has been to ensure that the decisions which are made should be to the best possible advantage of our Antarctic program. Of course, of equal importance is that there should be a judicial use of Australia's taxpayers' funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not to say that any of our Antarctic operations should ever be done on the cheap. Because of the obvious isolation and the climatic extremes, simply maintaining a presence in the Antarctic region is a very expensive business. Nor am I advocating in any manner that the safety of our Antarctic expeditioners should be jeopardised. I am totally committed to the belief that no amount of money is as important as safety. These concerns aside, there have been instances where all has not been well. I need only refer to the recently released report by the Auditor-General regarding the arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the replacement Antarctic vessel, the Aurora Australis. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister, Senator Richardson, and I have often clashed on the tendering process for the Aurora Australis, but the fact remains that the Auditor-General did express reservations about that process. In particular, the Auditor-General stated that whilst he may have understood why the Government signed a letter of intent with P and O Polar to construct the vessel, he also quite correctly pointed out that the signing of this letter of intent severely hampered the Commonwealth's bargaining position. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, signing the letter of intent before matters were finalised was the equivalent of going into a car yard and signing a contract to purchase a motor vehicle before agreeing on the price. Once a person has signed the letter, he is committed, which is a most irresponsible business attitude at best. No-one, least of all I, is going to argue with the Government or the Minister's intention to have the vessel built in Australia. This is commendable. However, as with all things, this desire should have been kept in its proper perspective. To have a vessel built overseas was always going to be the cheaper option. No-one minds paying a little more for the Australian product but, in the case of the replacement Antarctic vessel, the cost of the Australian vessel rose so rapidly that a very valid question to ask is whether the equation became unreasonably balanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also had to find out whether the vessel which we got was the one we originally ordered. I regret very much that P and O saw fit to jettison its experienced Antarctic partners, Polar Schieffarts, once it had been awarded the contract. It should be remembered that under the terms of the original expressions of interest, P and O would not have gone past first base without its partners because relevant experience was an important prerequisite. I know that there were other tenderers who were very aggrieved that the Government saw fit to allow this to happen. Once again, I believe these concerns were very valid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic Division is made up of hundreds of individual scientists, administrators and support staff. I know that their work is held in high esteem, particularly at an international level. I would not like this opportunity to pass without first congratulating these men and women on the outstanding job which they do and, secondly, commenting briefly on some particular matters which I believe would be of interest to the Senate. One of those particular matters was the role which the Antarctic Division is playing in initiating a program to monitor and investigate the impact of marine debris on seals and seabirds in the southern ocean. This is a subject which I believe most Australians find particularly distressing, especially as some of this debris, such as plastic lines and nets, has the potential to be a danger for up to 50 years. It is evident that this marine garbage poses a seal threat and I trust that the definite research of the Division will prove a catalyst for an international approach to controlling the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> During Estimates, my colleague, Senator Baume, commented on the Casey oil spill. Since that, we have had another oil spill in Antarctica of 19,000 litres. That is of great concern to me. My final point is that the environmental policy activities conducted by the Antarctic Division-the proposed trials for an air transport system-have been a bit of a failure. With those few words I conclude. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report has been lauded by the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Ian McLachlan, as a practical, if not perfect, program of reduced assistance for the automotive sector. Point 2 of the terms of reference which the Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, issued specifies that the report and recommendations will cover the assistance arrangements for the industry from 1993 to the year 2000, and will include any factors including institutional, regulatory and other arrangements affecting the competitiveness of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Mr Ian McLachlan in the other chamber said that it was not a perfect program for the whole industry. I wish to refer to what I perceive to be some of those imperfections in the Automotive Industry Report No. 5, particularly because I believe that the report does not adequately address the problems of a macro-economic nature, the overvalued nature of the Australian dollar and the effect of the competitiveness of the automotive industry in such an environment. It also addresses inadequately the micro-economic issues which are so necessary to accompany the tariff cuts that are envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the macro-economic issues were limited to two pages; the micro-economic issues were limited to three pages. That has to be looked at by reference to the fact that the report was over 250 pages long. This term of reference thus allows the Commission, under chapter 9 entitled `Other matters', to make specific reference to a Commonwealth Government regulation, including legislation; that is, the luxury sales tax and its impact on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of participants raised concerns about . . . the higher rate of sales tax applying to luxury vehicles, and the level of taxation on vehicles as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>As most senators present, and even those absent, would be aware, the matter of luxury sales tax on vehicles is one which has been debated several times in this chamber over the past 12 months. Having considered all the submissions put before it, the Commission concluded, and I quote from page 167 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission is not convinced that the luxury sales tax, in either its current or previous form, has provided significant de facto protection to the local industry. By virtue of the pattern of domestic vehicle production and vehicle importation, its incidence obviously falls more heavily on imported marques. However, the sales tax regime in general does not discriminate between domestically produced and imported vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> That said, the revised sales tax regime still has deficiencies. The base rate on sales tax on luxury vehicles of 30 per cent remains higher than the rate applying to non-luxury vehicles. Hence a price void, albeit smaller, remains. And, there will also remain some disincentive to include safety features and other options on vehicles priced just under the luxury tax threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Commission's view, it would be preferable if any luxury sales tax applied only on the value of the vehicle above the designated threshold. Given the current sales tax regime for non-luxury vehicles, this would imply a split rate regime of 20 per cent on the wholesale value below the threshold, and a higher rate of wholesale value above the threshold.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Industry Commission refrained from making any specific recommendations about vehicle taxation because of the implications of such a recommendation on areas other than the automotive industry, I feel that the Commission has raised a valid point which the Government should consider. No doubt vehicle importers would contemplate suicide at the mere suggestion of a further change to the luxury car sales tax. However, the view expressed seems to me to be a sensible one. Indeed, it is a pity that the Government did not have the opinion to work with when it attempted to correct its first botched attempt at increasing the luxury sales tax on cars. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also commented on an almost unanimous complaint amongst participants which was that high taxes on vehicles adversely affected vehicle producers and importers alike.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to speak on this Industry Commission report on the automotive industry-report No. 5. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that when we were debating the Industry Commission Bill, which replaced the old Industries Assistance Commission with the Industry Commission, the Senate accepted several very significant amendments: one was that as a constant term of reference, the Industry Commission would have before us the environmental consequences of any of its other references; and, secondly, that there would be appointed to the Commission somebody whose expertise was in the area of environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we turn to this important document-the report of the Industry Commission-we find that Mr Keating gave terms of reference to the Commission without any mention whatsoever of the extreme importance of the automotive industry in relation to environmental effects. I refer, specifically, to the large contribution which the automotive industry in Australia makes to greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, despite that absence and despite the fact that the Industry Commission is supposed to be working under its Act which charges it with the responsibility of considering environmental matters, it did not take on board Mr Keating's second term of reference, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . specify that the report and recommendations will cover the assistance agreements for the industry from 1993 to 2000 and will include any factors, including-</PARA>
<PARA>I take it that `including' is not exclusive-</PARA>
<PARA>institutional, regulatory or other arrangements affecting the competitiveness of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Reference 3(v) states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the measures which enable the industry to concentrate on areas of greatest comparative advantage and to take advantage of opportunities arising from globalisation of the automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the growing global awareness of the importance of greenhouse would have indicated quite clearly to the Australian automotive industry that it is in its interest to start making motor cars which emit less greenhouse gas, are more fuel efficient and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the automotive business pages of today's Australian, there is a major headline `Buyers swing to fuel-efficient cars'. When we look at how the Commission has actually discharged its duty in relation to considering environmental matters-Senator Watson pointed out that this report is 252 pages-we find that only two pages out of 252 say anything whatsoever on environmental matters. There is no consideration whatsoever of the very important role which the automotive industry plays in environmental damage, and the comparative advantage which Australia may well achieve in the next 10 to 15 years if it quite deliberately starts manufacturing cars which are more fuel efficient and less polluting. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of those two pages are devoted to a very cursory resume of the evidence that was put before the Commission. It then has two very brief paragraphs, which is really all the Commission says in the discharge of its duty under its Act. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Commission considers that industry policy measures should not be tailored specifically to achieve environmental objectives: rather, such objectives are generally best pursued through direct measures. This suggests that, once policies governing vehicle emissions are in place, vehicle producers should be allowed to adjust their production and marketing decisions as they see fit. By augmenting rather than supplanting market forces, such an approach should achieve environmental objectives in a way that least distorts consumer preferences, and hence maximises overall community well-being. </PARA>
<PARA>Reading between the gobbledegook, what that really means is that one should intrude into the market by putting appropriate price signals into place which would cause the industry to make different vehicles. Yet, in addressing this very important question of the industry between the years 1993 and the year 2000, the Industry Commission has not seen fit to actually make that a specific recommendation. I believe that the Industry Commission has not fulfilled its responsibility under its Act. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I also was caught slightly by the large number of papers that we are dealing with, so I do not have this paper in front of me. But it was one that was on the Notice Paper yesterday and I was expecting to speak to it then. I merely wish to observe in moving that this document be noted that it is very fortunate to see that the waters of the Torres Strait have been substantially reserved for the people of the Torres Strait to use as their exclusive fishing zone; that is one of the things that comes clearly out of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, I noted in the report that most of the species which are being fished-the crayfish and other species-are apparently, according to the report, being managed in a sustainable way. I think the report says that the crayfish are being harvested up to close to their maximum yield, but many of the other species are certainly being harvested at considerably less than that-which is a very desirable objective, given the natural variation which occurs in wild populations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter on which I wish to comment is that the report also draws attention to the likelihood of pollution of the waters of the Torres Strait. I think it should be noted here that the activities of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in relation to the OK Tedi mine have caused very considerable pollution of the Fly River from the sinking of a barge containing cyanide some years ago and also from the loss of the tailings dam in the mine site and the consequent loss of a great deal of material, including heavy metals and other things. Potentially, there is very considerable danger there to the waters of the Torres Strait. One hopes that very careful attention is given to the operation of that particular company. </PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, is also relevant in relation to the proposed Coronation Hill mine, which is also a proposal largely involving the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, and involving the East Alligator River and the possibility of pollution not going directly into the Torres Strait but certainly going into the general areas of the marine environment to the north of Australia. I think the main thing that should be noted from this report is the highly desirable way in which, for once, a natural resource has been substantially reserved to the indigenous people of the area for their use. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the paper with me but, on my reading of the paper, the Privacy Commissioner has made certain observations relating to a range of aspects to do with his functions, including the observations that he made about the various taxation issues. In the appendix-I suppose it is-to the report, as I recall it, there are guidelines established by the National Health and Medical Research Council, and those guidelines are to govern the questions of privacy as they relate to medical research. As honourable senators would know, when the principal legislation came before the Senate, there were established certain privacy principles. They were, by and large, to be immutable principles except in certain cases. One of the cases was in respect of medical research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I want to go to is my concern that the guidelines appear to place in the hands of institutional ethics committees in various parts of the country the power to make decisions which may in fact not be consistent. Relating to privacy matters, they may stipulate certain measures in Adelaide, for example, and different measures to be observed by those conducting medical research in Sydney. That is how I understand the provisions of the guidelines as they are appended to the Privacy Commissioner's report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes the damning admission on 8 February 1991 of policy failure by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that `the Government did not want a recession, it wanted a slowdown' and that `it is a slowdown, not a recession, that Australia requires';</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes the equally stunning admission by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Sunday program on 10 February 1991 that `we obviously got wrong a proposition that said that there would not be a recession';</PARA>
<PARA> (c) condemns the Government for the massive hardship its disastrous miscalculations and mismanagement have wrought on all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) urges the Government to pursue the policies advocated for so long by the Coalition, to restore sustainable private sector growth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>How grateful we must all have been to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say last Sunday that his Government had got it wrong on interest rates, and to hear the Treasurer (Mr Keating) say that what he really meant to say last year was that we needed a `slowdown' and not a `recession'. This, sadly, is just so typical of the deterioration of sound management by the Treasurer and the admission that he did get it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month former Treasury official David Morgan placed on record the fact that warning was given of a shakeout in financial services-just one more warning that the Treasurer and the Hawke Labor Government did not heed. Now, when trouble strikes the corporate sector, we are told that it was entirely its fault. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply cannot come at the fact that the dramatic increases in bankruptcies are all the fault of the private sector and management and mismanagement. No-one can convince me that businesses that have been quite viable for 30, 40 or more years go out of business not because of the current economic climate but because of their mismanagement. Restructuring through economic collapse seems to be the modus operandi of the Treasurer and, while this Government rightly stands up to Saddam Hussein, there seems to be a touch of his logic in the Treasurer's statements when the hardship suffered by business, farms and ordinary wage earners is somehow held up as proof of courageous economic management. I referred a short time ago to one constant indicator of all the suffering and that is, of course, the bankruptcy levels and the statistics for the December quarter of 1990. Last year 11,000 or 57 per cent of small businesses went bankrupt and one does not have to think too hard to realise how many people lost their jobs as a consequence. That is the real tragedy. Today we have the highest unemployment figures for nearly eight years, yet this Government still says that it is on track. In my State of Western Australia, the rise in bankruptcies from the previous December quarter was 89 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this Hawke-Keating Labor Government can be summarised in very simple terms-the ever increasing dole queues, the ever increasing numbers of businesses going broke-and that does not include those businesses that shut up shop before they actually went into bankruptcy, resulting in all the staff losing their jobs as well-the ever decreasing value of assets, the increasing dole queues, the increasing number of businesses going broke and the decreasing value of assets, all of which is taking everyone out backwards. Australia has a rural sector that is left like a carcass on the track and job opportunities for school leavers are virtually non-existent. All this has been cleverly done as a home-grown market. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government cannot even say that this depression-not recession-has been brought about by overseas factors beyond its control. Australia started to drop out of sight long before any other country was experiencing difficulties, and the trend has just continued downwards. This is the depression that Messrs Hawke and Keating `engineered' and that is what the disgrace is all about. They engineered this with little or no regard for those who have lost everything-their futures and all their hard work in the past. They and their political masters-the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-have not had the courage to make the policy changes necessary to save Australia from ruin. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has repeatedly offered bipartisan support if the Government, for the sake of Australia, undertakes real policy reform of things such as tax reform, significant spending cuts, significant shifts in work practices and productivity, particularly in areas such as transport, telecommunications and the waterfront, and real privatisation reform. By that I do not mean simply selling off the assets when they become an embarrassing liability or bailing out people with private sector money. It is a case of selling off things while they are viable and not when they become a liability. This is a real opportunity for the Government, if it is prepared to make the hard decisions, to have bipartisan support from the Opposition to make sure that this country gets back on track. But will it do it? No, because its political masters, the ACTU, will simply not allow it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> To have not only the support but the encouragement of the Opposition is something that is fairly rare in politics today, but we recognise the gravity of the situation for this country and we want to make sure that it does not deteriorate for another two years before we have an opportunity to pull it out of the woods. There is an opportunity to set things straight and it would leave the Australian Democrats in absolute isolation as the Party that really wants to see this country go downhill. They would be the only ones pursuing policies of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at the areas that have to be reformed because there are at least eight fundamental structural policy changes which must be implemented. I will briefly run through some of them. The first is taxation reform. We must have a simpler tax system that gives incentive to Australians to work harder, earn more and be able to save. That means less tax overall and a bias in the tax system towards saving rather than spending. Labour market reform is another area. The Government must abandon the accord which has eroded real incomes, propped up inflation and given the ACTU far too much power. Only in recent months have we seen the ACTU flex its muscles again. This is the real weakness in this Labor Government that huffs and puffs about waterfront reform but is yet to get rid of one excess wharfie and stood by while John Halfpenny tried to sabotage the agreement of the SPC Ltd cannery where employers and workers were trying to save jobs in the face of an economic reality that the ACTU simply does not want to know about. We must look at inefficient infrastructure and inefficiencies in telecommunication, transport, shipping, the waterfront and power generation, which impose major cost disadvantages on Australian industry trying to export or compete against imports. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at reform of Government operations. Contracting-out of Government services to the private sector can bring savings of up to 20 per cent. So why will the Government not take on these challenges and say, `Now is the time. We are not going to just stand by and let the ACTU run this country any longer. These hard decisions must be made.'? The same applies to the question of privatisation. Sleepy, inefficient Government-owned monopolies must be shaken up through exposure to competition and privatisation. Earlier this evening we were talking about Qantas and what a fine airline it is. It would have to be one of those industries that is absolutely ripe for an injection of real funds and being privatised. We must look at industry reform and orderly and pre-specified reductions in protection. Protection shields Australian industry from the stimulus of international competition and we simply cannot afford that. If we do have orderly and pre-specified reductions in protection, they will be an integral part of an economic reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration is another area that should be very seriously considered because in recent years standards have been lowered to actually achieve the annual targets. It is essential for this country that existing migration criteria be enforced and the integrity of our program be restored because, in the short term, as the recession makes Australia less attractive to skilled migrants and our economy has a reduced capacity to absorb migrants, the overall level of immigration will fall. However, in the longer term, increased immigration will be of substantial economic benefit and Australia should retain its commitment to family reunion and refugee programs. But we must bite the bullet today and not in months or years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must urgently set out clear, consistent and unequivocal guidelines to achieve an appropriate balance between development and conservation of the environment. It is not good enough for the Government to say at election time, `We will promise anything and win the votes and get re-elected and worry about it later'. I am not Robinson Crusoe when I say that Australians generally are concerned that with any major development project that is proposed these days there is such a song and dance routine from the Green movement that it is always put onto the back burner. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins happens to be the Minister on duty in the chamber tonight-a Northern Territory senator. I went up to Coronation Hill to look at it for myself and to learn more about it. I would have to say that that is one area that should be allowed to be mined. However, we have this current, ongoing situation in which, if oil drilling is to take place in the Tasman Sea, there are people who say, `There are whales in the Tasman Sea and we cannot drill for oil there'. We cannot allow this situation to continue. We all have a role to play in this and it is particularly important. That is why it is vital that Senator Short's motion be talked about at this early stage of the autumn session. Senator Short and the coalition parties as a whole urge the Government to pursue the policies about which I have talked tonight and to restore sustainable private sector growth and employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating a motion moved by Senator Short on the economy in which he calls for the introduction of new economic policies in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have. I will get onto that in a moment because I have some illuminating data which I would like to share with Senator Short. However, we have been operating to moderate the impact of this constraint. The predilection of the economy to spill over purchases into excessive imports has been a constraint on Australia's economic growth since Federation. It is important to note that the policies in place to slow down gross domestic production and the rate of growth in the economy have been working to slow down the rate of import growth and to close the balance of payments current account deficit. It is important to look at those figures. For example, I calculated today that in the six months from July to December in the calendar year 1989 the current account deficit on our balance of payments was $11.9 billion, very close to $12 billion. In the equivalent period in the last six months of 1990, the balance of payments current account deficit had been reduced to $8.6 billion. In just a 12-month period there was a reduction in the current account deficit of 28 per cent. By anybody's calculations that is a major reduction in that constraint on the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to note-Senator Short is not listening at the moment-that the $8.6 billion deficit in the first six months of this financial year is very much on track to meet the Budget forecast of $18 billion for the whole financial year. It was $8.6 billion in the first half of the financial year, the forecast being $18 billion for the full year. At the same time that this improvement in the current account deficit has been occurring, there has been a relaxation of monetary policy--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Short" NAMEID="DJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator Short</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But do you think $18 billion is an improvement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly an improvement in proportion to the gross domestic product. One must always relate items such as imports and current account deficits to the size of the economy. We should not talk about them in sheer absolute terms. The deficits now are not much different as a percentage of gross domestic product from the deficits under Mr Howard and Mr Fraser in the early 1980s. One has to look at those sorts of things because there is a very clear link between gross domestic product and imports. That is one of the few well-documented linkages in economics. One should therefore relate imports and current account deficits to the size of the economy and not just speak about them in absolute terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not deny that, as Senator Short's motion states, there has been hardship in the Australian economy. I readily admit that there has been hardship in some sections of the community. Family living standards have been compressed; they have been very tight in recent months. Families have been feeling the pinch. I should point out that, as well as interest rates being relaxed, fiscal policy has been relaxed in recent times. From 1 January Australian households have been getting not only an initial round of personal income tax cuts; they have been getting two lots of personal income tax cuts, because in the last few months of 1990 we agreed to fund a second round of personal income tax reductions, which took effect from 1 January this year. I am sure that people who have been looking at their pay slips have been rather impressed by the reduction in the tax burden and the increase in their take-home pay. It is rather striking to see the impact on the pay slips. </PARA>
<PARA> The original round of tax cuts for somebody on an income of $20,000 per annum-which is a fairly typical income in my State-would mean a tax cut of $4.80 a week. As a result of the second round of tax cuts, the additional tax cuts which have been given effect from 1 January, an extra $2.80 a week is being provided to Australian employees. The sum of the two tax cuts for somebody on an income of $20,000 per annum is of the order of $7.60 a week. That is the increase in take-home pay of after-tax disposable income which translates into a $10.90 per week gross wage before tax. If one allows for the tax that would be taken out of $10.90 a week, it would translate to the after-tax take-home pay rise of $7.60 a week. It is very important to fund increases in disposable income in that way, because it takes pressures off employers by reducing the impact of extra wage rounds on their wages bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax cuts have been given effect by an increase in the amount of tax-exempt income. The amount of tax-exempt income has gone up from $5,100 to $5,400 and the bottom rate of income tax has been cut from 21c in the dollar to 20c in the dollar. That is one example; I will not go through all the tax changes that are occurring. I should also point out that as part of this remuneration package-and Senator Short has moved a motion here tonight about hardship in Australian families-there is also to be a wage rise. In May this year there will be a flat wage rise of $12 weekly for members of the work force. It will be paid to all members of the work force so that lower paid members of the work force get as much as higher paid members. It is an effective way of getting a larger percentage wage rise to lower paid workers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that $12 wage rise, the total gross wage equivalent of the tax cuts-the two elements of the tax cuts and that wage rise-will mean that somebody on an income of $20,000 per annum will get a gross wage equivalent increase by May of some $22.90 a week. That is equivalent to a 6 per cent wage rise, which is fairly impressive. A 6 per cent wage rise is in effect what Australian workers earning $20,000 per annum will obtain as a result of those two tax cut increments and the $12 wage rise. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested to note that, despite the Liberals moving this motion about hardship this evening, they have never supported this $12 wage rise. I asked them yesterday when I made a speech on the subject whether they were going to endorse this wage rise and there was a deafening silence from the other side of the chamber. Tonight we are debating a motion about hardship in the Australian community and the Liberals are saying, `This Labor Government has brought hardship to Australian families and therefore its policies should be changed'; meanwhile in the very near future this Labor Government will be providing a $12 a week pay rise to Australian workers-and the Liberals are opposed to the rise. I have not heard anyone on the other side of the chamber speak in support of this $12 a week wage rise. Again, there is a massive difference between Liberal Party rhetoric and reality under the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short in part (d) of his motion calls for the implementation of alternative economic policies in Australia. He says that we have to go down a new road, bring in new policies-in fact `policies' advocated for so long by the coalition. What are these policies? What specifically would the Liberal Party do in government-heaven forbid if it ever got into government-and it controlled the Treasury bench of this Parliament? I suppose we can say categorically that the Liberals would bring in a consumption tax. That is pretty clear: the Liberal Party is wedded to a goods and services tax. For the first time in Australia's history we would see a tax on services. Everything from medical bills to public transport and the cost of funerals would be taxed by these people. That is what they would be on about. </PARA>
<PARA> I said yesterday that I think the Liberal Party is dressing up self-interest as an economic virtue. It claims that we have to have a consumption tax as a panacea to improve the economy and dresses up self-interest as an economic virtue, as yet another pathway for the Liberal Party to bring in big income tax cuts for people at the big end of town. That is the way the Liberal Party would go if it ever got into power. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to look at the situation in the United Kingdom. We are told that if we had a broad-based consumption tax in Australia-the Liberals call it a goods and services tax-that would help solve our overseas balance of payments problem. But one has only to look at the United Kingdom under the Conservative Party. It had the great double; it had a broad-based consumption tax and a massive balance of payments deficit. The United Kingdom still has a massive balance of payments deficit despite all that North Sea oil. Despite being an oil rich country, it has a massive balance of payments deficit and a broad-based consumption tax at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look at some of the specifics of a broad-based consumption tax as it could be operated by a possible future Liberal government. First of all, a goods and services tax, which is a variation of a broad-based consumption tax, would change relative prices. Clearly, such a tax would make many products in our community more expensive and some products very much cheaper. I think we can work on the assumption, doing the sums, as I have, that if the Liberals brought in such a tax with the idea of abolishing the current sales tax, they would have to bring in a consumption tax at a rate of about 15 to 18 per cent. That is the sort of rate they could be working on. </PARA>
<PARA> But the catch is that the Liberals would be replacing a sales tax which currently has a number of items taxed at a 30 per cent or 50 per cent rate. That is the big catch. What those people on the other side are up to is bringing down the price of some goods and services, particularly goods which currently are taxed at either a 30 per cent or 50 per cent rate. They would tax these items at the general rate. Under the Liberals' theory, everything would be taxed at the same rate-I estimate 15 to 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three main areas in the Australian economy which historically have been tax-free. These include services, a whole range of intangible products in the community-everything from hairdressing to medical services, rent, public transport fares-as well as food and clothing. The Liberal Party's policies would make fruit and vegetables, groceries, meat, shoes, clothes and all the services I mentioned more expensive. All those items would go up in price roughly by the extent of the tax that they would bring in. In other words, if the Liberals brought in a 15 per cent broad-based consumption tax, because these items are tax-free at the moment that would be the extent of the tax increase. That is the effect that the policies that Senator Short is calling for tonight would have on these items in the Australian economy. All those things would go up by the percentage tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, at the very same time, the broad-based consumption tax policy which the Liberal Party has put forward as a kind of economic panacea, which it says would solve many of our economic problems, would make many luxuries in the Australian economy infinitely cheaper. </PARA>

But under the Liberal Party's policy, everything would be taxed at the same rate-everything from funerals to luxury cars, wedding dresses and Easter eggs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not too many people living in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, Senator. However, a number of very privileged people would benefit. Dr Hewson let the cat out of the bag on 15 November when he went to the Sydney International Motor Show and said, when asked by journalists what the future was for the 50 per cent luxury car tax under this Government-which I strongly endorse-`Oh, we are going to scrap it: we are going to get rid of that tax'. So that means that luxury cars will be taxed at the general rate of 15 to 18 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On my calculations, which I have done this week, a motor vehicle currently retailing for $97,000-a lot of that price reflects our 50 per cent sales tax-would, under the Liberals, go down in price to $77,000. So there is a $20,000 gift to the privileged section of the community who can afford to pay $77,000 or $80,000 for a motor car. Meanwhile, Senator Short put forward a motion in this chamber talking about hardship in the Australian community under this Government. It is as clear as night follows day that a broad-based consumption tax under the Liberal Party will bring down the price of limousines by some $20,000 if they are priced at about $100,000. As Senator Loosley pointed out, those opposite are the limousine Liberals. Basically, what they are after is a Rolls Royce-led recovery-as Senator McMullan has pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party policy is a clear nonsense. It shows just how much it is out of touch with the ordinary people of Australia if it intends to reduce the price of luxury cars and claim that somehow that will restore Australia's health.

There are a number of items that are currently taxed at a rate of 30 per cent under this Labor Government. These include diamonds, jewellery, furs, cosmetics and gold watches. If the Liberal Party policy is to bring in a broad-based consumption tax to replace that sales tax with a general rate tax, so that everything is taxed at the same rate, those items-diamonds, jewellery, furs, cosmetics and gold watches-will be taxed at a rate of 15 to 18 per cent.

<PARA> I will now get on to the linkage with the economy. The mind boggles. We have been talking about the concept of luxuries but most luxuries in this country are imported; they come from other countries. So how can the Liberal Party of Australia claim that it has policies to close the current account deficit when it will give an enormous boost to imports of luxury goods? It will make luxury goods cheaper; it will bring down the price of luxury cars, diamonds, cosmetics, furs, gold watches-a whole range of things. All these items will come down in price-and they are all imported. Ninety-nine per cent of these items come from overseas. I ask Senator Short and his colleagues: how on earth will the balance of payments be improved by boosting luxury the growth in imports? I am waiting for an answer but I do not hear one. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a very inequitable tax system. Those opposite are proposing to bring in a grossly unfair tax system.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.13)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are invited by Senator Short to debate the damning admissions by both Mr Keating and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about the economy and about their engineered recession. From the figures before us, it is quite clear that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) were indeed wrong in their economic policies and that the objective of their engineered recession has not been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objective has always been to improve the balance of payments. Obviously that can be done in two ways: by increasing exports and/or by reducing imports. The Government appears to have concentrated on reducing imports and has done so in the most damaging and clumsy way. To achieve the specific target of import reductions, the Treasurer has chosen to damage economic activity as a whole and the predictable result is before us-a recession and only a marginal improvement in our trade figures; in fact, they continue to deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA> In November we showed a trade deficit in seasonally adjusted terms of $1.36 billion; in December we showed it as $1.77 billion-a deficit of $3 billion in just two months in seasonally adjusted figures. Clearly that strategy is not working. The utter stupidity of that approach-it is like using a sledge hammer to crack a nut-becomes very apparent when one considers that, to even maintain that sort of minimal progress or slowing down of the deterioration, one would have to keep the economy at recession level forever after. </PARA>
<PARA> When it became apparent that the strategic objective was not going to be achieved in this way, the rhetoric changed to combating inflation. But now, with a 2.7 per cent consumer price index increase for the December quarter and a current annual rate of 6.9 per cent, there is no dramatic improvement here either. In fact, the marginal drop from 8 to 7 per cent in the annual rate has been achieved by an increase of 250,000 unemployed since October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are other figures to document the utter failure of these economic policies. Retail turnover growth plummeted to 2.6 per cent in November 1990 and is still trending downwards. Bankruptcies have skyrocketed with almost 3,000 occurring during the December quarter. This compares with 1,874 in the previous December quarter-a rise of 56 per cent. Similarly credit growth has collapsed from the speculative binge of the late 1980s level of nearly 20 per cent down to 7 per cent. It further appears that the banks have over-reacted because of the massive bad debts and so-called non-performing loans and are actually rationing credit even though interest rates have dropped considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> These sober figures hide social breakdown and human misery on a growing scale. Recently, on behalf of the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Bishops' Committee for Justice, Development and Peace issued its draft report on wealth distribution in Australia entitled Common Wealth and Common Good. The report demonstrates that inequality continues to grow at an alarming rate. It documents recent surveys showing an increase in the proportion of high income households balanced by a reduction in the proportion of middle income households at a time when the proportion of low income households has continued to grow. As the bishops' report observes:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the rate of increase of already high incomes and the fact that they're less heavily taxed than in the past have contributed to the widening of the gap. </PARA>
<PARA>In his submission to the bishops' report, Phil Ruthven, Chairman of IBIS-international finance analysts-said that Australia's legendary middle class was shrinking while the poverty area consists largely of sole parents, disabled persons without employment and families lacking a bread winner. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not compare all that well to other countries in this regard. Dr Peter Saunders, Director of the Social Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, has been studying income distribution in eight developed Western countries. He has found that the share of income going to the 60 per cent of families in the middle to low income range in Australia is smaller than in any of the other countries he studied. Further, contrary to prevailing mythology, Australia spends less on social welfare than most other developed countries and we are not as heavily taxed as most comparable nations. </PARA>
<PARA> But the social outfall of this Government's economic policies continue to come before our eyes. Child poverty still exists. The Burdekin report estimated that we have at least 250,000 children who are homeless or are at risk of being homeless. Poverty in farming communities is increasing alarmingly and surveys indicate that the level of child poverty in rural areas is double the national rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Two hundred thousand Australian households are on public housing waiting lists. To cap it off, domestic violence is on the increase as families suffer increased economic stress. In a 1989 New South Wales study it was found that families with annual incomes of less than $15,000 were 11 times more likely to experience domestic violence than families enjoying material comfort. </PARA>
<PARA> While deregulation, high interest rates and cutting government expenditure are all discredited polices of the Government, the Opposition's remedies are clearly worse. Firstly, it wants to tax all goods and services, as Senator Maguire has demonstrated, and cut high income earners' income tax even further; and, secondly, it has no plan to assist manufacturing industry. Rather, it is in favour of cutting tariffs to the point where manufacturing industry in our country will be destroyed at an even faster rate than the Industry Commission recommends. The car industry is a major employer in my State of Victoria, especially in Geelong, and this industry will certainly not survive without some tariff protection. The same applies to the textile, clothing and footwear sector. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point it might be useful if I refer to an article by Mr Ken Davidson in today's Age newspaper. He recounts the results of his survey in the last few weeks in some of the Asian countries which so often are paraded before us as examples of entrepreneurial push and a free market operating on an even keel. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the fact is that the economic planners in Taiwan and Korea believe that it is necessary to first create international competitive industries that may then be exposed to international competition without government support. </PARA>
<PARA> While Singapore has no border protection and the economy is shaped by international market forces, the Government's planners in the Economic Development Board pick winners and offer tax holidays and venture capital on a concessional basis if the company concerned has reasonable prospects of becoming competitive and is in an industry compatible with the overall economic strategy of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no such planning and no such desire to intervene to assist our industries to become internationally competitive in the Opposition's box of policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's desire not to lift a finger to make constructive action possible can be illustrated by the fact that when accelerated depreciation allowances, for instance, were put on the table as one of the measures, Dr Hewson very quickly sprang into the fray and said that the Opposition would certainly not be supporting accelerated depreciation allowances to assist those industries that had a hope of becoming more competitive and more productive in our export sector. The Opposition is prepared to abolish capital gains tax to fuel speculation, usually of a non-productive nature, where an asset is held for more than five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Opposition's policies are a disaster. The Australian Democrats cannot possibly accept paragraph (d) in the motion that Senator Short has moved. That paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>urges the Government to pursue the policies advocated for so long by the Coalition, to restore sustainable private sector growth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>What a laugh! Clearly the policies that the Opposition is advocating are not going to do any such thing; they are going to deliver our farmers, our workers and our industry to the wolves-they will go by the board. That is the policy of the Opposition and we cannot support it. I will be moving an amendment at the end of my address to delete that particular paragraph from the motion that Senator Short has moved in the Senate today. I believe that the Government is prepared to support that amendment. I trust it has not changed its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the time has come for us to take specific action in Australia to achieve an increase in our industrial activity, an increase in our competitiveness and, particularly, an increase in our employment. The time has come for governments to accept responsibility to institute policies-and to intervene in the economy-which will achieve the sort of future that is the aspiration of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific measures must be introduced to limit imports. The luxury car tax is actually a very good example of a specific tax which is having a significant impact on restraining unnecessary production, sales and consumption of luxury motor vehicles. Clearly, this move will boost local industry and it certainly helps the merchandising trades and our current account. The Democrats see similar scope with other luxuries such as clocks, watches, furs, weapons and ammunitions, to name but a few. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, we believe that the procedures for our anti-dumping action need to be improved. At the moment, when dumping of products is discovered it can take up to 12 months before any action is taken. An industry can be destroyed in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The further option which the Democrats believe should be examined is a self-limiting system of controlling imports which has been developed by the Society for Balanced Free Trade and one of its directors, Mr Ernst Rodeck. The proposal involves automatically limiting imports to export performance. No individual quotas would be necessary for any specific product, as the right to import goods would have to be purchased from exporters who automatically obtain the right to import an equivalent value of goods to that exported. </PARA>
<PARA> No public money would be necessary and significant benefits would be earned by exporters, thereby providing a huge incentive for international orientation of Australian business. Obviously, certain capital goods and components for products being assembled in Australia would need special treatment, and transitional implementation measures would be complex initially. I believe that the Government should give this proposal serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that the tax system must be further oriented towards production and jobs and away from speculation, otherwise the current trend of relocating production and employment offshore will continue. As mentioned before, we believe that industry should be assisted by accelerated depreciation in selected export sectors that are capable of increasing our export development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that the interest withholding tax should be lifted from 10 per cent up to the company tax rate where possible. Many tax avoidance loopholes would be closed by this move but, more particularly, the result of this measure would be to reduce the value of the dollar, thereby assisting our export industry significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> In our belief, the most important policy change which must occur is an ideological shift away from deregulation. There is, indeed, a role for government-especially in industrial development-and Australia, because of its high transport costs arising from its isolation, needs an interventionist industrial policy. This approach is so different from the one advocated until now by the Government and, to a much tougher extent by the Opposition, that, as I said, the Democrats are unable to accept paragraph (d) in the motion moved by Senator Short. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Omit paragraph (d). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In many ways this debate is a re-run of a debate we had only yesterday. I will not rehash the points I made yesterday because those concerned would have had the opportunity to hear or read that, and because time would be taken up that others might wish to use in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Suffice to say that as Senator Short failed to make any progress yesterday, either in the debate itself or in gaining any publicity from the attempt, I guess that is why he is trying again today. The debate, I suspect, will go no better for him because the substance of the matter runs so substantially against him. That is not to say that anybody can take joy or comfort from the current economic situation in which Australia finds itself. I do not, and I spoke about that yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had further statistics today which show a small increase in unemployment. Broadly analysed, they may indicate, though it is too early to be sure, a plateauing of the unemployment problem, but in human terms the position is very serious for those individuals adversely affected and a source of reasonable and proper concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I turn to the part that is different from the proposal that was put forward yesterday. I shall give brief attention to some of the matters raised by the Opposition in its own policy proposal. That which differs in today's motion from yesterday's is paragraph (d) to which Senator Spindler referred, namely, the call for the Government to adopt the policies of the Opposition. There is one thing one can say of the conservatives in Australia. They may not have many redeeming features, but I suppose that one is consistency. Over the 20 or so years in which I have been involved in politics, conservatives have always had the same solution. They oppose inflation by putting up prices, they fight unemployment by putting people out of work, and they deal with workers' living standards by keeping down wages. The rhetoric has changed a little over the last 20 years, but the outcome has been the same. It is serious and important that we should continue to focus on that. It is a stark contrast which the Australian people cannot be allowed to forget. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important possible achievements that an Australian government can contribute to the success of Australian business is a reduction in inflation. I want to talk more about inflation and alternative strategies for dealing with it in good time. We are at the moment poised in a position where, for the first time in a generation, Australia may be able to break the back of inflation and inflationary expectations. Serious economists are predicting-and yesterday I read into Hansard the Westpac Banking Corporation prediction and others-that by 1992 we may be back in a reasonable growth economy of 2.5 to 3 per cent growth with inflation at 4 per cent, following a year in which inflation in 1991 is predicted at about 4.5 per cent. That is creating the situation where expectations of inflation may be broken, and therefore we can start to see a long term downward trend in inflation reinforced by the wage-tax agreements between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Therefore, it will lead to a long term fall in interest rates, reducing the cost of capital to Australian business and making business significantly more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the very worst thing one could conceive of in a climate where one might be about to break the inflationary cycle? It would be a massive one-off increase in prices through a consumption tax. There is no doubt that the Australian indirect tax system needs reform. It is a matter to which I am giving significant time and to which the Government is giving attention, and it is a long term and important task. But it would be fundamentally flawed economically to now give such a stimulus to prices on the first occasion for a generation when we have a chance to break the back of inflation. It would be fundamentally flawed socially for the reasons that were outlined so eloquently by my colleague Senator Maguire. He was absolutely correct in his analysis of the social consequences of the type of broadly based consumption tax proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In dramatically changed circumstances in 1991, the Opposition is plaintively pursuing what it saw as a golden opportunity in 1985. We now have the situation in Australia that is far different from 1985 or at any other time in Australia's history, when the balance of direct and indirect taxation in Australia is similar to the average in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the changes that have been made in income and consumption tax, the revenue gain is not and will not be sufficient to provide proper compensation for the less well off to enable cuts in marginal tax rates to offset the high price level associated with a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the situation where the top marginal tax rate now is lower than that proposed in option C. The proposal in option C in 1985 to say that there needed to be a change in the indirect tax base so that we could fund a cut in the top marginal tax rate to get it down to internationally competitive levels was for the top marginal tax rate to be cut dramatically to 50c. It is now 47c. Therefore, the whole rationale has fundamentally changed. Now, the lust for a consumption tax is driven by the desire to feed major tax cuts into the best off in our community by further reducing the top marginal tax rate for those on the highest incomes. It will also deliver to those people the most substantial benefits because the luxury items that they consume will be those in relation to which prices will fall most. It is those people who spend the lowest percentage of their income on the goods whose prices will rise the most. It is economically irresponsible, it is socially adverse and unjust, and it is trying to adopt a 1985 solution to a 1991 problem. Therefore, it is fundamentally flawed and should be rejected. Its most profound problem is that, at a time when we have a key opportunity to give priority to breaking the back of inflation, a one-off boost to prices would be disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from the problem of tax being the most serious in our society-not that I underestimate it-I believe that the most serious social problem generated economically is that of unemployment. The Opposition's solution to unemployment would only make the situation dramatically worse. Every economically literate person knows that in a time of tight fiscal policy proposals to advocate dramatic further cuts in fiscal policy will only exacerbate unemployment. I am not saying that Opposition members are a malevolent bunch whose intention is to throw people on to the scrap heap. Those are emotions of the past. I say that those people are wrong and ill-informed and that that would be the unintended consequence of their actions. In 1991 in a situation involving a uniquely tight fiscal policy in Australia, a situation in which we are in a recession, to advocate dramatic cuts in fiscal policy is socially irresponsible and can only exaggerate the profound economic and social problems that we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, fiscal policy is loosening cyclically because, in the post-1930s Depression world, the change to the welfare system whereby people receive unemployment benefits when out of work has led to a cyclical correction being built into contemporary economic policy. Welfare payments go up and the tax take goes down in a recession, loosening fiscal policy and leading to some automatic correction. To be advocating at this time that a part of the solution to the recession is to cut fiscal policy further is the height of social irresponsibility. The most profound contradiction of all is the concern that one frequently hears expressed that wages have not risen sufficiently and that workers have lost real wages during the time of this Government. Those who so argue ignore statistics, such as household disposable income, which do not suit their argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with the subject of wages. In the 20 years I have been involved in public life there has never been a time when the Liberal Party has supported any wage increase at all on any occasion. However, Liberal members are now shedding crocodile tears about workers' wages while they are advocating that the $12 wage increase scheduled for the first half of this year should be abandoned, which is hardly the way to improve living standards for ordinary Australian workers. Under the guise of so-called deregulation of the labour market, the only way that that can achieve the purpose that those opposite advocate is if it leads to lower wage outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is obvious. Why is the Opposition supporting the crushing of the opportunities for growth by tighter fiscal policy? Why is it supporting the cutting of wages? Because it has no other anti-inflationary strategy and because it cannot deal with wages policy. It has no anti-inflationary strategy other than crushing the growth out of the economy through restrictive fiscal policy and cutting wages. Therefore, any party that is proposing to introduce a consumption tax and to give a massive one-off increase to prices cannot deal with the inflationary consequences without crushing growth. Any chance of the recovery that this Government is creating the preconditions for out of this recession-which will come-can only be dealt with by a conservative government with no anti-inflationary strategy and by cutting fiscal policy and cutting wages. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the only thing we can say for the conservatives in Australia is that they do have consistency. They have always advocated coping with inflation by putting up prices; coping with unemployment by putting people out of work and coping with the problems of workers' living standards by cutting wages. They are advocating nothing different now and that is why this motion ought to be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA> Yet the Prime Minister of the day (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer of the day (Mr Keating) have finally had the decency to acknowledge that even the most willing support by Senators Maguire and McMullan is nonsensical because they have finally admitted in the words of the Prime Minister on the Sunday program on 10 February:</PARA>
<PARA>We obviously got wrong a proposition that said there would not be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer on 8 February said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government did not want a recession; it wanted a slowdown. </PARA>
<PARA>He also told us that we were having the recession that we had to have which, in turn, means that the unemployed are having the lack of employment they also had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the speeches tonight from the Labor Party and in all the speeches from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer there is not an excuse, no explanation offered, no remorse, no apology-simply a statement that they got it wrong and they failed the Australian people. There are 600,000 people who are now unemployed and they deserve better than that. The business men and women who have had to close their doors on years of hard work and saving, only to find themselves bereft of everything they have worked for, deserve better than to be told by the Government leaders that they got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The suffering that this country is having under this Government's economic regime is as sad and debilitating as any we have seen in place in this country for more than 60 years. The inflation rate announced yesterday vindicates what I said in this chamber when the last quarterly consumer price index figures came down. That is when I said that the then 6 per cent inflation figure was an illusory figure and that it reflected prices during the Treasurer's petrol price freeze at the time when oil prices were being blown out of the water by Saddam Hussein. Prices rose considerably after the freeze was removed and we see this reflected in the annual inflation figure of 6.9 per cent announced yesterday. It is apparent that inflation will tend to fall in the short term. Let there be no mistake as to the reason that it will fall. It will not be the result of any anti-inflationary policy which is sadly lacking from this Government. It will be the direct consequence of the collapse of asset prices, the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> The trend of corporate decline and the record levels of small business failures will be directly reflected in the general price level. This lower inflation rate will be unsustainable and will be the by-product rather than the goal of any distinct positive policy of Mr Keating. The continual failure of the Treasurer and the trade union movement to realise that the need for inflation reduction is dependent upon wages and fiscal policy and the fact that we have a centralised wage fixing system have simply institutionalised the expectation of inflation and, accordingly, increased wages. </PARA>
<PARA> That institutionalised expectation was borne out only yesterday and again on the AM program this morning when the National Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, Mr George Campbell, said that the high cost of living rise for December justified bringing forward from 16 May to early April the claim of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) for a wage rise of $12 a week. This would be the worst possible option we could have at the time when unemployment is skyrocketing. This is the Government that has said to us again and again, every time that there was a negative response to its policies that, after all, it had kept employment growing; it had kept people in jobs. That is just not happening now. Every ounce of the Government's policies is putting additional pressure on employers who are simply buckling and unable to keep those employees they have already, let alone add new employees to their payrolls. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the labour market is that it is not a labour market at all. It is not a market. Wages are determined by the ACTU and the Treasurer together. Employers are excluded and, indeed, so are employees. The idea that employees and employers should be allowed to talk together without having the need for a third party to negotiate the best wages and conditions for them is part of our policy. It is not part of this Government's policy. It is certainly not the aim of the ACTU, whose vested interest is to keep its finger in every pie. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party will tell us that the accord has been a wonderful solution and served the country well. Indeed, the accord is part of the problem. Mr Keating has completely failed to consider the micro-economic implications of the accord and its failure to generate desirable micro-economic incentives. The centralised process is anti-productivity, anti-competition, as wage increases are applied across the board irrespective of the condition or strength of particular firms or industries. The result is a disequilibrium and the only way in which the market can clear is through rampant unemployment. Surely this is an inhumane policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This, and the impact it is having, can be demonstrated in various parts of Sydney, for instance, particularly in the west of Sydney. Today's Sydney Morning Herald shows how the Government's policies have impacted on the ordinary decent Australians who live in the west. Over the past year the dole queues have grown by an average of 33 per cent in western Sydney with areas such as Mount Druitt experiencing increases of 64 per cent; St Marys, 66 per cent and Merrylands, 70 per cent. So much for a soft landing. So much for hope. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the policies of disillusionment. Indeed, the word to describe these policies that the Government has wrought on this nation is shameful. The cold hard reality is that this is the Treasurer's own personally designed recession. In the past year, new capital expenditure was down by 3.4 per cent; new motor vehicle receipts were down by 10.6 per cent; dwelling approvals were down by 12.1 per cent; the value of building work was down by 10.6 per cent; commercial finance commitments were down by 12.1 per cent; job vacancies were down by 28 per cent; and after Cabinet's decision on Monday, it is official that the bottom has finally gone from the wool market. </PARA>
<PARA> By tying fiscal policy to wages policy, monetary policy has been all that the Government has been left with to deal with the economy. The result has been that tight monetary policy has led to an unnaturally high exchange rate, despite the intervention on the foreign exchange market, and crippling interest rates which, in turn, have strangled investment and stifled demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The net outcome has been a record number of personal bankruptcies, small business and bank failures, the collapse of investment and staggering levels of job losses. We may well say that the Treasurer's view has been that Australia had to be brought to its knees before we could see any improvement. We have one of the worst recessions in 60 years. But the Treasurer is not the only guilty party. In other areas, those requiring micro-economic reform, he has had handmaidens and accomplices. Micro-economic reform was the catchcry of the third Hawke Administration; yet we have had a failed industry policy, overseen by Senator Button, and we have seen nothing but dismal failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite simply, we have seen the failure to bring about a systematic revitalisation of Australian industry. Whether this has been brought about by sectoral plans, bounty and grants schemes, procurement and offsets policies, partnerships for development, the scandal of the Australian Customs Service or the failed management and investment companies scheme, Senator Button and his Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce have failed to establish tangible benefits for manufacturers, exporters or consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest monument to the failing policies comes in the form of the McKinsey report on the operations of the Australian Trade Commission. That body, known as Austrade, was bitterly fought over by Senator Button and Senator Evans. Which would have it-the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? If the policies of the Government were to remain the same it would not matter which department it went with. </PARA>
<PARA> The findings of that report-which Senator Button said in answer to questions today he would release, and I hope he keeps that commitment and releases it immediately-have been leaked to the Australian, to Chris Wallace. Senator Button said in Question Time today that the McKinsey report undertook a very frank review and a lot of faults were found. `Frank' could be the understatement of the year. Chris Wallace wrote, from her leaked version of the report, in a way in which the key words gave an indication of what is to come when we are finally able to read the report. She wrote that Austrade `lacks focus'; has an `inadequate management structure', `poor priorities' and `poor performance'; is `too desk-bound and paper driven'; that resources utilised overseas `are being devoted to the wrong markets'; that it has a `topheavy, highly centralised structure'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good saying that the Commission is an autonomous body and outside the reach of the Government and the Minister of the day. It simply will not do. When the Government claims to be the elected government of the nation, overseeing and implementing policies, I am afraid it has to take responsibility for the bodies even though it has purported to turn them into so-called independent entities. The report, apparently, will point out that about one-third of Austrade staff are deployed overseas, and that there are more resources in the United States than there are employed in Thailand, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and India collectively. The emphasis needs to be on establishing markets rather than providing information on existing ones. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, we have had the embarrassing spectacle of watching Government senators trying to defend the deplorable record of the policies which have been seen, overseen and implemented by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. We have seen the ploy used by Senator Maguire of setting up the straw man and knocking him down. So paltry was his own material that he had to invent what he thought would be our version of the goods and services tax. One can only suppose that he had to go back to his own Government's proposals for such a tax in 1985. There is plenty of that material around, acres, volumes of it-all the statements of Mr Keating saying why we had to have such a tax. Quite clearly, whatever recollections Senator Maguire was relying upon came from the documentation prepared by his own side of politics. As I said, one did have a smidgin of sorrow for the plight and the difficulties into which it was put. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody tonight has had the gall to defend, at this stage, the industry policies that have been put in place-except that one of the Australian Democrats tried to say that Victoria needed to have more protection because the only industries it had were protected industries and that somehow that would make things better for Victoria. If we compare it with New South Wales, where we got rid of most of those industries and we have a booming economy, I think there are some lessons to be learnt. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking forward on 12 March to the industry statement and to see what pious hopes the Government might try to hang, or salvage, its reputation on for the remaining and dwindling months that it will remain in office. Although the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have at last admitted that they got it wrong, this country has not got too many chances left. If the Government is fair dinkum about letting Australia have a chance, then it will pick up the policies that the Opposition has been offering and we will give it our bipartisan support. I ask Senator McMullan to think about it seriously because the future of millions of Australians depends on that decision. </PARA>

That person on $20,000 cannot see any equity or justice in what has happened to him or her because unless his or her partner is also earning $20,000 they, frankly, cannot survive on $20,000 under this Government. They are having the hell taxed out of them at $20,000 under this Government. There is no equity or justice in that.

This has been done repeatedly; the big lie in relation to the CPI. It has been happening all the time under this Government.

It is as simple as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The big levers that Mr Keating talks about have been pulled in the wrong direction. The micro-economic reform that honourable senators opposite talk about frankly does not exist. It is peripheral nonsense. Most of it has been devised to enable people employed in the government statutory authorities to get an increase in their salaries so that they can catch up to the private sector, and the Government has called that a micro-economic reform. The Government has changed the name and the constitution of some institution so that, instead of its being a government statutory authority responsible to this Parliament, it has become a company not responsible to this Parliament, and in that way the members of that body have been able to give themselves an increase in salary. The Government has called that micro-economic reform. That is not what micro-economic reform is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I asked Senator Collins about waterfront reform. He tried to tell the Parliament that there have been very significant changes in waterfront reform in the last 12 months. But the waterside workers on Wednesday were still having their annual picnic. They were still having their annual picnic as if it was about 150 years ago when they all went by horse and buggy down to the beach for the day. Where did they have their picnic in Sydney yesterday? Did they all go to Bondi beach or somewhere for their annual picnic? Of course not; they took the day off. Most of them probably managed to flex off on Monday and Tuesday so that they could have a long weekend running right through until Wednesday, or flex off on Thursday and Friday so that they could have a long weekend running through this weekend. The Government calls that moving substantially towards micro-economic reform on the waterfront! It is absolute nonsense in 1991. Those opposite will not address that problem. They cannot address that problem because of their relationship with the trade union movement. They do not have the courage. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition of three parties opposite cannot work together to produce any substantial micro-economic reform in this country which is worth while. They have been talking about it now for five or six years and achieving absolutely nothing. It is totally inadequate. Mr Keating knows about it. I am sure he addresses those opposite about these matters and he certainly would address his Cabinet about them, but those opposite cannot organise it. They cannot organise it because the left wing will not allow them to do this, the right wing will not allow them to do that, and the trade union movement will not allow them to do anything even if the three of them could agree on what they were going to do. Talk about a coalition of hopeless politicians!</PARA>
<PARA> It is an absolute nonsense to think that this country is being run by people who simply cannot achieve the sorts of things which this country has to have done this decade-which should have been done in the last four or five years but just have to be completed before the year 2000. We are going down the drain so fast that we have probably already become the equivalent of a Third World country. We can see that by the poverty out there in the streets. People on $20,000 a year are being taxed to hell, as Senator Maguire talks about, and are unable to meet their commitments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Had we realised what was going to happen to this Bill in the 3 1/2 years from when it was introduced until it was voted on, we would probably have considered moving some amendments to it. One potential amendment stands out. That amendment, which we would have dealt with at this stage, is that it would be a requirement in the Act that there be a chairman of the Australia Council. It is regrettable that apparently the Government does not share our concern that there should be a chairman for the Australia Council because it is now almost two months since the last Chairman, Professor Donald Horne, retired. There is still no chairman. It is probably too late for us at this stage to amend the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to raise this matter because it struck me as curious that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in his summing up of the second reading debate, replied to most of the other points made by members of the Opposition, and indeed by the Australian Democrats, but did not mention the point that there was still no chairman. </PARA>

<PARA> In the present situation a whole host of people were approached and one very publicly knocked it back.

<PARA> I ask the Government through the Minister in charge of the Senate at the moment, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), whether we can expect a response to the concerns that we have about the lack of a chairman of the Australia Council. Can he give us any indication of when the Government intends to get around to actually appointing a chairman of what is supposed to be the most prestigious arts funding body in Australia? Does the Government intend to keep going on without a chairman? Will the Government take the advice of Mr Nelson of radio station JJJ and appoint Mr Geyer, the Penrith second rower, as the chairman in the hope of getting some strength in the ruck?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the issue of Question Time in this chamber. As many honourable senators will be aware, there is considerable concern about the number of questions which are answered during Question Time. Why does this Government answer only some 22 questions, on average, in Question Time when all other governments in memory could answer some 28 questions or more? The issue has been canvassed in this chamber. As far as I am concerned, no satisfactory explanation has been given. One view that has been put is that there are too many structured questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have much experience in this chamber, but I am at a loss to understand why a so-called structured Question Time would involve longer answers than a so-called free Question Time. Indeed, judging from recent experience it could be argued that a structured Question Time can produce a record number of questions. For example, as Senator Tate will attest, on 10 May last year we had some 31 questions at Question Time, which was a record for this Government in recent years. A majority of these questions were directed to Senator Tate regarding a press briefing he gave on an issue relating to drug charges before the court. I was not a senator at that stage, but on reading the Hansard it seems to me that we had a structured Question Time with a vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA> Another view which has been put is that a too strict enforcement of Standing Orders produces chaos. I do not deny the fact that flexibility is needed, but what of the counterargument that a loose interpretation of Standing Orders-which is the current practice in the other place-produces very few questions? The other place is lucky to achieve 14 questions in 45 minutes; a performance which, it has to be admitted, is even worse than in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one denies that we have had a more liberal approach to Standing Orders in recent years. That is stated in the recent report of the Procedure Committee which Senator Ray brought before this chamber. Yet this more liberal interpretation of Standing Orders has produced, on average, low numbers of questions being answered per day compared with previous governments. I think that we must look elsewhere for an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another view put forward-by Senator Coates, I believe-is that we have many senior and very important Ministers in this chamber. I do not argue with that. Whether they are good Ministers is a different matter. I do not plan to enter into that issue this evening. In any case, history will make the final judgment. In some cases they are certainly very verbose Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Can we say that the reason the numbers in Question Time have fallen so precipitously is the fact that we have eight Ministers in the Senate rather than the six we had during the last Fraser Government? Have the number of answers to questions fallen because we have six Cabinet Ministers in the Senate rather than four, as was more typical during the Fraser period? I do not think that that type of argument stands up. I would have thought that the most obvious and satisfactory explanation is that Ministers are simply taking too long to answer questions. It is not complicated; it is straightforward. We have one hour for Question Time and very few answers are given. What is the reason for that? Essentially, but not exclusively, the reason is long answers. Of course, some answers must be long because they deal with important and weighty subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to a question by Senator Hill today, Senator Evans gave a long-I am sure this is the view of all honourable senators-but important answer. The Government would respond that some of the questions are too long. Senator Faulkner sometimes makes that sort of accusation. I agree. Senator Powell today, for example, seemed to be making a speech rather than asking a question. Whatever the sins of Senator Powell and the rest of us concerning the length of questions, let us face the fact that it pales into insignificance compared with the length of answers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we make a mistake if we try to think of too complex explanations for the poor performance, on average, of the Hawke Government Ministers in answering questions. It has little to do, in my view, with a structured Question Time or the number of Cabinet Ministers in this chamber, as Senator Cook alleges. It has more to do with longwinded answers, often by Senator Bolkus, Senator Cook and possibly Senator Collins. No-one will deny that long answers are often in response to dorothy dixers. At times these answers are more like ministerial statements than answers to questions. This is an issue for Standing Orders. We all seem to agree that it is better to answer more questions in Question Time than fewer. Even Senator Ray said yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in Question Time we should try to get more numbers up . . .</PARA>
<PARA>To that I can only respond: hear, hear! The final point I wish to make is that I do not think the statistics sustain the point that the performance of Ministers in Question Time is improving. I have carefully examined the statistics tabled by the President yesterday. For the life of me, I cannot discern any significant improvement in Question Time performance as measured by the numbers of questions answered. Indeed, the performances seem remarkably consistent over the period of the Hawke Government. In the past three days the number of questions, including supplementaries, that have been answered is 21, 21 and 17. If this trend continues, 1991 may well be one of our poorer years. As Senator Ray said, it is important to get the numbers up. Yesterday I said in the chamber, and I quote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Thank you, Senator Macdonald. This is what I said yesterday. Senator Robert Ray should call for his Hansard, get it out and read it.

<PARA>I am not urging that it be tightly constrained by rules, but I am urging that we should see a tighter application of standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA>This was, somewhat surprisingly in view of the astonishing reaction yesterday, the effect of a recommendation which the Procedure Committee presented to this chamber via Senator Ray and which was accepted by the President. I say that we should get the numbers up; Senator Ray says we should get the numbers up. There is no argument there; Senator Ray and I are both agreed on the matter. I say that there should be a tighter application of Standing Orders; Senator Ray says, in the report presented to the chamber yesterday and accepted by the President, that there should be a tighter application of Standing Orders. No argument there. The question I ask myself is: why should I have been subjected to such a vitriolic attack by Senator Ray? Let us recall what he said. In effect it was: `I am not a man of vengeance but, if I am ever over that side, I will get you'. That is really an impressive performance by a senior Minister in the Hawke Government. You will have a pretty early chance to be over on this side and then you will have a really good chance to get me and the rest of my colleagues, and it will be a long time in the getting. </PARA>

Senator Ray must now sit in the chamber tonight to hear the perfectly reasonable and sensible comments that I would have made yesterday. Frankly, Senator Ray has brought this on himself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would the Minister like to repeat that? It was such an incomprehensible interjection. The message regarding Question Time which was noticeably missing from yesterday's debate should now be given, and it is this: if Ministers become self-indulgent and excessively long in their answers, the President should use Standing Orders, which are available to him, to bring answers to an end. If this is done we will certainly achieve more questions being asked in Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable senators, right around the chamber, for their contributions tonight. It was very good to hear the honourable senator from Victoria trying to make a better speech than he obviously made yesterday. Turning to the reason Senator Kemp was not given leave yesterday, one of the disadvantages of speaking early in a debate is that one gets sweated on. One puts up all one's arguments early and other people come in, not always even representing one's arguments accurately. They often knock them down, irrespective of the logic that one has used. That is one of the unlucky points of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Senator Kemp has been here a bit longer he will notice that a senator from Western Australia always speaks at the end of debates. He never misses. If there are 30 speakers on the list he is always twenty-eighth. He has learnt the lesson that if one speaks last and this side runs out of speakers, one never gets attacked. Unfortunately for Senator Kemp yesterday, he had to get up and make his cogent points and he had other people come in and attack. Some of the attack was valid and some was not. He felt frustrated and therefore he wanted to respond yesterday. But politics is a bit tougher than that. One has to learn to win or wear it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My car is not booked until about 20 minutes to 12. I am quite happy to be here. If Senator Kemp wants me to turn this into a half-hour speech I will. However, I will not do so. I have a couple of points to make on the substantive issues that Senator Kemp has raised. Whether his obsession with Standing Orders is healthy or not for his political career, I do not know. I would not mind seeing him broaden his horizons just a little, but maybe that is unfair. Just concentrating on Standing Orders will get him nowhere. I suggest he go to some of the broader issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the numbers in Question Time, 21 : 21 is an average performance. Today was a very poor performance in terms of achievement. Maybe Senator Kemp should come and sit on this side in Question Time and hear how many times Ministers are interrupted. Senator Button, in answer to one question today, was interrupted 30 or 40 times by those opposite. So, when they call the President to rule things orderly and to make achievements here and tell Ministers such as myself to sit down, at the same time the President is going to tell them to shut up and stop the constant barrage of interjections. No-one objects to the odd barrage. What Senator Kemp was subjected to tonight is what most Ministers are subjected to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, you were, just by two or three people. When 15 or 20 people are doing that-interrupting the flow of answers-the answers will lengthen. When we talk about behaviour in this chamber it is a two-way street. I do not know what the perfect number is in Question Time-whether it is 20 or 25. I have often thought that even the formula we use in this place is probably unnecessary. I think that sometimes some of the questions we get from our own side are unnecessary. Some are; some are just fillers. It has been ever thus since the existence of parliament-either in the House of Representatives or the Senate. We take our quota to fill in the time. If it had taken Senator Evans seven minutes to answer Senator Hill's question today, I do not think anyone in this chamber would have objected. It was a serious, current question about the tragedy in Baghdad yesterday. So one would expect a seven-minute answer to that.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not, and we have not this week. With all due respect, the one long answer we got from Senator Cook today was when we had a continual barrage of interjections from those opposite-non-stop. Quite clearly, this week Senator Cook has abbreviated his answers. That is obvious to anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We are getting these long questions. Meanwhile, Senator Alston and others are firing more questions in. Some of us ignore them and others try to be helpful and answer them. If we actually added up some of the questions answered by way of interjection today, we would be up around 25 or 26.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem of people being frustrated by not being able to ask questions has been exacerbated by many matters. The fault is neither on this side of the chamber nor on the other. And, if it is, it is fairly evenly divided. Again, we will remind our front bench to try to cooperate and get as many questions up as possible. Some of the interjections we hear in Question Time are clever, witty, and make their point and some are very wounding, but loud grunts and groans from one or two people-a barrage from foghorn leghorn at the back here-are not helpful to the progress of this chamber. These interjections can be dealt with in several ways. They can be dealt with by a loud shout. I defy the whole lot of you to shout me down if I hit top key in terms of voice level, but that is not particularly desirable, especially when we are televised. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there is some substance in the point being made by Senator Kemp. I do not agree entirely with his analysis because I do not think that he recognises all the factors. But the Standing Committee on Procedure has looked at it and will keep it under review. I have enormous difficulty in accepting Senator Kemp's point. The President tries to be non-partisan. He is non-partisan in these matters. He tries to adjudicate. To try to adjudicate on relevance is very difficult. How can a President know the substance of every policy area covered here and know whether it is still relevant?</PARA>
<PARA> It is very hard to know at which point of answering a question it becomes debating or simply an embroidering of the answer, which leads me to the final point. Questions may have to be standardised. If questions are poorly based with misassumptions in them, why can the Minister not debate them? I do not see an answer forthcoming immediately. I, as Manager of Government Business, do not mind reminding all the Ministers that a notional figure of 24-odd questions a day, including supplementaries, would be desirable. It would be nice if some people did not come into this chamber with a supplementary question already written out. Some do it with a bit of dash and elan; others get up and ask a supplementary question even though the question has been answered. </PARA>

I do not think that the Opposition ever recognises that, but it happens occasionally.</PARA></TALK.START>
