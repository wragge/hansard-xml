<PARA> (a) immediately withdraw from hostilities in the Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) bring our naval force home from the Gulf.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that sections 59 and 60 of the Defence Act 1903 can not be applied to the conflict in the Persian Gulf. These sections</PARA>
<PARA>authorise the Government to call on Australian men between the ages of 18 and 60 years to serve in the Australian Defence forces for the duration of the war. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has stated categorically that it will not revive the National Service Act of 1951 in order to conscript Australian men into the forces to serve in this war. The Australian Democrats understand those statements to be Government policy. We are introducing this Bill to ensure that that policy is adhered to for the duration of this conflict regardless of the demands or pressures which may be placed on the Government or any future Government to commit large numbers of land forces to the Gulf. As this measure is simply to place on the statute books Government policy with which the Australian Democrats fully agree, we can see no reason why the legislation should not gain a speedy passage through both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>This is perhaps the classic example of the Democrats in our perceived role of keeping them honest. It is our aim to firmly shut the door which currently leads to the option of re-introduction of conscription by the Government without reference to either Parliament or the people. </PARA>
<PARA>This move is of course not going to come as a surprise to any who have sat in this Chamber for any length of time. Some eight years ago, former Democrat Deputy Leader, Senator Colin Mason, introduced a Bill to require a referendum before conscription could ever again be implemented by an Australian Government. In 1987, his successor, Senator Paul McLean, introduced a similar measure, with the additional requirement that before Australian forces are ever again committed to overseas service a vote of both Houses of Parliament would be required. I therefore take grave exception to the mindless comments of some of the Hawke Government's Ministers who claim that this is an opportunistic and cheap publicity stunt. </PARA>
<PARA>An examination of Sections 59 and 60 of the Defence Act could lead to the view that if a Government wanted to re-introduce conscription to meet demands placed on us by our allies in relation to the Gulf War, it may be difficult to implement. None of the provisions of the National Service Act 1951 would be available to the Government as has already been established by the Minister for Defence Senator Ray in answer to a question by Senator McLean on 12th November. </PARA>
<PARA>However, while it could be argued that at best Sections 59 and 60 of the Defence Act provide a doorway to conscription which is cramped and mis-shapen the Australian Democrats would argue that any Government determined on such a course could still wriggle through it. The Proclamation of the call-up under Sections 59 and 60 of the Defence Act could detail procedures which the Government could in fact wholly draw from the now suspended National Service Act of 1951 to ensure that the call-up's validity and effectiveness was secured against any legal challenges by those seeking to resist the call-up. </PARA>
<PARA>This brings me to the substantive basis for the Bill. The Australian Democrats agree with the Government that conscription is an option which should only be available to a Government in order to meet a threat to Australian Security from a foreign power or powers. There is no suggestion that such a situation exists as part of the Gulf conflict nor that it could exist as a result of any future developments in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>These views on the pre-conditions for the re-introduction of conscription have of course been a cause for historic debate in Australia in the past. The Labor Government which took Australia into the First World War collapsed over the issue of conscription being used to increase our commitment to a conflict which did not represent a threat to Australian security. The Liberal Government which took Australia to Vietnam was defeated largely over the issue of conscription being used to fight a United States sponsored war of intervention which did not represent a threat to Australian security. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as the ALP gained new members because of its opposition to our involvement in Vietnam and was able to gain the strength required to win office in 1972, Australian Democrat offices are now hearing about the massive number of resignations from the ALP and loss of public support because of their commitment of our forces in the Gulf. The people of Australia will ultimately make the decisive judgement on this horrific blunder by the Hawke Government. In the meantime the protests will continue and public opinion will continue to turn against the war. </PARA>
<PARA>During this period the Australian Democrats seek to limit this Government or any future Government to the level of commitment already made and to work towards the recall of our forces as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, Australian Democrats offices have received many calls from parents of sons over 18 years of age appealing to us to make sure they will not be called up and sent to the Gulf. There is a high level of anxiety in the community about the Government's commitment of our forces to the Gulf but that anxiety reaches grave proportions in the minds of those whose family members would be subject to conscription if a Commonwealth Government was persuaded to re-introduce it. No amount of assurances by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence can calm that anxiety more effectively than the speedy passage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move, pursuant to contingent notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 154, standing in the name of Senator Hill for this day, relating to Soviet military actions in the Baltic States. </PARA>
<PARA>Horrible things are occurring in the Baltic states today and this matter is therefore of great urgency. Today as we are assembled here Soviet troops are moving into Estonia and the democratically elected parliamentarians of Estonia and their supporters are having to put up barriers around their Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago, at least five Latvians were killed when Soviet special beret troops attempted to storm the Interior Ministry building in that state. A few days earlier in Lithuania, as honourable senators are aware, Soviet troops stormed something like seven different institutions, killing some 14 persons, including innocent civilians, and injuring many others. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, as we stand here, there are rumours of presidential rule from the Soviet Union, which is the equivalent of martial law, and of the democratically elected leaders of the Baltic states being called to Moscow to be told this unfortunate news. </PARA>
<PARA> Huge rallies are occurring in Moscow in support of the Baltic states and those who are prepared to stand and defend their so dearly won and new freedom. It is so critically important that democracies around the world at this time of urgency give support for those within the Soviet Union and the Baltic states who are prepared to stand up against this horrible violence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most regrettable that this seems to be occurring not simply by coincidence with the Gulf war, when the attention of the world community has been diverted to that occurrence. Therefore, to some degree the international community has been unable to focus on the type and extent of the violence that is occurring in the Baltic states. If it were not for the Gulf war, the events in Lithuania, where tanks in fact ran over civilians, would have been regarded as another Tiananmen Square incident; and we know the extent of the world community's reaction to that event. But it has not occurred because of the diversion of the Gulf war, which only increases our responsibility to take action today and at the very least to pass a motion which condemns the violence that is occurring and calls upon certain actions to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament is not the only body that is concerned about this matter. Democracies throughout the world-in Britain, the United States of America and the European Community-have been passing similar motions calling upon their governments to put pressure upon the Soviet Union to desist from the use of violence in this way and in fact to look at other possibilities. Honourable senators would be aware that today the European Community is considering its resolutions in respect of aid support to the Soviet Union and the big economic powers will also be looking at their economic packages to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> So the matter is critically urgent. It is important that the Soviet Union is left in no doubt at all that the world's democracies simply will not tolerate this abuse and killing of innocent people who are simply wishing to stand up for the freedoms they had won at a price after decades of occupation. They will not be subjected to the restraints of dictatorship as they have been in the past and we must therefore offer our support. If this motion is passed and the Senate understands the urgency of this matter, I will seek to move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores the brutality used against the citizens of Lithuania and the deaths of fourteen people arising from the use of force by Soviet troops on 13 January;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the assault by Soviet troops on the Interior Ministry in Riga, Latvia on 21 January in which at least four persons were killed and nine injured;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) is appalled by the additional threat of force against the democratically elected Parliaments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) demands that the Soviet Union in accordance with universally accepted principles of human rights desist from the use of military force and violence against the peoples of the Baltic states;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) calls upon the Australian Government in conjunction with other democratic states to protest such brutality to the Soviet authorities and in international human rights forums; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) calls on the Soviet Government to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of those Republics which have expressed through democratically elected parliaments a desire for self-determination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion was not called formal and many people opposite would realise why it was not. On many occasions one has had to negotiate in order that a motion can be declared formal. I think most members of the Opposition understand that we on this side of the chamber cannot support a motion which calls on the Government to do something being dealt with in this way-other processes have to be adopted. Senator Hill apparently-and I will withdraw this if it is not true-has shown no flexibility in modifying this motion so that we can all join him in respect of the principles that he has enunciated in his motion for the suspension of standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say-and I have not been involved in the process-is that I think it is a pity that we have not been able to resolve a motion to get the unanimous support of the Senate in a formal process. I think Senator Hill would concede that over the years we have never allowed a clause through that calls on the Government; it is usually phrased in another way which does not see the Senate as a formal chamber, with us being part of the chamber, calling on the Government to do something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My first point is to explain why, in spite of most of the substance here, which I have no problem with, we could not agree to the motion being called formal. Now we face the secondary issue, which is whether we should suspend standing orders to debate this motion. It is an important issue; one cannot belittle that. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have another important issue to continue to debate this morning. Necessary arrangements have been made so that that debate is carried on national television and we are eroding that time at the moment. I believe it should have priority. That in no way denigrates this other issue-it is very important. But Parliament was specifically called back to debate the Gulf issue. I refer Senator Hill to Dr Hewson's press interview where he consistently said that we were coming back for two days to debate the Gulf issue and the Gulf issue alone. </PARA>
<PARA> If standing orders are suspended and we have a long and sustained debate on this matter, I think we will very much be treating the other debate as a second issue. Quite frankly, I think that would be putting the cart before the horse. I think it is a pity, given the fact that there is almost unanimity on the issues, that this matter could not have been sorted out so that we could have had a united resolution of the Parliament. I do not know whether there is any point in reopening the negotiations to see whether we can come to a motion with which we all agree and which will not require a large and long debate that intrudes into the Gulf debate. I think it would be a pity if it does. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I recognise this other very important issue but life does go on. The Gulf cannot dominate everything; other issues need to be addressed and cannot be put into the background. But, I think that this morning, given the reason for the recall of Parliament and the arrangements that have been made, it would be a preferable course for this chamber to finish the Gulf debate and to consider the other matter over the next few hours to see whether we can, through negotiation, get a motion that not only this side and the other side of the chamber but also the Australian Democrats and the Independents can agree with and which can be put through in a formal sense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the suspension of standing orders. While Senator Ray pointed out that the Parliament has been recalled to debate a specific matter, the matters in Senator Hill's motion- matters which we have also raised by way of notice in this chamber, even today-are currently very urgent and important. They are matters which are related to the very debate which the Parliament has been recalled to undertake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important for the Government and the people of Australia to get a clear view of where their parliamentary representatives stand on this matter. Bearing in mind that many members of the Senate have yet to speak, I understand it is intended that this should be a limited debate. We believe that this is a matter of urgency. We support the suspension of Standing Orders at this time. Senator Ray made the point that there should be negotiation of notices between the parties and the Independents in this place. This is only a two-day sitting. It does take time for negotiations particularly with Ministers, shadow Ministers and my portfolio holders, the same people engaged in the substantive debate during this non-sitting period. </PARA>
<PARA> By virtue of the statements we have already made, I think it is quite clear that we, along with members of the Opposition, consider this to be a very important and opportune time to discuss this particular issue and, therefore, we support the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, support the suspension of Standing Orders. I will be very brief. I will make two points: firstly, newspapers have only one front page. If the Gulf war was not taking place at this time, splashed across every front page of every newspaper in every State of Australia-indeed the world-would have been the brutal treatment by the Soviet army of the peaceful demonstrators in Lithuania trying to protect the media; that is, free speech. Secondly, overnight we heard of the brutal killing of people in Latvia during the storming of the Interior Ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Hill has said, this Parliament ought to understand that the parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia-the centres of democracy-have had to be barricaded, barbed wire has been put around them, tank traps have been put around them so as to prevent the Soviet armed forces from entering those citadels of democracy. We, as a parliament, have a very important task. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray indicated that for the Government to agree to this, it ought to surely agree to what it is being called upon to do. In the motion as I see it the Government is being called upon to do one thing. Paragraph (e) states:</PARA>
<PARA> calls upon the Australian Government in conjunction with other democratic states to protest such brutality to the Soviet authorities and in international human rights fora;</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has already done the first part, but what about the international fora? What is wrong with protesting about the brutality in international fora? What is wrong with this motion?</PARA>
<PARA> I was consulted late last night on this motion. As far as I am concerned, it is not strong enough. Surely the Government is not being called upon to do very much other than what it has already done thus far. Therefore, I support the suspension of Standing Orders and believe that this motion ought to be carried unanimously by the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to support Senator Hill. I am very pleased to hear of the support he has from Senator Powell and Senator Harradine in moving the suspension of Standing Orders on this matter. I do regret the reasons, which may be explainable, that this matter has not been declared formal. This is a major issue indeed. As Senator Harradine has said, if we had not had the smokescreen from the Baltic states point of view of the Gulf war, it would be major headlines around the world; indeed, in many instances it is today. It is on the front page of the Australian and it has been on the front page of many other newspapers as well. I use the word `smokescreen' very deliberately because the world may not remember that the annexation of the Baltic states and the movement into the Baltic states by the Soviet Union in 1940 took place under the smokescreen of the day before the fall of Paris to the Nazi forces. I think that there is a very strong argument to be made that the timing of the Soviet action in relation to Lithuania, Latvia and now Estonia was very significantly influenced by the events in the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a major issue. It is one of the two issues that have made a major setback to the cause of world peace and stability in the last 12 months. This issue, plus the Gulf crisis, are the two issues of paramount importance in determining the course of order, stability and peace, or no peace, in this world. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say to Senator Ray that there was no suggestion here that this matter ought to be given priority over the issues that we have been recalled to debate, but to suggest-I am sure Senator Ray did not mean to do this-that this was a matter of other than significant importance I think would be a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not find Senator Ray's comments convincing in relation to his opposition to declaring the motion formal on the basis that one paragraph of the six paragraph motion moved by Senator Hill calls upon the Australian Government to do something. Paragraph (e) calls upon the Australian Government in conjunction with other democratic states to protest such brutality, as is occurring in Lithuania, Latvia and now Estonia, to the Soviet authorities and in international human rights fora. </PARA>
<PARA> The key action paragraph of the motion is paragraph (f), which states:</PARA>
<PARA> calls on the Soviet Government to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of those republics which have expressed through democratically elected parliaments a desire for self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA>That is really the key paragraph of this motion. I hope that not one member of this Parliament would be opposed to that paragraph. Indeed, if there were such opposition, then it makes a mockery of the stance that this nation has so proudly and rightly taken for 50 years virtually without exception on the question of the legality or illegality of the annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union in 1940. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is a very important motion indeed. I hope that the Government will have another chance to look at its position on it because I think that it would do great good to the cause that we are all striving for of peace, stability and order if we could have unanimous support for this motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I had not been personally involved in that. I did not know about that until I got in this morning and was told that the motion as moved had two problems. One was in the formulation of the last paragraph. I had not had time obviously in the rough and tumble of events with the Gulf to focus on that. I looked at that a few minutes ago and decided that there is no problem in terms of the formulation of the last paragraph. The content and the flavour of it are clear and are entirely consistent with the position that this Government has taken. I am not prepared to quibble about the language in which that is expressed; I think that is okay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The remaining problem we have, as so often with these motions, is the penultimate paragraph calling upon the Government to do various things-which conveys the implication that we have not been doing them. I want to say for the record that so far as the events in Lithuania are concerned, we have made very clear our position on that-publicly by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and in terms of direct representations to the Soviet Ambassador on 14 January. As far as the events in Latvia are concerned, yesterday afternoon the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Woolcott, made our concerns very clear indeed to the Soviet Ambassador and I am in the process of putting out a further Government statement re-enforcing that in an overt and public way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is something we have been doing in the course of events and, with the utmost respect, we do not need to be told that we should be doing it on matters of this kind. I can assure the Senate that we are very conscious of the issues concerned. Senator Hill, with his usual grace on these matters, has conceded that point and is prepared to amend slightly the language of that penultimate paragraph accordingly. In the sweet spirit which is thus prevailing, I hope that we can curtail what otherwise might have been a protracted debate and get on record a very firm parliamentary statement of a position that obviously in substance we all share. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply say that I support the suspension of Standing Orders, which I thought would have been clear from the motion I moved this morning which was in similar terms. I did so specifically because I returned, as did many other senators and members, from overseas having been away only three days. I was, at the time of returning, attending a meeting of the executive of the International Democrat Union. That executive meeting managed to discuss not only the Gulf itself and the questions that had to be dealt with but also the question of the Baltic crisis. I am pleased to see that the Government is now of the view that we are able to deal with both matters at the same time as well as meetings of an international nature and character.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel that with the importance of what is occurring in the Baltic nations if we did not place on record at the recalling of the Parliament our strong condemnation of the actions against the freely elected parliaments of the people of the Baltic states then we would be sadly remiss. I think the importance of the press conference called by Mr Yeltsin calling on Russia's troops not to fire upon the people of those Baltic nations has been very significant and if we had failed to deal with this matter in this Parliament we would have been most remiss.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly support the motion to suspend Standing Orders. I am delighted to hear that the Government has agreed that Senator Hill's motion is reasonable and should be passed by this Parliament. I have been totally appalled by the events that have been occurring in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Baltic states, and could not understand why the Prime Minister is not making as much fuss about this as he made about the Chinese tanks running over the citizens of China. This is a worse situation because these countries are not part of the Soviet Union. They have been independent countries and recognised as independent countries by all governments in this Parliament since Mr Whitlam made his incredible faux pas in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see this as being very much akin to the Soviet attack on Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Surely that warrants this Government protesting very loudly about this matter. The only other thing I wanted to raise was the difference between this motion, No. 154, and my motion, No. 156, which I hope will be carried formally in a few minutes time. My motion was actually prepared before No. 154 and dealt with events before the recent attack by the Soviet troops on the citizens of Latvia, which is why I did not mention Latvia in my motion. Also, I went directly to the point of calling on the Government of the Soviet Union to act on this matter whereas Senator Hill, in addition to calling on the Soviet Government to do something, calls on the Australian Government to take some action. There are some fundamental differences between the two motions, but I believe that both should be carried by this Parliament. </PARA>

There was never an intention for a long debate on this matter. There was never an intention to divert from the principal reasons for which the Parliament has been called back. As I sought to explain in seeking the suspension, one of the great concerns about this issue is that it is not receiving the attention that it demands from the world community because the world's attention has been diverted to the Gulf issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point I make briefly is that we can always find some set of words to accommodate the Government's concern that if the motion is passed in this form it will mean Government senators calling upon their own Government to take certain action with which they are uncomfortable. But the real area of concern that could not be accommodated came this morning when I was told that the Government could not live with the word `independence' in the last paragraph. The Opposition believes that it is absolutely critical that the Soviet Government is called upon to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of those republics which have expressed through democratically elected parliaments a desire for self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had a rethink, as Senator Evans indicated, and is prepared to accept paragraph (f) of our motion. We are pleased that it has reached that position. I seek to amend my motion by deleting paragraph (e) and substituting the words:</PARA>
<PARA>strongly believes that the Australian Government in conjunction with other democratic states should protest and continue to protest such brutality to the Soviet authorities and in international human rights fora; and</PARA>
<PARA>In moving the motion in that amended form I hope the Government will take that seriously. We on this side of the chamber would like to see it take the question of this brutality to the floor of the United Nations General Assembly. We would like to see it taking it to the Human Rights Commission using all the resources that are open to a country such as Australia to bring force upon the Soviet Union to desist from this brutality. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the brutality used against the citizens of Lithuania and the deaths of fourteen people arising from the use of force by Soviet troops on 13 January 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the assault by Soviet troops on the Interior Ministry in Riga, Latvia on 21 January 1991 in which at least four persons were killed and nine injured;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) is appalled by the additional threat of force against the democratically elected parliaments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) demands that the Soviet Union, in accordance with universally accepted principles of human rights, desist from the use of military force and violence against the peoples of the Baltic States;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) strongly believes that the Australian Government in conjunction with other democratic states should protest and continue to protest such brutality to the Soviet authorities and in international human rights fora; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) calls on the Soviet Government to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of those republics which have expressed through democratically elected parliaments a desire for self-determination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by the Government regarding the Gulf crisis. In speaking, I indicate my total opposition to the circulated amendment from the Australian Democrats which, I understand, also has the support of Senator Vallentine. In supporting the motion, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate one aspect which I know some speakers have already drawn attention to, but which in its own way justifies the actions that the allies have taken in the Gulf; it is the appalling human rights record of the regime in Iraq, not just since Iraq's invasion and plundering of Kuwait over the last six months, but the regime of Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party over the last 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am, like many members of this chamber, a member of Amnesty International and the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group. There is probably no country that has had more adverse reports in the last 20 years than Iraq regarding human rights abuses. I draw to the attention of the Senate some of these abuses to give a flavour of what has been going on in Iraq over the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a report of Amnesty International on Iraq's occupation of Kuwait which came out at the end of last year. It is called Human Rights Violations Since 2 August. It is quite a detailed report. I think other members of the Senate have seen copies of it and may have had the opportunity to read the full report. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring the attention of the Senate to some of the lists of human rights abuses and methods of torture that the Iraq regime has been using against the citizens of Kuwait. On pages 37, 38, 39, and 40 Amnesty International carefully lists, from interviews with people who have fled Kuwait, the types of tortures that have been used against the citizens in Kuwait. Thirty-eight accounts are given. I will not read them all but I will put on record a few of them to give a very unsavoury flavour of what has been going on. I have been disappointed that in the speeches I have heard in the Senate from the Australian Democrats and from Senator Vallentine there has been no recognition of this appalling record of human rights abuses. That has been quite disappointing. Some of the types of tortures reported by Amnesty International are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Beatings on all parts of the body, including punching, slapping, delivering Karate-style blows and kicking with heavy army boots. Implements used for beating include canes, metal rods, whips, steel cables, hose pipes, rubber truncheons and rifle butts. </PARA>
<PARA>Other methods of torture that are quite common are described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Falaqa: prolonged beating on the soles of the feet. Sometimes the detainee is then forced to walk or run. </PARA>
<PARA>Suspending the detainee by the feet, or by the arms which are tied behind the back. </PARA>
<PARA>Beating the detainee while suspended from a rotating fan in the ceiling. </PARA>
<PARA>Breaking of the arms, legs or ribs; dislocating elbow and shoulder joints. </PARA>
<PARA>Lifting the detainee high up in the air and then dropping him, sometimes resulting in the fracturing of bones. </PARA>
<PARA>Applying pressure to the fingers with a clamp-like instrument. </PARA>
<PARA>Slashing the face, arms or legs with knives. </PARA>
<PARA>Extracting finger and toenails. </PARA>
<PARA>Boring a hole in the leg, apparently with a type of drilling tool. </PARA>
<PARA>Cutting off of the tongue and ear. </PARA>
<PARA>Gouging out of the eyes. </PARA>
<PARA>Castration. </PARA>
<PARA>Hammering nails into the hands. </PARA>
<PARA>Piercing the skin with pins or staplers. </PARA>
<PARA>Shooting the detainee in the arm or leg at point-blank range, followed by deprivation of the necessary medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>Rape of women (including virgins) and young men. </PARA>
<PARA>Inserting bottlenecks, sometimes when broken, into the rectum. </PARA>
<PARA>Tying a string around the penis and pulling it tightly. </PARA>
<PARA>Pumping air using a pipe through the anus, particularly of young boys. </PARA>
<PARA>Applying electricity to sensitive parts of the body, including the ears, lips, tongue, fingers, toes and genitals. Sometimes the detainee is doused with water prior to the administration of electricity. The electrical instruments used include electric batons as well as wires fitted with clips (like those used to recharge car batteries but smaller in size). </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on through four pages listing the types of torture the Iraqi authorities have used in Kuwait in the last six months. But long before the invasion and occupation of Kuwait, there had been endless reports of the abuse of human rights by the present regime. In a report called Human Rights in Iraq, Middle East Watch from the middle 1980s, the conclusions and recommendations state:</PARA>
<PARA>Iraq is a well-organised police state and its government is one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in power today. With the exception of freedom of worship, the Iraqi government denies its citizens all fundamental rights and freedoms, and ruthlessly suppresses even the smallest gestures of dissent. Iraqi citizens enjoy neither freedom of expression nor freedom to form or join political parties or trade unions of their choice. Their government subjects them to forced relocation and deportation, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, disappearance, and summary and political execution. There is no meaningful legal recourse in Iraq against these abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi government imposes its rule through:</PARA>
<PARA> the Baath party's monolithic organisation, which penetrates all elements of society and is responsible for enforcing political and social conformity; a pervasive system of informing-such that Iraq has become a nation of informers-which denies Iraqis the right to express their views candidly, even in private, and encourages friends and family members to report on one another;</PARA>
<PARA> a highly developed cult of personality for President Saddam Hussein, active participation in which has become a test of loyalty and a prerequisite for advancement;</PARA>
<PARA> secret-police agencies that are empowered to arrest, detain without trial, torture and kill. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a report from the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Another report from Amnesty International is entitled IRAQ Evidence of Torture 1985. I will just quote briefly from some of the evidence of torture and abuse of human rights:</PARA>
<PARA> Five people said they had been totally or partially stripped: a women said she had been made to stand naked for a long time in front of her interrogators without being blindfolded; three people said their genitals had been pawed. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight people, including two women, said they had been threatened with rape, and two with having a bottle inserted into their rectum. </PARA>
<PARA> One man said both of these physical abuses had actually been carried out on him. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight people said their interrogators had threatened to arrest, torture or rape members of their family, including children. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1985, long before the invasion of Kuwait. That was the regime conducting its policies against its own people and not even against the Kuwaitis, who it may claim, of course, to be members of another country. It was against its own people. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have unlimited evidence that Iraq should stand condemned in the eyes of all civilised people and civilised societies for being one of the worst regimes in the post- Second World War period. There should be absolutely no doubt on the part of anybody in Australia in condemning this regime. In my view, if there is an argument for saying that a war is justified, that military action and intervention against a regime such of that of Saddam Hussein is justified, it is this one. </PARA>
<PARA> I am distressed by remarks made in this place by members of the Australian Democrats, and by Senator Vallentine last night in particular, which I find extraordinary. I do not doubt Senator Vallentine's sincerity about being opposed to war. Everybody is opposed to war. But it is a meaningless statement to say that one is opposed to war because, unfortunately, people like Saddam Hussein are not opposed to war. They see it as a logical instrument of international action. Unless we take action against those people, our being opposed to war means that they will always win. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night Senator Vallentine quoted the views of Martin Luther King, because two or three days ago in America it was the celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday. She said, `What would Martin Luther King be saying about the American involvement in Iraq'? I would like to quote from Martin Luther King in the 1960s:</PARA>
<PARA>He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it.</PARA>
<PARA>Martin Luther King recognised evil. He recognised the evil of the racist policies of the southern states of America with the segregation and took action to overcome it. Obviously in the end he paid with his life for taking those actions. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting what he said and I am saying that he recognised evil. I also want to quote something that has been said here so often in other debates and which was first of all said by Edmund Burke in April 1770. The original statement, which is often paraphrased today, was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When bad men combine, the good men associate, else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle. </PARA>
<PARA>That has often been paraphrased as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>I remember many years ago as a student reading probably what is considered the greatest novel in modern times-Tolstoy's War and Peace. When one reads War and Peace, the theme that comes through consistently is that evil will triumph unless good people combine to oppose it and fight it. If they do not combine to fight it then it will triumph, and that has been the lesson of history. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the greatest historical book written, which is probably the basis of modern historical research, is Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. If one reads the full unabridged version of that book one will find again that emphasis-that unless good people combine evil will triumph. I think too many people in the Democrats and Senator Vallentine have found themselves falling for the easy thing to say-`we are opposed to war'-without realising that sometimes unless we fight the evil people will win because we do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that Senator Vallentine also further irritates me with the morality she puts forward-that she is the only one who wants the world to be good; she is the only one who knows how to explain why the world can achieve things through peaceful means. I do not disagree that we all want that, but I also point out to Senator Vallentine that she has no monopoly on virtue, no monopoly on those sorts of views. I point out to Senator Vallentine that, when I and my colleague Senator Walsh were demonstrating in the streets against our involvement in the Vietnam war, Senator Vallentine was a member of the Country Party in Western Australia-a party that supported overtly and strongly our involvement in sending young conscripts to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that after a period of time she left the Country Party. She then joined the Australian Labor Party. She left the Labor Party and joined the Nuclear Disarmament Party. Then she left that and for a while was an independent nuclear disarmament politician, and she is now a member of some sort of Green organisation. I am reminded of a famous statement by Billy Hughes towards the end of his long parliamentary career. He was asked, `You have been a member of the Labor Party, the Nationalist Party, the Liberal Party and the United Australia Party. Why haven't you been a member of the Country Party?'. He said, `Good God man, you have to draw the line somewhere'. It is a line that Senator Vallentine chose not to draw from the very beginning. She has even beaten Billy Hughes's remarkable record of being a member of practically every party conceivable. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing about Senator Vallentine which I find extraordinary is that she issued a press statement on 21 January and she made remarks last night further emphasising it. I want to quote from this part of her press release. She says:</PARA>
<PARA>A denial of information to Israel via Nurrungar which would be crucial for their use of Patriot missiles, as such a contribution negates Australia's official policy of even-handedness in the Palestine-Israel conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>She is criticising the fact that we are using information from Pine Gap and Nurrungar, but particularly Pine Gap, to warn civilians in Israel that they may be attacked by Scud missiles that not only have conventional warheads but also have, potentially, germ or chemical warheads. </PARA>
<PARA> She criticises us for trying to protect ordinary civilians who have made no attack on Iraq and who are not involved in the fighting but are a part of Saddam Hussein's policy of trying to draw Israel into the conflict in order to destroy the Arab coalition that supports the allies. She criticises the use of that information. I would have to say that, under any sort of civilised regime anywhere in the world, that is the most useful thing that Pine Gap can be used for-to warn civilians not only in Israel but in any country that they could be attacked by terror weapons of a mad dictator. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is extraordinary that Senator Vallentine would criticise the Government and criticise the United States for allowing the joint facilities in Australia to provide that sort of warning to ordinary civilians in Israel, or any other country that may be attacked. Senator Vallentine makes the point, and so do the Democrats, that we should have given sanctions more time to work. What I find extraordinary is that when this debate started in August-September of last year, when we said that we would put our naval ships into the Gulf to ensure that the sanctions would be effective, the Democrats and Senator Vallentine opposed it. They said it was terrible to get our ships involved and ensure that the sanctions were effective. Now they are claiming that we should allow more time for the sanctions to be effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that they would shift their position so dramatically. Five months ago they complained that we were making the sanctions too effective by having our ships there and now they say that we did not give enough time. If we had taken their advice five months ago, the sanctions would not have been in any way effective because none of the allies would have had the ships in the Gulf, the Red Sea or anywhere else, stopping Saddam Hussein's ships getting through with supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine goes on at some length to say that Australia should not be involved in any war and that we should always use diplomacy. I want to ask Senator Vallentine and the Democrats a question about the negotiations in Cambodia, which is an area that I have had some interest in. I think I am the only member of this chamber who, since the early eighties, has visited Cambodia twice. Probably, and hopefully, some time this year a UN resolution will be carried that says that Cambodia will have a United Nations peacekeeping force, and that Australia will contribute part of its military forces to that peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Vallentine: what happens if Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge refuse to accept a peace arrangement and start fighting? Are our soldiers supposed not to fight and protect ordinary Cambodian civilians? Are we to say that because we do not agree with any self-defence and with arming our soldiers to protect Cambodians, we are going to stand by and allow Pol Pot to carry out a second genocide? Of course that is absurd. We have to allow, in particular circumstances, the use of force to protect ordinary civilians and ordinary people against the evil that is Pol Pot. Yet if we take the view of Senator Vallentine and the Democrats to its logical conclusion, they say that we should not be in Cambodia using arms to protect the ordinary civilians against the homicidal, psychotic Pol Pot. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area where there has been a war for 30 years is Eritrea. I think I am the only member of this Parliament who has visited Eritrea. I support the Eritrean cause because the Eritreans have a just cause. They were illegally incorporated into Ethiopia. I say to Senator Vallentine: do the Eritreans have to lay down their arms and allow another maniac dictator called Mengistu to wipe them out? He has carpet bombed every town that the Eritreans have. He has killed hundreds of thousands of people. He spends 50 per cent of his domestic budget on weapons. Is Senator Vallentine going to say that they have no right to defend themselves? Go and tell the 15-year-old Eritreans I met who are going up to the front to defend themselves and their families that they should lay down their arms and not fight. It would be absurd. We cannot take the view of Senator Vallentine or of the Democrats. We cannot say, `You can't fight. You shouldn't fight to defend yourselves'. There are circumstances in the world where one has to fight, where people have every right to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by putting my view about what has happened in the Gulf and about the future of the UN. For 30 years people, including the Democrats and Senator Vallentine, have been complaining about the ineffectiveness of the UN. They have argued that superpower rivalry has made the UN a useless debating chamber. Finally, at long last the UN is starting to act the way it was envisaged by people like Dr Evatt in 1945-to be the international mediator. Dr Evatt made it quite clear that it did have to have the power to intervene militarily to defend countries from aggression by a neighbour such as Iraq. I quote two parts of Dr Evatt's speech in 1945:</PARA>
<PARA>If economic or diplomatic sanctions: are deemed inappropriate to the situation or prove ineffective, the Security Council may take any military action necessary to suppress the aggressor. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It must be made crystal clear that the nations seeking representation in the world organisation must be prepared to contribute their share of physical force to restrain the action of proved aggressors. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Dr Evatt in 1945. He knew what powers the United Nations had to have: it had to have the ultimate sanction of military force to stop aggression. Senator Vallentine and the Democrats do not want to concede that point. In not conceding that point, they condemn the UN to endless irrelevancy and uselessness, because an aggressor will know that in the end it will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that as a result of the Gulf decisions in the UN, we have now established the precedents so that the superpowers, whether they be the United States (US), the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, and the other permanent member of the Security Council, China, understand that from now on there is a new environment in the world, that we expect these sorts of conflicts to be resolved by debate and discussion and that the UN is the appropriate forum in which decisions will be reached. We do not accept unilateral action. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is to be welcomed by those people who have been very critical of the United States, in particular, over not using the UN in past disputes, that the US has now committed itself and is going to find it very difficult in the future to go back on using the UN as the appropriate forum. It will destroy its own credibility in western Europe, with countries such as Australia and with people such as myself, as a member of the Australian Labor Party, if it intends in the future to ignore the UN as the appropriate body to settle international disputes. If it does so, it will suffer the consequences. I think it should be welcomed that in the long run this will mean the UN will triumph as the international body. This has been Labor Party policy for 40 years: it is what we have been seeking to achieve. I think that achievement is something to look forward to. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that from time to time in the future Australia will be required as a middle power in the UN to provide military forces to stop aggression or to be part of a peacekeeping force. I am not an isolationist: I am an internationalist. I believe that after those requests have been properly debated and decisions have been reached in the UN, we would, in our own context, meet those requirements. We cannot, in this world today, allow ourselves to become isolationists or allow ourselves to say that the rest of the world can look after itself but we are not going to be participating in it. That is no role for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats get up here and argue endlessly about international activity on environmental issues and trade issues. We cannot participate in those issues at the international level and then say, when the real crunch issue is on, when there is naked aggression, `Ah, we are going to wash our hands of it; let someone else do the dirty work of stopping aggression'. We cannot say that and still expect the rest of the world to take notice of Australia's views on international environmental issues, international trade issues, social issues, population problems and so on. We want to play a part in all those, but when it comes to the bottom line of stopping aggression, are we going to squib it? That is not the Australian way. It never has been and I hope it never will be.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me say this about the future of the UN: there are many countries that do not have democratic forms of government. I think a UN, revitalised, knowing that it has the power and the status to impose and express strong views about human rights issues, about dictatorships, may in fact be able to use that new influence to encourage dictatorships to go by the way. </PARA>
<PARA> A country that I have a particular interest in is Burma. I would hope that in the next 12 months a revitalised UN can use its influence with its new standing to say to the military regime of Burma, `You must stand aside and allow the democratically elected Government, which was overwhelmingly supported by the Burmese people, to take office, because if you don't, the rest of the world, through the UN, will consider taking some firm action against you'. Ask 36 million Burmese people what they would think about that UN action. They would cheer it to the echo because they know it may be the only way that they can get a decent government that is going to be democratic and is going to provide them with a decent standard of living and a decent system of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people are not going to be worried too much about whether this is an interference in their internal affairs, because they have expressed their view. This terrible military government killed 4,000 people in 1988, has tens of thousands locked up already and is now torturing many in terrible human rights abuses. So I hope that the new United Nations-the new atmosphere that is being created-will enable us to say that there is a better chance in the 1990s and in the new century to ensure that the Saddam Husseins of the world are going to be taken on and defeated. I think in the long run all of us agree that that will be a major achievement for a better world. </PARA>
<PARA> I am terribly disappointed to hear the views of the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine. They have not been able to delineate the difference between the meaningless statement of saying, `We all oppose and abhor war' and pragmatically, properly and constructively doing something about it. How can one say to Saddam Hussein, `We all oppose war', and then let him get on with the job of doing what he wants to do-that is, invading other countries? Those honourable senators have put up a meaningless statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad I have had the opportunity to take part in this debate and that the Parliament has been recalled to have it. I am very pleased that overwhelmingly the majority of Australian parliamentarians and the people understand a very basic principle-that is, naked aggression such as Saddam Hussein has shown cannot be allowed to go without forfeit. It has to be opposed. By opposing it, no matter that the cost in some cases will be terrible, in the long run the world will be a better place because the United Nations will have much more influence. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These two days are very sombre days indeed. The Parliament is dealing with one of the most serious matters to come before it-that is, the involvement of our armed forces in armed conflict. No other war in history has generated so much public discussion and debate and no other war has received so much publicity after it has started. Prior to the commencement of this war there was considerable national and international debate. That is indicative of the fact that people worldwide, including Australians, consider it is their individual responsibility to come to a clear, informed and conscientious decision about this most grave matter and that it is very important to develop a view about it. That has been reflected in the debate in this chamber and in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate has been quite wide ranging. Many of the contributions have been incisive and all have been sincere. For my part, I have difficulty in coming to an informed, conscientious decision about this war and Australia's involvement in it. I might say that a few years ago I would not have had so much difficulty in arriving at an informed view based on a conscientious decision. Although I have had an interest in international affairs for many years, I am not in complete possession of all the strategic facts and circumstances, knowledge of which is rather vital to a final determinant of the issue. Whether or not to commit Australian defence forces to armed conflict is a decision for the Government to take under the Constitution. But I believe that Australian citizens have a responsibility, through members of parliament, to make their position clear to the Government and for the Government to follow that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, this war is probably one of the most publicised wars in history. I deplore the euphoria with which some of the media, particularly the television media, deal with some of the defence military actions taking place in the Gulf states. Everybody in this Parliament is against war. War and its aftermath are accompanied by much distress and evil. Indeed, history shows that sometimes the very principle in defence of which a nation has gone to war is later besmirched by those very nations which have become the victors under different guises. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons that the West went to war against Hitler-the Nazi regime-was that regime had no respect for human life. Indeed, that regime had a philosophy which was dubbed by them Lebensunwertes leben-life unworthy of life. The Nazi doctors, under authority from that regime, were empowered to declare that certain individuals had a life unworthy of life. So many went to the gas chambers. There was a national card index established which would attempt to detect those with genetic disorders and have them sterilised. The Nuremberg trials were held after the war and the Declaration of Helsinki was made in order to attempt to uphold the principle of the worthiness and inherent value of each human life. </PARA>
<PARA> But now we see in some of the very countries which fought against that, including the United Kingdom, and to some extent Australia, attempts to establish that same vile principle of life unworthy of life-to attempt to detect the presence of genetic disorders in the unborn; not to cure the disorders but to eliminate the bearer. That is not to say, of course, that the action taken against Hitler and his regime was not required. Of course it was required. It was demanded and it should have taken place before it did. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said in this debate, those of us who know a bit about history and have read about that period are aware that a number of people high up in the German Army were hoping that the allied powers would act against Hitler before they did. The allied powers had too much patience with Hitler, as has been said. Hitler was able to go into Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia and Austria. His expansion was met head-on after he invaded Poland. In a way, we have a possible similar situation today with Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to range over the very clear and thoughtful contributions that have been made in this debate in this chamber. I believe the motion needs to be restated, and I am going to restate it because it is my intention to vote for the motion, though I believe that it has some inadequacies. The motion is:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate</PARA>
<PARA> reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and self-determination of nations and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely no-one can argue against that paragraph. It is important that the United Nations has an ongoing role in promoting world peace and self-determination of nations. One of the problems of course with that is that there is a veto in the Security Council, and really in some of these areas it depends on whether China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics agree. In my view that is not appropriate. However, if the United Nations is going to do any good at all, then I believe that the motion does indicate how this should occur. Clearly, that paragraph of the motion indicates to all concerned that the Senate agrees that the invasion by Iraq of Kuwait was simply robbery with violence. Iraq has not gone in and just taken everything out. That has happened, but it is occupying Kuwait. It is not only an invasion; it is an occupation. The attempts therefore of the Security Council decision and its call upon nations to support it were to try to get Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, to withdraw his occupying forces from that country. The second part of the resolution says:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate . . . </PARA>
<PARA> affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 678 for support in implementing that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course our naval forces went to the Gulf area to participate in the blockade in support of sanctions against Saddam Hussein. The question has been raised in the debate as to whether the particular prerequisite before a country goes to war has been tried; that is, that all other measures have been tried, whether sanctions really have been tried, and whether diplomacy really has been tried. I am not going to go over the responses that have been given by those who have responded to these questions, but I have listened and I have considered that matter very carefully, as to whether sanctions have been given a chance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that sanctions were working to the extent that the interdiction was successful-over 90 per cent-but that is not the test of whether the sanctions were working. Working means whether they were having an effect on the decisions that were being taken by Saddam Hussein. That is the test as to whether they were working or not. Clearly they were not working in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question arises as to whether we should have given them more time. It has been clearly stated that there were certain strategic reasons, as well as humanitarian reasons, for a time limit to be put on the sanctions. As we all know, that time limit was 15 January. Why put a time limit on it? That is a very good question. One of the reasons that have been advanced is that, if a time limit were not imposed, then strategically military action would have been most difficult to mount successfully because of geographical, meteorological and other factors, for a period of about four months. Secondly, in that time, what is happening to the people of Kuwait? Are we to stand back-in face of the evidence that has been provided to us by Amnesty International of the gross violations of human rights that have taken place in Kuwait by the Iraqi occupation forces? Thirdly, would the time that Saddam Hussein would have been given have enabled him to develop the biological weapons of warfare, the chemical weapons-he has already developed the chemical weapons but obviously has difficulty in achieving their launch-and also, perhaps, a nuclear capacity? As has been said, what effect would this have had on the coalition of forces in the Gulf? These are some of the humane as well as strategic considerations which are appropriate for us to reflect upon when coming to a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding diplomatic efforts, I do not know of any previous occasion in modern history where an aggressor has been given so many diplomatic chances to back off. As was indicated here by one of the speakers yesterday-I think it was the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)-the United Nations Secretary General's efforts appeared to indicate that there was no hope that Saddam Hussein would change his mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The French, who know this area very well, even after the deadline had expired gave an opportunity to Saddam Hussein which any reasonable person, surely, would have accepted. It had benefits for Iraq, but it was not accepted. The motion goes on to state that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces serving with the UN-sanctioned multi-national forces in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly support what has been said about our naval personnel and other personnel in the area. They deserve our support and their families, friends and relations deserve our support. ``The penultimate paragraph of the motion says that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack upon Israel. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever attitude Iraq may have about Israel, and whatever problems Israel itself has posed for the Arab nations and others, there is no justification whatsoever for the action of Iraq in widening the conflict. It is important to understand that this measure clearly appears to be an attempt to bring onside those Arab nations which are currently offside with Saddam Hussein. Finally, the motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>I will vote for that particular paragraph of the motion, but I believe that it is inadequate. The reason I believe it is inadequate is that establishing peace and stability in the Middle East may not provide protection for the human, political and civil rights of the peoples in the area. Much has been said about the concept of a new world order and collective security. It is important, when considering a new world order and collective security, that it is based on respect for the human, civil and political rights of people. </PARA>
<PARA> I assume that the Government agrees with that. I was in touch with the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about that particular matter. I suggested that that might go in, but it was too late at that time. The Prime Minister's office indicated that as far as it was concerned that was the basis upon which peace and stability in the Middle East should be established. The motion reads that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I reckon some of the people with whom we are associated in the Middle East at the moment would not recognise the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East based on respect for human, civil and political rights. For example, President Assad of Syria is not well known for his support of human, civil and political rights. Indeed, one of the victims of this conflict is Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> To a certain extent, the policy of the United States of America in Lebanon has contributed to a betrayal of that country, and to a betrayal of human, civil and political rights in that country where Syrian armed invasion, other armed invasions, and civil strife have contributed over a period to 150,000 dead in that country. In recent times, since the Gulf war started, the 40,000 to 60,000 Lebanese who were in the Gulf area-in Kuwait and other countries-have had to get out, and are now unable to send financial support back to their homes, and Syria has extended its control over that country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view-and I believe and hope that it is the Government's view, because it has been stated to me by the Prime Minister's office-that the motion means that there is a need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East based on respect for the human, civil and political rights of individuals, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issues and the continuing security of Israel once the Gulf crisis is resolved. That is very important because unless we get, and try to uphold, civil, political and basic human rights in the area, there will never be peace in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that, whilst it was important for this Parliament to be recalled for this very important debate, it is also important for all of us, individually and collectively, to pray for world peace; to pray for peace in our own hearts and minds, in the community within which we live, in our own homes and, in an extended way, peace for the world. My prayers and thoughts are with those people who are currently suffering in this Gulf crisis, and those people who are suffering because of the smokescreen, mentioned by Senator Short, which is being used by other dictators such as the Soviet Union to put down democracy in the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a very difficult matter for me as it has been, I believe, for all Australians, but it is my intention, having made up my mind, to vote for the motion and to get out and strongly support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to compare the situation facing the world now with that facing us 12 months ago. Twelve months ago we saw the end of the Cold War; the collapse, we believed, of communism and of the repressive regimes in eastern Europe, and the rebirth of freedom and democracy in those nations. We had also seen the apparent and encouraging movement in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics towards greater freedoms and a hesitant start towards the establishment of democratic institutions and a democratically elected parliament. As a result, there was the flowering of hope that the world was on the verge of a new order: a new era of political freedom, of economic development and, above all, of peace and stability. Since then two disasters of great magnitude have occurred. The first was the commencement on 2 August 1990 of a new and terrible war with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The second was the brutal use of force by Moscow against the Baltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in recent days, weeks and months, about which the Senate unanimously adopted a condemnatory motion only an hour or so ago. (Quorum formed)</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the Gulf crisis is concerned, I wish to add my voice to that of other Government, Liberal and National Party senators and Senator Harradine, and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in expressing my strong support for the motion before the Parliament. I echo Dr Hewson's sentiments that the Opposition stands united with the Government in condemning Iraq's brutal invasion and ruthless occupation of Kuwait; in our belief that the United Nations is upholding the principles of its charter; in supporting the current nature and extent of Australia's defence involvement in the Gulf crisis; and in strongly supporting the role of the United States of America, and particularly President Bush, throughout this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> For the entire post-Second World War period, which now extends well into its fifth decade, the United States has been the torchbearer for freedom in a troubled and largely undemocratic world where basic human rights and values have been ignored or violated much more frequently than they have been respected. The United States has been supported in this role by many other nations at different times, notably Britain and, I am very proud to say, Australia. But the United States has carried the main burden. It has done so again on this occasion of the Gulf crisis, in the sense that it was the United States that initiated much of the activity within the United Nations that led to that organisation, for the first time in its history, playing a fundamental role for which it was established, namely, taking action to oppose the invasion and repression of one sovereign nation by another. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be stressed too often: the war that Iraq commenced on 2 August last has now been joined by the most diverse coalition of nations in modern history, nations whose participation is sanctioned by the moral authority of the United Nations, nations who have joined battle for only one reason-that over a 5 1/2 month period Iraq arrogantly and deliberately defied no less than 12 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which, inter alia, condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and called for its withdrawal, called initially for economic sanctions and-in the final resolution, resolution 678-approved the use of force to evict Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of those 12 resolutions was passed by an overwhelming majority. On nine of the 12 resolutions the vote was unanimous. Virtually every member of the United Nations-Senator Gareth Evans in his contribution to this debate yesterday said 157 of the 160-supports the action being taken by the allied forces to eject Iraq from Kuwait and to restore sovereignty to that nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The world's condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is reflected in the extraordinary coalition of, as I said, no fewer than 28 nations who make up the United Nations sanctioned multinational force. It is not just America, Britain and Australia that are involved; it is 28 nations from all continents and of all political, social and cultural persuasions. No fewer than nine of those 28 nations are Arab nations. This war is not an Arab versus non-Arab war or a Muslim versus non-Muslim war. It is a war joined on the one hand by Iraq, led by a ruthless and brutal dictator and tyrant and, on the other hand, by a large and representative group of nations that believe that the rights of nations, particularly small nations, to preserve the integrity of their sovereignty and the freedom of their citizens are basic conditions not only worth fighting for but also without which there is no hope of individual, national or world peace, order or stability. </PARA>
<PARA> The 28 nations that make up the coalition ranged against Saddam Hussein are very diverse. As well as the United States, Britain and Australia, the coalition includes Canada, New Zealand, France, Denmark, Norway, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Netherlands, Argentina, Germany, Bangladesh--</PARA>

I will come back to the protesters a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point that cannot be stressed too much is that the allied objective is not to invade or to subjugate Iraq; it is to liberate Kuwait, to restore its sovereignty and independence and the lives and freedom of its citizens. Since 2 August last, Kuwait has been pillaged, destroyed and raped by Iraq. Iraq installed a provisional government comprising Iraqi officers with whom even the Kuwaiti opposition members were not prepared to cooperate in the formation of a puppet government. Iraq has since annexed Kuwait and declared it to be its nineteenth province `forever'. The disputed Rumaila oilfield in Kuwait and the islands of Bubiyan and Waaba were renamed Saddamiyat al-Mitia and annexed to the Iraqi province of Basra. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has since based its refusal to withdraw from Kuwait in the first instance upon the unqualified proposition that Kuwait is a part of Iraq. The annexation of Kuwait in two parts shows clearly that Iraq regards the oilfield and the two islands as non-negotiable. Iraq has destroyed and looted Kuwait. Kuwaiti assets have been seized, stripped and transported to Iraq. Internal resistance has been suppressed with the use of systematic terror. According to Kuwaiti sources, an estimated 7,000 Kuwaitis were killed in the first three months of the invasion; of the 800,000 Kuwaitis, 400,000 have fled to Saudi Arabia or have remained abroad; whilst of its total population of two million, many non-Kuwaitis have fled the country through Jordan. There are now more Iraqi troops in Kuwait than there are Kuwaitis. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq is led by a man who cannot accurately be described in any way other than evil. Saddam Hussein's record of ruthlessness and brutality, not just against other nations but even more so against his own people, has few parallels in modern history. His drive towards nuclear weapons a decade or more ago, which was confronted successfully by Israel when it destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor, is just one example of his military intention. Enthusiasm for unconventional warfare is only one of the characteristics of Hussein which should excite the outrage of peace demonstrators. As was outlined in the Weekend Australian of last week:</PARA>
<PARA>When Saddam seized the leadership of the Iraqi Ba'athist Party in 1979 he moved against five of his closest supporters, had them tortured, staged public confessions, and then took part himself in their execution, apparently by machinegun. Torture and execution of supposed dissidents became routine and most probably has intensified since the annexation of Kuwait. Religious and tribal dissent has been met with particular ferocity. Hussein butchered the dissident Muslim leaders of the Dawa. He used mustard gas and cyanide, on a scale . . . not witnessed since the German gassing of Ypres in 1917, against the Kurds of Halabje-men, women and children-and then renamed the town after himself. </PARA>
<PARA> No class of people was immune from his poison gas: not the Iranian troops fighting the original Gulf war; not the Iraqi deserters who perished in the southern marshes of their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA>In April last year he promised that his binary chemical weapons would lay waste to half of Israel should he be attacked. Following the invasion of Kuwait, he used innocent hostages from different nations of the world as a human shield to defend his defence installations. Today it is reported that Saddam proposes to use captured allied prisoners of war as human shields at strategic positions. Not only is such action obscene in itself but it also constitutes a total violation of international conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month Amnesty International produced an 80 page report on the widespread abuses of human rights that have been perpetrated by Iraqi forces following the invasion of Kuwait. The report says that violations reported since 2 August 1990 are entirely consistent with the abuses known to have been committed in Iraq over many years. The report of Amnesty International goes on to say that Iraq's policy of the brutal suppression of all forms of internal dissent continues to be implemented and the people of Iraq remain its victims.</PARA>
<PARA> The report lists some of the methods of torture that are carried out by the Iraqis under Hussein's direction. Scores of them are listed in the report--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one is disagreeing with that, Senator Vallentine. If Senator Vallentine is proposing that two wrongs make a right, I would be very surprised. Let me give some examples of the sorts of tortures involved: beatings on all part of the body, involving punching, slapping, delivering karate-style blows and kicking with heavy army boots. Implements used for beating include canes, metal rods, whips, steel cables, hosepipes, rubber truncheons and rifle butts. Torture also included falaqa, which is prolonged beating on the soles of the feet; breaking of the arms, legs or ribs; dislocating elbow and shoulder joints; slashing the face, arms or legs with knives; extracting finger and toenails; boring a hole in the leg; cutting off the tongue and ear; gouging out the eyes; castration; hammering nails into the hands; rape of women and young men; inserting bottle necks, sometimes when broken, into the rectum; applying electricity to sensitive parts of the body, including the ears, lips, tongue, fingers, toes and genitals; burning various parts of the body; pouring caustic substances onto the eyes causing blindness; raping or torturing the detainee's relatives in his or her presence and threatening the detainee with such acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me now say something about the peace protests that are occurring and some of the comments made during this debate by the peace group spokespersons, in particular Senators Powell and Vallentine. No-one denies protesters on any cause the right to protest. Indeed, in Australia and other Western nations like the United States and Britain, it is a basic right. They would not be able to do the same thing in Iraq, as the Amnesty International report illustrates so graphically and horrifically. </PARA>
<PARA> While fully accepting the right of protest, I share the profound disagreement of my Liberal and National Party colleagues, and of most, though not all, members of the Government with what the peace protesters are saying. I would like to ask a few questions of them. Why do the protesters seem to protest only when the stance of the United Nations and other like-minded nations are involved? Why did the protesters protest only once the United Nations sanctioned multinational force had been deployed? Why did they not protest between 2 August 1990 and 15 January 1991 at Saddam Hussein's plundering of Kuwait, his raping of Kuwaiti women and his killing of their children? Why did they not protest that it is Saddam Hussein alone who has refused to give peace a chance? It is Saddam who, to use the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), is shedding blood for oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be clear on this fundamental point: the full weight and authority of the conscience of the world-the United Nations-called on Iraq for peace no less than 12 times following its invasion of Kuwait. Twelve times the United Nations was denied; 12 times its plea was met with a deafening silence by Saddam or by arrogant rejection. Peace was given every chance by the United Nations and its member nations. The only denial of peace or any prospect of it came from Saddam Hussein. Every action he took, every signal he gave, showed beyond any doubt that he had no intention of withdrawing from Kuwait or of providing the peace that the rest of the world so desperately and patiently sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell, Senator Vallentine and the peace protesters argue that the economic sanctions were not given sufficient time to work. The evidence is overwhelming that the sanctions were not having sufficient impact on Iraq to force it to withdraw from Kuwait. Western intelligence sources estimated that the sanctions would not have the necessary impact even if they were continued for another 12 months or possibly much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, what happens to Kuwait? What does the rest of the world do? Sit on its hands? Sit by and watch impassively while the pillaging, the raping and the killing of innocent men, women and babies continues remorselessly and without cause. If that is what seeking peace at all costs is all about, I do not want-and I do not believe many Australians would want-any part of such non-existent, mythical peace. As the Prime Minister said last week, when confirming Australia's involvement in the coalition force:</PARA>
<PARA> We all of us wish for peace . . . But we cannot have peace just by wishing for it or just by talking about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to work for it and sometimes, tragically, we have to fight for it. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. In his address to the United States people last week, President Bush said:</PARA>
<PARA> While the world waited, Saddam Hussein systematically raped, pillaged and plundered a tiny nation no threat to its own. </PARA>
<PARA> He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities. </PARA>
<PARA> And among those maimed and murdered-innocent children. </PARA>
<PARA> While the world waited, Saddam sought to add to the chemical weapons arsenal he now possesses, an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction: a nuclear weapon. </PARA>
<PARA> And while the world waited, while the world talked peace and withdrawal, Saddam Hussein dug in and moved massive forces into Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>President Bush is right. No-one doubts the sincerity of many of the peace protesters. We all share their fierce desire for peace. I do not know anyone who does not want peace. But what the protesters need to come up with are concrete, practical proposals as to what they would do. It is not enough merely to mindlessly chant, `Give peace a chance'. I have heard of no concrete, practical solutions or proposals from the protesters that would in any way have influenced Saddam Hussein's brutal, murderous, repressive, tyrannical actions. </PARA>
<PARA> If Saddam were permitted to take Kuwait without resistance, does anyone doubt that he would move to take control of the Saudi oilfields or to pursue his development of nuclear weapons to add to his armoury of chemical weapons? Does anyone believe that this would lead to peace in the Middle East or elsewhere? I put it to the Senate that anyone who believes that is gravely misguided. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein is clearly and unequivocally opposed to withdrawal from Kuwait under any circumstances. He has and continues to violate the rule of law in international relations, let alone basic rules for human rights. For this reason alone, opposition to Australia's role in the multinational force is opposition to the rule of law in international relations. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning we heard on radio Iraq's senior representative in Europe, the Iraqi Ambassador to Paris, ask what are Australia's interests in the Gulf that were affected by what Iraq was doing. He clearly believes that we have no interest there. The Iraqi Ambassador is wrong for many reasons. As Dr Hewson said in the House of Representatives yesterday, Australia's interests in the Gulf and what is happening there are real and they are vital. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat here some of those interests. We do have an interest in helping to build a new international order where the strong are just, the weak are secure, and the peace is preserved; we do have an interest in making the United Nations an effective means of establishing such an international order; we do have an interest in resisting Saddam Hussein's threat to regional stability and security, particularly that of Israel; we do have an interest in deterring or preventing the use of chemical warfare and other weapons of mass destruction; we do have an interest in helping to ensure that the international oil market is not held to blackmail as a result of Iraq's aggression; and we do have an interest in helping to end the brutalisation of Kuwait's citizens and the appalling violation of their basic human rights over the past 5 1/2 months. No civilised country can ignore those appalling facts. So our interests in the Gulf crisis are real and they are vital. </PARA>
<PARA> I was going to comment in some depth on Senator Vallentine's contribution to this debate last night and refer to what I regard as her quite disgraceful and disreputable behaviour in both the Senate and the House of Representatives yesterday. On reflection, I think it is better to leave her to be judged by her own words and actions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Senator Vallentine made two or three points in her remarks last night on which I must comment. One comment was that it is the coalition forces' invasion of Kuwait that will destroy Kuwait. That, surely, has to be the theatre of the absurd. Kuwait is being ruthlessly destroyed hour by hour and has been for the last five months by Iraq. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I say, another point that Senator Vallentine made was that the attack on Israel would not have happened if the multinational force had not moved in on Iraq. The attack on Israel was a deliberate ploy by Iraq to try to divide the coalition. Israel is to be congratulated in the strongest terms for the moderation that it has exercised in non-response to that attack. Israel is the innocent victim of that attack; it is not part of this aspect of the Gulf crisis. So Senator Vallentine's argument to me just turns logic completely on its head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point that Senator Vallentine made was: why is there a difference between action on UN resolution 242-and I think probably resolution 338-in relation to Israel and resolution 678 on Iraq? There are totally different circumstances between the two. Resolutions 242 and 338 set out provisions to be met by both sides of the conflict and requiring negotiation between them. One of those issues was the settlement of boundaries between the then warring parties of 1967 and 1973-boundaries which had never been determined, whereas in the case of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, established and recognised international boundaries were being, and are being, blatantly violated. The onus for the implementation of resolutions 242 and 338 has thus never rested exclusively with Israel; indeed, the Arab side, which had lost territory in both wars, was for several years ambivalent about the resolutions mainly because they implied recognition of the state of Israel. I just repeat that the circumstances between the two are totally different. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Vallentine outlined various alternative courses for action-I accept what she said-in a speech she made in the Senate last year. She advocated negotiation and mediation. As I understand it, all the proposals she made in that speech have either been rejected out of hand by Hussein directly or indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two final points which I regard as very important. Firstly, I add my thanks, my congratulations and my prayers for our service men and women who are serving with the multinational force in the Gulf-those now serving, those who have served, and those who will serve. I say to them, `We are all very proud of you. We are eternally grateful to you, as will be all peoples who believe in true lasting peace, freedom and security'. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to say to the Australian public-which is now very heavily supportive, with support running at 75 per cent for and 18 per cent against the action in the Gulf, and with Australia's involvement supported by 69 per cent and opposed by 24 per cent-that it is essential that we all hang in there with our support. </PARA>
<PARA> The war could be protracted. The British Foreign Secretary the other day talked of it taking months. We saw how support for the war in Vietnam eroded as it dragged on. This will not be another Vietnam, of course, but it is very important indeed that the Government, the Opposition and all like-minded people continue to do all possible to keep public support by explaining the continuing reasons for Australian involvement. The cause of freedom, stability, security and world order demand it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the motion before this chamber. The decision to go to war is never an easy one, nor should it be. It is not easy for the world community, it is not easy for individual nations and it is not easy for individuals within those nations. (Quorum formed) The human cost of any war is monumental. The financial costs are immense. Resources and the environment are eroded. These considerations must weigh heavily on all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To me, as an individual who has campaigned for peace for over 26 years, this decision was not an easy one. As a long time member of Australia's peace movement, as an individual with a deep commitment to human rights, and as a person who believes in the peaceful co-existence of peoples and nations, I have thought deeply and seriously about my attitude to the current situation. As a member of Australia's Left movement, I have taken into consideration the views and beliefs of all my friends in that progressive movement-both in Australia and internationally. The decision I have taken to support this resolution is one that I deeply believe in. It is consistent with my principles. It is, I believe, consistent with a sustainable Left position. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four basic, long held principles which have guided me in supporting our current commitment in this conflict. They also underlie the Government's decisions. These four principles are basic to the philosophy of the Left, in this country as well as internationally. First is the Government's and my personal opposition to war and our commitment to world peace. We have pursued both global and regional initiatives for peace. Our work at the United Nations (UN) on disarmament issues, on confidence building measures for peace and on regional security issues is acclaimed worldwide. Our initiatives for a nuclear free zone treaty in our region and for a resolution of the Cambodian issue are honourable ones. Peace does not come easily-it has to be worked at and worked for. Unfortunately, at times it has to be fought for. </PARA>
<PARA> The second principle is a belief in the independence of nations and the self-determination of their people. We have opposed, and we must oppose, foreign intervention in and aggression against nations. The third and increasingly important consideration relates to the role of the United Nations. The Australian Labor Party has long cherished the concept of the United Nations as an influential and effective forum and mechanism for the resolution of international conflict. The current crisis demonstrates the potential for the UN in this role. The fourth belief is one that goes directly to the immediate issue. That is, the quest for a just resolution to the Middle East conflict, to the Palestinian homeland issue and the security of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have stated, these four principles are and should be basic to the position of progressive political movements both in this country and internationally. It is a fact that the Left in Australia has not been exclusively a pacifist movement. It has consistently supported armed struggle. It has consistently argued for intervention to protect the independence of nations and the self-determination of people. As a movement, we have supported armed struggle in countries both far from and near to our shores. In the last half of this century, we have had many examples of this. We should not forget them and for the record some need to be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> We committed ourselves to the struggle against fascism in Spain in the 1930s and 1940s. We committed funds, we committed arms. Australians went to Spain to fight against fascism. The Communist Party in Australia was at the forefront of these initiatives, but it was not alone. Workers and other individuals, unions and other groups joined that struggle. The Spanish struggle was not in our region. Our commitment to fight for peace and freedom was recognised internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Abbot at the Benedictine Monastery of Montserrat, which protected democrats during the civil war, said to partisan veterans in 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>In you are demonstrated the values which are necessary for the future of humanity; the capacity to find common cause with people of other nations, the fact of giving your own lives to defend the peace and freedom of other people; the fact that you came over here by yourselves without obligation. That is why I am thankful to you and grateful that you have come to meet me here at Montserrat. </PARA>
<PARA>The Europeans said Australia and Australians were so remote from Spain that we could have been forgiven for not wanting to take part in the struggle. But we, the Left, did so. There have been many instances since where the progressive movement in this country has endorsed armed struggle in pursuance of the aims of freedom, equality and independence of nations. We endorsed the war against Hitler and fascism. We supported the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the imperialists. For years, the Left has supported the Fretilin movement's armed struggle in its quest for self-determination. We have supported the majority of black peoples of South Africa, particularly the African National Congress. </PARA>
<PARA> In Central America, the Left supported the Sandinistas in their struggle and now continues to support guerilla movements in El Salvador and neighbouring countries. Support for armed struggle, therefore, is not alien to the Left. As I have said, the Left is not, and has not been, exclusively a pacifist movement although we hold the quest for peace as one of our most basic political tenets. We have supported in principle the whole post-World War II decolonisation process. This has been characterised by wars of liberation against European powers with liberation movements supported by the communist bloc and opposed by the United States and colonial powers. Rhetoric that we hear now has generated from that period. The world, however, has moved past that decolonisation era, beyond wars of liberation against European powers and the Cold War is now over. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue, therefore, is whether the use of force in this instance can be justified and whether it can be morally sustained in the current Gulf crisis. On 15 January, UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar made one final plea to Saddam Hussein. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I most sincerely appeal to President Saddam Hussein to turn the cause of events away from catastrophe and towards a new era of justice and harmony based on the principles of the United Nations charter. </PARA>
<PARA>This plea had been made before. It had been made by all sectors of the international community consistently over the almost five months of Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. It was a plea that had been made by the West, by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), by non-aligned countries, by the European Community, by Pacific countries and by the Arab League. Most importantly, it was a plea that had been made a dozen times by the world community by way of UN Security Council resolutions. It was a plea that had been rejected as often as it had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> All attempts at peace through diplomatic means and at negotiations to prevent war had failed. In Hussein we are being haunted by a monster the world helped to create. He has been supplied with arms when he should not have been. He has been able to develop chemical weapons and he should not have been. He has been able to develop political support around the world out of the world's failure to apply itself to resolving the Palestinian issue. On 2 August 1990 he took a brazen and unjustifiable step in annexing Kuwait. I do not need to go in great depth into the situation in Kuwait since the invasion of 2 August 1990. We need to remember that Kuwait has been taken over by Iraq and that there are over 300,000 Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait outnumbering the 200,000 Kuwaitis who remain. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to recognise that on 19 December Amnesty International documented a very comprehensive picture of human rights violations including detention, torture and summary executions. We should acknowledge that Iraq's looting of Kuwait has also been well documented. It amounts not to casual heat of the moment looting but to the deliberate, systematic pillage by one country of another. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has stated many times that Kuwait is its nineteenth province. The world cannot tolerate this sort of annexation. So, Mr President, the world is confronted with a situation of intransigence which, if not addressed, condones the takeover and destruction of Kuwait. We are also confronted by a person who now threatens to destroy another state which has UN support, the state of Israel. But we are confronted with more than this: we are confronted with a person whose potential resources and power are a threat to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> How we respond to Hussein is at issue. This particular crisis arises at an important moment in world affairs. It arises at a time when there is a major change in the world power balance. It arises at a time when there are changes in the structure of world power. Cold War and detente are over. We now have to meet the challenge that this recently created and fluid situation presents. It is my firm belief that this challenge can be met by the United Nations and the increasing role that body is playing, and has to play, in world affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go to that, let me tackle three issues that have been raised over recent weeks in respect of Australia's response to this crisis. We have been accused of acting in haste. Let the record speak for itself. This matter has been progressing since August 1990. During that time we have had 12 UN resolutions directed at the Gulf crisis. We have had more than 100 countries supporting decisions made at the United Nations level. In fact, at the Security Council we had six co-sponsors of the vital resolution, and those co-sponsors include both the US and the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultation has not only proceeded at that level. In the last week preceding the deadline date of 15 January, Hussein entertained negotiating offers from a wide and diverse group of nations. The USSR, France and the Arab League as well as the Secretary General of the United Nations himself were amongst those who went to him with propositions for a settlement of the crisis. We all know full well the representations made by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar, and the way in which he was treated by Saddam Hussein. One can say that the world community tried in a relentless effort to bring about a negotiated peace to this particular issue. One can also very fairly say that at every turn they were met by intransigence and resistance by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that he was and is in no way concerned about achieving a negotiated settlement to the problem. A negotiated settlement for Hussein could not have been a victory that he could have presented to his people. It is also claimed that sanctions were not given long enough to work. I am one of those who have believed from the outset that sanctions could not work in respect of Iraq. I also believe that, as time went by, and goes by, Saddam Hussein was using and is using the opportunity to increase his armoury and his capacity for retaliation. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims have also been made that the Australian Government has been too closely linked to the United States in pursuing our role in this crisis. One cannot deny that the United States is at the forefront of international endeavours. But one must also not deny that there are more than 100 countries involved in and supporting the decision making processes at the United Nations and that 28 countries are involved in intervening in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> One must ask that, if we were not committed, if we were not involved, if we were not supportive of both the United States and the United Nations in their role in this conflict, then who would we be aligned with? The answer is clear. We would be aligned with no other countries but Cuba, Yemen, North Korea and Jordan. We must remember in addressing this claim that we no longer live in a Cold War era where both superpowers take directly opposite positions. We must remember that both superpowers are now on the same side in this issue. This time, linkage with the United States of America (USA) is also linkage with the USSR, as well as linkage with the non-aligned countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already mentioned, we do have an evolving world situation and it is one that is very much at a definitional stage. It is one that presents a test for the world community; it is one that presents a test for the United Nations. The old days of nuclear deterrents are over. The old days when superpowers could, amongst themselves, achieve stability and order are over. We now have to evolve a mechanism to ensure the continuation of world peace and the protection of sovereign states, and we must do this quickly. The body that is most suited for that role is, of course, the United Nations. This crisis presents a fundamental test for the United Nations. If it passes it, then world peace, security and good order are the major beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> For a moment, let us go back to the genesis of the United Nations. Let us go back to our role in that and let us go back to some of the considerations put forward at that particular time. Dr Evatt, of course, played a leading role in establishing the United Nations. In 1945, in the House of Representatives, he said that if economic or diplomatic sanctions `are deemed inappropriate to the situation or prove ineffective, the Security Council may take any military action necessary to suppress the aggressor'. The use of force in bringing about adherence to UN resolutions was obviously contemplated at the time. Dr Evatt also said in 1945:</PARA>
<PARA>It must be made crystal clear that nations seeking representation in the world organisation must be prepared to contribute their share of physical force to restrain the action of proved aggressors. </PARA>
<PARA>Since its inception, therefore, it has been contemplated that the UN could marshal force to ensure its decisions could be implemented. We should recognise that. We should particularly recognise that when we talk about the increased and enhanced role for the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular process, the UN has a series of resolutions that have been endorsed by an overwhelming majority of its member countries. If the UN could not bring about enforcement of a resolution or a series of resolutions in this context, then it can never be effective. If it cannot bring about the enforcement of resolutions that it has adopted with co-sponsorship with countries such as the US, the USSR and France, then it has no hope of bringing about any effective resolution to conflict in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, at this time in history, an opportunity to evolve a new world order, an effective mechanism for the good conduct of nations. It is an opportunity that cannot be lost. The alternative is that of world disorder. If the world does not stand up to Hussein, then he is the victor. There is no alternative to that. Hussein represents the politics of tyranny, of repression, of terror. His victory now would be a victory for his politics and for his values. Let us not underestimate the potential destruction which would arise from this. Hussein possesses chemical weapons. He is near to or does possess nuclear weapons. If he defeats this challenge to his authority, if he is not curtailed by the world, then by this example the world would be open to domination by any aggressor. So there is a clear choice for us and for the world, and that choice goes very much to the heart of the issue of peace and the heart of the future role of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Some argue that we in Australia should withdraw our commitment at this particular stage. But how irresponsible would that be? We have supported UN resolutions; we have supported UN initiatives. These resolutions clearly contemplate the use of force. Not to lend physical support, at this stage, when we have travelled so far down the road in the UN process on this particular issue, would be an act of grand treachery to the United Nations. It would undermine forever the future role of the UN and our role within it. What we have here is international action taken under the auspices of the United Nations with the consent of all permanent members of the Security Council for the first time in that body's history. We have an obligation to this action and to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, there are two pleas that I would like to make. Firstly, there is a plea to the Australian community, one that I make as a member of that community as well as the Minister representing ethnic affairs in this chamber. We are a diverse, multicultural society made rich through the many, varied cultures, attitudes, religions and people who have made Australia their sanctuary and their home. My plea is one for tolerance, for understanding, and for a commitment to our community as a whole. Reports of racism, violence arising from that racism as well as religious intolerance, are sickening, and they are abhorrent. There is no room in Australia for such behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Muslim men, women and children, wherever they have come from, whether they have come from India, Turkey, Iraq, Palestine or elsewhere, as well as Arabs of all religions, deserve respect, not racism; they deserve understanding, not hatred. I therefore call on all Australians to live up to the notion that ours is a nation for all people to live in, to express their views freely, to hear one another, and together determine a future based on bringing together the best of all cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> My second plea is one to my friends in the Left, to the peace movement, and to all those marching in the streets-people with whom I have marched for the last 26 years of my 40-year life. It is a plea based on the obligation we all have to truth. Let us get some balance into this debate. Let us address the issues honestly. Let us acknowledge and condemn Saddam Hussein's role, as all world leaders, including Gaddafi, have done. Let us acknowledge Hussein's intransigence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us acknowledge that there is no moral equivalence between Hussein and the rest of the world community. Let us acknowledge the potential that this issue has for world peace, for the UN and for a new world order, and let us acknowledge the need for consistency in our arguments. How can we support armed struggle in so many instances and then object to it in this particular case?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us also encourage the peace movement to think creatively, to debate the new world order and its implications for peace and international social and economic justice. We have objectives which all of us in this chamber share. The most fundamental one, however, is to achieve peace. It is a peace that we need to win, not only for the Middle East but also for the rest of the world. I must say in conclusion that this war cannot be allowed to go on for too long. The cost will be too great. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to state at the start that I oppose the brutal, barbaric dictator Saddam Hussein. His inhumanity seems to know no bounds. As Senator Harradine said earlier, the invasion was indeed robbery with violence. We condemn him and all his forces, who have been responsible for the pillaging and the rape of Kuwait and its people. Yes, Saddam is a fanatical, cruel dictator. He is, as Senator Tate outlined yesterday, responsible for the torture and the killing of many innocent civilians. It is very pleasing to note that at last an Amnesty International report is getting a proper and thorough airing in this place. It is very pleasing to note that a large number of speakers have indeed quoted from that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must emphasise here that in the debate that has gone on so far-in listening to those from the Liberal and Labor parties who support the war, and listening to the many excellent speakers who have made some very valid points-Senator Tate is the only speaker from either side who has come even close to justifying the involvement of this country, of this Government, in this war. Where I differ from Senator Tate is that war is not now the option, not now the solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree that the only proper means we now have to stop aggression is more aggression. I cannot agree that the only way to stop the killing of innocent civilians is by killing more innocent civilians-and, make no mistake, the volume of explosives being dropped now on Iraq and Kuwait is killing millions of innocent people. By the time this is over, one only wonders what the total cost will be. Tens of thousands of people could have already lost their lives in this war. The destruction of property will be massive-not that that should be one of our major considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The sanctions, which have been discussed by many people so far, were working. As Senator Gareth Evans acknowledged, some 95 to 97 per cent of Iraq's external trade had been cut off. Industrial production had dropped sharply and non-subsidised food prices had soared. Indeed, the sanctions had in fact exceeded the United Nations' stated objectives because, despite the exemptions, medical supplies were running short, and that was one of the items that was supposed to be still getting in. </PARA>
<PARA> The question, I believe, is one of timing. Now is not the time. War should be an absolute last resort and not rushed into before all else has failed. To those who compare this war with World War II, I say that they are ignoring the fact that in this case we had united, well-organised sanctions that were working. We did have an alternative. The issue of timing is of critical importance. Why must we rush into war just as the sanctions begin to have their intended effect on resources? To take time means that we must be patient, and we must encourage other nations to be patient. To take time means that we must be prepared to discuss at length and discuss again. We must give time to those within Iraq to protest directly and indirectly, as much as they are able, at the lack of resources that they are beginning to experience, in order to put pressure on Saddam Hussein from within his own country. This means that we should have kept-indeed, could keep if the hostilities were to stop-the sanctions in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Noting that a number of Western nations have downgraded the Iraqi diplomatic representation in their respective countries by expelling non-essential diplomatic staff and those seen as security risks, I ask: Why has not the Australian Government taken such action? Can we assume that the Government is, therefore, satisfied that there are no Iraqi diplomatic or service personnel who pose any danger to Australian interests?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that a number of governments have recently taken action on security grounds, as Senator Hill says, to reduce the numbers or expel whole missions of Iraqis in their countries. These include the United States, British, Netherlands, Belgian, Greek, Canadian and Philippines governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As is the case with other members of the United Nations force in the Gulf, Australia is, nonetheless, maintaining diplomatic relations with Iraq. That is essentially because we do consider it important to ensure that this channel of communication is kept open, not least for the kinds of communications that we were able to make to the Iraqis this morning, for example, in the context of the prisoner of war issue and the targeting of civilian populations.</PARA>
<PARA> On the outbreak of hostilities with Iraq, the Australian Government imposed a 50-kilometre travel restriction on members of the Iraqi Embassy in Canberra. It is only a small mission, with only something like six people there. That restriction was imposed on security grounds. We would of course be concerned about any activities by diplomats of Iraq or of any country that posed any more specific threat to Australian security. We would take appropriate action to deal with such a situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I draw the Minister's attention to an article in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald under the title `Australia dragging feet over UN appeal' which claims that Australia is one of only three countries to have failed to respond to a United Nations appeal for funding to assist victims of the war in Iraq, apparently because the appeal is already oversubscribed. I ask the Minister for his assurance that the Government will demonstrate that its commitment to UN initiatives in the Middle East is not selective by, as a matter of urgency, reconsidering its decision to not contribute. I also seek his assurance that Australia will make a significant contribution to the Joint International Committee of Red Cross-League of Red Cross Societies appeal for victims of the war.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="137" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not been dragging its feet in this matter as has been alleged in that article. The facts are as follows: Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, the UN did prepare a plan to handle a potentially large exodus of people from Iraq and Kuwait. For planning purposes, the UN worked with a figure of 400,000 evacuees; that is to say, 100,000 in each of Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iran. It estimated that to care for this number of people for three months would cost around $US175m. The UN then launched, on the basis of that assessment, an international appeal for a portion of this amount or start-up funds of some $US38m so that it would be in a position to react speedily if required. That appeal was quickly met, principally through the generosity of the Government of Japan, which pledged, in fact, the full $US38m figure. There were also contributions from some others of the 15 countries, and there were only 15 countries that were specifically asked to contribute to this. Those additional contributions amounted to something like another $US18m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In those circumstances, and not least because of the huge budgetary constraints we are facing in the humanitarian relief area, we made the judgment that it was unnecessary for Australia to make a contribution to that start-up fund at this time. That is not to say that we will not be prepared to consider a contribution and to find the funds to do so should some further appeal be made in due course through UN channels for some additional support in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to the UN appeal, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) launched an appeal for approximately $US140m. The ICRC has, of course, a crucial role to play in providing protection and assistance to civilians caught up in the conflict, in caring, if required, for the wounded and in protecting and assisting those captured or detained. Along with the UN, the ICRC also has a role in assisting those fleeing across international boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Government is considering how we might best contribute to the relief of suffering in the Gulf region generally. I have before me at the moment a number of proposals, including for further contributions both to the UN, as I have already said, and to the ICRC. A decision will be made shortly and I will be making an announcement at an appropriately early time.</PARA>

<PARA>We do not propose any further commitment. We do not expect any further request. But, in the unlikely event that one came forward, we would consider it.</PARA>
<PARA>On the Sunday program the other day, the Minister made the following unequivocal statement:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the latter part of Senator Durack's question about whether we have communicated any decision, the answer is no. Our commitment to the Gulf area was very carefully thought through in the first week of December. It is based primarily on what we regard as our role as a world power-that is, a middle power. We anticipated, if there was to be a conflict, the nature of that conflict, and we therefore crafted our decision to be commensurate with our position as a world power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say that we very carefully looked at what the best sort of contribution was that we could make to the coalition forces. Admiral Maus made it very clear when General Gration visited the region that that contribution of escort vessels, of which the coalition was short, would be the most appropriate contribution. His reasoning for that is fairly well known: that is, our ships have integrated air defence systems with the layer defence of the carrier group. Secondly, the communication systems between our ships and the coalition ships, especially the United States (US) ships, is highly compatible and they are the latest state-of-the-art technology. Finally, Australian ships have been exercising with US, Canadian and British ships, especially in Rimpac, for many years. That is why Admiral Maus in particular was very pleased that Australia's contribution would be along the line of escort ships.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, a view was expressed to the Australian contingent then that there was a shortage of medical teams. It is true that Australia could make a greater contribution, and so could many countries, but each country judges its contribution according to the role it sees itself playing in the world and the most appropriate contribution it regards as possible. As for any future escalation, we see absolutely no cause to re-evaluate our decision not to contribute anything more because all these factors were taken into account at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is that at no stage in my visit to Washington in October, or in the various discussions that Senator Evans held in the US, Canada, Europe and the Middle East-and he has had a whole range of discussions-has there been any request for a further contribution because most of those countries recognise our contribution as an excellent one, a valuable one and one where there is an area of shortage. So the question of a further escalation simply does not come up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to press reports on potential terrorist threats to Australia? What action has the Government taken to protect Australians from terrorism, and how serious is that threat?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the start of this latest phase in the war that was initiated by Saddam Hussein on 2 August last year against the people of Kuwait, we have taken special measures, and indeed the national anti-terrorist plan has been activated, so that the contingencies which are foreseen can be adequately dealt with. There is a very high state of preparedness among Federal agencies, in cooperation with State police forces, to deal with any such contingencies as they might arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, special security measures have been taken in relation to particular persons and buildings, but naturally I would not outline those. However, everyone who passes through our airports will be aware of the enhanced security at those airports. I do not think anybody has vented any anger or frustration at the delay that has been occasioned by the necessary extra checking that has taken place both of individuals and their baggage and cargo being handled.</PARA>
<PARA> I am briefed constantly on the situation in relation to threats which are credible or turn out to be hoaxes. I can assure the people of Australia that those security measures are being undertaken against the threat of violence, which has added credibility since Iraqi Radio broadcast its request that terrorism be activated around the world against those who have contributed to the multinational forces operating in the Gulf region at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst actions of violence by terrorists may have the most colourful aspect as far as the public imagination is concerned, perhaps more worrying are those politically motivated violent acts that might take place within the Australian community as a result of the tensions generated by this conflict. Last night there was a Jewish rally in Melbourne and some incidents occurred. I understand that a person has appeared in the Melbourne courts this morning as a result of actions taken in relation to that rally.</PARA>
<PARA> I know from the comments by my colleague Senator Bolkus during his splendid contribution to the debate this morning that what we need to emphasise is the social cohesion of the Australian community. We have to ensure that those who have a particular point of view can express their view non-violently and peaceably and, in particular, that those in the Arab and Muslim communities are not stereotyped and subject to harassment or intimidation during this time of tension.</PARA>
<PARA> I had the honour of attending Friday prayers at the Lakemba mosque a couple of Fridays ago at which time the spiritual and community leaders of the Muslim community in Sydney gave a very clear undertaking that their community would never engage in acts of violence in relation to this conflict. On behalf of the Prime Minister, and I think the whole Australian community, I assured that community of our tolerance and the fact that we would not tolerate actions of harassment, intimidation or violence directed against that community during these times.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that all contingencies in regard to acts of violence that might affect Australians as a result of this conflict have been foreseen and are well prepared for. The Australian people can take comfort from the fact that we have, as I say, reached a high state of preparedness to deal with any contingency that might arise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oil prices have fallen dramatically in the wake of the commencement of hostilities in the Gulf to around $20 per barrel now, which is about the same as the prevailing rate at the end of July 1990, just prior to the invasion of Kuwait. But prices remain extremely volatile and our dollar is slightly lower than it was in August last year. It is down by about three to four cents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 19 January the Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority, Professor Allan Fels, announced that the wholesale price of petrol would fall by 0.52c per litre today-22 January-and that further cuts could be expected in the coming week if there was no reversal in the oil price drops recorded since the outbreak of hostilities. An additional 0.52c per litre fall in wholesale prices will be effective from tomorrow-Wednesday, 23 January. In total, today's and tomorrow's drops amount to 1.04c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA> Wholesale petrol prices are currently around 7c per litre higher than at the end of the 21-day price freeze imposed by the Treasurer in response to the Middle East crisis but around 12c per litre below their peak of 76c per litre on 19 October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prices Surveillance Authority is basing its wholesale petrol price movements on a mix of crude oil and Singapore petrol prices using a seven-day moving average of prices. This has insulated the motorist from the worst effects of oil market volatility while still ensuring that market movements are reflected in Australian petrol prices.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the Prices Surveillance Authority determines the wholesale price. The Government has no control over retail prices. It is possible that distributors' and resellers' margins may not settle back to their previous levels, although I urge consumer pressure to encourage that to be the case. It is also possible that the States would take some interest in this area if there were to be any considered refusal to pass on those wholesale price reductions.</PARA>

The honourable senator will understand that is why I do not put a figure on it now, even though I might like to get the jump on the Department of Finance. The Government has given an assurance that the overall defence budget will not be affected by the additional costs of the Gulf deployment. It is a complex formula because one can not only take the Gulf costs into account, but also one must subtract the normal operational costs that those ships and other personnel will be dealing with.

A figure was fixed in the Budget projections which was the subject of some discussion. The essential point was that the Government at that time was not prepared to provide a firm figure in relation to oil prices. At this stage of course it is too early to say what the implications of the Gulf war are likely to be in terms of the recession from which Australia is currently suffering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say that since the Senate last met there has been some moderation of the unemployment consequences of the recession. I think there has been a considerable improvement in the level of inflation-its having fallen to 6 per cent over the past year-and it is anticipated that it will fall below this level in 1991. There has been an improvement in the balance of payments deficit, and of course there has been a continuing period of declining interest rates for the last 12 months. Of course, the Government is hopeful to be able to consolidate these gains and improvements in the economic situation. Government expenditure will of course continue to be restrained, and the structural Budget surplus will, as far as possible, be kept high. In so far as the impact of the Gulf war is concerned, I believe it is too early to say what detriment that will cause to the projections of the Government in respect of the economy in 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Iraqi actions from the time of the invasion to the present have been characterised by a flagrant disregard of the various principles of international law embodied in the United Nations Charter or in the Geneva conventions which are meant to be some civilising restraint on the conduct of the horrific war that is being undertaken. The initial Iraqi invasion of Kuwait contravened a fundamental obligation under article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter not to threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Iraq's refusal to comply with numerous resolutions of the United Nations Security Council calling upon it to withdraw from Kuwait is also in clear breach of article 25 of the United Nations Charter, and as we know from Daniel Ortega's remarks to Craxi, the leader of the Italian socialists, `withdraw' is one word which Saddam Hussein would not utter, but, in not uttering it, he is in complete breach of his obligations under the United Nations Charter.</PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's action in holding foreign nationals as hostages and using them to render strategic areas immune from potential attack was certainly contrary to the fourth Geneva Convention dealing with civilians. The torture, the rape, and the summary executions without trial which have been well documented by Amnesty International in Kuwait under the occupying forces are themselves certainly breaches of the fourth Geneva Convention. Under article 147 of that Convention, grave breaches-which have been so well documented by Amnesty International-include the emptying of the humidicribs in the maternity hospital so that 300 premature babies were left to die on the cold tiles of the floor, the Red Crescent doctor himself testifying to the fact that he had buried 72 of those babies. Those horrific crimes against civilians-the brutal tortures, the summary executions-are all such grave breaches that those individually responsible and their superior officers will be held responsible at the conclusion of this conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> The treatment of prisoners of war by Iraq reported today-their parading and display-is itself contrary to the third Geneva Convention dealing with prisoners of war which stresses how humanely they must be treated. In particular, the use of prisoners of war as human shields by placing them at educational and scientific and other establishments, as has been threatened, is very clearly in breach of article 23 of the third Geneva Convention dealing with prisoners of war. That article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>No prisoner of war may at any time be sent to, or detained in areas where he may be exposed to the fire of the combat zone, nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no more clear statement of the international law and the treatment of prisoners of war, and it is very clear that if the threats against prisoners of war taken by Saddam Hussein's forces are carried out in the way that he has alleged they will be, then Iraq is once again in clear breach of its international law obligations. This is only a catalogue of the most apparent breaches of international law, the clearest breaches. I believe it is totally in harmony with what one would expect of a regime which is nurtured on war, which has as its lifeblood the killing of others-as in the conflict with Iran where over a million died for no territorial gain whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA> We know of his treatment of the Kurds, the horrific gassing of the civilian populations; we saw the huddled bodies of Kurdish villagers in the streets and alleyways of their various places of what should be peaceful habitation. These particular cruel treatments of the population of Kuwait and, now, of prisoners of war put Iraq in clear breach of international law and, at the end of this conflict, those responsible will be brought to justice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing to be said absolutely emphatically is that in relation to this conflict there will not be any conscription of any Australian to serve in the armed forces. That has been clearly stated by the Prime Minister; it had been stated in this chamber in answer to a question asked by Senate McLean before Christmas. The fact is that we have an absolutely unadulterated, unadorned, emphatic no to the question of conscription. That is the clear political stance of this Government and totally in accord with everything that has been said by the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, there is no legal basis which would enable conscription to be undertaken. In that respect I simply wish to emphasise that sections 59 and 60 of the Defence Act provide the framework for conscription in time of war. Because of the definition of `in time of war', there is an opinion of the Attorney-General's Department that nothing occurring at the moment in the Gulf, or by way of threatened terrorism activity within Australia, would qualify as an invasion, or apprehended invasion, of Australia which is what is required under the Defence Act to qualify as time of war.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the National Service Act 1951, of course, was terminated by section 4 of the National Service Termination Act 1973, an early activity of the newly elected Whitlam Government. That provides that no person is liable to register or render service under the National Service Act. Therefore, it follows that there is no legal capacity whatsoever for any Australian Government to conscript any Australian into its armed forces and, of course, there is no political will to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been some interjections from the Australian Democrats as I have been answering this question. The Democrats have abandoned devotion to truth. There is no doubt that honesty and truthfulness have been a casualty of this particular war, and they have engaged in propaganda in this instance.

In fact, Senator Bell went on radio talkback in Hobart last Thursday or Friday in order to state that Senator Robert Ray had refused to give an answer, yes or no, in the Senate to the question of whether there would be conscription. The Hansard clearly reveals that in answer to a question asked by Senator McLean on 12 November 1990, Senator Robert Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA>As to the question: Will we reintroduce conscription?, the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the answer given on 12 November, recorded in Hansard, publicly available, and known to Senator Bell; yet he has aroused these misgivings in the Tasmanian community. I know from telephone calls to my office that there have been real apprehensions and fears in the households and among the parents and young men of Tasmania as a result of his scaremongering in that regard. There is no legislative power and no political will whatsoever to introduce conscription into Australia.</PARA>

The service operates on a 24-hour basis and is staffed by Navy personnel, both uniformed and civilian. So far over 1,000 calls have been taken since its inception. No matters of an operational nature are discussed, nor are details of individual personnel serving in the Gulf or those of their families divulged. The facility is a very important link between the Navy and family members and friends and will greatly assist in reducing the potential for unnecessary stress generated by unintended information or ill-founded rumours. For instance, for several hours last Friday night a television station carried a story about a collision between two Australian ships. That story was never substantiated by that television station and was denied by us consistently. That would have promoted a number of anxious calls-I believe hundreds-from family members worrying about the safety of their relatives.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were forced into making the decision that there was no alternative but to go down the war route simply because of the rapidly accumulating evidence in the latter part of last year that, despite all our hopes and expectations, sanctions were simply not going to produce the result we wanted within a realistic time frame. I explained in considerable detail in my speech in this place yesterday-and I will not again today-just what the basis of that reasoning is. In short, it implies not just the necessity for an effective net to be maintained, which has been effective, but for that to be accompanied by very real and actual hurt within the country and, furthermore, for that to be accompanied by a willingness on the part of the Government to respond to that hurt by changing its policy course. In short, the judgment has been made that we could not reasonably expect anything of the kind to happen in under a period of another 12 to 18 months, and perhaps not even then, because of the particular nature of the society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the meantime, while we would be waiting around for this unspecified long run to work itself out, the following things would be happening-I repeat, would be happening: the murdering, the raping, the brutalisation and the looting of Kuwait and the people of Kuwait would continue unabated. We have available to us all the atrocities recorded and detailed by Amnesty International to give us plenty of evidence of that. Furthermore, we faced a situation in which Iraq would have taken advantage of that ongoing time period to rapidly increase its chemical weapons stocks. It would have taken the opportunity to further develop the technology making it possible for those chemical weapons to be attached to missiles in the form of warheads-technology which it is presently uncertain that the Iraqis actually have. It would have enabled another period of 12 or 18 months or two years for the development of biological weapons, which is very much in Iraq's potential capacity. Whether it is in its actual capacity here and now again remains a matter of some doubt. It would have enabled the capacity of Iraq to develop-which it unquestionably wants to do within the shortest possible time frame-a nuclear capacity together with an appropriate delivery system to go with it. The best available estimates are that, should Iraq be prepared to utilise the material available in its existing safeguarded nuclear reactor, it would be possible for it to produce at least a crude nuclear device within a period of just 12 months from now.</PARA>
<PARA> The point of the matter is that, quite apart from the political considerations, which have their own importance, and the capacity of Saddam Hussein to manipulate the environment and to undermine the coalition working against him, in terms of both the application of sanctions and the potential coalition available against him in the event that sanctions broke down, the reality, from the point of view of the very people in the region and in the world that Senator Vallentine is saying she wants to protect, we would have been gravely and massively adding to the risk. That is the reason why the rest of the world simply could not afford to take the risks associated with adherence to an open-ended sanctions policy, the ultimate success of which, even over a time frame of the length I have described, we simply could not guarantee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tap the mat-I really do. However, I made the point-I hope in stark terms-that the mere effectiveness of the net cannot by itself secure the effectiveness of the sanctions policy. It has to be accompanied by real hurt within the country and not some other compensating activity which in fact reduces the impact of that hurt. There has been a lot of such activity, not least the looting of Kuwait. The application of all the machinery, spare parts and food stocks from Kuwait has been a big compensating factor. The hurt has not been that great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On some estimates, manufacturing capacity may have been reduced by up to 40 per cent as a result of the sanctions that have been applied. But the truth of that matter is that that has been pretty well wholly focused within non-essential, light industrial manufacturing areas that are simply not important or not necessary for the future viability of the Iraqi economy.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no measurable impact at all on the Iraqi military machine as a result of the application of sanctions for the reason that we are talking about a dictatorship which gives ultimate priority to its military machine. There has been no significant impact, so far as we can tell, on infrastructure like energy and water supply, despite some earlier belief that that might be so. The truth of the matter is that although gross domestic product has been reduced, it has only been of the order of 10 per cent as a result of the inability of Iraq to sell oil and refined fuel. In all the other ways that I have mentioned, the impact of sanctions has so far been at best marginal. It would take an awfully much longer time than the world, the region or the people of Kuwait can afford for the impact to become more than that and maybe an even greater time for that impact to be translated into a decision by the Iraqi Government to actually change policy course.</PARA>

Latest reports indicate that at least four people died when Soviet Interior Ministry troops stormed the Latvian police headquarters in Riga on 20 January. That follows, of course, the even more horrific events in Lithuania a few days earlier, in which some 15 people died, with many additional reported injuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has already before today forthrightly condemned the action of Soviet troops in Lithuania.

<PARA> In relation to the more recent events, yesterday the Secretary to my Department, Mr Woolcott, underlined the Government's concerns about the situation in the Baltic states generally and Latvia in particular in a meeting with the Soviet Ambassador. Today I have issued a public statement condemning the use of force in Latvia and instructed my Secretary again to call in the Soviet Ambassador to reinforce the strength of the Government's views. The Senate today also passed a motion in bipartisan terms strongly expressing our concern and distaste for those recent events.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my own statement today, we in Australia share the view of other Western nations that the use of force to resolve the future of the Baltic area is not only undermining the reform process in the Soviet Union itself but it also has a very substantial capacity to affect the whole future course of cooperation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the West, including Australia. It really would be a tragedy if the recent course of events in the Soviet Union were to amount to a retreat from the political and economic reforms of recent years, which have been absolutely integral to the emergence of a cooperative and constructive climate for East-West relations. Unfortunately, the situation in all three Baltic republics remains tense with Soviet troops still maintaining a very threatening stance.</PARA>

I have obtained an answer to that question. If Senator Watson is agreeable, I will have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office is not anticipating an early election and is continuing to use the 1990 Budget tax rates for calculation of provisional tax through fiscal 1990-91 because they are the legislated rates. Last year the ATO was castigated for anticipating legislation; this year it is standing by existing law and is being questioned for that action as well.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable pressure from many sectors of the taxpayer community for the ATO to issue provisional assessments as early as possible. That process had already started when the Treasurer announced the new tax rates (Royal Assent of Budget Bills granted on 6 November 1990). Further, the amending bill (Bill No. 6) which prescribes the new rates of tax will be debated in this session of parliament. For the ATO to wait for the passage of that legislation through both houses would have caused considerable delays in the issuing of assessments.</PARA>
<PARA> The action of the ATO to issue provisional assessments at the legislated rates is justified as the amending bill will contain a provision which will divorce the new tax rates from those to be applied in the calculation of 1991 provisional tax. The impact of continuing to apply the existing rates of tax as opposed to the announced new rates of tax is minimal, given the variation in the tax rates and the impact that variation would have on the determination of provisional tax.</PARA>

I just want to clarify for the record that there is no case of which we are aware in which a whole Iraqi mission has been expelled, but there are a number of cases, though-the ones that I indicated-where the numbers have been reduced on security grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to go over what I have already said about the timing. I believe that the important point in the way in which I certainly differ with what Senator Tate had to say earlier was that I do believe that we have not yet reached the point at which we should be considering war. We should have given time for the sanctions to have their full effect. As has already been said and agreed to in this chamber, sanctions were indeed affecting the imports and exports from the country. We should have kept that pressure tight. The Australian Democrats have always supported sanctions as long as they were under United Nations command.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We totally agree that international law after international law has been broken by Saddam. We believe that given time the sanctions would have had their desired effect. Time means that we could have begun to discuss the other issues that must be put back on the table after this is all over. My colleagues have already dealt very thoroughly with a number of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray and others have said that time would have given Iraq further opportunity to plunder Kuwait and indeed this may well have happened, but I believe that it was by far the lesser of two evils. What will be left now of Kuwait once this is all over? What will be left to liberate? If this war drags on for yet another week and another week after that, perhaps months or more, what will be left if saturation bombing continues? It is not correct to insist, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I have noted a number of others have done, that the only choice was between war that we have now and appeasement. Between those two extremes there were a wide variety of options, but they would have taken time. </PARA>
<PARA> To move from time to another issue-money. If we look back through recent events around the world, current occupations in other parts of the world, we see many invasions of a smaller, weaker country by a larger, aggressive neighbour. Again, my colleagues have outlined a number of these. I want to deal briefly with only one today; that is, East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> Where were we and what did our Government do when Indonesia invaded East Timor? Senator Tate talked yesterday about the torture, rape, killing and brutalities that were going on in Kuwait. All of these atrocities have been going on for years, not months, in East Timor. A third of the population has died, but this Government and the Opposition are silent on this issue. Why? Not only is there no call to war-and one must be very grateful for that-but there is no call for sanctions, there are no discussions even with the Indonesian military, with the Indonesian Government, asking the military to leave-there is silence. The answer again I believe involves money or oil. The answer to this is oil-the access to it, the control of it and how much it will cost. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the direct reward of access to this resource the answer is also unfortunately found in the enormous financial commitment the United States has to its military program, the enormous amount of money tied up in military hardware and technology. The other group which stands to reap enormous financial rewards, one group of financial beneficiaries, will be the actual producers of that hardware, the military weapons, the bombs and the missiles, the builders of the planes and the ships, the ammunition suppliers, those who outfit the two armies and more that are now facing each other across the sands. Also the beneficiaries will be those who will-indeed it seems they are already jostling-get contracts to rebuild the cities, to rebuild the oil terminals, to rebuild the factories and the other installations now being destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the final cost be? It is estimated now that the minimum daily expenditures by the United States alone is some $A645m per day. It has been estimated that the United States alone has $170 billion worth of weapons at the ready stationed in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to an issue that makes this war even more obscene if that is possible; that is, the human cost, the direct and the indirect cost. I mentioned millions of lives earlier and I notice that obviously some people do not agree; but when we start looking at the indirect cost to all of the world I believe this is very realistic indeed. While we encourage the spending of billions of dollars maiming and killing innocent civilians in order to protect innocent civilians, millions of people in this world do not have enough to eat on a regular basis. They are not adequately fed, not because there is not enough food to go around in the world-plenty is produced-but because of a lack of political will, because of supply difficulties and because they or their governments do not have the money to purchase the minimal food that is available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The billions spent on this war should have been directed to meet such urgent needs as feeding, housing and clothing this world's population. Every year the development aid budget for the whole world is some $50 billion. The Americans spent the equivalent of three-fifths of this even before the war was actually declared. In the State of the World's Children 1991 project, launched by the United Nations Children's Fund before Christmas, it asked for $20 billion a year each year until the year 2000. It said that with that it could do the following four things:</PARA>
<PARA> reduce child mortality levels to a third of 1990 levels and halve maternal mortality</PARA>
<PARA> reduce severe and moderate malnutrition in children under five</PARA>
<PARA> provide universal access to safe drinking water and `proper removal of excreta' ie sanitation</PARA>
<PARA> provide universal access to primary education for children and reduce adult illiteracy by half, particularly in women. </PARA>
<PARA>This is where the money could have been spent. Now, to add to the plight of the many poor nations of this world and indeed the poor in the industrialised countries that are fighting this war, the relief effort, the social services, will be directed away from them. It will be directed away from such areas as the Horn of Africa. I read in today's press that most of the aid workers have already had to leave the Sudan. They have had to move away from those areas to the refugees who are now beginning to pour out of Iraq. Eventually an enormous effort will be needed for Kuwait and Iraq and perhaps many more countries if this war drags on. </PARA>
<PARA> Already, hundreds of thousands of guest workers have fled the Middle East. Yes, this would have still occurred had sanctions been in place. However, we are exacerbating those problems. Some 122,000 guest workers were forced back to Bangladesh. Those 122,000 people were supporting a million people in Bangladesh. This is a further burden placed on a poor nation. Then, of course, there is the personal cost to those who are directly involved, their families and their communities-the cost to a generation of Iraqi and Kuwaiti people, and this is immeasurable. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to stress that Australia had a choice. Our Government, with the support of the Opposition, chose war-one of the two extremes. War was chosen because, at the time, it seemed to be a quick and easy solution to this complicated problem. The initial problem is to remove Saddam but there are also problems related to the control of oil resources. We now have to stop and look and ask: will this really be a quick solution?'. Will it all be over in a week or two? Will it take another month? Will it indeed be over before that summer deadline that the Americans were so anxious to avoid? What will be left to liberate? What will the total damage bill be? What will be the total impact on the world in human terms and environmental terms? What will it be now that we have literally let the cat out of the bag? What will the end result be?</PARA>
<PARA> We read in the newspapers today of further atrocities being committed by Saddam Hussein in his treatment of prisoners of war. Where will it stop? We knew, America told us, our newspapers told us, how unpredictable this man was, how ruthless. We should now be absolutely horrified. (Quorum formed) I believe that war was chosen by others because of the attraction it offers to some powers and we followed along. It offers a great chance to test weaponry previously untested and untried because it is so new and so expensive. It gives an opportunity to demonstrate that brute force is really what is important to the powers of this world. </PARA>
<PARA> War was chosen by Australia because we did not want to be out of step with the United States and we made no extra public calls for sanctions to be given time to work. We followed along. We took what seemed to be at the time the easiest political route-the wimps' way out, to use someone else's words. Our leaders chose not to take the path that would have at least given peace some chance. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to go through the amendments that the Australian Democrats will be moving to the motion that we have before us. We have some seven amendments. They involve either adding or subtracting a word, phrase or sentence. It would make a lot more sense for those listening if I simply read out the new motion that would be carried if the amendments were successful. It would state:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait by means of sanctions and diplomacy;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 661 for support in implementing comprehensive sanctions against Iraq until it leaves Kuwait;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) condemns the Australian Government's warlike interpretation of Resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council, and calls for an immediate ceasefire, and the withdrawal of Australian warships from combat duty, which is consistent with that resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces in the Gulf, and places the burden of responsibility for the misguided decision to deploy them to that region solely on the Federal Government and the Opposition;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack on Israel; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) recognises the need to intensify non- military efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion. I do this despite the fact that the process of accepting this position has involved considerable personal anguish. I have been involved for a long time with the peace movement. In 1964 I was one of the first to demonstrate against the Vietnam War, I had come to an intellectual position, after having felt strongly that the war was wrong, that that was what I should do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So I sympathise with those who feel strongly about this issue and find it difficult to support the actions taken or proposed. Furthermore, I do not think it is wrong, as some have suggested, to act on strong feelings without rational justification, to be spurred into action by the heart rather than the mind. This was how, as a younger man, I approached the question of capital punishment, for example. I had a strong feeling of revulsion at the act as I saw it-and still see it-of institutionalised murder from which my active opposition to that issue of capital punishment sprang. But, having felt this, it was incumbent upon me to rationalise this feeling, to develop an intellectual justification for my position. This was important for two reasons, not only to clarify my own thinking but also to be able to explain to other people why I felt that way, and to gain further adherents to that cause.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is with the issue of war. It is natural to feel revulsion to war; it is natural to feel revulsion at the senseless killing of the young combatants or, in modern wars, at the killing of innocent civilians of all ages. It is natural to feel revulsion at the tragic misallocation of resources into weapons with an awesome capacity to kill and to maim. It is natural to be concerned about the irrationality of the whole process of war; it is natural to feel all of these things. It is natural to feel this revulsion but, as with the analogy of capital punishment, it is incumbent on all of us to rationalise our position. </PARA>
<PARA> So many of the opponents of this motion, and to Australia's involvement in the Gulf war, have failed to do this. They have failed in particular to understand the significance of not curbing the excesses of Saddam Hussein. They have failed to explain--</PARA>
<PARA> An incident having occurred in the gallery-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have failed to explain how the whole question might be resolved-if people would listen instead of joining the cheer squad that the Australian Democrats have engendered, they might learn something about it. They have failed to explain how the whole question might be resolved without the concerted action currently being taken. They have failed, in short, to provide any intellectual support in this particular area for what I understand are genuinely held feelings about involvement in war in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not enough to make invidious comparisons, as Senator Lees has, with East Timor, or with Panama, or with Grenada. Apart from the speciousness of such comparisons-for a whole range of reasons. If the international community did not act then, there is no reason at all why it should not act now. It is not enough either to talk about earlier errors in Middle East politics by the British, the French, the United States or the Soviet Union, nor is there any point giving support to Iraq's invasion in terms of the undemocratic nature of Kuwait. Kuwait is not the only autocratic fiefdom in the region, and Iraq is hardly in a position to be critical. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait has upset a delicate balance within the region and a set of borders which, while not ideal, were accepted by all of the nations within the region and also those without. Any change to these borders must be the result of negotiations involving all those potentially affected. It cannot be by the annexation by force of an area. It is not enough either to demonise the United States of America, as is popular with the Democrats and Senator Vallentine. It needs to be remembered that only four of the United Nations 159 members have rejected the United Nations resolutions sanctioning the actions in the Gulf. It needs also to be remembered that 28 countries have committed forces in support of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, and that this includes nine Arab countries which have a lot more to lose than we do. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not enough either to argue by reference to claimed similarities between Vietnam and the Gulf. Such arguments, as many other speakers have pointed out, are also specious. Firstly, Australia's response in the Gulf was defined by and made in response to successive resolutions by the United Nations; that was not the case in Vietnam. Secondly, the Vietnam war was borne of anti-colonial nationalism and developed into a civil war; that is manifestly not the case in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, our commitment to the Gulf, unlike Vietnam, is a modest, limited and practical one. It is a commitment that is proportionate to our national resources. Finally, our involvement in Vietnam was based upon a mistaken belief that an alien ideology was creeping southwards through Asia and would eventually engulf Australia-the so-called domino theory which history has proved to be a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons, by contrast, for our involvement in the Gulf are much clearer and much more logical than this. Firstly, Saddam Hussein's invasion and annexation of Kuwait, if unchecked, would give him a strategic power, in an already volatile and difficult region, out of all proportion to the size of Iraq. Does anybody seriously believe, given his track record, that Saddam would have stopped at Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the suggestion that it is somehow immoral or illegitimate to be concerned about oil is fanciful and naive, and might suit the cheer squad politics of the Democrats but does not suit anybody who wants to make a proper and rational analysis of the problem. It is not a question of morality, nor is it a question of Western greed. The whole world must be concerned about the strategic power offered by control over one of the world's most basic resources by a dictator who has armed Iraq-a country with a population about the same size as Australia-with a million troops and a formidable arsenal, including chemical and biological weapons, ballistic missiles and a developing nuclear capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees says that this will affect Third World countries which are struggling to survive. I ask her to consider how control of the oil resources of the world or a good proportion of the oil resources of the world by somebody of Saddam Hussein's nature would affect those same people. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that we should have given sanctions longer to work has already been thoroughly dealt with by Senator Evans and by others, but it demonstrates a basic misunderstanding about what sanctions were meant to do. Put simply, sanctions were designed to bring Iraq to its senses, not to its knees--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Put in simple terms, sanctions were designed to bring Iraq to its senses, not to its knees. The fact is that in all the attempts at diplomacy and non-military coercion, Saddam has made no response. He has clearly never been interested in peace. He is a dictator whose whole ethos is bound up in military power. There seems to be a belief by those opposing the United Nations action that somehow we are in a perfect world where people act rationally, with honesty and with principle on all matters. The world is not like that. This is unfortunate, but true. The United Nations has always recognised this. As a result, it has sanctioned the use of force as a necessary part of its armoury of weapons to use at its disposal as each case arises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Schacht in an earlier speech referred to one of the speeches of Dr Evatt on the formation of the United Nations in 1945. I will repeat what Dr Evatt said because it is worth repeating:</PARA>
<PARA>It must be made crystal clear that the nations making representation in the world organisation must be prepared to contribute their share of physical force to restrain the action of proved aggressors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats in their amendment talk about reasserting a role for the United Nations, and yet what they want to do is to totally undermine the United Nations so that it cannot have a role. Force is a legitimate part of the armoury of the United Nations and suddenly the Democrats want to change all that. It was Thucydides who at the time of the Peloponnesian war said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you give in, you will immediately be confronted with some greater demand, since they will think you only gave way . . . through fear. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an unfortunate comment on mankind 2 1/2 millennia later and, despite remarkable advances in so many areas, that this comment is as valid now as it was then. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Saddam Hussein is not about to be influenced except by force. It is this unavoidable fact which has led me, despite considerable personal anguish, to support a small but appropriate contribution to the world effort to force Saddam out of Kuwait. I welcome the Government's acceptance of the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian question. I welcome also the Government's assurance that there will be no commitment of additional Australian forces to the Gulf. It is with deep personal regret that I believe the action proposed by the Government to be necessary. I urge support of the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my first speech in this place, I promised to bring to the Senate the attitudes of my family and to represent the people who had helped me grow from a boy into a man. I bring to this place the attitude that my mother had to wear since the minute I was born, when the midwife held me up by the heels-a long, stringy, very thin, weak-looking affair I was-and said, `More cannon fodder'. I was born during the Korean war. My mother was horrified by that and has had to carry that for some years. I bring her attitude to this place and I speak on behalf of her, my family, my peer group, my supporters and my friends and, I hope, for a growing number of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On my way to this chamber today, I was handed a petition which had been gathered in my absence in Hobart between Saturday night and some time yesterday. While my office was manned by people working out of hours without me present and without a campaign to gather a petition, almost 1,000 people signed a petition, which I will table and ask to have dealt with in the normal way later this afternoon. But the amazing thing to me was that this petition arrived without my exhortations or campaigning and about 1,000 people saw fit to sign it, mostly late on Saturday and during Sunday. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to mention that before I started because it amazed me so much. That petition, of course, came from Hobart and, knowing Hobart people fairly well, I flicked through it and looked for some names that I might recognise. I can see in that list recognisable names of architects, doctors, teachers, film producers, bus drivers and butchers. I cannot identify the 1,000 names but I can see a broad spectrum of citizens of Hobart and also, quite interestingly, some people from mainland Australia who were tourists in Hobart signed it because they felt that this was a way that they could get a message across to their Government immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> During this lengthy debate so far, I have been disappointed, mostly by what I have seen as well-measured, carefully read statements, mostly delivered without passion and mostly delivered without commitment and without conviction. It seems that all we have heard is the party piece; all we have heard is what has been sanctioned by the Party, to use a word in another way. It is almost as if most of the people who have spoken so far have been afraid of showing passion, afraid of admitting that Australia has reached this shameful position. </PARA>
<PARA> In attempting to justify this position, Senator Gareth Evans said in part that wars have to be fought. I am afraid that I was not convinced. Part of Senator Hill's justification for the position that we have reached included his concern that a power balance must be preserved in the Middle East and, as I understand it, Senator Beahan was saying something of the same just recently. Senator Hill was also concerned about the possibility of a power vacuum when hostilities cease. I suggest that that vacuum would have been ideally filled from within Iraq by those who would have achieved Hussein's overthrow after his failure was apparent. And that failure would have become apparent, if sufficient time was given for sanctions to work. </PARA>
<PARA> A suggestion made earlier on in this debate via the interjections of several Liberal senators was that Iraqi citizens would starve during the enforcement of sanctions. Those interjections reveal how little those people know of the geography of the area. We are talking about the fertile crescent. It is highly unlikely that Iraqi citizens will starve-although they will not be eating caviar-as a result of sanctions, as a result of the actions which keep trade away from their country. </PARA>
<PARA> Sanctions will destroy trade and sanctions will destroy military capacity, but for Liberal senators glibly to suggest from their ignorance of the geography of the area that people will starve illustrates their depth of understanding of what is involved here. Sanctions will destroy the military capacity of the area. They will force that country, if applied long enough of course, to become something more like an agrarian society, incapable of sustaining the megalomania of military dictators such as Saddam. Surely that is the agreed purpose of sanctions-to reduce the capacity of a leader to provide for his external ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> After listening to some of this debate yesterday, I took refuge in watching the television late last night. Two experts, Marvin Feuerwerger and Edward Luttwak, were interviewed on a Cable News Network program at 1.30 this morning. Marvin Feuerwerger was from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and Edward Luttwak was from the Washington Centre for Strategic and International Studies. These experts were introduced by the interviewer and the interviewer's questions generally took the trend of, `What is the next phase in the war?' and, `What should we do next?'. I think the expectations of the interviewer were that we would be told what the next phase was. Instead, Luttwak replied, `Sanctions were working. We should not proceed beyond the air war. We could starve the troops out. They need truckloads of food each day'. The other speaker suggested that we should not engage Iraq in a ground war because it would be solely a waste of lives. Both those strategists appeared on American television last night and were not witnesses being led by the prosecution; they were witnesses brought to argue, I think, another phase of the war. However, without assistance from the interviewer, they came up with that analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the debate-not the television debate-several speakers so far have invoked their personal understanding of history in their attempts to justify the actions of this Government. Many honourable senators have read out lists of past tyrants and have described the past responses of Western civilisations to these tyrants. If we really want to learn the lessons of history, we should not be interested in imitating the failures of history, nor should we be interested in any new world order which depends upon American superiority of armaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht spoke at length about this new order. There is nothing new about trying to bludgeon dissenters into compliance, nor is there anything new about using military superiority to enforce peace. The Romans tried that. It is not a real, lasting peace. History teaches us that such peace only lasts as long as it takes for a new weapon to emerge or for a new tyrant to develop his power. We are obliged to be interested in the lessons of history. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the mightiest lesson of all is provided to us by the Great War-the war to end all wars. It did not. Instead, new weapons and new violent strategies gave promise to new violent warriors who wanted to avenge the memory of their forefathers. The same, or even a greater effect, was obvious from the Second World War-a war that was caused by the first. What whirlwind will we reap from the seeds of today's destruction?</PARA>
<PARA> Other honourable senators spoke of more recent history: the atrocities committed by the Iraqis in Kuwait. Senator Tate asked us directly for a quantification of the level of atrocities required before violent reaction could be provoked. My personal and genuine answer to Senator Tate-and I am very pleased that he is in the chamber at the moment-is that a nation has vastly different capacities and vastly different responsibilities to those of an individual. </PARA>

I suppose that all fathers wrestle with difficulties in this regard. But nations have a responsibility to do more than make brief, instinctive physical reactions. They have a responsibility also to go through more than esoteric mental recreation; they have to face the aggression and decide what to do about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I cannot help but think that the response which is now occurring in the Gulf may well bring about destruction and suffering vastly in excess of anything that has occurred in Kuwait. The present violence is certainly the seed of future violence. Thus, that is not an appropriate response, regardless of the sophistication of the ordnance being used and regardless of the precision of its delivery, the decision to use military force was a primitive decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell suggested in his contribution that the leader of Iraq is probably irrational and inconsistent to the extent that he cannot maintain meaningful negotiations. These are probably not Senator Boswell's exact words but I think I have the sense of it. I agree with his instinctive psychoanalysis. However, we should consider what is possible in terms of negotiations in this region. In effect, we are negotiating with the Iraqi people and not just their leader. Surely our aim is to place that evil leader in such a position that his own people will recognise his folly and stupidity and, therefore, remove his authority or at least remove their support of his regime. Such a course would resolve much of what is not resolved by warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi people would not then be harbouring a smouldering hatred of those who they now see as aggressors. Such hatreds have always eventually given rise to vengeance. If any interjector suggests that such a theory is naive, I say again that that person should look at history. Such hatreds always give rise to vengeance, with the avengers claiming the status of heroes. Such hatreds have always perpetuated warfare.</PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I must say that I am particularly disappointed that so much of the negotiating that we saw reported in Australia was conducted by people other than those with the United Nations mandate. It was only at the very end that the United Nations Secretary-General was expected to achieve an impossible, last minute resolution after the military minds had painted all of us into an impossible corner. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate, Senator McMullan and others reported the statements made by the world leaders such as Mitterrand and Craxi. Quotes from those people suggest that Hussein would never say the word `withdrawal' and that he has not given us any sign that he would comply with the United Nations requests. Have these people not been anywhere? Do they not know anything? That is what bullies talk about. That is what they are all about. That is the language of bullyism. They never, ever admit fault. They never submit. </PARA>
<PARA> What did these wise people do? They gave a deadline; a time to aim for. Of course the leader of Iraq waited until the deadline. Of course he maintained his position until then. Without that line to aim for, with uncertainty, with no indication of when international patience will run out, stress and pressure would mount from within. The Iraqi people would then put pressure on the person who is leading them into a vague situation without a deadline, without a goal and without any sense of achievement. It is then that the uncertainties would arise from within the administration of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman suggested that our civilisation has a history of dealing with tyrants. The history of our treatment of previous tyrants has not rid the world of new tyrants. We have one now. If we meet violence with violence, and if we meet the tyrants with violence, there will always be one who believes he is stronger. That is the fundamental law of violence. There will be one who believes he is more terrible, more fear-inspiring than all who have been defeated before with violence. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not repeat the follies of history. We need to recognise that what Senator McLean was saying yesterday was, in fact, where we are. Senator McLean spoke about our opportunity to move from the mentality of war to the mentality of peace. We are, in our society now, at a threshold. I am sorry to say that we went over the brink a couple of days ago. We have reached a stage in our society where we have the technology, the social skills and the communications networks which we had never had before. We almost had the will to bring about a real new world order, a world order of strong, persistent, international cohesion to ostracise the warmongers and to make their program impossible to embark upon. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon, with his keen vision, noticed that all those concerned about the use of violence in this conflict are those who were concerned about the use of violence to solve Vietnam's problems. He was wrong: there are many missing. His eyesight has failed him. Those who are missing are sitting on the Labor front bench. What has happened to their courage, their commitment and their faith in the future and the progress of our civilisation? By that I mean the progress towards non-military solutions to international problems. Those aspirations are constrained within the stultifying blanket of the party system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that there are perhaps some who may not feel the constraint as tightly as others, but that system has denied parliamentarians an opportunity to vote publicly in the same direction as their conscience. I blame that system for the frustration which has been expressed by so many Australians. They are frustrated because they have not seen sufficient public debate and public exposure, through debate, of the concerns that my colleagues have expressed both yesterday and today. </PARA>
<PARA> As I listened to Senator Schacht's contribution I hoped for some departure from the party line. Senator Schacht gave us a lot of information. He described how Iraq's Government has abused its own people over the last 20 years and he placed particular emphasis on evidence from 1985. All Senator Schacht's evidence shows us is Australia's inaction over those years. Although he has been outspoken on human rights issues over a number of years, it does not seem to have achieved the results which he and many others would hope for.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht also confused not fighting with inaction. It takes great courage to resist the primitive urge to lash out, to strike rather than negotiate. I was astounded to hear Senator Schacht attempting to misquote Martin Luther King's thoughts about how evils should be met. Of course King challenged all peaceful people to meet evil and to take action. He did not propose violent reaction against it. Senator Schacht's problem is that he knows of only one action-the primitive action of violence. I was astounded that he attempted to endorse that by referring to Martin Luther King. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a great problem with Senator Schacht's repeated and misguided assertion that the Australian Democrats first opposed sanctions. We certainly did not. What we did oppose was the placing of Australian vessels under United States command in a role which at that time was not endorsed by the United Nations. The Democrats contend that there could still be a role for Australian ships to play as part of a United Nations sanction enforcement team. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of being unconvincing, Senator Aulich was one who drove me to write down what he was saying. He suggested that until now we have been unable to implement collective security through the United Nations. Perhaps he is correct. We do know that we now have the opportunity to exercise collective security. Real security comes from the opportunity to reduce the imbalance between the haves and the have-nots. But to suggest that collective security needs as its foundation the destructiveness of this military action is to remove the best opportunity we have to establish, through consensus, non-military actions as the restraints which are necessary for the preservation of peace. Restraints built in that way are restraints which are not easily broken. Restraints based on violence are those which can be overcome by any other violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The military actions are really like mass capital punishment. Just as the prospect of capital punishment does not deter the crazed murderer, mass capital punishment cannot deter the power-hungry dictator, the sort of person who always adopts the mentality of the schoolyard bully- `If I am violent enough I can overcome all comers'; the `I am the greatest' mentality. As we all know, such a mentality is always surpassed eventually, usually by a more violent person. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know about honourable senators in the chamber, but I have seen enough of life: I have had to deal with enough tough guys to know the basic laws of the street. I know that if such a person is ostracised he is met with complete isolation from his community. If nobody challenges him, if he is unable to function in the community, his violence is irrelevant. </PARA>

I have given a recipe because we now have the technological capacity, the social skills, the communication network and the social development which, for the first time in history, give us the opportunity to bring to bear on bullies the sorts of actions which we have learnt surpass the primitive actions taken in the past which have failed. What is being proposed, by way of interjection, is that we return to the primitive notions of the past and try to learn them all over again. That is just garbage. There is a lesson we need to learn so we can eventually rid the world of the likes of this despicable tyrant that has been given to us.

The important thing is what we do when we are in unison, how we enforce peace when we act together. That is why my petitioners and correspondents ask the question of this Government. We know that violence does not work. Why do we not look at the alternative measures? That is why we are so upset about the action taken by the Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before the Senate. Senator Bell gave us a summary of all the reasons why the Australian people will, in the end, totally reject the view which has been put forward by Senator Powell and her colleagues. Anyone listening to Senator Bell would have assumed that the Gulf crisis was the fault of Mr Bush and Mr Hawke. He barely mentioned this evil dictator, this slaughterer of his own people, this man who has plunged the world into this terrible bloodbath. We heard virtually nothing from Senator Bell about Saddam Hussein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bell urged us to learn the lessons of history and he referred to World War II. The lesson of history is this: at the end of the day, peace-loving people have to stand up to bloodthirsty dictators. People have to say, `Thus far and no further', and be prepared to enforce their will. Standing up to the Nazis and the Japanese did not create 40 or 50 years of violence: it created a long period of peace in Europe. It is clear that the Australian Democrats have learnt nothing from history. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely that during our period as senators we will have to consider a motion of greater moment than one which commits the men and women of our armed forces to war. Dr Hewson has stated the position of the coalition very clearly. He said yesterday, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>We share with the Government a fundamental unity of purpose concerning Australia's commitment to the Gulf war.</PARA>
<PARA>The arguments regarding our commitment to the Gulf have been extensively canvassed in this chamber. Today I wish to direct myself to two particular matters. Firstly, I believe there is not a person in the Senate or in the House of Representatives who is not for peace. I reject the assertions from Senator Powell and her colleagues that they are the ones who offer the best chance for long term peace in this world. Indeed, the policy advocated by Senator Powell and the Senator Vallentines of this world would, I believe, given time, lead to international disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I wish to discuss relates to the responsibility of the Government to ensure that our service men and women receive the Government and community support that they are entitled to expect. All of us in this chamber seek peace. The debate is between those who say the best way to maintain peace in the long term is to avoid confronting the aggressor, to give him time, concessions-indeed anything-in the hope of persuading him to cease his illegal occupation of his neighbour. On the other hand, there are those-and I am pleased to say the vast majority of senators-who argue that naked aggression must now be resisted as all reasonable diplomatic steps to secure peace have been exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Democrats, under the leadership of Senator Powell, have adopted a policy of appeasement. Dr Hewson, and Senator Evans in this chamber, were quite correct in drawing our attention to the lessons of the 1930s. Appeasing the aggressor in the 1930s did not lead to peace but resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of men, women and children. Appeasement was the policy that was tried by the British Prime Ministers Baldwin and Chamberlain, and it was a policy which almost led to world Nazi domination. This is how the historian, William Manchester, describes the great appeasers, Baldwin and Chamberlain, who now, as he says, wear the sackcloth of history. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>So, with their eyes open they sought accommodation with a criminal regime, turned a blind eye to its iniquities, ignored its frequent resort to murder and torture . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Powell, Senator Vallentine and indeed most of the Democrat speakers in their contributions to this debate largely ignored the criminal regime of Saddam Hussein and spent much of their time, as I have said, attacking the policies of the United States of America and the Australian Government in their attempt to give meaning and substance to the resolution of the United Nations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp, I understand, has dumped on them. Senator Chipp has made it very clear, I understand, that he does not support the policies that Senator Powell and her colleagues are now pursuing. We believe that the policy represented by the motion before this chamber is the international community's best chance to secure a new world order based on peaceful relations between sovereign states. Saddam's invasion and annexation of Kuwait, a member state of the United Nations, was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, yet Senator Powell urges us to show him more understanding and to give him more time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been many attempts over the past five months to get a negotiated settlement-all frustrated by Iraq's refusal to withdraw. What evidence is there that Saddam Hussein is prepared to negotiate peace? Senator Powell has not brought forward any evidence today. Saddam Hussein has a record of making war on his neighbours and slaughtering his own citizens who have the misfortune to belong to a minority group or who are his political opponents. What chance is there to negotiate a rational peace with this man? How do we deal with an evil leader such as Saddam Hussein, who has no respect for human rights and civilised behaviour? Senator Powell, Senator Vallentine and, as we have just heard, Senator Bell, offer no solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans has outlined in some detail why the policy to impose sanctions was not in the end going to bring about a resolution of the conflict. It is interesting that none of the Democrat speakers have seen fit to carefully address and weigh the arguments that Senator Evans put forward. In calling for sanctions to be given what amounts to unlimited time-and I repeat that the Democrats are effectively calling for sanctions to be given absolutely unlimited time-Senator Powell, Senator Vallentine and their colleagues might reflect on this matter: Saddam Hussein has never had a weapon he has not used, or indeed is prepared to use. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Edward Kennedy informed the United States Senate armed services committee hearings that in eight or nine months time Saddam will have some type of nuclear weapon. Senator Vallentine in her speech said that Iraq is developing a nuclear capability. How does Senator Vallentine deal with this fact? Within a brief period of time Iraq may be able to deliver a nuclear bomb. Did she offer a sound practical policy to deal with what would be an immense crisis for the world community? What did Senator Vallentine do? She attacked Israel. She offered nothing practical, nothing to deal with the real substance of the issues which are before this chamber. Is there any doubt that Saddam would be prepared to use a nuclear bomb as an offensive weapon to dominate his neighbours? A war he would wage with a nuclear capacity would cause far greater confusion and casualties than may be inflicted by the present crisis. We also know that with additional time Saddam Hussein will be able to upgrade his delivery systems for chemical and biological weapons. All the evidence points to the fact that Saddam Hussein is more than prepared to use these terrible weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth considering the horrendous implications for the future of the world if Saddam Hussein possesses an effective arsenal of nuclear bombs and upgraded chemical and biological weapons. Providing additional time for sanctions, as argued by Senator Powell and her colleagues, would not produce peace. It may produce a holocaust. Senator Powell warns us of another Vietnam. In some ways Senator Powell, in raising this issue, is raising an apt point. The failure to defeat an aggressor in Vietnam condemned the people of South Vietnam to be governed by one of the world's most backward regimes, a regime that instituted a gulag to re-educate its political opponents, a regime which has created such terror that hundreds of thousands of its citizens thought it preferable to face the risks of rape, torture from pirates, and possible death in the open sea, than to stay under a totalitarian dictatorship. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech supporting the Government's position Senator Bolkus, to his undying discredit, seemed to forget these real lessons of Vietnam. Indeed, it has to be said that Senator Bolkus hardly bolstered the Government's case for supporting the United States-led coalition forces by recalling that the Left had supported the Vietnamese-by that he means, of course, the communist Vietnamese-against imperialist forces. Who were the imperialist forces? I suspect the imperialist forces he was referring to-and he would attempt to argue-were the US and Australian forces. It hardly bolsters the Government's policy to have a Minister stand up and utter such nonsense, in my view. Senator Schacht also undermined his own well-argued case by mentioning the Vietnam experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to address is the need to ensure that the Government's Gulf policy is effectively communicated to the Australian public. Our service men and women need to be confident that the nation is united behind them. The bipartisanship which has been offered by the Opposition means that there is almost a unique opportunity to build and maintain national unity and purpose on the Gulf commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the divisions between the two major parties which have so often marked Australian foreign policy since World War II are not present in this crisis. How different it is from the time when the Fraser Government sought bipartisan support from the Labor Party for the Australian commitment to the multilateral Sinai peace force following the Camp David agreement. I can tell Senator Tate that the Labor Party has come a long way since the debates in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his senior Ministers have been criticised in the press for failing to communicate effectively the Government's Gulf policy. It is a policy which I and my colleagues all support, as we have stated. Regrettably, there is some substance to these criticisms. For example, the Government was notably unenthusiastic about recalling Parliament to enable this vital national debate to take place which will demonstrate, above all, the strong support that this Parliament will give to our Gulf commitment. That is the message which will go out from this Parliament when this motion comes to the vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, some Australian Labor Party members and senators have already attempted to undermine the Government's policies. Senator Tambling drew attention previously and, indeed, in this chamber today to the fact that a Government office-holder, Mr Snowdon, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, has given his strong support to a rally opposing the Government's policy. Mr Hawke must show that his Government speaks with one voice on this vital national issue. It is one thing for Labor Party backbenchers to dissent from Government policy; it is intolerable that a Government office-holder should be free to attack our national commitment. In my view, Mr Snowdon must either resign or be sacked by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some irony in the fact that yesterday Senator Evans was subjected to considerable abuse from so-called peace activists when he attempted to explain to this Parliament why, in some cases, military action is the only moral course. It would be interesting to calculate how much money this Government has funnelled into so-called peace groups. The Government recently announced the establishment of a peace study centre in Perth. I wonder whether Senator Tate, who is in this chamber, can let us know whether this centre will join with some other so-called peace centres in attacking the Gulf commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Can Senator Tate tell us how much the Government gave to radical peace groups in 1986, the International Year of Peace? How many of these groups are supporting the moral commitment the Government has made to support the UN resolutions on the Gulf? Do their publications make it clear that at times this nation must go to war if we are to establish a workable long time peace? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not point scoring. The Government, through its own shortsightedness and weakness, has helped the Left build its influence in the education system and given it resources which have increased its capacity to attack the national commitment to the Gulf. As a result, the onus is now on Senator Tate and his colleagues to make special efforts to communicate the Gulf policy, to effectively answer the concerns that will be raised and to expose the false arguments of the Senator Vallentines and their supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Other difficulties will have to be faced by the Government if it is to communicate its policy with a strong voice. The fact that our forces are committed to the Gulf raises particular dilemmas for the media. It is a concern that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) itself has become a matter of controversy in relation to the coverage of the war. It has been accused of anti-Americanism and pro-pacifist bias in the press, and today Senator Robert Ray gave some credence to these views by saying that no-one could argue that the ABC is pro-American. I hope the ABC is pro-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had the opportunity to analyse the validity of the arguments which have been made against the ABC in the press but I have noted that David Hill, not surprisingly, rejects these criticisms. Nevertheless, the ABC does have a tradition of left wing bias. What procedures does the ABC have in place to ensure that its current affairs programs do not excessively promote minority views? The public would be interested to hear from David Hill what these procedures are and how they are being observed. Does the Government have a view on the performance of the national broadcaster in relation to its reporting of the Gulf crisis?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now asked men and women to put their lives at stake for the national good. There can be no twotrack foreign policy. The national interest must not be compromised by any Labor Party internal problems and, indeed, the frequently perceived need by the Labor Party leadership to placate its left wing. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, two years ago the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader, Yasser Arafat, mouthed the renunciation of terrorism and the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Events have proved he clearly did not mean these words. Why, then, we ask, is the Government still considering a request by the PLO office in Canberra for visas to enable overseas PLO representatives to come here? The request should have been rejected as soon as the PLO made clear its support for Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait, and it should certainly be rejected now. </PARA>
<PARA> How can Australia take resolute action against Saddam Hussein and, at the same time, consider appeasing some of his most enthusiastic supporters by upgrading further the PLO status and representation in Canberra? I can tell Senator Tate that action on this front will help communicate the determination of the Government to support its own policy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Australians will not tolerate a two-track foreign policy. There is some evidence to date that the Government does not have a well thought out policy, as I have said, to communicate clearly and forcefully the reasons for our Gulf commitment. In my view, every family in Australia should be informed of the reasons this Parliament has made its bipartisan commitment to the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the bipartisan approach which has been offered by the coalition, I would certainly like to see a letter jointly signed by Mr Hawke and Dr Hewson posted to every adult in Australia, which encloses information and sets out in straightforward language the reasons why we have made this national commitment. With this information at hand, all Australians will understand why this Parliament will pass the motion before us with a huge majority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Peace in our time-those words have been uttered many times in this century with optimism and hope by people who reflect the world's desire to live in peace, to live without conflict. And 1990 promised to be just that-a year in which we had peace, when Russia changed its spots, when the Berlin Wall fell, when the problem of Namibia was solved, and when South African people were given some hope. While there was still some conflict in the world, the world basically started off as a better place at the beginning of 1990. It was a place in which peace and disarmament meant that a civilised world could concentrate on such matters as poverty, starvation and the environment and look after those in the world who deserved a better life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what happened to that promising start of 1990? That madman, Saddam Hussein, came upon the scene. Without reason, cause or logic, he ruthlessly and brutally invaded and occupied an adjoining sovereign state and proceeded to rape and pillage a nation and its people. He imposed a regime of summary execution, arrest and incarceration without trial and often without cause; a regime where accidentally spilling a cup of coffee over his photograph in a newspaper meant instant arrest; a regime where turning off his broadcast on a radio in a public place meant imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this sort of environment that people such as Senator Bell say we should let this matter go so that eventually the people of Iraq would overthrow this madman. What absolute ridiculousness, when the people who might oppose Saddam Hussein in Iraq are imprisoned for something as small as spilling a cup of coffee over his photograph in the newspaper. The world community was rightly outraged at the unprovoked attack by Iraq. But, in a decision which itself showed a maturity that was sadly lacking in the early decades of this century, the world community, through the United Nations, decided with sensibility and after detailed debate that Hussein must withdraw or be forced out of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The world community decided to take a stand against naked aggression-a stand which, I might say, had it been taken in the fourth decade of this century, may have avoided the Holocaust, the mass killing, the horror and maiming that commenced with the appeasement of that other notorious madman of our time. Indeed, there are many similarities between the personalities and aims of Saddam Hussein and Hitler. Warning after warning was given, but to no avail. Eventually the world community took the only avenue left, and that was forcibly to remove Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia as part of the world community took its part. We are only a small nation in world events, but we played our part. Our troops, with the professionalism for which they have become renowned, have gone in and played their part. Again, as usual, they have been well regarded by all with whom they have come in contact as the very best of troops. We as a nation must be very proud of them. It was important that tyrants be universally condemned. Australia was part of the world nation which did the universal condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole world played its part, with the exception of the few fifth columnists, the friends of the madman Saddam Hussein, the supporters of the Jew haters, with the appeasement policies that supported Hitler and the Nazis. It is those people-and those people alone-who would not join in the condemnation of Saddam Hussein. It was encouragement from such people that led the Nazis to attempt a world conquest which led to the deaths and murders of some six million Jews and many more millions of other innocent people and troops over a six-year period of madness, a six-year period which it appears the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine and their supporters want repeated so that Saddam Hussein can go in and murder babies and children and, if he could have his way, more than six million Jews again. I venture to say that that is probably what Senator Vallentine and some of her cronies down the other end of this chamber would relish-some war that went on for six years so that they would be given some opportunity, some reason, to be reelected and continue to have a prominence in this place. </PARA>

<PARA> The Democrats, with their usual holier-than-thou approach to everything, have provided this chamber with a litany of lies, as is normal. They have continued all the way through with inaccuracy after inaccuracy-the Belgian ships and the refusal by Senator Robert Ray to answer things. They put forward all of these lies and continue to try to misrepresent the feelings of this nation. They are claiming that there is more than 50 per cent support for their cause. I do not suppose they have bothered to read the Newspoll in today's Australian, which shows that some 70 per cent of Australians support this Government's action in the Middle East. The Democrats have no intention of letting a few facts interfere with their biased and jaundiced view on this whole matter. A total of only some 24 per cent are opposed to the present action of this Government, and some of them are not terribly opposed to it. But the Democrats do not acknowledge that. They come in here and keep telling us that the majority support their jaundiced and quite strange view of world affairs in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> It is these fifth columnists, as I call them, who continue to encourage the madman Hussein. If only these people would realise that, every time they object, every time they get up and try to break the alliance against Hussein, it gives Hussein encouragement to keep going in a war which even someone as mad as he must know he cannot win. But, while the likes of the Democrats and Senator Vallentine continue to support his cause, he will continue in the hope that eventually that sort of attitude will cause the solid alliance currently arranged against Hussein to crack and leave him alone to continue his plans for world conquest. </PARA>
<PARA> We, like the people in the United States of America, live in a free country where we have a right to dissent-and I support that right. It is a right, of course, that is completely unknown in countries such as Iraq and occupied Kuwait. No matter how much I disagree with the views expressed by people campaigning around this chamber, I respect and will always support their right to dissent. But they have no monopoly on peace. I and all of us in this chamber are dedicated to peace and are opposed to the horrors of war, but there was no alternative in this case. The sanctions were not working. I do not know how much the Democrats and their cronies need to understand that, but they were simply not working. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we have to wait for as long as sanctions have been imposed on South Africa to try to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait? It is some 16 years or more since sanctions were imposed on South Africa and they have never really worked. What makes people like the Democrats think they can possibly work in this case? In five months they have reduced Iraq's gross domestic product by about only 10 per cent. They have had absolutely no effect on the military might or on the controllers of that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean said yesterday in his speech, which was again a speech notable for its confused thoughts and principles, that we must get out of the ethos of war-he spoke a lot about that-and have an ethos of peace. However, not once did he tell us how we were going to achieve that. Not once did he tell us how we were going to defend ourselves if we were attacked. He did not tell us how the Kuwaitis should have defended themselves when they were attacked and how they should try to retrieve their country. He went on for some time and told us how loathsome Hussein was. But by his very action he encourages and supports this loathsome madman in his continuation of this ridiculous war he cannot win. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean talked about singing the songs of Lennon and giving peace a chance. Well, the world community gave peace a chance. For five months we begged Hussein to do something and to get out of Kuwait. We begged him; we then threatened him. None of it worked. The only way to achieve anything is to move in and physically eject him. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the peace demonstrators to think very seriously about the effect that their demonstrations might have on someone as mad as Hussein. He must see that there are people trying to undermine the united efforts of this country and of the world community. Saddam Hussein must sit there thinking that if he can hang out long enough for that sort of movement to take control of the Western democracies, he will be right. If he can hang out for three or four months and encourage that lot to keep undermining the united effort, he may be able to force a crack in the coalition, he may be able to force the crack that will, in the democracies, mean that governments are forced to pull back. He will then be left-with all his madness and brutality-to continue on from where he started. But it will not be just Kuwait; it will be Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Iran and Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who demonstrate should seriously think about the effects that their undermining of the united effort will have on the prolongation of this war. The more Hussein sees cracks in the coalition, the more determined he will be to drag it on for as long as he can in the hope that he can outlast the united effort of the Western and coalition nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put some questions to Senator Vallentine, the Democrats and the people who, by their attacks on the opponents of Saddam Hussein, only encourage that madman to continue this crazy war. It is all very well for them to say what we should not be doing but can they tell me what we should do to get the madman out? Sanctions do not work-that has been proven-so that course is irrelevant. We cannot wait 16 years in the hope that by that time the sanctions might work. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we to do to get him out? Do we keep asking him to leave? Do we keep sending him little notes? Do we keep passing resolutions at the United Nations telling him to get out? We have done that for the five months and it has not worked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely nothing. The lessons of history are there. Had the world community in 1936 stood up to those people maybe-just maybe-they would not have progressed with their aims of world conquest. Maybe some Jews might have been injured-as there have been in this war-but six million of them might not have been gassed. No matter how well meaning that appeasement was, Hitler was encouraged to go further and this led to the Holocaust which is now part of a history we would all wish to forget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Democrats and Senator Vallentine: How do we deal with people who turn rockets with chemical and germ warheads indiscriminately on civilian populations, often their own? Again, I cannot help but laugh, although it is tragic, when Senator Bell says, `We will wait for an uprising in Iraq to overthrow Hussein. Maybe if we keep the sanctions on for a long while the Iraqi people will rise up and overthrow him'. The Kurds tried to do that and those of them who are left probably regret the day that they did so because the madman turned the germ warfare on his own country. </PARA>
<PARA> I put this scenario to the Democrats: Suppose for some reason-which I will not even attempt to invent-the government of a nation of 250 million people to the near north of Australia, which at the moment is a very sensible, progressive and stable government, was no longer in power. I live closer to that country than I do to Canberra. Suppose into the vacuum came a leader of the type of Saddam Hussein-someone who looked around and eyed enviously the mineral wealth of our country of Australia; someone who dreamt of a southern empire that would include the Indonesian archipelago, the Philippines, New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand. Hopefully, that will never happen and the present enlightened leadership of Indonesia will continue forever. But it is just possible that some day there could be an overturning of the government of that country which is very close to us. Someone like Saddam Hussein might then invade Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our armed forces have been run down over the years because of pressure on governments from peace groups and groups like the Democrats. Suppose we were invaded from the north by someone determined to invade us-by someone who had planned the invasion for some time, had built up a military capability, had nuclear weapons, had chemical and germ warfare and had rockets that could easily be launched from the archipelago into Australia. With the way our forces have been run down, a concerted and determined attack from our near north could find Australia subjugated. This would happen no matter how professional and good our forces and troops are. Hopefully, the Americans would come in to support us. The attacking force, if it were led by someone like Saddam Hussein, would be raping our wives and children, murdering our babies, killing our old people and conducting summary executions, arrests without trial and gas attacks in our country. What would we think of that?</PARA>
<PARA> If then the Americans came to our rescue what would the people like the Australian Democrats think of those who started opposing the Americans, calling upon the Americans to pull out of Australia, wanting to stop the Americans helping us against the people who would kill and plunder our loved ones, our families? Would the Democrats then send some money to the peace groups in America which were trying to stop the Americans helping us? Is that what they would do?</PARA>
<PARA> One would think from the attitude they have taken in this particular issue that that is the sort of thing they would do. If it came back to home, if it was us being attacked and if it were the Americans coming in to save us, maybe they would change their minds. They would be inhuman if they did not. That leads to the question of whether they would have one rule if we were attacked but, if some other country were attacked, would they think it was fair game to oppose the Americans, to oppose the British or to oppose the Australian Government, which were trying to do something to resurrect the country that had been pillaged?</PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat disappointed that a colleague of mine from north Queensland, Senator Reynolds, is on record supporting the peace groups. I might say that she is totally at odds with the other people of her party in north Queensland-the State members and Mr Lindsay, who is the Federal member for Herbert. Senator Reynolds is on record in the Townsville newspaper as opposing the American involvement, opposing our involvement, calling for withdrawal and supporting the peace groups. It seems sad to me that someone in that situation, who would be in the front line if there were an attack on Australia, should not be able to see and understand that the only way to stop tyrants and bullies is by showing force. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude my speech, there are just two other matters that I want to raise in connection with this issue. The motion being moved has the unanimous support of the Liberal and National parties and we congratulate the Government on the stand it has taken and the way it has handled this conflict and handled the whole issue today. It is important that this Parliament should unanimously support the motion to show people and to show Hussein that there is no crack in our resolve to get rid of the type of aggression that he supports. </PARA>
<PARA> I again ask the people who are supporting the peace groups to sit down and think seriously just what their actions are doing to Hussein because his emissaries right around the world will be reporting with gusto where there are demonstrations against military involvement in this country and in the United States, Britain and Europe. Hussein will realise that if he can hang out a little longer these peace groups may have their way and they may, over a period of time, force the Western democracies and the other partners in the coalition to withdraw from the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> I just plead with the protesters and with the peace people, if they are genuine in wanting an early end to this conflict, to consider what they are doing and to consider that every time they demonstrate they give Saddam Hussein more resolve to hang on, to lengthen the war and to keep it going in the hope that the Western allies, the coalition, will pull back and he will be left to do his deeds. I make that plea to the peace groups. I ask them to please think it through sincerely, and realise that their actions give encouragement and support to Hussein to continue his mad war. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I have been somewhat troubled in recent years at the bias in the ABC. Often it has been internal and political and we, on this side of the Parliament, have grown used to that and shrug it by and deal without it. But I was disturbed last Friday, as I drove along the Queensland coast looking at the flood ravaged areas there, with my radio on the ABC keeping updated on the Gulf War, to hear the tone of the people on the ABC. I cannot be specific with particular instances, but there were ABC commentators in that broadcast who, by the way they asked the questions, by the light and darkness in their voices, seemed to me to get a real lift, a real buzz, when the rockets first started going at Israel. The thought that the Israelis would be drawn in and the coalition split aside seemed to cause some great excitement to the people asking the questions. The questions were posed to the people being interviewed in a slanted way which seemed to indicate almost an eagerness for Israel to be attacked, for Israel to respond and for that to lead to the coalition breaking up and the Americans and the Australians being withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed to see that our national radio station was doing that. As I say, it was done in no specific way, but it was a general demeanour. Maybe I should not have said that because I have not been able to be specific but I am encouraged to say it by a letter written by David Hill in response to an article which I have not read. I did read Hill's response. From the tone of the response, it seemed that I would have agreed to the thing that he was responding to. There does seem to be an unfortunate bias in the way the ABC reports the war. </PARA>
<PARA> The attention given to peace groups in the news broadcasts and bulletins far outweighs their significance in Australia. The number of people demonstrating and the number of people in peace groups is infinitesimal when compared to the silent majority of Australians, most of whom, according to the news poll, support the Government's action. It seems to me that the ABC has given an inordinate amount of time and airplay to the peace groups which then gives the appearance that the peace groups are stronger than they are. I am somewhat disappointed in that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Peace is something to which we all aspire. Last Thursday was a very sad day. I do not know of many people who were not moved when they heard on the 11 o'clock news reports that hostilities had broken out. It is a difficult issue for many people and I respect their decisions to oppose what this Government is doing. I support the Government's actions wholeheartedly, but I do so sharing some of its sadness because it does mean loss of life. But if we do not do something now, what will happen? If we do not defend Kuwait, what will be the outcome? What happens to Saudi Arabia? What happens to Iran? What happens to Turkey, Syria and Jordan? They all border on a country run by someone who can be fairly accurately described as a psychopath. A psychopath is someone who does not respond to anything that is rational or logical; that is the sort of person we are dealing with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In thinking about what to say, I was moved to look at a quotation which has been attributed to Martin Niemoller, a German pastor who, in 1937, was incarcerated in a concentration camp by the German Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>In Germany, the Nazis came for the Communists and I didn't speak up because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn't speak up because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics and I was a Protestant so I didn't speak up. Then they came for me . . . By that time there was no one to speak up for anyone. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of problem that we face here: if we do not speak up, if we do not act, there will come a time when it is too large for anything further to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody likes war, as I have said. If I knew any one who did, I think I would trot them off to a psychiatrist fairly quick smart because I think they would need a bit of help. By mentioning `we' when I talk of this conflict, I do mean the United Nations. I do not just mean Australia and the United States (US). I pause here to give an indication of the countries who have shown, not just in verbal terms but in practical terms, their opposition to what Saddam Hussein is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Contributing to the multinational naval force we have the US, Britain, Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain. That is certainly a good cross- section because it was only a few years ago that Britain and Argentina were having a stoush themselves. But they, despite their conflict of recent times, are opposed to what is happening in the Gulf. Germany and Greece have ships in support in the Mediterranean. The Soviet Union has ships in the Gulf. They are not part of that task force but they have certainly cooperated with it. </PARA>
<PARA> On the ground, we have military forces from the United States, Britain, Turkey, Argentina, Bangladesh, Egypt, France, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Morocco, Niger, Pakistan and Senegal. That is a fairly good cross-section of countries within this world of Muslim belief, Christian belief and other beliefs as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In a non-combatant medical and support area we have countries including Australia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, the Philippines, Sweden and Thailand. Sweden is known as an independent nation. It did not enter into the Second World War and retained its neutral status, but it has seen fit to provide medical aid to those who need it. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of medical aid, we have seen today the refusal by Hussein to allow access to the prisoners of war by the Red Cross. This is in total breach of the Geneva Convention. This is in conjunction with his threats to place them, as he was going to do with the hostages, around military sites. It is just a further indication of this man's lack of regard for human beings. We have heard very well documented evidence from Senator Tate, and Senator Schacht in particular, of the human rights abuses of this man. I do not recall seeing very many of the peace activists outside the Iraqi Embassy when we saw those graphic television pictures of the Iranian soldiers sprayed with chemicals. I do not recall there being much of a protest outside the Iraqi Embassy when the villages and towns and large numbers of their Kurdish inhabitants were decimated, destroyed-genocide within his own country. </PARA>
<PARA> We know he has the weapons. We know that because he has used them on his own people. Surely there are not many people in this world who can accept and approve the use of chemical and biological weapons, with the threat of nuclear weapons, upon his own people. To me, that is horrendous and makes me stand up and say: thus far, and no further. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like war. I do not like killing. But I do not like abuse of innocent civilians, particularly premature infants in humidicribs. I worked for two years in a premature nursery. I know what those children have to struggle through to survive. I know what the parents of premature infants being born now in Kuwait must be going through. Those children who will be born prematurely or in need of paediatric treatment have been given a death warrant before they even arrive in this world. That is something which I find intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the motion moved by Senator Button in this chamber and by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the other place, which says that the Senate reaffirms its support for the ongoing role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations. That is what this conflict is all about. We have heard today from others of Dr Evatt's statement in the 1940s when the United Nations was being formed; that it was going to be different from the League of Nations. One of the reasons for the failure of the League of Nations was the fact that it did not have any teeth. It was able to carry out diplomacy, which is what the Australian Democrats are suggesting in their amendment. That failed. We have tried it once; surely we do not have to try it again. In some situations when dealing with certain psychiatric types of illnesses, we do have to do something fairly substantial and with force. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also affirming support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in resolution 678 for support in implementing that resolution. That is not the first resolution. It did not come as a surprise to anybody that the United Nations Security Council might just have thought it was time to express its feelings a bit more firmly, because it was the twelfth resolution from the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 15 members on the Security Council and of these 12 resolutions, five of them were passed 15 to nothing. Cuba and Yemen are members of the Security Council. Cuba is not a country that is given to supporting democracies-far from it. Cuba has interfered in many self-determination and independence struggles, and not always by just talking but certainly by providing soldiers, weapons and munitions. But even Cuba thought that what Hussein was doing was obviously far beyond what it would contemplate, and it has supported a number of these resolutions: five out of the 12 resolutions in the Security Council have obtained the support of Cuba. I think that is very important to remember. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, thus far and no further. I think that is what this resolution is about. I notice that the Australian Democrats have mentioned only two resolutions, one which they oppose; they support only resolution 661. I wonder what they would suggest about the other 10. </PARA>
<PARA> We express also our full confidence in and support for Australian forces serving with the United Nations multinational forces in the Gulf, and to that I can only add my support. I also add my support for the families of those who are serving in the Gulf, because it is those families who are left to wait, worry, pray and hope that nothing untoward befalls their family members. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that a lot of support has been given to the families by the Royal Australian Navy. I have spoken with the mother of one of our naval personnel who is serving in the Gulf, and she is most appreciative of the support and of the contact that the Navy and the Defence Force are giving. This is something that we must ensure continues. The families of the defence forces also must be upset when they see graffiti on cenotaphs and graffiti and defacing paint on the entrances to military barracks and things like that. We should bear in mind that these families can remember the welcome home parades that were not given for the personnel who served in Vietnam. They are scared that this will happen to members of their families; that they will not get the recognition of the hard work and the dedication that they have given and displayed. I call upon everybody here to reinforce our support for these personnel. They did not go because they wanted to go to war. They went because they are doing their duty for their country, and it is very important to remember that. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are talking about supporting groups, we should also be very conscious and oppose most vehemently the harassment that has taken place in parts of the Arab and Muslim community in this country. I would draw the people's attention to the Prime Minister's comments when he addressed the House of Representatives on this subject. It is something to be opposed at every turn. We may not agree with people's opinions but we do not have the right when they are living peacefully in this country to harass them. Many of those people from the Arab and Muslim countries have come to this country to escape the sort of regimes that Saddam Hussein has in fact been leading. Those people understand better than we do what persecution is, and we should not be increasing it for them. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly deplore Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack on Israel. We can also add to that Bahrain, because it has copped a couple of Scud attacks as well. We recognise, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Conflict in the Middle East is not new. I admit to not being a student of the Bible, but I certainly know of a number of stories within the Bible of conflict and war within the Middle East, of oppression of different nations. I say it is not new. But if, as the Democrats say, we have come a long way with technology and communications, then certainly now is the time to deal with these problems and to address them in a mature and intelligent way, because we all have to live on this earth together. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also not forget the problems and the fighting that is going on in the Lebanon. There have been some suggestions by some of the Democrats that the Arab League might well be the body to resolve the Iraq-Kuwait conflict. But I would point out that the Arab League is the one that has attempted to settle the Lebanon issue and has not to this date been terribly successful. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I say that I respect the opinions of everyone who has spoken. I respect the opinions of those within the peace movement. I disagree with what they say, but I also expect them to respect what I might believe and have to say. Finally, I quote the Prime Minister when he said on Thursday of last week:</PARA>
<PARA>We all of us wish for peace. But we cannot have peace just by wishing for it or just by talking about it; we have to work for it, and sometimes, tragically, we have to fight for it. The great lesson of this century is that peace is bought at too high a price, if that price is the appeasement of aggression. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In endorsing our involvement in the Gulf war, I believe that it is imperative that we make the point that there cannot be one member of this Parliament who sees war as a policy decision. The days of militarism are gone. War is no longer a glory; it is now only a last resort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For Australia, deciding to be part of the Middle East conflict was the difficult, not the easy, decision. I am positive that, despite the peace protests in our cities, the quiet majority of Australians recognise that. It was a bipartisan decision and it had bipartisan support. It was bipartisan because our commitment in the Gulf is on our own behalf; that is, on behalf of Australia. It is on behalf of Australia's involvement and commitment to all that the United Nations Charter stands for-the international order based on the UN Charter. It recognises that Iraq is in contempt of 12 mandatory resolutions of the United Nations. It is on behalf of a very small nation which, if right does not triumph this time, may one day find itself obliterated by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also on behalf of the many agreements which give us the security that other nations would come to Australia's help against aggressors. It recognises the new order throughout the world, a most encouraging development. It is not on behalf of the United States of America. That view, which I have heard during the past month, is nothing but wrongly targeted emotion. Involvement in this conflict is simply our duty, however much we would prefer to be at peace. We cannot use the excuse of geography to shun our responsibilities. That would have been the easy solution. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot argue to be included in the A team in peace and then opt for the reserves during a war. I make these comments all the while recognising that I do not want Australia to be at war. It is the last thing I and I am sure everyone else in this Parliament wanted to occur. That view, however, has nothing to do with my endorsement of the decision. My endorsement says that choice is a luxury we do not have as a major nation. I make those comments not just as a senator but as a father. As a father, of course, I am selfish enough, like most, never to want a son or a daughter of mine to go to or be involved in war. But as a senator of Australia, I have to agree with great reluctance that I am at one with the 28 nations-through five continents throughout the world-which have ordered force against Saddam Hussein. The last resort was all we had left to use. </PARA>
<PARA> My endorsement recognises the atrocities committed by Hussein-which many have referred to in debates over the last 24 hours-that we will not tolerate action such as that and that many nations will respond with unison and absolute purpose when an aggressor takes over a country and a city, as did Saddam Hussein. My endorsement recognises the new world order responding to an aggressor; a new world order that I would not have thought possible but a few years ago; a new world order that really does demonstrate that peace-and by that I mean meaningful peace-is an objective for which countries hitherto not prepared to act collectively will now so act when pushed to the brink by someone like Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> The war of words is over. The final solution is now the only solution. That is not said lightly. But nor is any decision to go to war made lightly. I have watched, therefore, the machinations of the Australian Democrats-as one journalist wrote recently, the `parliamentary scavengers'-with concern and, more recently, with distaste. I noted the actions of Senator Vallentine yesterday in the other House. For an elected member of the Commonwealth of Australia to abuse a privilege-as I believe, in effect, it was abused-in the forum of the other House is reprehensible. Some reference ought to be made to such action. </PARA>
<PARA> Actions such as inciting others to participate in breaching the Standing Orders of the Parliament of Australia are reprehensible. These are actions that really prey on the emotions of the Australian public, a public that has the same horror of war as this country's politicians do. We have a group of people who thrive on the doubts of others, not only on this issue but on many other issues that we have seen. Of course, that is very easy for a group of people who stand for anything that may bring them handfuls of votes from small interest groups. It is very easy for a group of people who will never ever be called upon in government to answer for their words or their deeds, and they know it. They can say what they want, when they want, for whatever ends. They can change their minds more often than the sun rises and not be accountable for it. In a crisis they can take the opportunistic line, and they usually do.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to three press releases put out by the Democrats in the course of the last few months. Let us see where they stand. On 13 August, a release said that the Democrats support UN attempts to resolve the conflict by non-military means, including the use of economic sanctions. On 27 August, they said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . sanctions are an excuse to wage war by means of starvation. </PARA>
<PARA>Are they in favour of them or are they not in favour of them? Do they want a blockade or do they not want a blockade? Then on 30 November they talked about the sanctions needing some 12 to 18 months to be worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the course of three months the Democrats' position changed somewhat. We had the position referred to in the Senate earlier where last Friday a senator from the Democrats went on talk back radio indicating that the Government had not ruled out conscription. I am not a defender of the Government's line, nor would I seek to want to do that on too many occasions. But on this occasion it was shown that in November the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) did clearly indicate that that was not a legal option for the Government, nor was it an option of will or a policy direction which the Government intended to implement. Yet we had that issue being raised on radio by a Democrat senator. If that is not meant to create concern and anxiety within the community, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> I have respect for people who want to use the streets and the columns of our newspapers to spread the pacifists' word. I have no objection to them taking that course of action-that is their right and, in a democracy, that right ought to be protected. I happen to disagree with their views which are currently being put forward but I advocate that their right to put those views ought to be maintained. Pacifism is a point of view which I think ought to be respected. It is not a coward's point of view. For many, it is a deeply held point of view that ought to have our respect in a democracy. So too should the point of view that the bipartisan decision to take part in the conflict was not one of aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> My one concern about the peace movement is that it is playing into the psychological warfare hands of our opponents. We do not want a military win and a political loss for the alliance. To that end, in this last 24 hours, I have had sent to me a letter from a group of concerned citizens in my home State who saw the peace marches over the weekend and who saw the activities that started to generate around the Commonwealth Parliament whilst we debated this motion. At short notice they put together a letter addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I will read the contents of that letter because I think it has some relevance. It is from people who acted on their own initiative, wanting to just balance out in some small but meaningful way the profile of the peace movement in the community. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> As an Australian citizen, I wish to record my support for our Government's decision to honour its obligations to the United Nations Security Council's resolution to use force against Iraq in its refusal to withdraw from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand people protesting against war, however I believe they do not fully realise the adverse psychological effect of this action on people serving in a war zone where it could be perceived as a lack of support for our defence forces who are carrying out their duty to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I deplore the necessity of war, I pledge my support for my fellow citizens in our defence forces serving in this war zone. </PARA>
<PARA>These are sentiments with which I concur. Our service personnel are doing a crucial, critical and important job for this country. They deserve and are entitled to the wholehearted support of this Parliament and the people of Australia. I ask those in the peace movement how they would feel if the sirens sounded over our cities some time in the future and the allies said, `Sorry, but the pressure from the peace movement says we shouldn't help. We can't help'. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying earlier that we cannot expect to be part of the A team in peace if we opt for the reserves during war, I believe it is imperative that when this conflict is over we are indeed part of the A team when seeking a solution to the Palestinian problem. We have had to take the painful, while correct, decision to be involved in the Gulf war. That involvement must surely put us in the front line of negotiation in seeking a solution to lasting peace in the Middle East. I am sure that that is a sentiment with which all members of this Parliament would concur and agree. </PARA>
<PARA> There is just one other aspect to which I wish to refer while speaking on this motion and giving it my endorsement and support. Today I asked the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a question about my concern that there are a number of people currently in Australia on visas, illegally issued by an office of the Commonwealth of Australia overseas. These illegal visas were, as I understand it, issued to people from Middle East countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming from South Australia within which Nurrungar is located and given that the Government has indicated that it is concerned about the increase in terrorist activities throughout the world and that Australia may well be a part of that scene, I urge the Government to ensure that if there are some four unaccounted for people currently in Australia on illegal visas, every precaution is taken and all resources are committed to ensure that they are located. The public should be adequately informed. The necessary precautions should be taken for the safety and security of the public and the installations within Australia that are forming a vital component of the war effort to ensure that the ultimate result of this war will be a new world order that will bring lasting peace throughout the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion and the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The motion reaffirms our support for an ongoing role for the United Nations (UN) in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait. Because of the time restraints I will not read out the motion, but it goes on to say that we support resolution 678 of the Security Council. I believe that by supporting that and the first part of the motion we show quite clearly Australia's position in supporting the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to deal with only two matters today: firstly, the new world order and, secondly, Amnesty International. I believe that a number of previous speakers have said that there was selective use of the report of Amnesty International. I had the luck, I suppose one would have to say, of being selected to represent the Parliament at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> At that Assembly there was a quite surprising discussion between member states and this was because a change had taken place in the General Assembly. The Cold War had ended and there had been a change in the international scene. That change had developed to such a point that the eastern Europeans and the two Germanies had come together. All those things helped to build the international relationship between the various countries. </PARA>
<PARA> So for the first time the United Nations became a very strong and cohesive organisation. The Cold War had ended and the political changes that had been talked about in eastern Europe had come about. Some of the speakers at the General Assembly-in particular President Bush from the United States of America and Eduard Shevardnadze, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-outlined their view of the future of the United Nations. They talked of the new world order and that had some meaning. It meant that in the future the United States, Russia and other member states were going to combine to see that some of the aggression that was taking place around the world was able to be stopped by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> One could see very clearly the view of the President of the United States when he addressed the General Assembly in New York. Addressing the Assembly on 1 October 1990, the President said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Soviet Union agreed with so many of us, here in the United Nations, to condemn the aggression of Iraq, there could be no doubt that we had indeed put four decades of history behind us. </PARA>
<PARA> We are hopeful that the machinery of the United Nations will no longer be frozen by the divisions that plagued us during the Cold War. That, at long last, we can build new bridges, and tear down old walls. </PARA>
<PARA> That, at long last, we will be able to build a new world based on an event for which we have all hoped-an end to the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days from now, the world will be watching when the Cold War is formally buried in Berlin. And in this time of testing, a fundamental question must be asked. A question not for any one nation-but for the United Nations. And the question is this: Can we work together in a new partnership of nations? Can the collective strength of the world community, expressed by the United Nations, unite to deter and defeat aggression?</PARA>
<PARA>An address was given by Eduard Shevardnadze, the then Russian Foreign Minister, on 25 September 1990 in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The cold war, with its accompanying stress, psychoses and anticipation of disaster, is no longer a part of our life. Gone is the strain of daily confrontation, propaganda bickering and reciprocal threats. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the year during which pieces of the Berlin wall were a popular souvenir. And now, an end has been put to the division of Europe and a final line drawn under the Second World War. The unification of the two German states is being completed. The ``German question'', this ``great'' and ``classical'' problem of world politics which only yesterday seemed intractable, has been resolved calmly and to mutual satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA>The statements by the President of the United States and Eduard Shevardnadze show very clearly that there was a different feeling in the United Nations-a feeling of a new order; a feeling that the United Nations had at last reached a point after the Cold War in which it could take action in the world and make that action count. </PARA>
<PARA> Eduard Shevardnadze said that he believed the military committee of the United Nations should be re-established and that military committee should be used to allow the United Nations to have a military force so that at no time in the future would any one nation have to move to try to stop aggression on its own and become the victim of criticism of other member states or nations throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from Mr Shevardnadze's speech on the military committee because his statement and the one made by George Bush show that there was a feeling that we should have unification within the United Nations and that unification should let the United Nations work as one group. Mr Shevardnadze stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet delegation believes that the Security Council must take the necessary organizational steps to be able to act in strict conformity with the provisions of the Charter. </PARA>
<PARA> It should begin by initiating steps to reactivate the work of the Military Staff Committee and study the practical aspects of assigning national military contingents to serve under the authority of the Council-</PARA>
<PARA>therefore building the United Nations force. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is prepared to conclude an appropriate agreement with the Security Council. We are sure that the other permanent members of the Council and states that might be approached . . . will do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Shevardnadze went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, there is no reason to object to steps taken by legitimate international ``law-enforcement bodies''-the Security Council and its Military Staff Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that eventually the Security Council will act on the points of view put forward at the Assembly. I do not believe we will see a situation again where one nation has to move to stop aggression and then be supported by other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I should quickly run through some of the details of what has happened in relation to the Gulf events. On 2 August, Iraq invaded Kuwait at 2 a.m.-9 a.m. Australian eastern standard time. The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq and demanded its withdrawal. On 6 August, the United Nations Security Council agreed 13 to nil to impose stringent trade embargoes on Iraq, except for medicine and foodstuffs. On 8 August, Iraq annexed Kuwait. On 16 August, Iraq ordered 4,000 British and 2,500 Americans in Kuwait to report to hotels or be rounded up. Its intention was to hold westerners as human shields against attack. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 August, the United Nations Security Council authorised the use of force by Western navies to enforce sanctions and Australia was going to play its part in the enforcement of those sanctions. On 3 October, Amnesty International said that Iraqi troops had tortured Kuwaitis and executed scores of people. On 28 November, Kuwait exiles told the UN Security Council of a nightmare of murder, rape, torture and looting by Iraqi soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something about the meeting of the Security Council on 28 November 1990. The Council was called into session following the request by the Kuwaiti Ambassador to bring before the Council representatives from Kuwait who had escaped that country when it was being overrun by Saddam Hussein. The Security Council agreed to allow these people to outline their case to members of the Security Council, and to allow them time to describe details of the takeover of the country by the Iraqis. The Security Council had television set up and allowed the showing of a tape taken by an amateur photographer. The tape clearly showed the details of the invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the tape was being shown to the Security Council, representatives of other countries at the United Nations were present. The people from Kuwait came forward to describe what had happened whilst the tape was screening, and they gave vivid descriptions of murder, rape, looting, torture, and the disappearance of friends and families. When we hear members within this chamber say that we are being selective in the way we use the Amnesty International report, it was quite clear, when seeing those tapes and when hearing those people speak before the Security Council, that one did not need to read the reports. The vivid way in which they described what had happened showed very clearly that Saddam Hussein is nothing more than the butcher of Baghdad. When they spoke of looting, they described the looting of household goods, businesses and hospitals where Iraqi soldiers removed equipment including dialysis machines-removed the patients, took the machines-and removed babies from humidicribs. More details of the horrors were given, but the details are too long to relate here today. I do think it shows very clearly that those details do support the reports of Amnesty International, and they do show very clearly that those reports should be taken into consideration when one is considering the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> As a witness to the tapes, and having heard the vivid descriptions from the people of Kuwait, I am left in no doubt that the Security Council should take military action to stop Saddam Hussein, and should take that action as quickly as possible. The horror and revulsion I felt I believe would have been felt by many of the representatives of the other countries at the United Nations. It left me in no doubt as to what action the United Nations should take. </PARA>
<PARA> Following that, on 29 November the United Nations Security Council voted 12 to 2-Yemen and Cuba opposing-with one abstaining, China, to authorise the use of force against Iraq unless it withdrew from Kuwait by 15 January. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very clear that the invasion of Kuwait by the Iraqis was nothing more than a blatant assertion and an attempt to take over a country which they should not have in their possession. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me finally say this: When the armed forces of Iraq invaded its neighbouring state, Kuwait, the latter state was at peace with Iraq and did not constitute any threat, military or otherwise. Iraq consequently annexed Kuwait and incorporated it into its territories. This was aggression, in that it constituted the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> War is essentially evil. It is the supreme international crime. Its consequences are not confined to the conquered country; it affects the whole world. As an international force the United Nations has acted to protect the world, and I believe that Australia has acted correctly in supporting the United Nations in its international action to try to halt the aggression that has taken place in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Council convenes today to express its resolve that the principles of the United Nations Charter should be concrete facts, that words will be translated into tangible deeds, and that the principle of collective security should be the framework that regulates international regulations, so that people may rest assured that the stronger will not prey on the weaker, and that those who harbour aggressive intentions should hesitate and consider before resorting to force because they now know that the entire world will reverse their aggression and face up to their adventures. </PARA>
<PARA>So spoke Sheikh al-Sabah, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kuwait, to the special sitting of the United Nations Security Council on 29 November last when it debated resolution 678. Today the Australian Parliament is debating the consequences of that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very fortunate to be one of the two parliamentary representatives at the United Nations (UN) from this Parliament, the other being Senator Jones who has just spoken. I will not go over a lot of the areas that he covered. We had the opportunity to see the expressions and resolve of the people on the Security Council. Today, though, we have the opportunity to express our views, individually and collectively, as members of the Australian Senate, on the tragic events that have taken place over the last five months. But we must not forget, in our deliberations, that what we say here in this chamber may not be remembered, just as what was said in the United Nations may also not be remembered. The result of what is said today and what was spoken in the United Nations Security Council in November is what matters. At the time Sheikh al-Sabah said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the principles . . . should be concrete facts. Words translated into tangible deeds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How very important that is. Those who are critical of the actions taken by the United Nations in this resolution and, by extension, those who are critical of Australia's role in the conflict need to remember that. Indeed, the United Nations was established for exactly the situation the world finds itself in today. Let me quote the United Nations Charter and the statute of the International Court of Justice, the purposes and principles. Article 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Purposes of the United Nations are:</PARA>
<PARA>1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Also article 2, clause 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>I think both of those parts of the Charter of the United Nations should be well remembered by everyone in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN Security Council's powers are precise. I will quote from those guidelines, remembering what Senator Jones has just told us about the 15 members-five of them being permanent and the others being elected for two years. The guidelines state:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Charter, all Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. While other organs of the United Nations make recommendations to Governments, the Council alone has the power to take decisions which Member States are obligated under the Charter to carry out. </PARA>
<PARA>The functions and powers of the Security Council are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Charter, the functions and powers of the Security Council are:</PARA>
<PARA> to maintain international peace and security in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations;</PARA>
<PARA>There are other functions and powers as well but, relevant to this debate, the Charter goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> to call on Members to apply economic sanctions and other measures not involving the use of force in order to prevent or stop aggression;</PARA>
<PARA> to take military action against an aggressor;</PARA>
<PARA>The activities in the Middle East today are the manifestation of the principles of the UN Charter-putting principles into concrete facts and translating words enunciated in November into tangible deeds, in accordance with the Charter agreed to by the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> What also needs to be stressed-and it appears to have been overlooked by all of those people who are protesting outside this building and elsewhere-is that the events in the Middle East today are not the result of American actions but, more importantly, UN actions, supported by almost all of the 159 member countries of the UN. Those actions have been precipitated by the refusal, and the intransigency, of Iraq to acknowledge the universal condemnation of its act of war on Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be repeated: This conflict did not start on 15 or 16 January 1991, and it was not started by the United States. This war started on 2 August last year. Iraq started this conflict by the atrocities it committed in Kuwait-atrocities to innocent Kuwaiti citizens and the government of Kuwait-atrocities which continue today. Iraq took hostages. As Senator Schacht said in his speech early this morning, Iraq perpetrated a list of atrocities. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has continued with its hostile actions despite repeated individual attempts by various heads of state to negotiate privately, and despite 12 separate resolutions of the United Nations. All resolutions have had one common purpose: peace. But for Saddam Hussein, the words made no impact. He was the only one who could achieve peace and he chose to spurn it. Resolution 678 was a peaceful motion. It asked Iraq to get out of Kuwait. Iraq had time to do it, if it had the resolve. I am afraid Saddam Hussein did not take the opportunity at that particular stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As the French Foreign Minister said at that historic meeting of the UN Security Council on 29 November which I was proud to witness, as I said, with Senator Jones, `If Iraq chooses to remain deaf to appeal, reason and respect for law what other choice are we left with but to resort to the same means which would appear to be the only one it recognises?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat at a loss to understand the logic of some of my colleagues in this place and those demonstrators outside this chamber who believe that somehow Australia can remain apart from all the things that are happening; that for some peculiar reason we should not be prepared to support the United Nations; that the world should travel the path of appeasement-a path already trodden this century with such disastrous and tragic results. I am not sure who first said that appeasement was like a person feeding a crocodile, hoping that he will be the last to be eaten; but that is what happens when one appeases an aggressor-one finds out that there is always somebody who is going to be the last to be eaten. </PARA>
<PARA> This country claimed during its bicentennial year three years ago that we had matured as a nation. We spoke then of our role in the world and our desire to be taken seriously as a country of significance. We expect the world to take us seriously on such issues as trade. We engage in international and multinational treaties with a myriad of countries. But when it comes to acting collectively with the rest of the world on an issue that may not affect us immediately or directly, but one which threatens international peace and global security, we have people saying, `Leave us out of it. It has nothing to do with us.' That notion is as naive as it is dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent of the UN resolution was to put an end to aggression. It was a resolution for peace, as I said earlier. The choice as to whether the conflict was resolved peacefully or otherwise lay then, and still does, entirely with Saddam Hussein. He was told in unequivocal terms what the feelings of the rest of the world were on the question of his invasion of Kuwait. He has known its attitude for months. He was told personally by the world's leaders on a number of occasions, some as recently as last week. He had the opportunity to speak with any and all of the UN Security Council members to ascertain their views. He chose to take the wrong course. That he chose to ignore their advice, and that he chose to ignore not one but all the various UN Security Council resolutions, is his responsibility and will be to his ultimate regret. </PARA>
<PARA> Once resolution 678 was passed the rest of the world had no option but to adhere to it, remembering that it had six weeks to really work. That six-week time lag was built into the resolution to allow the traditional Arab alliances and others to negotiate with Hussein. We all know the outcome of those negotiations. Here, might I say that not enough people have mentioned the work that was done by James Baker, the Secretary of State for America, in his attempts to bring peace to the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein, and no-one else, has thrown this world into hostilities. He is the one who has brought on the conflict and now he is the only one who can stop it. It is in his hands alone that a resolution to this conflict lies. He can choose to do it at any time. It is only sad for the world that he did not choose to do it when the opportunity was there through the Security Council resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, it appears that he is so little concerned about the future of his country that he is prepared to gamble with the lives of Iraqi citizens and jeopardise the country's future to satisfy his own arrogant ambitions. Strangely, that view seems to have been completely overlooked or ignored by the so-called peace demonstrators who have cluttered the galleries and grounds of Parliament over the past two days. </PARA>
<PARA> While they have protested vociferously outside the United States Embassy and at US consular offices around Australia and, as was mentioned by Senator Robert Ray in the debate yesterday, outside the Israeli Embassy when that country had Iraqi missiles being fired onto it-this absolutely astounds me-I cannot recall one protest being staged outside the Iraqi Embassy, either now or when this whole sad affair started last August. I would have had more respect for the sincerity of their views had they been more vocal and vigorous in their protests against the Iraqi atrocities in August and since. Where was their outrage and indignation then? Why is it directed at the United States and Australian governments now?</PARA>
<PARA> What must Australian naval personnel think of those who appear on television protesting our presence in the Gulf? How must they feel, seeing fellow countrymen opposed to what they are doing? They have joined up to bring about peace in a region. That is why people join the Army and the Navy. They do not do it to fight wars; they do it to bring about peace, in the same way as policemen have to administer the law and keep peace on the streets. What thought have those protesters given to the relatives and friends of our serving men and women? Why are they not given any support and consideration? If people have an overwhelming desire to stand on street corners and scream, let them stand outside the Iraqi Embassy and direct their abuse at the Iraqi Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, it was only 12 months ago that world leaders were talking of a new age of peace with the wave of democracy that swept through eastern Europe. Just how fragile global peace is and how precious is its existence has been brought home to all of us in the last week. I pray that this conflict will soon be resolved, that Saddam Hussein will come to realise the futility of the war he is engaged in, and that he will come to that realisation before he sacrifices innocent Iraqi lives any longer and further threatens the lives of those involved in defending the rights of the international community. That is what our sailors are doing in the Gulf: they are defending the rights of the international community on behalf of the United Nations Security Council resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> This is no holy war Hussein has engaged in; it is an outrageous abuse of his power, an abuse of human rights, and a terrorist campaign of manic proportions which no-one-not in Kuwait, not in the United States, not in Australia-can afford to ignore. Saddam Hussein's call to Muslims around the world to join his fight against the infidels has, thankfully, largely fallen on deaf ears. The significance of the opposition of Arab states to Iraq and their support for the United Nations' position cannot be underestimated. It is important that people around the world maintain their opposition to and their absolute rejection of the terrorism of Iraq and continue to press to end this bitter conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we in Australia maintain our support for the United Nations. It is for those reasons and others that I have already outlined that I support the Australian Government in this important motion. I wish to quote the words of Mr Abu Hassan of Malaysia when he spoke at the United Nations Security Council:</PARA>
<PARA> The natural tendency would be to abstain, horrified at the prospects of war and the thousands who would perish; however, we are convinced that such a step on our part would not amount to effectively discharging our responsibilities in the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> As a small nation and a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and of the Non-Aligned movement, it is Malaysia's duty to support and uphold the unity and resolve of the Council to reverse aggression and to restore peace. Malaysia's stand against strong nations invading or annexing small nations is well known. This applies not only to Iraq but to all others, without exception. We cannot compromise on this if we are, together, to build strong foundations for a new world order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The central principle against which I have come to my conclusion about this matter is the principle that no nation state, particularly a nation state that is a member of the United Nations, has the right to occupy militarily and then destroy another nation state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been six major arguments advanced over the last six months against our participation in the Middle East. I intend to go through those six arguments and make a comment about them. Before I do, I have to say that when Iraq first invaded Kuwait I was particularly pessimistic about the outcome. I came to the conclusion fairly early on that war was probably inevitable. I felt particularly depressed about that prospect. It is very clear to me, and has been for some time, that when the land combat starts and the forces of the United States of America and the various other nations surrounding Kuwait have to move into that former nation state there will be horrific casualties. I expect that they will number in the thousands, if not tens of thousands. That is the emotional background against which I have had to consider this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been fortunate to visit the Middle East on a number of occasions. I have spent extensive periods there. I have also read extensively of the history of this area, and I believe that I have some understanding of the particular problems confronted in this region. It is a very difficult series of issues and a very complex series of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The first argument put forward against our involvement in the Middle East is that it is basically a United States imperialist war in defence of oil supplies. I am very critical of the role of the United States in world affairs. I believe that the United States was wrong in Vietnam, that it was wrong in Nicaragua and that it was wrong in Grenada. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that area shortly. There are countless examples of the United States being driven by economic and immoral reasons in terms of the conduct of its foreign policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the United States is not wrong all the time. I reject the simplistic notion that this issue is driven purely by United States imperialism in order to secure oil supplies. The issue is far more complex than that. The United States on many occasions has performed a good and sound role in international affairs. I particularly draw the Senate's attention to the United States' role in both World War I and World War II but in particular the role of President Woodrow Wilson in World War I when he put forward his four points and his 14 principles for resolving conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the situation which has emerged in the Middle East, it is rather ironic that after World War I the victorious powers did not take a great deal more notice of the principles which President Wilson put forward at that time. Had they done so and had they settled the affairs of the Middle East-the affairs of the former Ottoman Empire-we might not have many of the problems which exist in the Middle East today. </PARA>
<PARA> We are continually reminded, particularly by the Australian Democrats, Senator Vallentine and some of the interjectors from the gallery, about East Timor and other examples of conflict in the world where the United Nations, the United States or Australia did not take a firm stand and did not follow their principles through with some effective sanctions-maybe even some effective military sanction. I reject that sort of argument. Because we failed to do something in the past and because we failed to adhere to our central principle that one nation state cannot conquer another nation state does not mean that we do not adhere to our central principle. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion we fortunately have been able to attempt to ensure that no nation state can act militarily and aggressively against another nation state. That is where the Democrats' argument falls down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the issue of `Why now?' a little later in my comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second argument used against the participation in the Middle East is the linkage between the problems of the Palestinians and the problems of Kuwait. It is true that the problems in the Middle East emerged directly as a result of the post-World War I settlement, when the Ottoman Empire was split up primarily by the British, French and Italians. However, the problems in the Middle East are much deeper than that. They go back at least one thousand years and are related to the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the emergence of Islam from the peninsula of what is now Saudi Arabia. There is a layer of religious conflicts and a layer of racial conflicts, and conquest after conquest. The Ottoman Empire finally emerged in the fifteenth century following the conquest of this area. There was the slow disintegration of the Ottoman Empire-the so-called eastern question which preoccupied Europe for most of the nineteenth century until World War I when these European powers believed they had solved it all. </PARA>
<PARA> To link the issue of Palestine with the issue of Kuwait is incorrect. The argument-particularly by Saddam Hussein and by many people who believe that we should not be at war in terms of defending Kuwait-has been advanced, `Well, we do not go to war for Kuwait until we solve the Palestinian problem'. That is a bit like arguing that if Germany, for example, decided to occupy militarily that part of Poland which was part of Germany prior to World War II-and which was, incidentally, quite illegally expropriated by the Soviet Union and Poland after World War II-it could then argue, `We will not withdraw from that area of Poland until the Soviet Union withdraws from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia'. That is the logic of linking one area of conquest with another. Of course, that argument has no logic because one cannot link it. It is a bit like an African country that wants to conquer its neighbour because the various borders which were drawn on a map in Europe have no logic geographically or ethnically. That country could argue, `We want to conquer our next door neighbour and we will not withdraw from that country until something is done about apartheid in South Africa'. One cannot link those sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the overall issues in the Middle East need very careful examination. It is also true to say that the Palestinian problem is by no manner of means the only problem in the Middle East. It quite legitimately receives extensive publicity and the Palestinians have serious concerns and a just cause. However, there are other issues in the Middle East, which in my judgment-if one can give them weight-are of quite serious concern and of equal seriousness in terms of their need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem concerns the Kurdish people. There are some 12 million Kurds in the Middle East; they are divided between Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The Kurds were promised an independent state after World War I but that promise was broken. Prior to the beginning of the present conflict, Hussein closed the valleys in the mountain areas where the Kurds were in rebellion and gassed them with poison gas, contrary to the Geneva Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the problem of the Armenians. During World War I, one million Armenians were marched from one end of the Ottoman Empire to the other. They were shot, starved and buried along the way. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that once this conflict is resolved, if we are to look at the problems of the Middle East, we will look at all the problems that demand attention. I reject the argument that one can link the Palestinian problem with Kuwait and that one should not do anything about Kuwait until the Palestinian problem is addressed in some sort of Middle East general conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The third argument is-and it is probably the most inane that I have heard-that as Kuwait was a monarchical dictatorship it is not worth defending. If we accept the logic of that argument, we could accept the argument that we should not have defended Poland and Greece, which were both military dictatorships prior to World War II and which were both invaded by Germany and, in the case of Poland, by the Soviet Union. That argument has to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth argument concerns sanctions. In my view this is probably the key issue and the one which has caused me the greatest concern. I will come back to it after I have dealt with two other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth argument is the pacifist argument: that we should not be involved in any conflict anywhere. I do not agree with the views of people who are absolute pacifists, although I can accept they have a legitimate view. That argument is that we should not be involved in Kuwait at all and that we should sit back and do nothing about any military aggression. I hope that one day those people have to test that principle in reality. If they are faced with having to defend their families directly from some sort of military assault, their absolute pacifist views will be put to the test. I accept that people do hold those views genuinely. My grandfather was a pacifist. He went to gaol during World War I for his views rather than fight. I had the opportunity to talk to him about that and I can understand his reasons. I find that this is the only view I can logically accept in this dispute as an adequate defence for not participating in the way we have chosen to participate in the Middle East conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth argument is that this is not our war-that maybe something does have to be done about Hussein, maybe military action has to be taken, but it is a far away place and is out of our region and we should not concern ourselves. I reject that argument. Frankly, it is a selfish argument. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in an international economy and we have, as we are often reminded, international environmental problems. Yet some people dare to put forward the argument that we should abrogate our responsibilities when the United Nations is involved and not carry our share of the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I am an internationalist and I believe that we should, when necessary, be involved in the United Nations. If that means the United Nations can now effectively ensure that there is some order in world affairs, we should contribute to that. That means that if it is necessary, we should contribute militarily. In response to earlier interjections, I believe that that is what we should have done in East Timor, but unfortunately we did not. Unfortunately, at that time the world global situation and structure and the environment of the United Nations did not permit us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to my fourth argument-the key issue of sanctions. The argument against military involvement is that sanctions should have been given longer to take effect. Frankly, I found that a difficult issue on which to reach a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken some time to look at the effects that sanctions were having and whether or not they would make any difference in a reasonable period of time. I suppose the hardest thing for us to do is define what a reasonable period of time is. It is interesting that when Australian Democrats have been challenged on this point, they have not defined what a reasonable period of time is for sanctions to take effect. However, it is certainly true that sanctions have stopped imports to and exports from Iraq. They have certainly had some effect on its industrial production. However, they have not had any effect on the military capacity of Iraq at all and it seems to me that they will not have any effect on the military capacity of Iraq for many years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have come to my conclusion. I have looked at the evidence and I have made what in my judgment is the best decision I can on that issue. It was certainly clear to me from the performance that Hussein put on during that six months of sanctions that he was playing for time. If we looked at the way in which Hussein behaved we saw that there were two major issues. He released the hostages one by one, which was a quite despicable and disgraceful performance. Secondly, he poured as much military reinforcement into Kuwait as possible. He dug his troops in and that is a clear indication to me that he meant to stay and he meant to fight. There was no way that he was going to leave Kuwait whether it took six months or six years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that he had the military capacity to maintain his presence. Unfortunately, in modern international affairs, the reality is that if you can occupy a country for long enough, you do obtain some legitimacy through that occupation. So the issue of sanctions is the key issue. I have come to the conclusion that sanctions were not going to succeed. We are left then with the one option, and that is the military option. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that for me it was a particularly difficult personal decision to come to, given that I never believed it would be a short war. No war is ever clean, war is horrific. I know a medical practitioner who spent some time in Iran during the conflict. He was a surgeon asked to go there in order to treat the victims of the Iran-Iraq conflict. He showed me some photographs of the victims of gas warfare. They were certainly the most horrific photos I have ever seen of human beings and the way that they are affected by war. Those sorts of images weighed in my mind when considering this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the future-I would like to examine this briefly before I conclude-I hope that out of this conflict and out of the reorganisation of world affairs that we have witnessed over the last year and with the end of the Cold War we have an emerging international system where justice, fairness and equity can be resolved without the necessity of warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the United Nations can take the leading pivotal role in this new conduct of world affairs. I have to say that I hesitate to use the term that has been used quite frequently-the new world order. I have heard that term used before, incidentally, by Adolf Hitler. I am afraid the images it conjures up are not particularly pleasant. I give one word of warning. I certainly do not believe that the United States can be expected, if this new international system emerges, to pay the economic and military price for enforcing the sorts of actions that are necessary in Kuwait. We are going to have to evolve very quickly some way of the international community sharing that burden. If that means the United Nations developing its own effective military force, then so be it. But I am fairly sceptical that that sort of international organisation will emerge because I believe that when it is put to the test on other occasions, when we cannot obtain the almost unanimous world opinion that we have on this occasion, we will not be able to police effectively the United Nations resolutions and sanctions if we have to. </PARA>
<PARA> But certainly, the United States cannot be expected to bear the brunt and the price of being the world's policeman. I believe that after this dispute is over there is a real danger that the United States may well retreat back into isolationism in a way similar to the way in which the Soviet Union has been forced to, particularly given that the European Community and the Japanese economy are, without doubt, emerging as the great economic forces in the world and seem loath to pay their share of the price. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point about the United Nations-again, it is a point that has been made by the Australian Democrats; it is a legitimate point but it does not excuse the fact that they are not supporting the action in the Middle East-is the behaviour of countries that sell arms to both sides as occurred in the Iran-Iraq conflict. It went on and again I personally hope that with the emergence of a new international system, the United Nations can take effective control of the arms trade by restricting and reducing it and, hopefully, eliminating it, so that we do not have the massive billions of dollars spent on armaments that could otherwise be spent on more effective causes that have been outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I reject the linkage of the Palestinian problem and other problems in the Middle East. I believe that it should be rejected but I sincerely hope that there will be an international conference on those issues and that they will be seriously addressed. If there is one thing to be learnt, and it is a sad way that Israel has had to learn it, it is that the argument that Israel needs defensible borders has largely disappeared with the advent of missile attacks because there are no defensible borders against missile attack. </PARA>

There is no other way. That is the conclusion I have come to and that is the reason why I support my Government. I support the motion before the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly this evening to join with my colleagues in supporting the motion moved by the Government on the Gulf war. At this stage of the debate it could be said that with 40-odd speakers who have spoken ahead of me, I could add very little to the debate that has not already been said. I may even agree with such observations, but I do not agree with the observation made by Paul Lyneham on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program yesterday morning in Western Australia when he suggested the speakers could be limited. He asked the question, `Who would be interested in what the member for Timbuktu thought of the Gulf war?'. I believe that members or senators from remote areas have something to contribute to the debate on the Gulf war. I know they contribute plenty to other debates, but they can also contribute to the debate on the Gulf war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, may I record my disappointment that Parliament was not recalled last week before the deadline expired. I know that putting this nation into a state of war is a function of executive government, but senators and members could have been briefed at first hand rather than relying on the biased opinions of the media. The United States Congress had a special sitting; the German parliament sat; and the Italian parliament definitely sat because three or four speakers from the Government side have quoted from the great speech of Craxi, the Italian Prime Minister. I agree with most of what he had to say, although I do not agree with everything his Government does. The French and British parliaments had their sittings, but we did not, so there will not be any of our famous speeches quoted, as the other speeches such as Craxi's was here. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the beginning of the Gulf dispute, the Opposition has supported the Government in all the moves it has made, so the Government did not face any problems from us in sitting last week. However, with the way the Australian Democrats have carried on, it would not matter whether we sat last week or this week; they perform the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the way that the Gulf war has been shown on television is an utter disgrace. I know that we have to have up to date reports, but I do not believe in glorifying war. It has been run as a live show, interspersed with American advertisements. It is something that we can do without and the television media should be looked at. War is a serious matter and should be treated as such. It should not be glorified that way. War, of course, was the final solution after everything else had been tried in this matter. Honourable senators may have read the reports in the media this morning of the effect that that type of reporting has had on families and children. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a short comment-as other speakers have-on the behaviour of the peace movement. I do not deny the right of any movement to express its views, but there is a right and wrong way to do it. The behaviour that we have seen in the galleries of this chamber was disgraceful and was mainly led and stirred by Senator Vallentine. She interjected when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was speaking in the House of Representatives. She was sitting in the Senators Gallery and, when an attempt was made to eject her, she pulled rank, told the attendants she was a senator and could not be ejected. If she was prepared to interject she should have been prepared to accept the consequences and not to have pulled rank. Her action leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen next time there is something controversial being debated in this Parliament? Will people in the gallery be allowed to carry on in the same way? In the next few months the rural voice will get stronger over the recession. Will we condone farmers carrying on in the same way or will they be ejected?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they do, I will be the first to call for their ejection, Senator Boswell. However, my main point concerns the sanctions that have been applied by the United Nations. This was the main thrust of the Democrats' argument. They believe the sanctions have not been given enough time. Senator Powell and others told us that the sanctions were the only way to go and should have been allowed to continue, but how long is enough time? Is it six months? Is it a year? Is it two years? Is it five years or whatever? No one has told us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell has mentioned South Africa. The sanctions there have been proved to be a failure. If honourable senators do not believe me they should ask the black population there whether the sanctions have worked. The only ones who have suffered in South Africa have been the black population. Sanctions hurt only the weakest, not the strongest. It has been mentioned already by Government and Opposition senators that, as the sanctions continued, Hussein became stronger and stronger. In South Africa sanctions were applied in 1963, a lot longer ago than I imagined, on the supply of arms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1970 a sports ban was placed on South Africa by the Olympic Committee. That would be the only successful sanction. It caused the elimination of South Africa from the Olympics and caused the elimination from competition of the best cricket team in the world at the time. That is the only one that has worked. The sanctions of 1980, 1985 and the United Nations Security Council suspension of investment in 1986 all failed to work and South Africa became stronger and stronger. South Africa is independent in fuel even though it has only two oil wells; it has been able to extract fuel from coal. So in those 28 years the sanctions have failed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move away from South Africa; I was distracted by Senator Boswell. Do the Democrats know who will pay for the sanctions? If five months have not been long enough, how long will it take for the sanctions to work? It could take five years. Who will pay for them? In the final analysis, trade sanctions fall most heavily on rural industries. That is of no concern to the Democrats, of course. Senator Bell, who has been the latter day saint of the defence of the rural industry, has failed to think how sanctions would affect those industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not; they lose, but we are all in together. Primary industry is still being affected by those failed sanctions against South Africa. We have a large amount of trade with the Middle East that has been affected. That leaves aside the trade we have lost with Iraq, the country we are at war with. Iraq was our second biggest wheat customer, taking about 1.3 million tonnes. We have lost that market and we have to look for others. We had a good trade in live sheep to Kuwait. There has been no trade with Iraq during the last two years in live sheep, but during the 1980s Kuwait was our second most important market. In recent years it took about 1.6 million sheep annually, somewhat below the peak of 2.1 million in 1984. The embargo means that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) forecast for total live sheep exports of 5.8 million is very unlikely to be achieved. I have said that we should forget the trade with Iraq because we are at war with it and we will probably replace that market, but Iraq caused us to lose our trade with Kuwait by its illegal invasion of Kuwait in August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the Democrats' view on oil and the slogan which is around which says `No blood for oil.' The Democrats have said that time and time again, but I quote the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson):</PARA>
<PARA>Success in seizing Kuwait's oil assets would encourage Saddam Hussein to repeat the strategy against other neighbours. His growing oil power would fund a further arsenal and adversely affect inflation, growth and interest rates not just in Western economies but in Third World ones as well. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the countries that the Democrats purport to care for all the time. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Saddam's aggression has come at a critical time for the global economy, with the onset of recession in many countries, the severe difficulties confronting eastern European countries and the threatened breakdown of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade system. It also comes at a particularly critical time for our own economy-</PARA>
<PARA>in case Senator Coulter does not know-</PARA>
<PARA>which is very vulnerable to any downturn in the international economy. To prevent world oil supplies being illegally acquired and manipulated by a ruthless and aggressive dictator is not a goal about which Australia or the rest of the international community need feel any embarrassment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the dinner break I quoted from the speech delivered by my Leader, Dr Hewson, to the House of Representatives in which he pointed out that he is not ashamed-and I believe that we should not be ashamed-to admit that we do not want 65 per cent of the world's oil to finish up in a mad dictator's hands. I stand by that statement. I have said before that the sanctions have failed, and all the senators, from both the Opposition and the Government sides, who have spoken in this debate have said that the sanctions have failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that five months was long enough: five months in which Hussein did not give one inch, or 2.54 centimetres; five months in which Kuwait suffered more and more and was plundered more and more with infrastructure being dismantled and removed to Iraq; five months in which oil prices around the world rose because of the effect of the occupation; and five months in which nothing was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> If the United Nations had achieved half of what it was aiming to achieve in that time, we could have said that something was achieved, but absolutely nothing was achieved in those five months. It was five months in which Iraq dug in in Kuwait, and that is the only thing that was achieved. Hussein achieved that; we achieved nothing. D day was 16 January, just as 6 June 1944 was D day. That day, 6 June 1944, was the day that the liberation of Europe commenced. Not five months after sanctions had been imposed or anything like that, but five years plus after the appeasement of Hitler-Baghdad Rose keeps denying that that went on but that is what happened-the Allies set out on the liberation of Europe. To that date the Second World War had been under way with occupation and digging in. That is when the liberation of Europe started, and it took another 12 months after that, with a lot of slaughter, finally to achieve what was done. If in 1938 things had been played differently and played as they are played now, things would have been a lot different. When the United Nations with the Allies acted on 16 January, the time had most certainly come to remove the invaders of Kuwait. The sanctions had failed, as I have already said. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this two-day special sitting of Parliament is not to debate the deepening recession that affects this country, but the sanctions have had a special effect on the rural areas that I represent with the loss of the grain and live sheep trades, and I have told the Senate of that on other occasions. I hope that it will not be too long before the Prime Minister makes good the promise he made when he said that he did not want the sanctions that we have imposed on Iraq to be carried by only certain sectors of Australia. I hope that it will not be very long before he puts those words into action to relieve the problems the sanctions have caused in the country areas of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before this Parliament. I think its terms are well understood by people in this chamber and by people listening. In brief, and this is not a definitive and complete reading of the motion, it supports the ongoing role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations; it affirms support for Australia's response to the request from the United Nations Security Council; it expresses confidence in the Australian forces serving in the United Nations multinational force; it deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by attacking Israel; and, finally, it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the motion I stand to speak to tonight. I do so with a heavy heart and a great regret. This is the sentiment of all those supporting this motion. A decision has been made not to pursue sanctions but to exercise the military option-in short, war. I say again that I do so with a heavy heart and considerable regret. But the time has come and I believe the decision that has been made deserves our support. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish, in the time available to me, to canvass the issues which so many people have very eloquently run through in this place and in the other place. We have heard the detailed arguments about the failure of sanctions. We have heard the argument that sanctions, if persisted with, were not going to be a sufficient restriction against Saddam Hussein. Nor do I wish to canvass extensively the very exhaustive exercise of diplomacy that was carried out by the United Nations and any number of diplomats concluding, I think, with the last effort by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar. I do not wish to run through that. I think it has been spelt out in great detail and I believe the arguments put about that are persuasive. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the comments that were made in the world television coverage of Secretary General de Cuellar's return from his final down-to-the-wire mission to try to see whether peace could not be achieved or the military option averted. People have commented that the look on his face said it all. The man was tired and exhausted and his depression and despondency were very obvious. I think that conveyed the sentiments of so many of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I spell out those issues, I would briefly like to make the comment it is horrible to have to resort to the military option, to war, in the name of peace, but with the greatest regret, I believe that it has come to that. Saddam Hussein has embarked upon a dangerous and wicked course. In particular, I refer to his flagrant disregard of civil rights and cruelty perpetrated against the people of Kuwait, as documented by Amnesty International in its report of December 1990. Others have quoted extensively from that document. I simply join in supporting the sentiments of horror and outrage that anyone quoting from that document has evidenced in this place. They are entirely my sentiments too. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few comments before talking about some differences between this war and others. I want to put on the record my support for the recalling of Parliament. I am pleased that we have the opportunity to be in Parliament to debate this significant motion. I want to convey to the people of Australia that we in this Parliament appreciate that this is a significant and very grave matter. It is appropriate for Parliament, on behalf of the people of this country, to seriously address the issues at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also important for the Australian people to know that their Parliament and, indeed, their representatives want to tackle this issue and put the arguments on the record, not only to make a case in this place but also to inform the Australian people of the questions at issue here and the reasons that so many of us in this place have felt justified supporting this motion and affirming the Government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also important to say something about the young men and women of Australia who by, I suppose, a very arbitrary piece of history and action find themselves the ones called to serve in the Middle East in this multinational force. Not only did one have to be in the military forces in Australia at that time, not only did one have to be in the Navy but also one had to be serving on one of the ships that were called upon to go. </PARA>
<PARA> So, for those men and women who are on active duty carrying out this country's commitment, I think it is very important that this Parliament acknowledges their contribution from the outset and makes it clear that we are proud of them. We congratulate them and acknowledge their courage. </PARA>
<PARA> I also think that it is important that this Parliament should be sitting at this time. I can stand and say that we support their families. We must not forget mainly the generosity of their families-as well as the anxiety and concern-and the need to support and care for those families. They must know that they are not forgotten by the people of Australia and certainly not by their parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA> I say, as many have said in this debate one way or another, that there are differences between this war and the war in Vietnam. I do not wish to canvass the war issue, but I would say that one big difference between this war and the war in Vietnam is the way the forces, the men and women serving Australia, have been acknowledged from the time they have gone and, quite clearly, on the occasion of their return. There will be no wait, when they return, to acknowledge their contribution. That is one of the differences between this war and the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> There were considerable and increasing divisions in Australia during the Vietnam war, as more and more people came to realise that it was an unjust war and it was improper for people to be there. What happened, though, was that much of that antagonism, that enmity, was actually directed at the volunteer and conscripted men and women serving in Vietnam on behalf of Australia. Many of them were not acknowledged as having served in Vietnam or as Vietnam veterans for years after their return. That was not only the case in this country; it was also the case in America. I think it was wrong that the enmity and objection to that war should have been directed at the service people. It should have been sheeted home to the politicians, not to the service men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before that the men and women who are in the Middle East on behalf of Australia at the moment will not have to wait, on their return, for their country to acknowledge their contribution. I do not believe that any of us have any doubt about the courage and the properness of them being there. But I support the recall of Parliament because in this debate we are saying to the people of Australia that ultimately it is this Parliament's responsibility; it is the politicians' responsibility. If people wish to take issue with the decision, if they wish to dispute what Australia is doing, they should not direct that fight at the service men and women who are bound by their obligations under the service force commitment to be there. They should take it up with us. They should bring their fight to the politicians. They should bring to us disputes, their anger, and their unhappiness. We have made that decision and we wear that responsibility. I think that is one of the distinctions between now and Vietnam. It is not that I am cheerfully making this decision. As I have said before, it is done with a heavy heart. But I accept, as a parliamentarian in this place, that I am in part one of the wearers of that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, I want to reinforce, stress and support those who have said in this place that it is important that everybody respects the views of people in this matter. There is a need to respect those who hold a different view. I object to those who leapt to judgment on their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp suggested that those of a different view from him were compromising national security. My view is that the value and significance of the debate and the bipartisan commitment of support for the motion is lessened by political point scoring. The position of some people-for example, the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine-is quite clear. It is quite clear that different points of view will not jeopardise national security. I think it behoves us to respect their point of view-they also have a duty to respect mine. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that we support in this country, too, is the right of people to hold and speak different views. In fact, we would probably say that we would fight to protect that right. I have no objection to people supporting peace in demonstrations around this country, although I must say that I heard one demonstrator in the Senate gallery yesterday lean over and shout, `Kill all politicians'. I think this is simply a reflection only on one individual. It is a measure of her anger and her lack of logic and ought not to be held against all the peace movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The irony of it is not lost on us, Senator, but I appreciate that it is not for us to sit in judgment. Those people are doing sufficient for themselves. I do not believe it does us any good to discredit the peace movement when so many of its members, as I understand it, are people of passionate goodwill and commitment. The peace movement would have even more credibility if it was demonstrating outside the Iraqi Embassy in this town. I do not know whether it has done so; it may have. If it has not, that gives me some reserve in support for the movement because quite clearly there is as much a case for demonstrating outside there, if one is committed to peace, as there is for demonstrating in this Parliament. I hope that peace activists respect the fact that parliamentarians in support of this motion are supporters of peace. The issue is not whether or not we are committed to peace. Indeed, I am and I think I speak for most other people who say they are. Our dispute is about the way to achieve it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join Senator Tate-his was an excellent speech and one of the best in this place in a long time-in claiming that it is our responsibility to come to the assistance of the most vulnerable and the weak. The murdered babies in Kuwait that he quoted are only one example of the many human rights violations under Saddam Hussein that must be stopped. As I have said, the arguments about sanctions and diplomacy have been canvassed extensively. The people who have put them did so very persuasively and I will not run over them again. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the role of the United Nations in which Australia has had a long history. Dr Evatt was one of the principal players in the foundation of the United Nations. The Labor Government, the Australian Labor Party and, I think, Australian governments of all flavours have continued to support and work through the committees of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> With the end of the Cold War hostilities, there has been significant change in the role, position and effectiveness of the United Nations. That is something I cele- brate and support. I would have thought that that has been the view of most people around the world-that, as the Cold War ceased, so the divisive posturing of both sides ceased, enabling the prospect of decent and constructive debate and implementation of resolutions from the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it-I could stand corrected on this-the decision of the United Nations to support in particular resolution 678, to exercise a military option after the deadline of 15 January, was unprecedented in terms of the support it got there. I want that United Nations role only strengthened. I believe that Aus- tralia's credibility in future debates and decisions in the United Nations will be the stronger for our commitment at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> What questions might the United Nations address? What might be the new agenda that Australia can initiate or contribute to in the United Nations? Certainly, with the cessation of hostilities and the ceasefire-and only after that ceasefire and cessation of hostilities-the United Nations will have a critical role. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spelt out the fifth point in the motion, but I think it is important to read it again. It states that this Parliament recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. That would have to be very high on the priority list for the United Nations at the end of the hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer can the world ignore the need for a solution to the questions dividing the Middle East. I have had the opportunity to visit the Middle East and have seen at first hand the camps in which many Palestinian people have not only lived over the last 20 years or more but also have been born in and grown up in. They have known no other world. That is the way they understand the world and that is what home means to them-eight or 10 people in a 10-foot by 10-foot square concrete room. That is what the poverty of those camps has been like for more than a generation of Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lack of health services, a lack of education, impossibly insufficient housing, in many cases a dangerous insufficiency of potable or drinkable water, insufficient food supplies, and in many cases sewage running in the streets. The playgrounds of the children of Palestine growing up in those camps are sewage-infested streets and piles of refuse insufficiently and inadequately collected. Disease and threats to health of all sorts are the playground for those children and families. </PARA>
<PARA> In the midst of all this children are trying to learn to read, to grow up informed in any kind of way. That quite remarkable achievement, in the face of such adversity, by the Palestinian people that I have met and spoken to in those camps must be acknowledged. One of the things that I could say-without, I hope, any misunderstanding-is that the poverty of the Palestinian camps is clean poverty. But that is simply a measure of the endless commitment by the Palestinian people to maintaining at least that modicum of cleanliness in the face of sewage in the streets and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> To me the overwhelming impossibility of the Palestinian camps, the great offence against human rights, is the loss of citizenship. People in the occupied territories are citizens of nowhere. In some ways one would have to ask what greater invasion or denial of human rights there could be. </PARA>
<PARA> Any resolution to the Palestinian question, and to other issues dividing the Middle East, must also ensure the security of Israel. It is sometimes overlooked that Israel's position in this is not a unanimous one either. Many Israelis have chosen to go to gaol rather than do their national service by serving the occupied territories. Many Israelis are passionate for peace. I am not saying that they are right and that Israelis that have exercised their military option are wrong. I do not believe it is for me to sit in judgment. But it is important for us to recognise that there are dreadfully deep divisions in those communities between different peoples and within peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> It was reported to me that yesterday there was a demonstration by Jewish people in Melbourne. I understand that that demonstration opened with a prayer by the rabbi in Arabic-a prayer praising Allah-which was translated for others there. One of the messages was that it is a perversion at the moment that Islam is at war with Judaism. Many times in history Islamic and Judaic religions have not only lived peaceably but also been in support of each other and we should not regard the current divisions in history as the natural state of things. They are what the state is now. But those people calling for peace yesterday were making it clear that, firstly, they have a passionate desire for peace and, secondly, they do not see that it is necessary for Islam and Judaism-two great religions-to be seen or used as a justification for continuing warring. We know that while these injustices continue in the Middle East there will always be that unrest: there will also be a guarantee of continuing prospects of war and certainly a guarantee that there will be no resolution for peace. So that has to be one of the items high on the agenda of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the Senate I asked a question about the unacceptable military crackdown by the Soviet Union in the Baltic states. I would like to see that military force cease as soon as possible-indeed, I would say immediately. Further, I ask: Is this something that the United Nations could and should address? I want to see a United Nations that can find ways of tackling these hard issues-not only country to country disputes but also disputes within countries, particularly where those disputes involve contraventions of basic human rights. It is no longer acceptable that the world turn a blind eye to tyrannies within country borders of the sorts that we know-for example, Cambodia and Uganda. However, I make it quite clear that those are but two examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly the question of numbers of refugees around the world must deserve our attention, and we should not just think about them or talk about them-we should proceed to some resolution of their invidious circumstances. I would have to say that I would like to see a United Nations where of course the overriding concern of all its actions was human rights. I appreciate that my remarks just now may well mean hours of debate, hours of defining what are countries, what are borders, what are acts of aggression, what sort of level of denial of human rights becomes justifiable for United Nations intervention. I know they are probably rather heroic by way of challenge but I would like to try to look at what the United Nations might address than admit that we cannot do very much. I would have to say, though, that history sometimes could leave you feeling very depressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I was asked last week, curiously enough, after the war started, `Are you the mother of sons and does this make a difference to your view?'. Actually I am the mother of sons and no, I would hope it does not make a difference to my view. Possibly it does, but I would certainly want to say that those of us who have sons and those of us who have daughters probably have a special understanding, particularly if those sons and daughters are somewhere between 15 and 45, or maybe 60, but my view is that you do not have to be the mother of sons to have a passionate commitment to peace. You do not have to be the mother of sons to abhor this awful behaviour by Saddam Hussein. I would hope that we do not restrict compassion to only the mothers of sons. Please understand that because I am the mother of sons I do not wish to belittle or diminish my commitment to compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate also said in his speech that peace is not simply the absence of war but a situation where justice prevails. I think that is the final issue that I wish to speak to that must have the attention of governments and the United Nations. It is not good enough to say that we will stop the military option, stop the war, and then there will be peace. There will probably only be quiet, and then only for a time. What we have to address is what is meant by justice, what is the balance of opportunity for education, for literacy, for health services, for clean water and adequate food, for jobs and income security for people which constitutes the sort of fair justice we are arguing for. It is the absence of those circumstances, it is the absence of that justice that leads to tyranny, that allows the emergence of tyrannical leaders, and in particular may lead to one country claiming to demand the services and the provision of goods in another country that might even justify them in their territorial ambitions due to the clear needs of some of their people. Until we address those questions of justice, not only in our country but around the world, through the United Nations, I think the prospects of war may hang over us forever. They are the sorts of questions we have to tackle. That is the sort of commitment, I believe, in talking to this motion, I would like to be affirming. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in this place on a number of occasions in different speeches that those appalling figures from the United Nations Children's Fund-something like 14 million children die each year from easily preventable causes around the world, and over 500,000 women die in childbirth and related diseases-indicate the sorts of perpetual injustices that I think ought to be the passionate question for all of us involved in this place. </PARA>

I have to say that one of the things I have on her is a few more years in this place, and a few more opportunities to have said it. I guess there is not one person in this chamber who would not prefer to spend his dollars on food, education or health services than on armaments. Certainly I have said it often, and I mean it, but I must say I do not find myself in the position where I can direct, for example, the military defence expenditure of most countries. I would prefer by a mile that we did not have those weapons of war. In fact, I would prefer that if anybody wanted to have a war, we should draw a patch on the ground and let the generals or heads of state go out and do it and stop taking the people with them. That is not the nature of war. I have to be a realist. In the end we have to confront the issue of whether or not Saddam Hussein's actions should be allowed to continue or whether they have to be stopped. The price we pay for stopping them is appalling. I understand that and everybody else in this place understands that, but that is the choice we make on balance at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do believe that we must have that commitment to a United Nations world justice-and that does include reduction in arms, and passionately would I vote for that at any time. Can you have a passionate vote? I would make a passionate speech before I voted, but certainly for a reduction in arms. I have been a long-time member of a number of organisations which have opposed nuclear arms and the threat of nuclear war. I do not believe I need to justify my case with my own personal history, but certainly I do not mind saying that I am a person who has campaigned against nuclear arms and would like to see not only their reduction but their total abolition. I would like to see no arms at all, but I guess that is an unrealistic ambition in my lifetime. I would certainly like to see that. I would like to see that we had international trade which meant countries did not have to fight and kick and scream for trading justice, although the last round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade talks means we will have to continue to think about that too. I would like to see a world free of dirty air and pollution. As somebody said in our debate in Caucus yesterday, it is important to recognise that boundaries on the ground do not stop missiles. They are the sorts of issues that we have to confront. </PARA>
<PARA> In this decision I think Australia actually does take its place in that world decision to oppose this act of aggression. I think it does draw credit to itself for its contribution. I believe Australia will have a continuing role in ongoing debates in the United Nations, I hope in regard to all the sorts of things I listed. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> I think this debate, which has now gone on for some 13 1/2 hours, is unique. It is unique to think that so many members and senators can rise to discuss the one motion with so many differing perspectives on the same subject matter. We have had perspectives from the Liberal Party from a range of senators and members with varying backgrounds, and from Labor Party members and senators. I am sure that when Senator Reynolds rises to her feet we will hear another perspective. We have heard varying perspectives from the Australian Democrats and from Senator Vallentine. I think that in this debate, be it from a pacifist point of view or from the point of view of former pacifists, from peace activists and from all the other perspectives, as my colleague Senator Crowley said, we find all valid points of view. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the sort of debate where we should enter into political point scoring. It is a debate where this chamber, and those members in the other place, would ideally seek as much unanimity as possible to show the greatest support for this motion. That is not to detract from the stance that has been taken by the Democrats or by Senator Vallentine or by anyone else who chooses to oppose this motion or who chooses to amend it. The point I am making is that it is a unique debate, and it is a debate to which I have listened with great interest. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there have been some sections of the debate which have detracted from it. I am sure that all of us would agree that the behaviour of some of the people in the gallery in the last couple of days has not helped the debate. The behaviour of Senator Vallentine in going across to the other place yesterday and in disrupting that place, using her privileges as an honourable senator to disrupt the proceedings of the House of Representatives--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was certainly, as Senator Knowles said, a disgrace to this Parliament, and brings no merit to Senator Vallentine who, I am sure, feels deeply in her heart about this issue, as I am sure we all do. But there are ways to represent those views without abusing the forums of this Parliament, as have many of her supporters. I think it is fair to say, having watched Senator Vallentine parade around this place in the last couple of days, that she has been personally involved in conspiring to disrupt this place by organising various protests in the galleries and outside, as she has done in the Western Australian Parliament previously where I was present one day when she was kicked out for disrupting that place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that it is necessary for any Australian citizen, be they a member of parliament or a citizen, to resort to the sorts of tactics we have seen here in the last couple of days to express what are very valid views. I think it does no good for the cause of the passionate people in the peace movement. There are plenty of opportunities in Australia these days to have one's views aired and made public, and to express those views without disrupting this place. This is, I guess, the greatest of all debating chambers and public forums where the views of the elected representatives of the people of Australia can be expressed. That is why we are here for this two-day sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also a great shame that some of the Democrat senators, particularly Senator McLean, and Senator Vallentine, have described some of the contributions made by the Government party and the coalition Opposition parties as `set piece speeches', to quote Senator Vallentine. They describe some members of the coalition and the Government as not being able to vote with their consciences, as their votes have been organised. It was Senator McLean who, only half an hour ago, accused my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Panizza, of saying that our Party would not allow him to vote with his conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those people on this side of the Senate know that we can vote with our conscience whenever we want to. It quite often happens. The Democrats will remember that it was not so long ago that a number of senators crossed the floor to vote in support of a Democrat amendment on a recent piece of legislation. I do not think that is a fair insult to be levelled--</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bell interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean did say it. It is not a fair insult to be levelled, particularly at this side of the House. Again, I guess that these are times when passions show through, and it is not unusual for a few gratuitous insults to be thrown around the chamber, but it is not helpful and I will certainly try to restrain myself during the debate this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A point which has been made time and time again-I guess, coming on to the speakers list after 25 or 30 other senators, with another 20 to go, most of the points have been made-which has angered me while I have been sitting quietly in my seat, is that so many of the Democrat senators and Senator Vallentine tend to have this self-righteous approach, this so-called mortgage or monopoly on the virtue of trying to stop war and being in favour of peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I really would ask the Democrats and Senator Vallentine to try to search their consciences-to search their morals-to try to understand where some of their Senate colleagues are really coming from. One thing that has permeated the entire debate, and the entire period of time leading up to the start of hostilities in the Gulf, is that for all of us who represent people in this place it has been a time of some sombreness and some soberness. </PARA>
<PARA> I do feel for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); for Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; for Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence; and for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). They are the people at the forefront of these hard decisions. They feel these decisions personally. One can see the toll it takes on them physically, mentally and personally. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a degree of what I call sombreness and soberness which overcomes us all because we are here today and were here yesterday putting our names on the line, and supporting or opposing this course of action taken by the Government. The insult towards Labor senators and members, and coalition senators and members, that we are warmongers and not really in favour of peace-either by implication or by direct assertion-is not fair and certainly should not to be continued. </PARA>
<PARA> The mood of this sombreness and soberness, and the constructive broad ranging nature of this debate has, in part, been hurt by Senator Vallentine and her peace movement supporters. </PARA>

They use force, they use tactics, they use foul language, they use-as we saw up in the gallery here this afternoon-violence against the officers of this Parliament to get their message across. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine has the right and the opportunity to take part in this debate, and I would have thought that this is the sort of discussion, negotiation and intellectual approach to problem solving that she advocates, but Senator Vallentine has been in this chamber for less than two hours out of something like 14 hours of debate at this stage. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that Senator Vallentine does not care to come into this chamber and listen to this most important debate-the very issue for which she was elected to this chamber in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Her peace movement colleagues who have disrupted proceedings in these galleries, choose to come in when the television cameras are on at Question Time, or when Ministers are speaking, but they are not prepared to listen. They are happy to disrupt things, cause a stir and use violence and foul language to make their point to get on television in prime time, but they are not prepared to do what they suggest the world leaders should do, which is listen and talk and negotiate and try to understand some of the arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that in their interests, and in the interests of all Australians, all of us should try to reflect upon the position that this Government has taken, supported by the Opposition, opposed by the Democrats, in a sober and intellectual frame of mind. It is fair to say that the most warlike people in this country at the moment are the very people who have surrounded this building and filled these galleries in the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues I want to raise in the short time remaining for me is the effect of this war on young Australians. By virtue of my birth date I am a young Australian, and I have not really witnessed a war of this sort. I was still only in primary school when Vietnam was coming to a close. I know that Senator McMullan and many other senators on the other side, and even on this side, have showed their credentials as peace activists in their younger days-when they had more hair and were wearing bandannas and tie dyed t-shirts. They must have felt twinges of anxiety when they saw these people come into the galleries in the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA> I think back to my own past. At that stage I was at Ironside State School in Brisbane. The most I did as a peace activist was to draw a massive `Ban the bomb' sign on what was, and probably still is, a gravel oval there. I think I was suspended from Ironside State School for the afternoon for doing that. I also remember writing, to my mother's and father's horror, `Make love not war' on the side of my `port'-I think we called them in Queensland-long before I knew what making love was all about. I did not realise why my mother was so horrified. </PARA>
<PARA> My recollections of war, as for so many of my generation, the younger generation, have been formed through movies such as Apocalypse Now, Vietnam, Born on the Fourth of July and The Deer Hunter, which is very hard to get in video shops. My generation and other young Australians generally are no different from everyone else in this country, but I think the way that we approach war, the way that young Australians form views about war-and I refer to many generations of young Australians-will be formed during these trying and very sad days for Australia. They will be looking at the images coming across on the cable network virtually every minute and forming their views of war. They will be looking at the protesters around this Parliament at the moment and forming their views from their behaviour. Many of the people opposed to the Australian involvement in the war will come to the view that war and killing is bad and that peace is good. These are very similar views to the concept of motherhood and apple pie because they are easy concepts to grasp. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, we hope they are achievable. Many of us here today are grappling with the problem of whether war is good or peace is good. Clearly, peace is better than war, and I guess it is a bit of a contradiction to have to make war to make peace and very hard for younger people to understand and for any of us to come to grips with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One good thing to come out of this debate is that so many young Australians will be concerning themselves with these very hefty issues of war and peace. I think it is good because for many years I have been asking for young Australians to be far more interested in the way we are governed-not only on issues such as war and peace or global environmental problems but also as to how we are governed generally. Many of us around this place are concerned at the moment about the level of involvement in politics by the population. Many articles have been written about the level of political party membership in Australia having fallen to disgracefully low levels. I guess this very hefty, important debate today, in so far as it involves young Australians in thinking about the global issues, can do some good in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge those young Australians not simply to take on the slogans of the peace movement nor the slogans of President Bush or the slogans taken on by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or our Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I say to young Australians: listen to the rhetoric, but question it. Do not believe the rhetoric of either Senator Vallentine or Senator Robert Ray. Challenge their thoughts, ideas and prejudices, as Senator Tate has done, I think more than most senators have done, in what I thought was a very moving speech yesterday. Senator Tate in putting his argument tried to come to grips with why, in some circumstances, a nation or a person has to use lethal force to try to stop a foe. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have come to the conclusion that, whereas I may resist, I hope, the urge to kill an assailant or an aggressor who is attacking me personally, when I hear the plea of the innocent, vulnerable and the especially weak I realise that I must stand between that person and the aggressor. But, further, with the greatest sadness if one has to kill the assailant or the aggressor, having exhausted every type of negotiation and diplomacy then I believe that is where we must stand as a nation in concert with other nations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a tremendous analogy which young Australians should pay great heed to. It cuts across a lot of the rhetoric of both the hawks and the doves in this debate. As I said earlier in this address tonight, I invite the people in the galleries, the people in the peace movement generally, and all young Australians, to not just pay heed to the one-minute grabs on the radio and television stations but to listen to all of the arguments put in this debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other influences on young people in Australia and worldwide is, of course, the culture of the rock and roll era, which has taken over since the 1960s. Particularly, my rock idols of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Neil Young and Bob Dylan, are both still going strong today. But now I guess we have far more rock bands. We have people such as Midnight Oil and so forth in Australia who raise the consciousness of younger generations about political problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some of the thoughts of Neil Young, a great rock-folk musician, who in the 1960s wrote a song entitled `Ohio', which described and painted in lyrical terms a very devastating and chilling picture of the Kent State peace rally killings. Neil Young affects the views of many young people right across the globe. It is fair to say that in the 1960s and 1970s he was a legend. I am sure that Senator McMullan would have many of Neil's records in his collection. After going to a Neil Young concert in 1985-I went again last year because I am a great fan of Mr Young's-I was surprised that, in an interview he did with Mr Richard Guilliatt from the Melbourne Age and reported in the West Australian on 8 March 1984, Neil Young came through with some very strident views in favour of a free enterprise society and what we would call in cliches `the American way' and, indeed, against the ideals of the peace movement and generally in favour of the concepts of peace through security or nuclear deterrence. I quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA> Freedom-the catch-cry of the 1960s ethos-is a word he--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Neil Young-</PARA>
<PARA>uses now to explain why he won't be involved in the peace movement.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote Neil Young:</PARA>
<PARA> I just feel that the free system had made it possible to do what I am doing . . . that's how I view it today with all of the feeling about nuclear war and power through idealistic demonstrations. </PARA>
<PARA> Idealistically I wish there were no weapons in the world (but) I think there is another side, and another way of thinking, and it's aggressive, as it is in Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA> I think you have to watch the other guy, because he's playing hard ball. </PARA>
<PARA>That is really what Senator Schacht said earlier today: idealistically we would all like peace and would like there to be no weapons, but there are other guys out there, as Neil Young calls them, and they are playing hard ball. We have to decide sooner or later how we will go out onto that ball park. Will we lay down arms or will we play hard ball back? Neil Young sums up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I mean I think war is wrong and I think killing is wrong, but I think survival of a free society is right. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are talking about here tonight. I was going to go on to discuss some of the arguments of the peace movement. Because time is short and many other senators want to make contributions tonight, I will sum up simply by saying that the arguments put, the slogans and some of the dishonest claims made by the peace movement, which I have asked Australians, and young Australians in particular, to challenge-the slogan of `blood for oil'; the comparisons with Panama, Grenada and East Timor; the need for further negotiations; and the use of sanctions-have all been debunked. </PARA>
<PARA> One claim which needs to be refuted has not been refuted adequately. The comparisons with Panama, Grenada and East Timor have been refuted a number of times. That has not stopped our Democrat colleagues from regurgitating them, but that is their right, which I admit. A number of honourable senators have quoted the figures provided by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on the effects of the sanctions. It has not been stated in the debate so far, but Stephen Solarz, a Democrat from New York and a House of Representatives member, in a 12 January debate in the United States Congress, when talking about Judge Webster, the head of the CIA, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Judge Webster, the head of the CIA, does not believe the sanctions will be sufficient to get Iraq out of Kuwait. Nor do the British, nor the French, nor the Egyptians, nor the Saudis. Not one of our coalition partners believes that sanctions will be sufficient to get Iraq out of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is clear that one could quote all the CIA figures on the effect of the sanctions, but the head of the CIA himself knows that no matter what the effects are, they will not be effective. I quote Representative Stephen Solarz further:</PARA>
<PARA> The reason they do not believe sanctions will be sufficient is because they know that Saddam Hussein does not give a whit for the welfare of his own people. All he cares about is the maximization of his own power. However great the economic impact of the sanctions may be, they know, as we know, that Saddam Hussein does not have to run for reelection in 1992. He does not have to worry about a contentious Congress or a critical press. He will hunker down. He will wait. And while he waits, there is a very real possibility that this inherently fractious and fragile coalition will begin to unravel, and the sanctions will erode, and he will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I am pleased to support this motion. I am pleased with the broad bipartisan support that this motion has drawn. I think we must all hope and pray for the safety of our armed service men and women in the Gulf and the medical team on the USS Comfort. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. I respect the views put forward by the honourable senators opposing and seeking to amend this resolution but I call upon them to be very careful in the tactics they use when showing their opposition. Some of the tactics, particularly the Democrat tactic of moving the motion about conscription, could be construed as political point scoring at a time when it is not necessary. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the motion before the Parliament tonight, I would like to make my position absolutely clear. Firstly, I wholeheartedly endorse support for the United Nations (UN) in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations. I support the Australian forces already serving in the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I deplore Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack on Israel and its gross breaches of international obligations in the treatment of prisoners of war. I certainly believe adamantly in the need to intensify efforts to bring peace and stability to the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel. However, I am opposed to a war as a means of resolving international conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not a new position for me. Senator Campbell indicated that he was still at school when the Vietnam conflict erupted. In those days I was a very apolitical young woman, I am sorry to say, and that, I believe, was responsible for my politicisation. All I can say in regard to Senator Campbell's comments about young people is that for many years in this place we have been concerned about the apathy of young people. Young people do not have any faith in the system. They not believe in getting involved in politics and they do not trust the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> If young people are prepared to make a commitment to the fight for peace-and there I have used a word I should not have in regard to peace, I suppose-if they are prepared to work for peace and join political parties to ensure that we find other methods, I believe that something will have come out of the debate in the Australian community at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since August, I have had strong reservations about Australia sending ships to the Gulf. But like many people, I rationalised this decision because I hoped that the United Nations' sanctions, supported around the world, would bring about a negotiated settlement and withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> In December, with eight senior Queensland Australian Labor Party (ALP) members, including the President, Ian McLean, I made a public call for mediation in the Gulf crisis to address the following issues: withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait; demilitarisation of the Middle East region and replacement of a UN peacekeeping force; negotiated rights of passage for Iraq; democratisation of Kuwait; world oil pricing which does not favour wealthy nations' monopoly of this resource; and a peace conference to require negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now opposed to Australia changing its role from enforcement of sanctions to military support for attack. I believe that sanctions could ultimately have brought about a negotiated settlement of this crisis. I accept the UN resolution which allowed `necessary force'. We could debate what we mean by `necessary force'. It is this aspect of the debate where differences of opinion arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone in this Parliament wants peace but we disagree on the means to ensure it. I do not believe that a new international order can be enforced militarily. If we are to have a new international world order, we have to be able to find a way to resolve conflict. What a horrendous precedent this establishes if every time there is a dispute between nations we automatically assume that the only way to resolve it is through force and through bombing a nation into submission.</PARA>
<PARA> I am firmly convinced that sanctions should have been pursued despite the absolute intransigence of Saddam Hussein. There is evidence that sanctions had started to impact severely on Iraq's economy and its opportunity to continue to build its horrific array of weaponry. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that a number of people from both sides have quoted material in this debate but I would like to take the time of the Senate to quote from three sources, one Australian, one American and one British. The head of the Peace Research Centre, Andrew Mack, said in an article in the Canberra Times of 1 November 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The war camp is almost certainly wrong about sanctions too. While sanctions regimes have failed more often than not in the past, UN-mandated sanctions against Iraq are the exception which will prove the rule. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq is unique among states which have had sanctions applied to them. Ninety-five percent of Iraqi export revenues come from a single commodity. </PARA>
<PARA> Sanctions are having their most important effect on the technical infrastructure of Iraq-on power stations, hydroelectric stations, communications . . . , transportation . . . and factories. All these systems are dependent on spare parts which can no longer be imported. Sanctions also mean that the military capability of Iraq is slowly deteriorating as spare parts run out. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Macdonald" NAMEID="YW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator Macdonald</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It never worked in South Africa, though.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We gave South Africa much longer, as I think Senator Macdonald will agree. My second quote is from Paul Nitze, a special adviser on arms to the Reagan Administration, who put his support for sanctions in a recent article called `War, Whether Its Needed or Not?' in the Washington Post. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, successful sanctions would be most likely to produce a stable world order. Critical to this outcome is that a substantially lower level of violence would be more likely to result in continued public support for an active U.S. international role. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, this option would likely be less disruptive to regional stability. But any approach that left much of Iraq's military capability intact would produce a need to retain a peacekeeping force on the front lines, either in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, and perhaps elsewhere. While internal destabilisation in other countries of the region would remain a concern, this threat would be lower than that produced by all-out war, especially if the peacekeeping force were primarily Arab.''</PARA>
<PARA>In the Guardian Weekly, Paul Wilkinson, Director of the Research Institute for the Study of Conflict and Terrorism, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> A combination of sanctions continuing containment and deterrence along with the construction of an effective Arab regional security system will provide an effective long haul method of obtaining the objectives of the international community as expressed in the U.N. Security Council resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that this strategy requires patience and stamina-</PARA>
<PARA>patience and stamina; I am not sure whether patience and stamina are something that many of the world leaders making decisions in relation to this crisis are prepared to offer-</PARA>
<PARA>and arguably greater moral courage than the easy policy of reducing Iraq to rubble. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators may not agree with his assessment, but the point that I agree with is the strategy requiring patience and stamina. Surely, patience and stamina are worth it when we are looking at human life. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Much has been made by the proponents of war about maintaining the authority of the United Nations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We all are absolutely committed to the United Nations. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it really going to do anything for the U.N.'s moral authority and leadership if the Security Council is seen to condone war in which possibly hundreds of thousands of innocent Arab civilians are injured and killed?</PARA>
<PARA> Paul Wilkinson goes on to say that the UN Security Council must be aware of its moral responsibilities to the international community as a whole and asks how it can possibly approve an immediate resort to a war of mass destruction when we have not given sufficient time for sanctions and diplomatic pressure which might yet achieve the UN's objectives without the tragic loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Scientists have warned of the horrendous environmental consequences in the Gulf war. Even the most conservative estimates from Basil Butler, one of British Petroleum's four managing directors, said that 300 to 400 wells could burn out of control for up to nine months after the war ended. He does not say how long he thinks the war could last. A worst case scenario would be fires burning for five years, triggering a nuclear winter disaster and causing the failure of the Asian monsoons which would destroy harvests on which over one thousand million people rely. </PARA>
<PARA> An engineer with experience in the Gulf oil industry said:</PARA>
<PARA>No surgical military strike against Iraq can possibly prevent the Kuwaiti installations being mined, exploded and fires taking place. </PARA>
<PARA>A huge increase in acid rain is predicted, having a wide spread effect on Middle East food supplies. In Australia I call, as several of my colleagues have done tonight, for tolerance in what is already a very divisive debate and the longer the war continues the more divisive it will be. As members of a multicultural nation, we all want the Gulf war brought to an end. No single individual has a monopoly on peace. I think it is important that we acknowledge that to each other because different people will be making different stands. Some of us will be involved in the peace movement and others will be condemning the peace movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, I do not believe there is anyone in this Parliament or anyone in Australia who does not want to see the end to this horrific war. The important thing is to recognise that our differences are based on how we see that the war can be stopped. Some of us have the view that we can solve conflict militarily. Others of us believe there have to be other ways and it is time for genuine conflict resolution and more creative ways to be found. </PARA>
<PARA> We are unified in wanting to see an end to the horrific scenes shown nightly on our television screens, but we disagree on how to halt quickly that military conflict. A group of women opposed to war in the Gulf sent me this message today which I think highlights the need for peaceful resolution. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that only through recognising our common needs and seeking to explore ways of settling our differences can we live in peace. We know that conflict will always exist between individuals and between nations but believe that we can work to minimise this and to find creative solutions which do not involve death and violence. War is neither natural or necessary but an archaic and dangerous way of solving disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I do not want to be accused in what is a very serious debate of throwaway lines and sexism, I think it would be irresponsible of me not to point out that it is women and children who are bearing a considerable brunt of this horrendous war. When we know the absolute terror that those women and children must face while men on the other side of the world are making decisions, it is only honest to say that men have to seriously question why we believe that a military option is the only way out. </PARA>

<PARA> It is my view that even in the midst of this terrible crisis it is still possible for the United Nations to negotiate a cease-fire conditional on the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait but enabling independent assessment of border issues by a UN commission to be set up by the Security Council and the establishment of an international conference to address the need for a Palestinian homeland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time is running out for this debate in many respects but there are some things many of us still want to say. I am glad to see that Senator Vallentine has come into the chamber this evening because it enables me to refer to one of the things she said last night when she accused those whose views differed from hers as, I think she said, lacking sincerity, and that their speeches were set piece speeches. I was very disappointed at this. I thought it was ungracious and unworthy and not a very tolerant approach to this debate, which is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is necessary for all of us to recognise that there are people with different views on how to solve the problem of the inexcusable attack on Kuwait and of the inhumane way it was done. No leader, no nation, no politician or parliament commits its sons and daughters to war lightly, but there are times I believe when there is no choice but to pursue the matter in the way it has been done in this instance. No nation can be safe unless it knows that others will come to its aid in these sorts of circumstances. I quote from Cicero who 2,000 years ago said, `The only excuse for war is that we may live in peace unharmed'. I thought it better perhaps in the English than in the Latin version. </PARA>
<PARA> Colleagues have pointed out tonight-I shall not go over a lot of the history and many of the things that have been said-that the conflict did not begin on 17 January this year, but on 2 August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Where were the demonstrators then? I live not far from the Iraqi Embassy. I did not see them there when there were unspeakable atrocities going on in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps it was inevitable that this would occur eventually. As early as 1961 Iraq had been threatening to take over Kuwait. But whatever reason Saddam Hussein had for doing it-and many reasons have been advanced-I think that is somewhat irrelevant when one looks at the documented brutality in the report of Amnesty International that has been mentioned here today by several honourable senators; it speaks of the brutality with which his army invaded and took over Kuwait. The same sort of brutality in a different way has been exhibited towards the hostages, the pilots, and prior to this we know what happened to the Kurds in his own country. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, as again last night, the environmental damage was referred to from oil fires being set, the oil wells of Kuwait being mentioned. My question then is: Who would set them alight? I think we all know who would set them alight if it suited his purpose. It was an unprovoked and brutal act of aggression on a sovereign nation and we should pledge ourselves not to let the strong do this to the weak. We should be a participant in the force which is seeking to free Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman quoted from the then Field Marshal William Slim who said, `Only those deserve freedom who are prepared to defend it'. I think that also should apply to us. There has been universal condemnation. Something has been attempted to be made of the fact that 28 nations are taking part in the allied forces. I think that is an enormous number. There are many other nations which would like to be taking part which do not have the resources to be there but support what the United Nations is doing and the 12 resolutions that have been passed. I am enormously impressed that there are 28 nations working together in this force. I do not see it as something to say that there are only 28 nations, as some would seek to do. </PARA>
<PARA> They also seek to say that the sanctions were working and seek to give examples that they are or were. In some instances sanctions may have been cutting back in places but not in ways that were significantly bringing Iraq to see that it had to withdraw from Kuwait. There was no way of enforcing sanctions that were going to hurt Iraq so that it would bring it to this position, and that was very clear. The dictator of Kuwait used the sanctions to strengthen his position there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats in their amendment say that they want the naval presence withdrawn. There would be even less opportunity to support sanctions if that were to be the case. The fact is that the sanctions were not working. While I concede that they may have been hurting some parts of the Iraqi economy, there was no sign of them working in a way which was going to bring such discomfort as to cause Iraq to withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his speech, and others, have outlined the important issues from Australia's point of view. I shall not take the time of the Senate to repeat that here tonight, but there are a couple of areas that I wish to refer to. One of them is the coverage of this war by the media. There is no doubt that it is different from ever before. When we look at the way that technology and satellites are able to bring it to us, we realise that we have not seen anything like it. It is the first time any war has been covered so intensely, so immediately, so intimately with the live coverage that we have had. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one would deny that it is essential in any democracy that there be free access to all the relevant information and we be as accurately informed as possible. For the most part, I believe the media has accepted its role of reporting responsibly on what has been going on. There have been some cases where the reporting has strayed from the simple provision of information to becoming something almost like a sporting commentary. I felt quite sickened at some of the things I have seen and heard on television; I have not appreciated the way in which it has been presented. Perhaps I am alone in that, but I feel I should express my views about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian reported yesterday, 21 January, `The Gulf war has become a blur of briefings and repeated television footage spinning further away from any perspective with each passing day'. There was the same day a very graphic cartoon in the Canberra Times which likened the presentation to that of a sporting event. One of the Sunday papers commented that the report on the Gulf war was interrupted by a race broadcast at the conclusion of which the television station commented, `And now, back to the war'. Perhaps it was not intended quite that way but it was said in that way. It has helped to create an unreal environment of something very horrible which is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset we have seen the first shots of the war, live eyewitness accounts, updates, unconfirmed reports-too many of them-human interest stories, and replay after replay. There is the technology to do this. Many people though, I think, have found some of it distasteful, the likening of it to a sporting event. We seem to be filled with commentators providing the innermost thoughts and workings as though every player were there on a cricket field and the participants were presumed to be doing this and doing that, with the expert commentaries, the guesses, and the speculations. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that proper and independent information should be available to all the democracies participating in the action, but I do protest at this grand final approach. The Canberra Times editorial this morning asks, `Is it not better to verge on voyeurism than on ignorance?' I do not believe that it is a black and white choice between accuracy and immediacy, between sensitivity or news at all costs, between voyeurism or ignorance. I suggest that the modern media has an increased duty precisely because of the technology available to them to report responsibly and with accuracy. The difficulty, as the same editorial in the Canberra Times points out, is that the Gulf war so far has been largely electronic, somewhat remote, and to an extent bodyless even though so immediate. `Bodyless' was the word the Canberra Times used, and we all know that war is not bodyless; it is a bit like a video game. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting control of the press or anything like that. I am not suggesting censorship. Freedom is one of the things that this war is being fought over. My concern is that we do not lose sight of or be insensitive to the real and crushing human suffering, the fear and the anguish, the injury and the loss that is involved in the war and in the way it is presented to us.</PARA>
<PARA> I should like also to comment that I have been very disappointed indeed with our own Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) coverage. It seems to me to have been very insensitive. I cite as an example the story which I think the ABC ran three times, that one of the Australian ships had crashed, which was not the case. Should the ABC not have checked with the Navy to see whether that was correct before it ran such a story? The ABC seems to me to have presented a very pro-Hussein coverage of this event, giving him very good coverage and exposure in a way that I do not believe was good reporting. War is a tragedy and should be presented in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to have been a remote control war with the horrors of it kept somewhat at a distance-a war where bombs are fired by computers and missiles are fired from afar, but every time a Scud or a Tomahawk missile falls to earth it may destroy one, a hundred or many more people. In the broader scheme of things it does not matter whether the people who are killed or maimed are Iraqi women and children, elite soldiers, US troops or Israeli children. No matter how one examines it, war is a tragedy of unmeasurable proportions, a triumph of force over reason. But we have then to think back to what we are dealing with, to this man who inhumanely took over Kuwait, having done some of the other things that we know he is capable of doing. We must also not forget our serving personnel or their families in this time of tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the few positive things that have come out of the situation is the bipartisanship that has marked the Australian response to the Gulf crisis. Not only has it enabled Australia to act decisively and confidently within the international community but also, and even more importantly, this national unity has sent a clear and vital message to our serving men and women and their families that they have the support and prayers of their nation with them. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been demonstrations by, I think, a small minority who are against the war no matter what. I find it strange that they seem to think that they have a lien on a desire for peace. I too have a very strong desire for peace. I regard their actions as giving succour to a man who is a murderer; a man who would crush Kuwait at any cost. As I said earlier, why were they not demonstrating against him from 2 August to 17 January? Why were not they outside the Iraqi Embassy in the same numbers that they are now prepared to go out into the streets and condemn the United States, who are part of the United Nations network in this activity?</PARA>
<PARA> Why were they not outside the embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on 14 January when I was there with people from Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia protesting the crushing at that time of Lithuania and since, of course, of Latvia? I knew the people who were there. They were Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and their friends that I have seen previously outside the same embassy of the USSR. The other protesters were not there, and I ask them why they were not there. Why are they not prepared to demonstrate against those who killed and shot at the Kuwaitis? Do they not appreciate how lucky they are to live in a free country where they can express their opinion without fear of being silenced or shot at and killed, as their counterparts in Kuwait were?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian nation does not want this war. I think that is obvious. Similarly, there is no doubt that Australians are anxious and worried about the war. However, there is no doubt that by far the majority of Australians recognise our responsibility as part of the international community; that they support the men and women who are fighting for us and representing us and the allied forces; and that they recognise the role of the families of those who remain at home while the men of their family are away. We think, of course, about the innocent victims of this war. But a man like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to crush Kuwait and behave as he has. No small country is safe if he is allowed to get away with this. </PARA>

They are speeches which will be quoted and requoted over many years, probably for generations to come. Hopefully this war will not last too long but, if this conflict that we as a nation are currently involved in continues or even escalates, we could be faced with a Third World war in this the twentieth century. It is something that we must endeavour to do everything possible to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said many times in the debate in both chambers that there are no winners in war but many losers. The losers are children, women and, of course, men. It has also been said, and I say this as an aside, that wars are run by men. Well, it was only in the last decade on the other side of the world that a certain female leader found that she could do it equally as badly as any man. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an easy debate for anybody to take part in and I do not believe that any member of either House of this Parliament really wanted to take part in it. It is certainly not an easy debate for a member of the peace movement to take part in. I am and will continue to be a member of the peace movement of Australia. The peace movement of Australia is not a homogeneous organisation made up of single entities with one common ideal. There are disparate groups in that movement, as I well know because of my involvement, because of my assistance to the movement in my current occupation and because of my previous assistance and my association with members of the movement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, as I said, very large and widespread interest groups represented in the peace movement. In all of the peace demonstrations that I have taken part in in this country since I arrived 21 years ago, a very high level of anti-United States feeling has been projected. That is justifiably so, because the United States of America has been no saint in international fora. It has been an aggressor. It has gone in and taken over smaller nations, and it has sought to justify its actions in the past. I am not certain that that is the case in the current conflict that we are involved in, but unfortunately-and I admit that I have not taken part in any of the current demonstrations-it would appear from the media coverage of the various demonstrations right around Australia that there are only two nations involved: Australia and the United States. The Australian Government is getting bagged and the United States Government is getting bagged, when there are 28 nations taking part in the allied forces. But the aspect that grieves me the most is the distinct absence of condemnation of Iraq. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I apologise and I withdraw the words, even though it has not been asked of me. Perhaps my language was a little bit strong. I withdraw that. I was making the statement that the lack of condemnation of Iraq has been very absent from the banners and slogans that I have witnessed. Maybe that is a fault of the media, and I make no accusations about that. But maybe it is also very well organised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the peace movement is a very disparate movement. It includes all sorts of people. And they are not all pacifists, as indeed we have witnessed in this very chamber in the last two days. We witnessed it in respect of two interjections yesterday. The first was, `We should kill members of the Labor Party.' The second interjection was, `Kill the members of the Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> We witnessed today an individual kicking the attendants. I think that the attendants have worked in this place under very difficult circumstances in the past couple of days and they ought to be commended. I take my hat off to them for the restraint that they have exercised under provocation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am against war. I do not want this war to continue. I want it stopped tomorrow. I particularly want it stopped before a ground assault starts. When a ground assault really gets going, that is when we are going to see the carnage-carnage not only of the troops that will be involved but also of all of the innocent civilians in the surrounding and immediate districts. It will run into thousands as all the military experts, usually with American accents, have told us over the past months. I do not want that to happen and I would like to see it stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> But I am not willing to fold my arms, stand back and let Saddam Hussein and his forces exercise the brutality, the killing, the maiming and the raping of the people of Kuwait-innocent individuals who have been forcibly occupied and taken over. I think as Australians we cannot afford to allow that to continue, so we have to take some stand. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said on many occasions that perhaps we should have given sanctions more time to work. I really do wish that we had the liberty to do that. But we witnessed and knew when we were debating this issue in December of last year that, really, the sanctions were not working and it required something else. At that point in time I was very hopeful that the threat of international action would avert the threat of war. Unfortunately, it did not.</PARA>
<PARA> In that period of 5 1/2 months since that naked, innocent nation was forcibly taken over by its neighbour, that dictator has entrenched himself. He has not suffered from the sanctions, although maybe the people of Iraq have. He fortified Kuwait and he has taken steps to make certain that it is the nineteenth province of Iraq. The longer we continued with the sanctions, the stronger it seemed, militarily, Saddam and his Government became. Of course, the stronger he became, the harder it was going to be to remove him. </PARA>
<PARA> I honestly do not know the answers. I have been searching, not only as an individual, a human being, but also as a member of parliament, for the answers to this situation that we are in at the moment. And I have got no way out. The war has not gone away because we wished it to go away. Indeed, we all wished it to go away. Large sections of the population prayed for it to go away and it has not gone away. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we do? Do we fold our arms and let the aggression continue? There are times when we can do that no more. We have to stop it. We have to take action to ensure it stops, because if we do not, what nation will be next? Remember that the next time around Iraq, which will then incorporate Kuwait, will be that much stronger because of what it has taken over in terms of oil. The next threat on the horizon was said to be Saudi Arabia-maybe it was; maybe it was not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President and members of the Senate, as a member of the peace movement, I am not prepared to take that risk. I am not prepared to have to live with my conscience 20 years down the track or have my children live with the conscience like others had to do when they did not stop Hitler in time. We had to act. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want the responsibility, as a member of parliament, of bringing this nation into war. I do not want that responsibility as a parent of children, and the parent of one particular child who is now 22 years old and who would be of the conscription age if we had conscription. I honestly cannot say anything too kindly about the Democrats and the scare tactics they have put in the minds of young people in Australia over this particular issue. </PARA>

That is another matter which, unfortunately, causes me great distress because, as people would know, there are some different points of view on this issue. That is not something that I condemn. I welcome the different points of view. Those different points of view have strengthened the great Australian Labor Party over the close on 100 years of its existence. We have spanned the globe in terms of our points of view. It is something that I welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not welcome the fact that some of my colleagues, some of my friends, may not be voting with me in support of a Government motion that is before both Houses. However, I respect their right to do it and I respect the right that they have in this very important and very serious debate to exercise their views. I would make a plea for people within the Party not only to respect the views of those individuals whom I have just mentioned but not named, but also all of the views of people within the Party and from all sides of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The television coverage of this war has been mentioned. I cannot say too much about that. After watching the television earlier last Thursday in a state of some shock, I was virtually glued to the television set for the rest of the day. Such was my disgust that I have watched very little television since then. The disgust sank in only after a period. Since then I have tuned into radio. When people make noises about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation they should not in their condemnation include the coverage of ABC radio because I find that to be very informative and factual. I do not think that it is biased in any way. However, as a person deeply involved and interested in this issue, I confess to having bias. Therefore, it is easy for me to allege that bias has occurred in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gone on much longer than I had intended to. I had intended to say something about the efforts made by people to bring about a peaceful resolution to this conflict. I do not want to go into each and every one of them at this stage. In many of the fine speeches we have heard to date they have been put on the record. However, I refer to one in particular-that is, the last speech by the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Perez de Cuellar, on 15 January 1991. Rather than delaying the Senate further, I will seek leave at a later time to incorporate that speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Before sitting down I make a final comment in regard to my Party-the Australian Labor Party; the Party that I am proud to belong to. Resolution 10 of our foreign affairs platform states that we, the Australian Labor Party, take an active part in the United Nations and its agencies and will work towards improving the United Nations as an effective instrument of peace, justice, security, human rights, decolonisation, and cultural and technical exchange. I will not read the rest of the section: it is out in the open. </PARA>
<PARA> We have finally reached the stage where many members of the Labor Party and the Australian community believe that the United Nations is finally fulfilling the role that it was created for. Those of us in the left wing of the Labor Party have carried many motions calling for the United Nations to be more proactive in international disputes and we have been very disappointed in the past. I am very disappointed now that on the death knock, the eleventh hour-when we can show that we can take action to perhaps stop the actions of somebody that history may judge to be worse than Hitler was-the United Nations might be nullified in its steps. I hope that it continues. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this conflict concludes very shortly and that it does not reach a ground assault stage. I certainly hope that those Australians who are currently serving on our three ships in the area return to their loved ones in Australia without any harm coming to them. I hope that there will be no more killing in the region of anybody, be they allied forces or Iraqi forces. I seek leave to incorporate the statement to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Statement by the Secretary-General on 15 January 1991</PARA>
<PARA>As 15 January advances, and the world stands poised between peace and war, I most sincerely appeal to President Saddam Hussein to turn the course of events away from catastrophe and towards a new era of justice and harmony based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. </PARA>
<PARA>All of our efforts in this direction will fall unless Iraq can signify its readiness to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, beginning with resolution 660. </PARA>
<PARA>If this commitment is made, and clear and substantial steps taken to implement these resolutions, a just peace, with all of the benefits, will follow. I therefore urge President Saddam Hussein to commence, without delay, the total withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>Once this process is well underway, I wish to assure him, on the basis of understandings that I have received from governments at the highest level, that neither Iraq nor its forces will be attacked by those arrayed in the international coalition against his country. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, with the commencement of withdrawal, as Secretary-General of the United Nations, I would, with the consent of the parties concerned, and the agreement of the Security Council, be prepared immediately to deploy United Nations observers and, if necessary, United Nations forces to certify the withdrawal and to ensure that hostilities do not erupt on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, with compliance of the resolutions, I would urge the Security Council to review its decisions imposing sanctions against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also encourage a process whereby foreign forces deployed in the area would be phased out. </PARA>
<PARA>Peace in the region requires that all of its problems be resolved justly and equitably, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>I have every assurance, once again from the highest levels of government, that with the resolution of the present crisis, every effort will be made to address, in a comprehensive manner, the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the Palestinian question. I pledge my every effort to this end. </PARA>
<PARA>As I stated to the Council last night, all of us are aware of the extreme gravity of the decisions to be made in the period ahead. No-one and no nation can-except with a heavy heart-resort to the other ``necessary means'' implied by resolution 678, knowing in advance that tragic and unpredictable consequences can follow. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust, in the circumstances, that wisdom and statesmanship will prevail in all quarters in order to move decisively away from conflict. In appealing to President Saddam Hussein today, I wish him to know that I will readily devote my every capacity to working with him, and with all others concerned, to this end. </PARA>
<PARA>In the tenth and final year of my tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations, no cause would give me greater satisfaction than to set the Middle East as a whole on the road to just and lasting peace. And no disappointment would be greater and more tragic than to find the nations of the world engaging in a conflict that none of their peoples want. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in favour of the motion. I have listened to a variety of speeches, including the impassioned speech by Senator McKiernan, and also have watched and heard hysterical behaviour both on the floor of this chamber and in the galleries above. I am drawn to the conclusion that there are similarities to be drawn between the attitude of Senator Powell and the Australian Democrats, and, shall I say, Senator Vallentine playing Little Miss Echo, and the attitude of Neville Chamberlain who was described by Professor Fuchser in his book Neville Chamberlain and Appeasement as a weak and ineffectual old man, feebly waving his umbrella promising `peace in our time' while the Wehrmacht marched into the Rhineland, Austria and Czechoslovakia. I find the comparison irresistible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Chamberlain was obsessed with World War I and not repeating it, but he failed to distinguish-and indeed was unable to distinguish-between the circumstances and the nature of the events leading to each conflict and indeed the very nature of the dictator who was determined to conquer. This is analogous to the latter-day appeasers-the Democrats and others on the left who are obsessed with Vietnam and are likewise unable to distinguish between the events surrounding the Vietnam war and the conflict now under way in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> The rhetoric of Senators Powell, Coulter, et al is all about the destruction that war causes. Never once do they address the question of the price that has to be paid for appeasement or avoiding that conflict. To say that they are simplistic or naive is to be kind. To say that they are obsessive and fearful is more realistic. To say that they are prepared to give a piece of this country and a piece of that country to buy a quiet life, which for them is peace, is more accurate as it is to call them the appeasers. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, Professor Fuchser wrote of Chamberlain that he believed that the alternative to coming to terms with Hitler would be another world war, infinitely more devastating than the last, and therefore almost any act of political accommodation was fully justified-not only justified but also the only conceivable course of moral action. Did that ring a bell in the speech that we heard today from Senator Coulter?</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Fuchser also wrote that Chamberlain did not sign an agreement which meant the end of Czechoslovak sovereignty because he wanted to buy time or because he felt Britain was too weak militarily to do otherwise, but because he believed that the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia was the price that had to be paid if another world war was to be avoided. Is Kuwait the price to be paid this time? Is that the price that the Democrats demand?</PARA>
<PARA> Neville Chamberlain was the arch promoter of the policy of appeasement in the 1930s. The Democrats and their ilk are the arch promoters in the 1990s. Let us look at some of the quotes of the 1930s and then at some of those of the 1990s. In July 1937, Neville Chamberlain said:</PARA>
<PARA> If only we could sit down at a table with the Germans and run through all their complaints and claims with a pencil, this would greatly relieve all tension. </PARA>
<PARA> How many speeches and pleas have we heard over here to say, `Stop the war and let us sit down and talk.'? On 27 September 1938 Neville Chamberlain said in a radio broadcast:</PARA>
<PARA>How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that a statement worthy of Senator Vallentine, perhaps? No, it was Neville Chamberlain speaking about the German annexation of the Sudetenland. On 28 September Neville Chamberlain wrote to Adolf Hitler:</PARA>
<PARA>I am ready to come to Berlin myself at once to discuss arrangements for transfer with you and representations of the Czechoslovak Government together with representations of France and Italy if you so desire. I feel convinced we could reach an agreement in a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, on 28 September 1938 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no honourable member of this House who did not feel his heart leap that the crisis had been once more postponed to give us once more an opportunity to try what reason and good will and discussion will do to settle a problem which is already within sight of settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>He signed the Munich Agreement on 30 September. On 3 October Neville Chamberlain further said:</PARA>
<PARA>Ever since I assumed my present office my main purpose has been to work for the removal of those suspicions and animosities which have so long poisoned the air. The path which leads to appeasement is long and bristles with obstacles.</PARA>
<PARA>On 3 September 1939 war was declared. There were opportunities during all the period that that policy of appeasement was pursued to prevent or curtail the horrors that followed with World War II. The time that elapsed allowed Germany to build, to implement its guns before butter policy, to be able to fight a war that brought us near to defeat. The comparisons between the period from 1936 to 1939 are too vivid and too close for us not to learn from them. The plea and the cry that say we must not have war at any price overlook the fact that there is always a price to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the important facts which are on the record. Firstly, world leaders tried and strove to attain a just peace. The United Nations worked and implored Saddam Hussein to withdraw from his conquered lands. The United Nations showed this time that it was not like the League of Nations; it showed that it had the strength to act and to reinforce its decisions, and Australia, to its credit, chose to shoulder its share of the burden of responsibility by sending Australian forces to serve with the coalition force of nations assembled to achieve the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. I say that Australia-and I say it with pride-chose to shoulder its share of the burden because Australia is not a nation which says, `We want to have our voice heard, we want to be part of the world of nations, we want to be listened to when we speak about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, we want to be listened to when we think there is an injustice on a trade issue or when there are other international issues to be discussed', but then say, when the going gets really rough, `Sorry, I'm all right, Jack; it is not our bit of the territory so we are going to stay out and let the rest of the world carry our share of the burden'. Australians are not like that. But yesterday Senator Janet Powell said in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>It is of deep regret that only 4 per cent of the parliamentarians in this place are prepared to oppose the action taken by our Government and by the United States. That 4 per cent clearly represents at least a majority of Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>She is clearly having herself on. Australians are a brave and a courageous people who share the path of world responsibility to bring to an end the aggression, the torture, the occupation and the dismemberment of a small country. As I said before, it was Chamberlain who said, `Peace in our time'. Of course, he meant, a `p-i-e-c-e'-a piece of this country and a piece of that country-just as it would seem the Democrats are prepared to pay in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim that the continuation of sanctions alone will solve the problem is a statement of appeasement, and appeasement is no answer. The Australian Democrats bring no answers. To hear Senator Powell speak of Saddam Hussein and justice in the same breath underlines her total misunderstanding of the reality of the nature of Saddam Hussein. How can she misunderstand the nature of a man who would use chemical weapons on his own countrymen simply because they were guilty of being an ethnic minority, of being Kurds. Again, it is reminiscent of World War II when the Jews were persecuted simply because they were that-Jews. This is a man who has inflicted torture, rape and destruction on those whom he invaded. He is not a man who understands the concept of justice. He is a shrewd, calculating, committed enemy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell spoke of the right of Australians to dissent. It is a right I will defend, but there is no such right in Iraq, as many people have pointed out in this chamber already. We enjoy that right to dissent, the Democrats enjoy that right to dissent, and the people behind the glass enjoy that right to dissent, because it was the people of my parents' generation who fought to ensure that my generation and I should enjoy that freedom. The appeasers, be they in this chamber, in the public gallery or in the streets, are again like the 40,000 supporters of Neville Chamberlain who wrote effusively congratulating him upon the Munich Agreement. Among those who wrote congratulatory letters were leading academic, intellectual and political figures of their day-people who find their counterparts in this society today, people who have signed the `Do not commit Australia to war!' advertisement placed in the Australian on 11 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> A former Cabinet secretary of Chamberlain's day, one Maurice Hankey, wrote that he had never questioned that Chamberlain would find a way to avoid going to war with Germany. Is this the mirror image of the view of Iraq that is held by the latter day appeasers-Senator Childs from the Labor Left; Democrats Senator Vicki Bourne, Senator Janet Powell and Senator McLean; Labor Left members of parliament Frank Walker, Jeannette McHugh, Stewart West; and of course the ubiquitous Manning Clark and Professor Ted Wheelwright? Are these the same people who thought as the intellectuals and academics and politicians who congratulated Chamberlain upon his success at Munich?</PARA>

I find that the interjection is not one that surprises me because I have said that the people who are the appeasers of the 1990s are as obsessive about the conclusions they draw from the Vietnam war as Neville Chamberlain was about World War I. But the United Nations will not suffer the fate of the League of Nations. There has been the establishment of the coalition force of 28 nations, given the strong leadership of the United States, a nation that it has become fashionable to insult because it upholds the sorts of things that a very large proportion of the world believes in. Because that coalition force has been established the resolutions passed by the United Nations are going to be enforced and then we will see that the United Nations will not suffer that fate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, Australians are a courageous people. They are a courageous people who are not fearful of taking their share of international burdens. They will, indeed, tolerate the views of the dissenters-the noisy but small minority-but they will disavow the sort of people whom Chamberlain would have embraced as soul mates. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Government and Opposition leaders have commended our forces, and I mean the forces who are serving this nation, as distinct from the people whom Senator Powell-or, indeed, was it Senator Vallentine; they are like an echo of each other-chose to congratulate, and that is the international Gulf peace team. I would like to commend our forces who serve with courage and distinction but, more than just commend them, I would like to thank them. I would like to thank them for serving and for their commitment to achieving a just peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with others who pray that this war and this conflict will come to an early and successful conclusion, and we will see that the aggressor, the torturer, the man who seeks conquest above all, will not be able to enjoy what he believes are the fruits of his conquest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days the Australian media has carried video footage and print articles featuring rallies of what could be called the peace movement. By and large those who have attended these rallies, and those who have supported them, are genuine in the beliefs that they are expressing. In general, they have put forward two related proposals. Firstly, we should live in a world of peace and, in particular, Australia should not be a party to belligerent activity in the Middle East. Secondly, the proposal is that we should withdraw our naval contingent which is deployed in the Persian Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With a public debate of this nature there are certain to be some emotive words used, but most of those do little credit to those who have two opposing points of view. What we need in a situation like the one which faces us so starkly at the moment is clear, reasoned debate. Empty slogans are of no help. They may give protesters on both sides of the argument a great feeling, but an inner glow is not going to help the nation arrive at a considered conclusion to what has become a divisive national issue. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who supports Australia's involvement in the current conflict with Iraq-my reasons for which I shall outline later-I would stress to those who rally for peace, pray for peace and silently hope for peace, that an overwhelming desire for peace is not their sole preserve. I, too, if not all of those who support Australia's current military involvement, then at least the vast majority of them, have the same deep abiding desire for a peaceful world. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the conflict with Iraq we have the same wish to see a peaceful resolution to these hostilities. In other words, the population of Australia is not divided into two groups: those who advocate peace and those who do not. The difference is how we should attain that goal of peace for which we both strive. Those, like me, who believe that conflict is necessary in this particular case do so in the belief that it is the best way of bringing peace to this area of the world, and of maintaining peace in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is debating a motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). That motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations and in particular the Resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 678 for support in implementing that Resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces serving with the UN-sanctioned multi-national forces in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack upon Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to remind honourable senators that last week the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) noted that the decision to be involved in the Gulf was based on five special considerations. These are worth noting by those who are unsure of whether Australia should be militarily involved in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> The first consideration is that there is a fundamental principle without which there can be neither peace nor freedom, and that is the right of every independent nation not to be invaded, not to be the victim of aggression and not to be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Australia acts with the commanding moral authority of the United Nations. Never, in the United Nations 45-year history, has it worked so effectively and with such unity to fulfil its Charter and the principles of peace and security it embodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration is that Australia and the coalition of forces has reached this decision only at the end of a process without precedent in history. There is no parallel for the restraint, the patience and the caution with which the world alliance against Saddam Hussein has sought, by peaceful means, to resolve this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, Australia's decision has a clear and achievable goal: to end Iraq's aggression as a necessary step towards establishing the conditions for peace and stability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth consideration is to further the great quest for a new world order of peace, security and freedom, especially in the light of the end of confrontation between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. In this regard, the Prime Minister remarked:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I believe that, at the bar of history, there will be no greater condemnation of Saddam Hussein, than that his aggression has plunged the world into a terrible and needless crisis which threatens the world stability on which those splendid hopes depend. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister also commented in his speech on 17 January that the great lesson of this century is that appeasement of aggression is too high a price to pay for peace. The conflicts of the 1930s bear this out. The fascist expansion which occurred throughout that decade was made possible because of the lack of decisive action by the wider world community, at that time operating through the League of Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The attempted annexation of Kuwait by Iraq is a frightening reminder of similar events of the thirties. It is possible to quote a long list of such annexations at the hand of militaristic, totalitarian regimes that took place during that decade. Austria and Czechoslovakia were annexed by Germany, as was Abyssinia-now Ethiopia-by Italy and Manchuria by Japan. In the case of the two European fascist nations, particularly Italy, it has been widely acknowledged that their expansion could have been thwarted if significant counter measures had been taken by the League. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as the United Nations has struggled to deal with Iraq's aggression so, too, did the League of Nations face similar problems. The League was burdened by a number of member nations which chose to ignore normal international responsibilities and sensibilities in order to further their own political, military and imperial goals. The failure of the League of Nations in stemming the fascist movement of the 1930s must be taken into account in dealing with Iraq's present aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, indicated yesterday, we are not dealing with another Vietnam. We must cast our minds back to the 1930s to see a parallel-a parallel which indicates the tragic consequences of appeasing aggression. In the 1930s a number of opportunities existed for the European powers to prevent the spread of fascism. A vital opportunity existed during the Spanish Civil War. The legitimate government of Spain was overturned by a military coup led by the totalitarian General Franco, and Spain was plunged into civil war. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset of the coup, Franco had been heavily supported by the German and Italian military. The legitimate representatives of the Spanish people, however, were reduced to begging for assistance from the international community. The majority of responses forthcoming from the European powers were ones of pity and weak messages of condolence. Russia, however, not only gave assistance to the Government forces but also lobbied a combined European opposition to the fascist movement in Spain and indeed Europe. The western European powers, notably England and France, however, rejected the Russian approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> In opposition to their governments' positions on the Spanish issue, a considerable number of private citizens volunteered as members of the Spanish Government forces. Notable among those were the volunteers who formed the International Brigade. They realised, as did the Russian Government, that peace and stability could not be assured just through hope or debate, but that unjust actions must at times be opposed in the strongest way. At times world peace, tragically, must be achieved through conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate victory of Franco's forces and the accelerated fascist expansion that followed, precipitating World War II, was made possible by the inability of the western European powers to form an effective coalition with the Russian forces. Many historians have acknowledged that a coalition defence of Spain was the last chance for European peace prior to the outbreak of the World War.</PARA>
<PARA> At present the world has the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the European powers of the 1930s. The response of the United Nations to the Gulf crisis should be applauded in the shadow of the experiences of the 1930s. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the world body applied considerable economic sanctions to force a withdrawal from the Gulf state. Despite applying the strongest possible economic pressure, the Iraqi presence in Kuwait remained. There is no doubt that Iraq was using the time during which sanctions were applied to develop further its war machine, including the development of a nuclear capacity. When even the most strenuous diplomatic efforts failed to move Iraq's forces from Kuwait, the United Nations resolved that the Iraqi aggression must not be allowed to stand. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations' decision to become militarily involved was not taken lightly. It should again be mentioned that the appeasement of aggression is not the road to peace. In line with that lesson of the past and the need for a combined response, the United Nations resolved that a multinational military response to Iraq's aggression was required. </PARA>
<PARA> To the credit of the world community, a multitude of countries have contributed resources to the multinational force. Again, to the credit of those nations involved, Arab, Asian and African Muslim states are involved in the force. Those nations involved have recognised that the opposition to international aggression, as demonstrated by Iraq in its invasion of Kuwait, is a collective responsibility. It is in fact the responsibility of all the people of the world to oppose that type of aggression through all possible means so as to ensure world peace. In line with that collective responsibility, Australian involvement in the multinational force should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while to examine what the consequences could be if the world decided to ignore the Iraqi aggression. Nations throughout the world would believe that we live on a planet where might is right. Many nations would thus build a military machine and others would do the same to protect their borders. This would lead to a massive misuse of resources which could be better applied for the betterment of humankind. We cannot allow that situation to develop, but we will do so if we appease Iraq's unbridled aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> What would we do in the future if our nation, with its relatively small population, became subject to the aggression of a foreign power? We would hope to receive the collective support of others to fight to retain our freedom. If we expect that support, it would ill behove us to shirk our responsibility now to take a stand against Iraq's aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who support the Government's positive response to the United Nations Security Council resolution do so in the belief that this is the only way to achieve an acceptable solution which will lead to future world peace. It is not an easy decision to make. But those who support the Government's response should not be regarded as anti-peace. That is definitely not so; in fact, the opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason why it is not an easy decision to commit troops to conflict is that it is inevitable that in war lives are lost. That has already occurred, although none of the casualties have yet been among the Australian forces. Some of us know personally members of the Australian forces already in the Gulf. We know what we are asking these young men and women to do on behalf of world peace. It is not an easy task to ask our forces to move into a danger area. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the time in which I served in the Army Reserve I was either a psychologist in training or a psychologist. At one stage I worked virtually full time with young men who were conscripted, my main task being to identify those who could undergo officer training. I am certain that some of those whom I interviewed did not return from Vietnam. I am thus not unmindful of the possible consequences of asking our troops to go into a war zone. Nevertheless, I support the Government's action. I do so because we cannot allow unbridled aggression to be rewarded and become a role model for other nations in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the motion moved by my Leader, I acknowledge the debt that we owe to our 884 serving men and women in the Gulf. We have three ships there-HMAS Sydney, HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Success. I trust that, when the crews of these three ships return, the Australian people will display their enthusiastic appreciation for a job well done. These fine service men and women deserve such a display, indicating that this nation understands what they have done for future world peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the motion before the Senate as part of a demonstration of national unity at a time of world crisis. I say at the outset that war is a costly experience-costly in terms of human lives, human resources and a country's material resources. It is an experience that should be avoided wherever possible. But it is also often the only way to avoid an even greater cost of human lives, human resources and a country's material resources. At times action is needed to avoid what is clearly to be seen as an even greater future cost. This is how I see the present situation. If we believe in the philosophy of the brotherhood of man and the concept of this world as a global village, there is a responsibility for those who are in less fortunate circumstances and those who are overrun by an aggressor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it is appropriate to take this opportunity, here and now, as a Tasmanian senator, to express my sympathies to the relatives and friends, particularly the 41 Tasmanian families, of those members serving in this area. My thoughts, together with those of my fellow colleagues from Tasmania, are indeed with them on this occasion as members of the Australian forces serve in the Gulf area. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope desperately and sincerely that this war will be resolved quickly. A parent's heart is often torn between the conflict of the need to stop an aggressor before more sons and daughters of others are harmed and the need to keep one's own offspring safe. Therefore, we know how those families whose children are serving in this crisis must be feeling during this time of great anxiety and great distress. </PARA>
<PARA> During my recent readings of local newspapers in Tasmania I have become greatly concerned about the nature of some of the calls for peace. Peace is necessary, but not the implied peace in so many of these articles-peace at any cost. There appears to be a number of well-intentioned people who, separated by a vast distance from what is actually happening in Kuwait and Iraq today, and mollycoddled by the security of their own nation, appear to be quite oblivious to the long term intentions and the past atrocities of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein, apart from seeking to advance Iraq's historic, political and strategic interests, aspires to be a present day Nebuchadnezzar, Saladin and Nasser of the Arab world. Saddam has modelled himself on previous great aggressors of this world, aggressors who stopped at nothing to achieve their aims; men who viewed human life as cheap and as a means to an end; men who, to adopted an oft-used historic expression, used human life as cannon fodder. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein has little respect for the quality of human life, especially the human life of his own countrymen, women and children. His indiscriminate use of chemical weapons on the Kurds is but one of hundreds of examples. Thousands of men, women and children were gassed without any prior knowledge or warning for no other reason than that he feared their resistance to his regime and wanted their land for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein was the aggressor in 1980 in the Iraq-Iran conflict, a war that lasted for eight ghastly years and resulted in over a million casualties. Saddam Hussein has personally helped in the execution of his political opponents. Amnesty International has documented evidence of atrocities committed against Kuwaitis since the takeover of Kuwait. Its report of 19 December gives a chilling and comprehensive picture of the terrible human rights violations, detention, torture and summary execution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi Government has ignored United Nations resolutions condemning its mistreatment of the Kuwaiti people and its unlawful destruction and seizure of their property. This refusal to recognise the existence of the Kuwaitis is further shown by the Iraqi refusal to allow access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide protection and assistance. People who call for peace at any cost are ignoring the sadistic nature of this man. Saddam has his objectives. He wishes to be the master of the Arab world and in the process he will annihilate anyone who stands in his way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we can trust this man. His past actions verify the dangerous nature of his psyche. He has double-crossed national leaders who previously assisted Iraq in its long war again Iran-that is, the leaders of Kuwait. I refer also to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Mubarak of Egypt. Saddam Hussein sought to assure those Arab leaders that the dispute with Kuwait could be resolved by amicable means; if not, certainly through the Arab League. He has betrayed their confidence--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The consequences of allowing Saddam to go unchecked are uncertain and very frightening. If he were allowed to devour Kuwait, where would he turn his attention next? This week we have seen Iraq's missile attack on Israel. This unprovoked attack violates both international law and the accepted standards of international behaviour. In fact, Saddam Hussein has turned his back on the Islamic principles of ruling, of brotherhood, of mercy and of cooperation. We must not ignore the lessons of history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The events of the 1930s in Europe remind us starkly of the need to curb an aggressor's desire for more territory. The failure of the international community to respond adequately to the invasions of Manchuria, Abyssinia and Czechoslovakia eroded confidence in the League of Nations and contributed to the collapse of the world as it was then known. </PARA>
<PARA> Appeasement of aggression risks only greater problems later on. However, this is first and foremost a test of the United Nations' ability to keep world peace and security. The conflict is the result of the Security Council taking its responsibilities seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolutions against Iraq are supported by representative forces from over 28 nations. The conflict is not with the United States but with the Security Council of the United Nations. To have the Security Council back off and not carry through its resolutions would put the United Nations in the same category as the now defunct and useless League of Nations in keeping world peace. It is my sincere hope that the United Nations will not become another League of Nations. Since 2 August the United Nations has passed 12 resolutions on the Kuwaiti situation. Saddam Hussein has had a number of opportunities to pursue a peaceful resolution. In fact, leaders of the Arab world pleaded with this Iraqi dictator but those calls have been constantly ignored. It is important to note that when an aggressor nation simply chooses to opt out of its normal international responsibilities, it is difficult for any government to engage it in any meaningful discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has made appropriate efforts to see the crisis resolved by diplomatic and peaceful means. The Opposition coalition places great importance on the need for national unity in dealing with such crises. For this reason we support the motion before the Senate. All the intensive efforts for a peaceful solution to this crisis have foundered on Saddam Hussein's flat refusal to consider any withdrawal from Kuwait. His cynical manipulation of the linkage between the crises and other issues and his continued massive build-up in Kuwait are quite frightening to world order. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the United Nations, by attempting a peaceful solution, gave Iraq an extra five months to build up its ever-increasing and growing arsenal of conventional and other weapons. The Central Intelligence Agency has ascertained that another 12 months of sanctions would not shift Hussein's position in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> An extremely frightening consequence is that if he is not stopped now, and with control of greater oil resources, he could be expected to develop a significant nuclear capability. Given Saddam's track record, his readiness to use these weapons cannot be doubted. One has only to read of the disastrous results of Chernobyl to realise that the results of nuclear explosions continue for many years. Nuclear warfare is to be avoided at any cost. This is one means of avoiding what would certainly be a catastrophe. As I read the situation, continuing only with sanctions would allow Saddam to build up his weapons arsenal, including nuclear and chemical weapons, and give him an even greater opportunity and possibility for using those sorts of weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I support the Government in its involvement in this issue and hope and pray that this aggression will be quickly stopped and that world peace will ensue. May I take the opportunity in this debate of congratulating the Israelis for their forbearance in not seeking an immediate revenge against those missile attacks launched against the populated areas of Haifa and Tel Aviv. Equally, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the restraint of Syria and Egypt because I believe that both of those countries have shown great statesmanship at a time of great trial for their nations, being neighbours of Iraq and with long term difficulties for Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I hope and pray most fervently, as the Bishop of Tasmania stated so emphatically at the weekend, that we:</PARA>
<PARA>unite with compassion for the lives of those caught up in the crisis (that) we are united in our concern for the people of Kuwait overwhelmed by the aggressor (that) we are united in our preference for a non-violent solution, . . . but since this has not been achieved we are united in our heartfelt concern for (those) at home awaiting news, and praying for a safe and speedy homecoming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 700 women from 60 countries who constitute World Women Parliamentarians for Peace are not only parliamentarians and peace activists. All bring a wide range of talent and experience with them and many have actually fought for liberation from colonial and dictatorial regimes. They include women like Joyce Mujure, one of the many Zimbabwean combatants who are now members of Parliament. Joyce, at the age of 19 and close to the delivery of her first baby, a little more than 10 years ago, shot down a helicopter. The late Nora Astorga of Nicaragua, also pregnant when she fled to the hills fearful for her life, joined the freedom fighters and subsequently became a representative of Nicaragua at the United Nations. Begum Rehana Sahar, Pakistani Minister for Women's Development in the Bhutto Government, a highly qualified barrister and public prosecutor, saw her husband murdered and went to gaol for supporting Benazir Bhutto who was then also under threat of her life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Madam Than of Hanoi was gaoled in South Vietnam for her active support of the nationalist regime. Many Soviet women deputies as teenagers took up arms to defend their country against the Nazis. Japanese women lived with the aftermath of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The lives of African and central American women have been shaped by armed struggle. </PARA>
<PARA> For these women the quest for peace is the most basic of political principles. They wholeheartedly support the objectives of our network to promote world peace and disarmament through the unified action of women parliamentarians all over the world. They represent a wide range of political philosophies, religions and traditions. A few take a rigid pacifist position. But all, I believe, agree with 160 member nations who in Nairobi in 1985 endorsed the Forward-looking Strategies, the document of the United Nations End of the Decade for Women conference which canvasses a theme of peace, equality and development and states at paragraph 242:</PARA>
<PARA>There exist situations in several regions of the world where the violation of principles of non-use of force, non-intervention, non-interference, nonaggression and the right to self-determination endangers international peace and security and creates massive humanitarian problems which constitute an impediment to the advancement of women and hence to the full implementation of the Forward-looking Strategies. In regard to these situations strict adherence to and respect for the cardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and implementation of relevant resolutions consistent with the principles of the Charter are an imperative requirement with a view to seeking solutions to such problems, thereby ensuring a secure and better future for the people affected, most of whom are invariably women and children. </PARA>
<PARA>My knowledge of the women of whom I speak leads me to believe that the majority, while deploring violence and working for peace, are well aware of the fact that at some stage the privilege of being members of societies which are member nations of the United Nations will be matched by the responsibility of a practical contribution to achieving peace, as foreshadowed by Dr Evatt in 1945. I would strongly recommend that among the very fine speeches that have preceded mine Minister Nick Bolkus's speech gives an excellent summary of those days and the position of social democratic societies in relation to those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> War, unfortunately, engenders xenophobia and bigotry and this one is no different. Women who are assumed to be Arabian, especially those who wear the veil, as they are fully entitled to do, are being harassed and victimised in a cowardly and vicious fashion in some of our cities and suburbs. Many have lived in Australia for years and have Australian born families. They may be from Lebanon, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Afghanistan or any one of a dozen other countries where modesty of dress is required and the wearing of a headscarf, called the hijab, is traditional. Many are political refugees like my friend, Tajwar, an Afghanistan former freedom fighter who now lives in Western Australia. Thus identified, they are being refused service, abused, and the scarves torn from their heads. Their children are bullied and their husbands provoked. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon all Australians of good will to offer friendship and support to these women particularly. Women themselves can identify with the distress of these possibly Arab women who are far from their close relatives and their motherland, sick with anxiety for their compatriots and relatives. Their final oppression is hostility and insults when they leave their homes. I appeal to Australians, if they know of such families in their neighbourhoods, to make sure that no such victimisation is taking place and offer assistance if it is needed and welcomed, preferably on a community basis. The many fine non-governmental organisations in Australia which pride themselves on community service could well consider how best they can, with sensitivity, extend comfort and encouragement to such families, especially the women who risk being totally isolated in their homes, singled out as they are for abuse and harassment. A society which can set up a very efficient neighbourhood watch system can surely care for the oppressed in its midst. It is worth noting that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has issued a strong statement condemning such acts of racism and that there are Federal and State laws which outlaw behaviour which discriminates against people because of their race. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted with interest the description by one of my colleagues, Elaine Darling of the House of Representatives, of war as a social cancer. Despite my disagreement with her conclusions, the analogy is hard to resist. War, like cancer, is malign. It maims, debilitates, invades and destroys creating pain, loss of function, distress and disruption of individuals, families and whole societies as an untreated malignancy does on a more limited scale. </PARA>
<PARA> Cancer can be prevented in many cases and so, we hope, can war. Indeed, the United Nations has repeatedly intervened over the years to avert open conflict. But identifying the predisposing causes is a matter of long, hard, social and scientific endeavour. Eliminating the causes through education, persuasion and social progress is costly and time consuming and, above all, requires the cooperation of the parties and community support. In the case of war, that means the 160 strong community of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Cancer can be treated in most cases. In order to stop further invasion and the isolation of the malignancy, the treatment may be very drastic indeed. Reconstruction and rehabilitation can be costly and painful. It is for these very reasons that we must allow the drastic option in the event that other treatment fails. Who now doubts the intransigence and duplicity of Saddam Hussein? There is now on record in Hansard much information about the horrifying abuses of human rights that he has perpetrated over the last years and months and his total refusal to yield to anything but force. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are malign forces in the world, the option must remain for timely and appropriate treatment, conservatively when possible, but radically when the balance of informed opinion so determines. The statement made by Perez de Cuellar, and already incorporated this evening, is moving and sincere. They are the words of a leader who has pledged his and the United Nations commitment to continue to work for a peaceful resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The world's need of the United Nations is unarguable. This war is a tragedy, however one views it, for individuals, for the countries of the Middle East, and for the peace loving peoples and nations of the world. A greater tragedy would be to lose the hard won confidence in the United Nations, so important for the security of the many smaller and medium sized nations, nations whose people are dependent upon the United Nations and the greater world community for amelioration of the perennial problems that they cannot resolve on their own-civil wars, abuses of human rights, displacement of whole populations, malnutrition, disease, lack of fuel and clean water, illiteracy, maternal and child mortality-the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Being of the generation which lived through the anxious years of the Cold War and the arms build up-and build down subsequently-the proliferation of nuclear weapons et cetera, and agonised over the regular use of the veto in the Security Council, many of us have come to depend heavily on the principles of the instruments of the United Nations, the imperatives that provided the basis for the defence of human rights and human dignity. The United Nations did not previously have the power; there simply was not the consensus to endorse intervention on the scale that we are witnessing in 1991. It is an historical fact. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a development, one for which we have waited for a long time. But in many other ways, support has slowly, painstakingly been nurtured for crucial initiatives, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Peacekeeping forces in otherwise war torn countries, nuclear free zones, progress on a chemical weapons ban, even progress on the comprehensive test ban treaty, wide support for new instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the work of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the High Commission on Refugees, conventions on apartheid, capital punishment, treatment of prisoners of war-these are just a few of the real triumphs of international diplomacy, each success adding to the status and potential of the United Nations to produce a real improvement in living standards and a real possibility of peace sometime in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the United Nations for all these and other very good reasons. As I said initially, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion which we are debating tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the world emerged from the smouldering ruins of the Second World War, a conflict which claimed 60 million lives, humanity vowed that such a catastrophe should never happen again. Tired of war, world leaders looked to provide for peace. It was in these circumstances that they came to form the United Nations, vowing to beat their swords into ploughshares, and promising to create a new world order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The blueprint for that new world order was embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, which stated certain fundamental principles. Among these were the right of people everywhere to live in peace and happiness, the right of peoples to self-determination, and the right of every sovereign state to exist free from attack within its own borders. These are the principles in which I believe very strongly, and principles which my generation holds dear, even if we do at times take them for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> But, Mr Deputy President, the Charter of the United Nations is more than just a statement of principles because it sets out the rules which govern relations between nations. It provides for the General Assembly, for the Security Council and for the International Court of Justice for the pacific settlement of disputes. Here we come to the interesting part, because after fighting for six years against a dictator who was not willing and did not believe in the peaceful settlement of disputes, those world leaders also allowed for the use of force, if all else failed, against those who would not live by the rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the past 45 years have seen too many dictators who would not live by the rules, and the consequence has been the suffering of millions of innocent people under the terror of Stalin, of Mao Tse-Tung, of Deng Xiao-Ping. And on and on the list continues-Tito, Ceaucescu, Khomini, Idi Amin, Gaddafi and, lately, Saddam Hussein. In short, the years following the Second World War largely failed to bring about the new world order which so many people desired. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, however, an event occurred which had the potential to change all of that-it was the fall of the Berlin Wall-because the collapse of communism has made possible the attainment of that new world order for which we have struggled so long. This is the challenge that my generation readily embraces; this is the challenge we must all embrace, to create not just a better town or state or even a nation, but to create a better world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is so ironic, therefore, at a time when peace was more than just a possibility-it was a real chance for the world-that it should be shattered by the brutal Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. Let us take this opportunity right here and now to examine why Saddam Hussein chose to make his bloody attack; why he sent his tanks to crush a peaceful nation, and why he chose to plunge the world down the path to war. What was his justification? I will tell you what his justification was: he said that Iraq had an historical claim to Kuwait. But then Hitler said that Germany had an historical claim to Austria; Mussolini said Italy had a claim to Abyssinia, and Stalin alleged that Russia had a title to the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these tyrants were wrong. All of them used such lies as a basis for oppression and terror, and all of them should have been stopped in their tracks. Honourable senators, Saddam Hussein should be stopped in his tracks. Hussein's every action in this regard smacks of deceit and treachery. He recognised the Kuwaiti Government, he called those in that Government his brothers in the Arab League, he borrowed billions of dollars from them to finance his war with Iran, and then he sent his troops, his tanks and his guns in the dead of night to take what was not his. That is how Kuwait was crushed, and that is why Kuwait must be set free. </PARA>
<PARA> But Saddam Hussein's perversity did not end there. He tried to call his war a holy war, even though he was fighting against his fellow Muslims. He even tried to link Kuwait with Palestine and then launched rockets against Israel, which he knew full well could kill Palestinian and Israeli alike. But the worst, the sickest and the most depraved act of all was to hold innocent people hostage to protect his strategic sites from attack, and to call these people his guests. These actions alone-and one can add to them his brutal reign of terror and his development of weapons of mass destruction-demanded that the world respond. </PARA>
<PARA> The world has responded: world leaders have urged Hussein to leave Kuwait; millions of ordinary people have prayed for peace; the United Nations passed resolutions; it imposed sanctions and embargoes, and all to no avail. While we are on the subject of sanctions we should mention the thousands of Australian farmers who are our second front against Saddam Hussein. For five months now, these men and women have had to pay the cost of the sanctions in lost markets for live sheep, for wheat and other grains. The wool industry too, just as it was recovering from its Government imposed crisis, has suffered falls in the amount of wool purchased at auction by the trade. The Government has to realise, therefore, that it has a moral and political obligation to ensure that the cost of the sanctions is borne equally by the community. If that means compensation for lost markets or collapsed prices, then so be it. </PARA>
<PARA> The sanctions are the Government's work and I support them. Many would say that the rural recession is in a large part the Government's part too, although of course I do not support that situation. I just take this opportunity therefore to remind the Government at this hour of crisis to look after the people who work the land and to stand up for Australia's farmers just as they are helping to stand up on our behalf to Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, while sanctions are an important part of the international effort, they will not do the job on their own. Sanctions have had five months to work and yet Saddam Hussein remains as unrepentant and as intransigent as before. I am well aware that there are people who say we must give the sanctions more time, but we must weigh against this the fact that every single day that passes increases Hussein's stranglehold on Kuwait; every single day that passes increases his opportunity to dig in and to fortify his position; and every single day that passes means that, when the inevitable assault to liberate Kuwait begins, more and more lives of young servicemen from the United States of America and other coalition countries will be lost. More and more lives will be lost in Kuwait as Saddam continues his reign of brutal oppression. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I ask, therefore, is how many women have to be raped, how many babies have to be ripped from incubators, and how many innocent people have to be tortured and murdered before we come to learn that a craven peace paid for at a dictator's asking price does not save any lives. It only makes life more unbearable for those who have to suffer the oppression every hour of every day of every week. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a question the Security Council had to face when it came to debate resolution 678, and this is why Iraq was given until 15 January to get out of Kuwait or face the consequences. But the diplomacy did not end even then. Secretary of State, James Baker, met with the Iraqi Foreign Minister in Geneva. We saw representations from the Yemenis, the French, the Soviets and others, and all without success. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Secretary-General of the United Nations went to Baghdad with hope in his heart and peace on his lips, only to return with despair on his brow. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this exhaustion of diplomacy, not by the United Nations but by Saddam Hussein, which has led to the resort to war. That is why, even as we speak, the forces of 28 nations representing the brotherhood of humanity are serving in the Gulf. And these are not heartless killers; these are men and women who love and laugh as we do, men and women who more than anyone else have a vested interest in peace but who are willing to lay down their lives in the hope that their sons and daughters will never have to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> What is at stake is more than just oil, and more than just Kuwait; it is the future of the world for the next 50 years. That is why we are involved in conflict. It is because we recognise the importance of principle and the right of people everywhere to live free of terror and intimidation, and instead in the happiness and security of their own homes. For these reasons, the Kuwaiti border is more than just a line scratched in the desert sands. It is a place where praxis and principle have met in an effort to provide for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Allow me to address too the peace movement, which claims so vociferously to believe in peace. To them I say that I too believe in peace, but that peace and freedom are always hard fought and hard come by and often easily lost. For me the importance of peace is that it is an expression of our love for our fellow man. It seems strange to me, therefore, that many of the people who claim to be interested in peace seem to thrive so much on hate. As the Bible so eloquently says:</PARA>
<PARA>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why I support the efforts of our service men and women in the Gulf, and that is why I support the actions of the coalition forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget either that Australia's freedoms were preserved in the Second World War only by the sacrifice of Australian, American and other servicemen who fought the evil tide of Japanese expansionism at the cost of their own lives. This is the legacy which we have inherited and the obligation we owe to other members of the community of nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, along with its allies, is embarked upon a struggle intrinsic to the fate of future generations. It is a struggle to secure for them an inheritance as fundamental to mankind as life itself. It is a struggle for freedom. The choice we must take, therefore, is to stand up for freedom, to stand up for peace and to stand up to Saddam Hussein. If we do this, we have made our contribution to the creation of a better world so that whenever tyranny, violence and terror threaten freedom, law and order, no nation shall stand alone, for the whole of the civilised world will be there too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been made clear in the debate that war is a foul instrument and that everybody in this chamber, and I think in the other place, regards it as such. Its aim is to destroy, to kill, to overthrow with violence, to subdue, to conquer. As Pope John Paul II says, `War is an adventure with no return'. Any person with instincts abhors it. Not one person, as I say, in this place or in the other has lightly counselled armed intervention in the Middle East. Conscious of the awful gravity of advice, it has been for all a matter of the most solemn concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two sides fighting the present war: Iraq and the United Nations. Australia, as a founding member of that organisation, has given it moral and material support. Many speakers in this debate have pressed cogent reasons for it to do so. Others have argued strongly against the war and our part in it. The Hansards of yesterday and today will contain a permanent record of the comprehensive cases put forward supporting the various courses urged upon us as proper for Australians to take in the present crisis. That record will show strong arguments for and against our present commitment. This being so, whatever view is taken of the war with Iraq, understanding should be given by each side of the community debate to the other, and that is a point that has been made again and again today. At times there is a tendency on the part of both sides to belittle the other, to impugn its integrity and to treat it as delinquent in its civic duty. That is a most unhappy situation. </PARA>
<PARA> While robust debate enhances democracy, intolerance, carping, poorly-formed criticism and the false attribution of ill-motives to others do not. Fortunately, the debate over the last two days, and indeed in the community generally, has in the main been informed and reasonable. In this context, the stance that most people in this country have taken towards their brothers and sisters of Arabic background and of the Muslim faith has been quite superb. That is a point again that has been made here. The cruel and bullying actions against them have been roundly condemned by most of their fellow Australians, and so they should. </PARA>
<PARA> It is abhorrent to see self-appointed vigilantes attack within the safety and comfort of these shores, men, women and children because of their race, religion or supposed loyalties. Such vigilantes are in no way to be compared to the courageous and dedicated people who, in serving their country, have gone into the dangers of the battle zone. They deserve our highest gratitude and praise. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has acted with high principle and great leadership in his rejection of the racism and intolerance shown towards those with an Arabic background and of the Islamic faith. His actions will be written into history. </PARA>
<PARA> Pope John Paul II, with others in the spiritual ministry, has counselled peace and turned humbly to God seeking it. I do not know whether people outside Victoria saw the prayer service in St Paul's cathedral in Melbourne on 14 January. It was marvellous. Religious leaders of the Muslim community, of the Jewish congregation and of different Christian denominations gathered together to ask the Almighty for harmony in the world. Tragically, the efforts of those committed people and others throughout the world like them have not prevented war. Hopefully, they can bring justice to the settlement which must come when the armed conflict ceases. Whether or not we believe in God, we must hope that this will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the debate over the last two days, which has been excellent, has turned on the question of whether or not we ought to go to war in the Middle East. The fact of the matter is that we have done so already-if not in August of last year, certainly in January of this year. So we cannot prevent war but we must not allow a flawed peace to follow. To that end, we should now look for an effective and sensible strategy to resolve the divisive issues in the Middle East. Without this, loss of life and property in the present conflict will be squandered. It is not an effective and sensible strategy to thwart the aggression of Saddam Hussein and do no more. </PARA>
<PARA> The Palestinians in Gaza and on the West Bank must be given their due as full members of the human community. The people in Lebanon have rights which during the last decade have been grievously abused-they must be redressed. The Kurds have been most horribly used and their situation must be looked at. What should we do about the most unhappy unease that exists between the Muslim faith and the Western philosophy? Something will have to be done about that. How can we ensure that Israel has safe and secure borders and is allowed to enjoy the peace and harmony that countries like ourselves do? Who do we leave in charge of the oil supplies in the Middle East? What do we do with Kuwait? What are we going to do with Iraq?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that these are the questions that we should be answering now so that when the end of hostilities does come, what we put in place is a lot better than what was there before. In my view, that is going to be a very hard task indeed. We certainly will need a lot of goodwill from a lot of people and from a lot of nations. Given the present conflict, that might be very difficult to obtain. Fortunately, in my case the question of whether or not we should have gone to war need not be answered. I remember, early in my career in the law hearing judges and being advised, `If you don't have to answer a question, don't do so'. As I say, most of the debate has been good, but there have been some things put, fairly harshly, that I would like to answer. The Democrats, Senator Vallentine, Manning Clark and those who have advocated peace have been accused by some as being appeasers. The history of the thirties has been pointed out as the lesson that ought to be followed. </PARA>
<PARA> As somebody else has pointed out, there are many wars that we can look at to see whether or not peace should have been discussed before actions were taken. Today when some senators accuse others of being appeasers, and of not standing up with armed forces to put aggressors to flight, we ought to look at what we have done today. A motion was put by Senator Hill-I must say that his speech on the debate before us was excellent-in reference to the actions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of where those who have been striving for peace and advocating discussions have been castigated, I would have thought that there would have been something in Senator Hill's motion stating that if the Soviet troops did not withdraw we were going to take appropriate action through the United Nations, including resort to arms. But as I look through the motion I see that the most it seems to do is protest and continue to protest and call on the Soviet Government to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of these republics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing in that motion that talks about the armed struggle and the need to stand up to the aggressor. All I say to Senator Walters is that when we condemn others for being, in effect, wimps, appeasers and what have you, we ought to look at what we do. We ought to look at what we have done about Tibet-which used to be an independent country-as far as China is concerned. We should look at what we did when the Russians went into Afghanistan and all the other instances that have been referred to during this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People have spoken about the abuse of human rights and have quoted material provided by Amnesty International, as evidence of the cruelty which has been perpetrated by the Iraqis in Kuwait. It has been said that such action and the trampling down of human rights ought to evoke an armed response. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two things I want to say about that. Firstly, the material that Amnesty International puts out does not contain, as far as I can establish-perhaps somebody in this chamber can tell me where I can find it-any suggestion that in defence of people's rights armed conflict ought to be undertaken. Indeed, what it seems to suggest is that letters be written and that diplomatic pressure be imposed. It seems to me that we ought to be very careful in using the abuse of human rights as a reason for going to war. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is said that sanctions should be used. The only difficulty that I have with that-again it has been pointed out in this place today-is that the longer we look to sanctions to work the more secure Saddam Hussein becomes in Kuwait. It seems to me that, whereas people may have disagreed on many other matters, what nobody seems to have disagreed upon is the fact that he should not be there and the fact that he should be made to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I find that many of the reasons put forward to invite our armed intervention, such as the abuse of human rights-dreadful as that might be-and intrusion onto other countries' territory, given the history of the way we have acted in respect of other instances where those sorts of things have occurred, are less compelling than they might have been had we acted consistently throughout. On the other hand, I do not think it can be said that because we have countenanced the abuse of human rights and the invasion of territories in other instances we should not act when it happens in this instance. The United Nations has said sanctioned the use of force. As has been said again and again in this debate, the United Nations determined that we take that particular approach in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> If we accept the United Nations as the proper instrument of some form of world order-no matter how defective it may be-and if we adhere to that and intend to keep doing so, then when it advocates a particular line of action in reference to a particular country and a particular person, that ought to be adopted, unless we want to get out of the United Nations and see it fall into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many inconsistencies in the actions we take, in that we seem to be courageous in some instances and not in others. We seem to be conscious of people's rights in some areas and not in others. Nevertheless, where we have a particular instrument we look to to institute some sort of world order and world peace and harmony, we should support it. </PARA>
<PARA> As one reads through the volumes of material put out by Amnesty International, one sees that the tragedy existing around the world is almost beyond endurance. We have spoken about the babies being thrown from their humidicribs in Kuwait. We should also remember the children that were shot in the streets of Brazil because, according to a sign hung round the neck of one, they `did not study and had no future'. Where those things have occurred we have been selective in our reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the motion put forward by the Government. In my view, it is the best that can be done given the situation in which we find ourselves. The world is not perfect. We cannot argue in terms of absolutes. We cannot act as moral superiors to other people, given the disasters and the dreadful abuse of rights of all sorts that have gone unanswered around the world. But it seems to me that when we do get the world together and there is an opportunity, as offered by the United Nations in this instance, to stop a person whose stance nobody has defended, it is an opportunity we must take. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well to remember that we are all in need of redemption and that when we do criticise each other, whether for being warmongers on the one hand or appeasers on the other, that hardly creates an atmosphere which will bring forth the new order we all so desperately hope for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to support the motion presently before the Senate-one of the most important motions that has come before the Australian Parliament in many generations. The war to liberate Kuwait in which Australia is now participating has arisen quite simply as the result of the actions and intransigence of only one man. The United States Secretary of State, James Baker, explained it well when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A dangerous man has committed a blatant act of aggression in a vital region at a critical moment in history. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will know that on 29 November the Security Council of the United Nations passed an extremely grave resolution. That resolution was momentous and in some respects quite unprecedented. Resolution 678 authorised member states of the United Nations from 15 January 1991 to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the Security Council's previous resolutions on the Gulf crisis. Essentially those previous resolutions called on Iraq to withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait and to release all hostages. The resolution also requested all states to provide appropriate support for actions taken under the resolution. The words `all necessary means' carry a clear meaning in this resolution. They encompass the use of armed force to compel compliance with the Security Council's resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that both superpowers were prepared, with four other nations, to sponsor this resolution shows in the most concrete terms that the nations of the world are overwhelmingly united in their condemnation of Iraq's aggression and in their determination to do whatever it takes to use all necessary means to make sure that Iraq's aggression is not allowed to stand. </PARA>
<PARA> The easy option was always to extend the embargo indefinitely to allow matters to drift on and to play into the hands of Saddam Hussein by that process. But, acting properly and capably, the United Nations set about the task of bringing forward, in a responsible way, resolutions to address all that is involved in the Middle East. That culminated in resolution 678 which was in fact sponsored by no fewer than six countries. It is interesting to note that they were the United States of America, Great Britain, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France, Canada, and Romania under its new administration. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know that embargoes and sanctions as such would not have in themselves been effective in liberating Kuwait. Indeed, the Iraqis were effectively toughing out the circumstances, and with varying degrees of success they carried on with their annexation of Kuwait and a number of other horrific activities which have been outlined by a number of senators during this current debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in the other place back in December, this is one of the gravest tests of the international community since 1945. It will certainly affect the nature of international relations and the security of independent states for years to come. That is why Australia cannot do nothing, and why it is correct in the world's interests and in Australia's strategic and economic interests to respond, and to respond in a manifestly correct way. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been necessary that we respond to these actions of Saddam Hussein for a variety of very simple reasons, and they are, firstly, that no nation has the right to invade another nation, no matter what the so-called provocation. The second point is that Saddam knows that by controlling oil he can control the economies of the Western world. I ask how long would it have been before he would have been looking with greedy eyes at the oil fields of Saudi Arabia? Let me reiterate that Saddam Hussein never went into Kuwait to resolve the Palestinian question; he went into Kuwait as a blatant act of aggression to ensure greater supplies of oil and thus control the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, just like Kuwait, Australia is a middle power which would rely on the United Nations to come to its aid in times of trouble, and as such we have a responsibility to that union of nations to take action when called upon to protect the rights of others. The fourth point is that the argument to use the Palestinian question is purely disinformation which, I might add, is propagated by many of our so-called peace activists. The fifth point I want to mention is that this man must be stopped before he has the capability to use far greater and more destructive weapons on other nations. I can tell many of the peace activists that this man would think nothing of using those destructive weapons. Saddam Hussein has already used poisonous gas on his own people, so we now know what we are up against. He has executed some of his closest colleagues in the most horrific circumstances, and of course his use of hostages as human shields is totally unacceptable. What did we see in the Australian headlines this morning? We saw this:</PARA>
<PARA>Iraq threatens to use POWs as human shields. </PARA>
<PARA>I just want to tell all these doubters of the true intentions of this man. He is no great saviour of the Palestinian or Muslim people. He is a ruthless dictator bent on glorifying himself in the annals of Arab history, and at the cost of other lives-the lives he lost in the Iran-Iraq war, the lives he lost when gassing the Kurdish people, the lives lost while defending Kuwait. Mr Don Chipp, who was the Leader of the Australian Democrats in this place for many years, writing in the Sunday Times on 6 January said:</PARA>
<PARA>No Middle East observer holds any doubt that Israel would be subjected to a massive attack from Saddam Hussein of poison gas, biological and possibly nuclear weapons within two years. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet we hear the Democrats in this place talk about giving him time. Time for what-more murder, torture and terrorism? This is one of the reasons I believe that the right action has been taken in so far as he has to be stopped. We did not want to use appeasement like Neville Chamberlain did in the last World War, and about which Senator Bishop spoke so clearly, distinctly and forcibly here in the Senate this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein is not a great leader of his nation. A great leader would have known what the world meant when it passed resolution 678. He chooses to ignore this because he thinks he is greater than the rest of the world. I want to tell the Senate that except for the swift action of the United States and the rest of the world it would not have been long at all before he would have been marching into other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the decision made by the Australian Government to send our naval contingent, as well as other military and medical personnel, to the Persian Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few comments about the demonstrators for peace to whom the media is so keen to give a lot of publicity and credence. No-one-I repeat, no-one-really wants war. We all want peace, but peace does not always come with the absence of war. This is a point I particularly want to emphasise to the Democrats who seem to think that we will have peace if we let Saddam Hussein have his way and keep Kuwait. This, I believe, is completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell says, `Let's give peace a chance'. This is what all the folk who have been marching and demonstrating have been saying- `Let's give peace a chance'. I do not believe we want peace at any price. Of course, that is what Neville Chamberlain did during the last war. It is a long time ago, but I can remember back to the days when Neville Chamberlain was trying to appease Germany. I can remember thinking, `Oh, yes, we don't want war. Won't it be lovely if he can stop it'. Sure enough, he stopped it, but it did not last for very long and in another 12 months the war started. In those extra 12 months Germany had been making extra weapons and that country and all the countries that Hitler had annexed were very hard to beat. That is something that we have to remember in the case that we are thinking about here in the Parliament at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Brownhill reminds us, Saddam Hussein has had an extra five months and he is getting more weapons all the time. This is something that we have to remember. Of course, `Let's have peace' is a message that is undoubtedly appealing to a significant minority of Australians. We have seen and heard a lot from the demonstrators in the last couple of days; a lot of noise and a lot of calls for `Let's have peace'. I have been very dismayed, like a lot of other senators, about the behaviour of so many of the peace people in the Senate yesterday. I believe that if they want to get up and scream and shout, and use words that I do not believe should be used in the Senate-in fact, I do not think they should be used anywhere, let alone in the Senate-let them become senators or members of parliament. Then they can come and say what they want to in this place and we will listen to them, even if we do not agree with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Peace is something which we earn. It does not come automatically. It is something that all people have to defend and be willing to fight for. Peace is not the absence of war. It is the right to freedom, and the right to exercise that freedom. It is the security to know that one has the right and the opportunity to achieve legitimate aims and not be under threat by other powers, whether they are rulers or nations. I want to quote from that greatest of authors, Anonymous, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral feeling which thinks nothing worth a war is worse . . . a man who has nothing which he cares more about than his self-preservation is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free unless made so and kept so by the existence of better men than himself. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask these demonstrators for peace: what about the peace for the people of Kuwait since the invasion in August? Are they not entitled to peace? What about peace for the people of Israel, a country which has chosen to stay out of this conflict, yet one which Saddam Hussein has been using with deliberate obfuscation to try to drag into the war and thus justify his actions in Kuwait? Do the peace marchers think the people of Israel have peace when, every day and night, they carry their gas masks around with them?</PARA>
<PARA> These peace marchers we see on the streets appear to be more keen on demonstrating against the United States than actually seeking peace. We have not seen them demonstrating outside the Iraqi Embassy. Why, I ask, when it is Iraq that started this war when it invaded Kuwait? It is Iraq which is the initial aggressor in this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me remind those who are listening that the objectives for this military action in the Persian Gulf are clear. They are not ambiguous; the goals are well defined and familiar. Iraq must be kicked out of Kuwait completely, and Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. Citizens abroad must be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> These goals are not the goals of any one nation. They have been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council numerous times. Most countries share these concerns for principle, and many have a stake in the stability of the Persian Gulf. This war is not, as Saddam Hussein and others would have it, the United States against Iraq. It is Iraq against the world. Let me quote from President Bush's address to the joint session of Congress in September last year as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We stand at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move towards an historic period of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of these troubled times . . . a new world order can emerge: a new era-freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony. </PARA>
<PARA> A hundred generations have searched for this illusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> Today that new world is struggling to be born. A world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognise the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to pay a tribute to our men and women who are serving in our naval forces in the Gulf area. We thank them for the part they are playing with the allied forces as they endeavour to bring peace to our world again. It is important that we remember in our prayers not only those who are in the war area but also their dear ones who are at home, hoping that it will not be long before the war is over and their dear ones return home. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to support this motion before us this evening. As a member of the National Party of Australia and the coalition I have been glad to have this opportunity of adding my words of support to the motion before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have opposed the war from the start. This is a war that has already wreaked, and will continue to wreak, massive carnage in the Middle East. The question that we must ask ourselves is: is the strategy contained in the motion one that will work? I do not believe it will. I oppose President Bush's dangerous and simplistic rush to war. It will not bring peace or a satisfactory political settlement to the troubled area of the Middle East, in my view. It will not result in a new world order because a new world order cannot be created in a place like the Middle East through the barrel of a gun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I add my voice to the 47 1/2 per cent of senators in the United States of America, the 42 per cent of the members of the United States Congress and the cry across the world against the premature use of force. Sanctions were not given time to work. I believe that President Bush will be judged harshly by history for his handling of this issue. However, my criticism of the Bush Administration should not in any way detract from the absolute condemnation that I join with other senators in making of Hussein and the blood thirsty regime he presides over. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that economic sanctions were the effective strategy to follow. As the United States Democrat senator Sam Nunn said of them:</PARA>
<PARA>We are playing a winning hand. I see no reason to use military actions. </PARA>
<PARA>Max Stauffer, a Middle East expert from the John Hopkins University in the United States of America, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We're witnessing one of the few cases in the history where economic sanctions are actually working. Only essential items like food are trickling through the blockade. </PARA>
<PARA> The country's economy has been grinding inexorably to a halt. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq is a natural for economic sanctions: its dependence on oil is overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Stauffer estimates that petroleum made up 75 per cent of the economy in direct and indirect connections, making it very vulnerable with consumer disposable income cut in half or more during that time. Iraq's oil revenues, which provided 95 per cent, or if one believes the Central Intelligence Agency, 97 per cent, of its foreign exchange were already down, having dropped 20 per cent by July last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only was Iraq a natural for sanctions but also at the time sanctions were imposed the internal situation in Iraq was such that they had an even greater chance of success. The public sector wages in Iraq were at starvation levels and guest workers were being harassed into leaving the country or accepting deteriorating pay and conditions. The promised liberalisation, both in the political and economic systems, were in limbo under the Hussein regime. It was becoming clear that the Government there had no solutions. United Nations sanctions were imposed on Iraq at a time when it was rich in discontent. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that Hussein is a rogue presiding over a regime that has been guilty of every human rights abuse. However, I believe that Hussein feared this restive population. He knew that as the months rolled on the sanctions would bite deeply. He preferred war now-and this is the important point-with a relatively united people rather than face sanctions over a period when his regime would be challenged from within. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, President Bush, in escalating the level and the speed of American military involvement, has denied the world the chance of a successful United Nations economic sanctions model. That is a great tragedy. United States Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, when he attacked the Bush Administration for abandoning sanctions in favour of the military option, quoted a string of administration officials who had testified that sanctions were biting. Mitchell said:</PARA>
<PARA>Inexplicably however on November 8th Mr Bush had ordered the doubling of US forces in the Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the President, without any consultation and without any public debate, changed American policy. He said that the grave decision for war was made prematurely. As I said earlier, I believe that history will judge President Bush harshly, particularly if the war is protracted, and the news tonight is that we face a protracted war. </PARA>
<PARA> When President Bush doubled the size of America's military involvement on 8 November, he changed military confrontation from an action of last resort to his preferred option. We remember that up to the United States congressional elections taking place in November last year he said that sanctions were working. Senator Robert Bird summed the situation up perfectly in the New York Times when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a superpower has claws and it has teeth. The superpower, as against this third world power, doesn't have to be impatient or impetuous. A superpower doesn't have to feel rushed. We can afford to be patient and let sanctions work. They say the morale of our soldiers will suffer. Mr President, we should have thought about this before we proceeded to double our forces and terminate the rotation policy in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the situation that existed at that time. The hypocrisy of the military solution to the current crisis in the Gulf is further exposed when we look at the attitude of the United States Administration towards Iraq prior to the invasion of Kuwait. Professor Robert Springborg in the Australian Journal of International Affairs, in an article on the origins of the Gulf crisis, points out that the historical records show that from 1988 to 1990 the United States Administration supported Iraq and worked assiduously to head off congressional attempts to chastise Saddam for human rights abuses, violation of bilateral economic agreements and attempts to smuggle weapon technology out of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate initiative led by Clairbourne Pell and Jesse Helms to impose sanctions on Iraq for using poisonous gas against its Kurdish population was defeated by the Reagan Administration in the House. The United States declined to join 12 other Western nations in demanding a United Nations inquiry into Iraq's treatment of its own population. The United States Administration sacked a voice of an American employee who had presented editorials critical of Iraq's human rights record. President Bush refused to join worldwide appeals for clemency for the British Iranian journalist and alleged spy, Farzad Bazoft. </PARA>
<PARA> In the weeks before the invasion, the United States Administration, increasingly under pressure for its pro-Iraq policy, shifted its justification to the position that trade sanctions would hurt American farmers and businessmen without swaying Baghdad in the least. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1990, last year, the Bush Administration-I repeat, the Bush Administration-opposed trade sanctions in the Congress. On 25 July the United States Ambassador to Iraq was instructed to assure Saddam that the United States had no position on this dispute with Kuwait. Most significantly of all, two days before the invasion, the State Department declared that the United States had no obligation to come to Kuwait's aid if it was attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> So I find it very strange when people talk about appeasement, as did Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator Bishop before her. Mention Chamberlain and it is a bit embarrassing when one considers the hypocrisy of President Bush and, before him, President Reagan's Administration. Because of the great respect for the institution of the American presidency and the fact that we are at war, there is a natural reluctance to criticise President Bush, to subject his actions to critical analysis. But the sordid support for Hussein for years; the supply of arms-of course, that occurred with many other countries-the intelligence during the Iran war and the political support, even up to two days before the invasion, are an indictment of President Bush. That is my position. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with all those who have expressed the hope that the United Nations will become a more effective organisation with the end of the Cold War. Senator Giles's speech earlier tonight most eloquently outlined that position that we, in the Australian Labor Party, have long held dear. We have championed the United Nations since its inception. </PARA>
<PARA> I respect all those who have the view that they must support this motion because of the United Nations' involvement. I appreciate their sincere belief that this will lead to a strengthening of the United Nations. But when I see the United States using the United Nations as a rallying call today, I cannot help but remember that both the Reagan and the Bush administrations have spent the last 10 years disparaging the United Nations at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the United States has refused to pay its dues and has ignored the ruling of the United Nations International Court of Justice against the United States mining of harbours in Nicaragua. That was not so long ago; perhaps people have selectively forgotten it. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have a completely different situation-we have the exact opposite. Now the United States is the main support for the United Nations, carrying 90 per cent or so of the human and economic burden in this war. The US is the enforcer for the United Nations and, as such, it cannot afford to get tired. This is the point I want to make. If the prolonged ground war which is now being predicted happens, America may get tired. It may get tired if it is a protracted war with heavy US casualties. As has been pointed out in the US media, this could be the last attempt at such a solution if the war drags on because the United States will carry the burden both in human and financial commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that if the United Nations fails in the Middle East and if volatile public opinion turns against costly involvement in the Middle East, instead of ushering in a new world order we will see the United States in particular retreat to isolation, which previously has been a characteristic in its history. </PARA>
<PARA> My criticism of President Bush might cause people to think that I am being anti-American. Nothing could be further from the truth because a great deal of my opposition is based on United States sources. After all, President Bush took a divided Congress into the war. While I appreciate that during the war the criticism will be muted, I believe that that divided country will be very critical in a short time if, as I suspect, this war becomes more protracted than we might have been led to believe at first. </PARA>
<PARA> My opposition to the war is also based on a need I feel to articulate a genuine opposition, shared by countless thousands of people in my State, to the war. I have been active in the peace and disarmament movement in my State for over 30 years. For the past 10 years I have been the convener of the Sydney Nuclear Disarmament Coordinating Committee. We have organised each year a Palm Sunday march and rally. Several times during the past decade we have had over 150,000 people march through the streets of Sydney. Several times the number of people who turn out has gone up and down. But I must answer the criticisms made of the peace movement by so many honourable senators in this debate because once again people are marching. They are expressing their basic democratic right to show their concern. Some 10,000 or 20,000 people may be marching in Sydney or Melbourne, and I can assure honourable senators that those numbers will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of my involvement, I regret some of the attacks that have been made. It is pretty easy to pick on young people sitting in the gallery who are inexperienced and who are reacting emotionally because they are very concerned. I think all the pros in this chamber know they are attacking straw people. I think it would be far fairer if people such as Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who just spoke, acknowledged that the peace movement is simply a mass movement of people who are agitated and concerned about the threat of war, instead of criticising these abstract people. This Parliament ignores at its own peril the views of such a broad cross- section of the community which opposes the escalation of war. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the priority should be a dialogue between the Government, the Parliament and concerned people. Certainly that is what I will be attempting to do. I believe it is essential that we increase the community's understanding of the complexity of the issues involved, particularly in the Middle East. For example, I for one do not accept that everybody in the peace movement is reacting with little knowledge. They will not get a lot if they are watching television. They will not necessarily get both sides of the story watching American television. I think it is essential that we try to have debate in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I praise everybody. I think the debate in this Parliament has been part of that process. I certainly commend it. I think the contributions from all parts of the chamber have been excellent. I have no doubt that the peace movement will organise at a higher and better level in the universities, schools, workplaces and churches and conduct seminars, teach-ins and discussions, which are essential in raising the level of debate. Rather than abuse people, I believe we should all encourage this debate. Abuse on any side of the argument is absolutely destructive and should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the nature of the peace movement, one might forget its many component parts. I would firstly like to mention the present outstanding unity, which I have not seen before, within the religious community-within all the churches and the Muslim faith. People from the various churches and the Muslim faith are actually working together. This is very inspiring. They are participating in the rallies and in the discussions which have taken place. They are concerned about the casualties and the suffering of the war, including the refugees. Many are concerned about the issues I previously mentioned, and particularly whether war was only an action of last resort. They are troubled that the war will not promote a just peace and, with all of us, they are concerned about the environmental, human and psychological damage caused by a war that will last for generations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have petitions and letters from officers of some of the largest unions in Australia who have expressed to me their concern and opposition to the war. They have many different views, and that is my point. I feel that I have a responsibility to try to bring their views to the attention of the Parliament and the people. If possible, I have a responsibility finally to get a consensus in order to reach agreement in Australia to encourage the excellent initiative that Prime Minister Hawke announced only this week in trying to work with other world leaders. I commend him for that. It was an initiative which resulted from discussions in the Government party. I believe that sort of thing is very commendable and should happen even more often than it has until now. The views of the people whom I have described and of members of political parties must be taken into consideration; I believe it is absolutely essential that discussion takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other problems. The issue of the Palestinian homeland is a tragedy which must be addressed. If there is one strange thing-and not because of what Saddam Hussein has said-it is that people across the world now recognise that finally the issue of justice for the Palestinians has reached fruition. I commend that at least as one of the positive things to arise from this conflict. For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot support the first two paragraphs of the motion. So, for the only time in my life, I will abstain from voting with the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in this debate I must pick up one absolutely extraordinary point made in the previous speaker's address. I do not deny Senator Childs's right to hold the position he takes, but his comments in relation to President Bush and Americans must apply equally to all other countries involved in the United Nations' actions. I am saddened that the United States of America was selected so singularly. What he said must also apply, if it is his belief, to the Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are faced with the serious situation which has developed in the Middle East and a debate on Australia's commitment to the United Nations in terms of the various resolutions carried by that body. I strongly support the motion before us. I strongly support the position adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and in particular the leadership of Dr John Hewson in publicly seeking a bipartisan approach to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> When I became a member of this chamber on 1 July last year, the last thing I would have wished to debate this day was the commitment of Australians to a war theatre. Nonetheless, invasion, looting, raping, torture, murder and other atrocities have been committed. I believe they would continue indefinitely if the United Nations did not stand up and say, `No more' and then be prepared to enforce that. It should be noted that these atrocities have been committed against a small, defenceless country. I do not wish to go over all the points that have been made by previous speakers; however, I do wish to emphasise some. In doing so, I wish to state that nobody wants peace more than I and, having listened to all speakers in this debate, I know that all want peace. The difference is how we resolve the issue. Do we have a continuation of the sanctions and diplomacy or direct intervention?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe claims that the sanctions would have worked. I do not deny that they were inflicting some pain, but who was bearing that pain? It was not President Hussein, not his elite force, not his army or air force but ordinary Iraqis, the people in the street, the remaining people of Kuwait. Unfortunately, diplomacy has clearly failed. The Secretary-General of the United Nations worked overtime. Many countries tried. Saddam Hussein rebuffed and rebuked them all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some indisputable facts: the war started on 2 August, not 17 January; Iraq is the aggressor; Iraq has an enormous and very potent armory; Saddam Hussein would not have been satisfied with just Kuwait; Saddam Hussein has no respect for human life or sovereign boundaries; Saddam Hussein rejected all reasonable and rational approaches for a negotiated settlement-paramount in this was an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait; Saddam Hussein was producing more horrific arms and digging himself in-not for peace, but war; not to leave Kuwait, but to stay; not to be compassionate to Kuwaitis, but to be cruel. I believe to have waited longer would only have made this situation worse. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate I wish to give notice of a number of flow-on issues that emerge from the Gulf crisis. In doing so I wish to acknowledge and congratulate President Bush of the United States. He is the man who has shown leadership. He has, through strength and not weakness, given us a chance for a new world order. We will have to examine carefully our future role in this new world order. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the issue of our trade with the Middle East. Our exports to the region are worth some $2 billion per annum. Our imports cost some $1.5 billion per annum. The region is of immense importance to Australia and Australia is of enormous importance to the Middle East. Therefore, it is important that the Government develop a strategy to deal with this part of the flow-on effects. It is imperative that the burden in Australia be shared as equitably as possible between industries and individuals. This is a responsibility of the Parliament and should be subject to further debate and discussion. It is essential that at this time of conflict and crisis which requires our utmost attention, we do not neglect other matters of vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I must comment on the unfortunate bias shown in recent days by the peace movement in and around this building. I will never understand why the United States and Australia are selectively targeted by the protesters-organised, orchestrated protesters. Why has not Iraq been targeted with equal vigour, when it is Iraq which invaded Kuwait on 2 August? Equally, it saddens me that the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine so publicly align themselves with the group which has been here. They in fact encourage the group we have seen behave so badly over the last two days-a group whose selective activities are encouraging Hussein to stay in Kuwait. If they have any moral fibre and consistency, they will also target the perpetrator-the invader, the butcher of Baghdad. I do not deny the protesters' right to freedom of speech. I just plead for fairness and consistency. As I said before, we all want peace. Let us all target the culprit and, hence, end the occupation of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> My thoughts and best wishes go to those now living in Australia who originate from the Middle East; to the members of our forces serving in the Middle East; to the families of those serving on our behalf-in fact, to all who have been called to serve under the United Nations Charter. There are many other issues I could pursue. However, they have been well covered by other speakers in a series of excellent speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the lessons of the beginning of the Second World War should teach us that we will not win peace by appeasement, by allowing a dictator to walk over a small country and saying `Stop'-because he will walk over another when it suits him. We will only win peace by strength. Hussein will only leave Kuwait when he recognises the United Nations is serious. I hope and pray that is soon and that we have a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Peace will survive only if we have the fortitude to defend it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to discuss all of the relevant issues in this conflict, but I want just briefly to explain my position. It is easy to support talk of attacking installations; of attacking Saddam Hussein; of pushing him out of Kuwait; of concentrating on the Iraqi leader and his being a dictator and responsible for appalling actions. But such talk avoids the reality that it is people, real Iraqi people, not just their leaders, who are being attacked in our name-young people and old people, innocent and guilty, no matter how one defines innocence and guilt. So I cannot put out of my mind the real victims of this horror: the allied military casualties, the Iraqi military casualties and the even greater innocents-the civilian casualties, the refugees, and the survivors who will continue suffering long after those who are killed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it impossible to justify killing some people in the hope that that will prevent others being killed or otherwise abused. It is not even as though it is the responsible tyrant who is being made to suffer personally. I have a basic opposition to the use of force. I do not agree that Iraq's violence or anyone's violence justifies violence in return. I condemn the use of force by anyone, and I am appalled by the reported Iraqi abuses of human rights. So in no way can my attitude be construed as pro-Iraq. I deplore the invasion of Kuwait as much as anyone else does. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an attitude of preference for avoiding the use of force to solve conflict. I continually ask myself: how does aggression prove that aggression is wrong? Perhaps some indication of my revulsion is that while I have of course heard and read descriptions of the television coverage of this war, I have watched not one minute of that television coverage: I could not bear to do so. I am in a position where I would not go to war myself, so how can I ask others to do so? How could I, in all conscience? I cannot. I have anguished deeply over this problem. I oppose this war and all war. The cost, and the terrible waste involved of humans and of other resources, is abhorrent to me, as I know it is to most people. </PARA>
<PARA> I just cannot come to grips with the concept of a just war or a war that is justified. That probably means that I am an absolute pacifist. That I am a pacifist is certain, but that that pacifism is absolute is less certain. I think I can be absolutely certain about that only if I have been continuously a pacifist until I die. I am pleased that most people recognise that one can genuinely hold the pacifist position and that they respect the legitimacy of that position; I trust it is only a minority here who use it as a term of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am doing is not at all easy for me. I think it would be a lot easier to go along with the clear majority in the Government, supporting the motion endorsing our involvement. I could easily justify it on the ground of solidarity. In fact, it pains me at this moment not to be supporting my comrades, including many for whom I have great respect and who have put their support for Australian involvement very powerfully. I cannot possibly list all the twists and turns of my thinking on this issue or the reasoning that has led me to this position, but I think it is clear that I have grappled with my conscience over this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have consistently accepted, supported and strongly argued for collective decision-making within the Australian Labor Party, and I have consistently observed it rigorously. I never thought I would be in this position of seeking to be excused from supporting a Caucus decision. So it is with a terrible feeling in my guts that I do so and indicate that I intend abstaining from the vote on the motion endorsing the war and our involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been previous instances where I have disagreed with the collective decision but then supported it. So why am I treating this one differently? I suppose it is because it is a question of war and peace, of authorising aggression. It is so big that it has pushed me over that line. I am aware of the risk of being accused of grandstanding. I hope that it is obvious that I am not seeking to do that but, having been faced with what I have felt is a terrible dilemma, I have had to decide to which of the conflicting principles I have to give priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not be going out of my way to add to the inevitable publicity about this. In fact, when I have finished this speech I will have said all I want to say. I would be most unhappy about my position if I thought that other Labor colleagues felt pressed or that I was taking the luxury of a position that others wished also to take but felt unable to take. But I feel reassured that, while some may have wished for some of the wording to have been different, and have gone through a lot of anguish about this issue themselves, those who are supporting the commitment do so not only because of the Caucus decision in which they have participated but, at least on balance, because of their own genuine beliefs, which I understand and respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I say now that I will not tolerate criticism of my colleagues for supporting the motion. I sincerely hope that I have not made things more difficult for them. I trust that it is clear how my position differs. All I ask for is the understanding of those of my colleagues who think I am doing the wrong thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also answer the accusation which could be made that this is a token action on my part and that it is not significant because the overwhelming majority will ensure that the motion is carried and that the Government is not at risk. That point is true, but the action is highly significant to me. I never thought that I would be in this position. I have carefully worked through the issues and with much trepidation reached the position of not supporting the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are parts of the motion I could support, but I think I would be kidding myself if I tried to use that as a justification for overlooking the main parts. For instance, I am not critical of the Australian defence forces. In fact, my feeling for them and for their families and friends left behind is as great as for anyone. I do not want to see even one Australian hurt in this operation. This is why I have refused to agree simplistically with calls for immediate withdrawal of the ships, which I assume might put them in even greater danger than they are at present. Of course, I support the United Nations' role for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I am not doing this because of some assessment that the majority of Australians oppose the war. I suspect that at the moment the clear majority of Australians support it, although with various degrees of dissatisfaction. It is a significant number, but a minority, who oppose our involvement. I am speaking from a personal perspective, but it is also true that I am thereby representing many people. I do not think it is necessary for the Parliament to give unanimous support to the motion. If it did, it would be a misrepresentation of the range of views in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I attended the protest meeting in Hobart on Monday of last week and I marched in Hobart on Saturday. I hope it does not have to be said that I am therefore guilty by association with every statement or chant uttered by every other participant. I am not a chanter by nature, anyway. However, I emphasise that there were many highly respected members of the Tasmanian community who last Saturday expressed their opposition to the war. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of opposition to the war, there is one thing I want to say about the demonstrations in the parliamentary galleries over the past two days. I think it is probably important that someone speaking from the position I have taken should say this. While of course I do not underestimate how strongly people feel, I do wish that those who protested had not taken it on themselves actually to disrupt proceedings. I do not think it was of help to their cause or to my cause. In fact, it was counterproductive. It damn near made me rejoin the fold in solidarity with my comrades, as a greater need for that solidarity had arisen. I suggest that silent protest can be much more powerful and effective. At the same time, I implore those critical of certain demonstrators' behaviour not to generalise from the behaviour they disapprove of by extending blame to all those who march and rally for peace. One cannot blame the whole peace movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final point: the 4 December decision is one factor that has weighed heavily with me. I opposed it at the time because I feared the outcome which has now transpired. I should have opposed it more strongly, and perhaps so should a lot of others. I did not, but that does not lead me to conclude that I must therefore automatically go along meekly with the next step. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would like to see are new initiatives for negotiations and peace. However, I am terribly pessimistic of there being much chance of success in that direction at the moment. I fear that this war will go on and on, and, even worse, that it will escalate and lead to even more appalling turmoil and destruction in our world. I am deeply troubled by that and I do not want to be on the record as approving it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No issue is so clear that there is no room for dissent or disagreement, and this is particularly so on this issue, which is probably the most important that any of us in this chamber will be required to determine. But the consequences of the decisions each of us take have to bear examination. The consequences of the decisions to be taken, for example, by the Australian Democrats and by a few members of the Australian Labor Party have to be examined with the same scrutiny through which the actions of those of us who are voting with the Government have been examined and attacked by the Australian Democrats, by the demonstrators, and by those who chose to disturb and disrupt the proceedings of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The same intellectual scrutiny should apply and the same preparedness to recognise the consequences of their actions should be accepted by the people who have so enthusiastically denied the merit of the position that the great bulk of this chamber has taken, the great bulk of parliamentarians in Australia and the great bulk of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest polls show that 75 per cent of the Australian population support the concept of military intervention of one kind or another in the Gulf. That is not mentioned by me in order to say, `Look, the majority of people support it; therefore it must necessarily be right'. But it does indicate that when people like Senator Powell come into this chamber and pretend to us that a rowdy minority in that gallery represents the majority opinion of Australians, and when that rowdy minority seeks to disrupt and to influence us here, I think we have to recognise what reality is. When I hear people like Senator Powell posing as the possessor of all wisdom and the right to judge what the majority of Australians really want, then I must say I have the instinctive uneasiness that comes when I hear anyone who claims to have some special access to knowledge, some special understanding which is denied the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA> What strikes me most about the consequences of the course of action taken by those people voting against this motion-this resolution of support for the action taken under the auspices of the United Nations-who are saying that we should give peace a chance, as if those of us supporting this resolution are somehow opposed to peace, is that the consequences of those actions are--</PARA>

She has, naturally, left the chamber when being attacked.

I stress that this holy war called by Saddam Hussein is totally phoney and is not supported at all by the Koran or by the Islamic community. I know that it will interrupt and interfere with the wall of nonsense, of obfuscation, that has descended across Senator Vallentine's intellect. We are only too well aware of what Senator Vallentine's objectives are, because we have seen them clearly in the press release that she put out on 21 January. She said that she will move amendments to the Prime Minister's statement calling for `a denial of information to Israel by Nurrungar which would be crucial for their use of Patriot missiles as such a contribution negates Australia's official policy of even-handedness in the Palestine-Israel conflict'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This woman professes to be a peace lover and here she is objecting to Israel having access to missiles whose purpose is to prevent missiles coming from Iraq to destroy, kill and maim innocent civilians in Israel. What sort of a woman is this who can put out this sort of stuff? What are her motives? This is what I believe we have to look at when we are wondering what are the consequences of people like Senator McLean and Senator Vallentine opposing this motion and putting their opposition in terms, such as Senator Vallentine has done, which can have but one consequence, and that is assisting the interests of the aggressor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the time we hear these people saying, `Ah, yes, if you gave the sanctions a chance-that is what you should be doing'. This is what we have heard from this corner non-stop. They have been saying, `If you gave the sanctions a chance. We're not involved in appeasement. Don't call us appeasers. We're not appeasers'. We heard this from every one of them. They said, `We're not appeasers. We believe in sanctions. We want action to be taken'. We believe in talk, talk, talk, but we must not attack them as appeasers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that what we have to recognise, very simply, is that not one of the people who spoke on this issue said, `Yes, we think that sanctions should have been given a greater go and if in 18 months they had failed, we would then support military action'. Not one of them said it because, in fact-and I guess we can find the answer simply-not one of them believes that in any circumstance military action can be justified. That is the reality. Otherwise, why did one of them not say so? In other words, there is a simple rationalising of their objection to war on any grounds. That is their honest position. </PARA>
<PARA> This bit about giving sanctions a chance is a disgraceful and totally dishonest smokescreen. If it was not a smokescreen, why did we not hear one of them say, `Yes, okay, we would have accepted this motion had in fact sanctions been given a greater chance'. And not one of them said it. Why? It is because they are as a group morally bankrupt; because they are not prepared to accept and to admit to this chamber that there is nothing that in their view will justify Australia going to war. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is an even more significant and disturbing consequence of their actions, and that is that they, like their colleagues around the rest of the world, have given Saddam Hussein the totally false impression-and I hope it remains totally false-that the rest of the world will stand idly by because deep in the heart of every nation which wants to stand against him there is an overwhelming, growing, significant element which, like the Democrats and Senator Vallentine, would never under any circumstances take action to resist a tyrant. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that that expectation is exactly the same expectation that Adolf Hitler had when he took the view that the British would not stand up to him-and he was well-informed about that; it is alleged even by the man who was supposed to be the future king. Hitler took exactly the same view and was equally misinformed. The reality is-and it must be evident to anyone-that Saddam Hussein took the view that he could literally get away with murder and pillage. He thought he could get away with it because there was a soft underbelly to the West represented by peaceniks, who in the end in fact become warniks because they bring forward a greater confidence in a tyrant that he can get away with it. This, I believe, is the burden that these sorts of people around the world have to carry on their conscience. They have encouraged a tyrant like Saddam Hussein to take the view that the West would not stand up to him. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine had at one stage, anywhere in this debate, said, `Yes, there may be a time when we would support military intervention, but it is not now', I could not and would not be making this charge against them. They did not because at no stage would they be prepared to do so. What a different party they are from the party under Don Chipp. I hope everyone in this chamber read what Mr Chipp said about `beware of the bleeding hearts' in last Saturday's paper. If that remark is not an indictment by ex-Senator Chipp of his former, and now, I must say, debased, Party, I do not know what is. His is a powerful and reasonable article. </PARA>

<PARA> Mountains of nonsense was written in the Sydney Morning Herald today. I do not know what the group that is almost a commune that seems to be running the Sydney Morning Herald these days is on about, but the most appalling garbage was written in the Sydney Morning Herald which in lineage far exceeded its reporting of the debate here. If it had read the debate it would have seen that the points that were made and the so-called informed comments were all more than adequately answered and severely dealt with in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event it is quite clear that except for a small number of countries the international community has condemned the invasion and reacted, through what is described in the briefing to us from the Department of the Parliamentary Library research service, as an unprecedented consensus by passing 12 resolutions in the Security Council of the United Nations. Now surely if there is moral support for the position being taken by the Government, which is supported by the Opposition, it is that unprecedented support through the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Because time is running out I will move quickly to one of the problems that concerns me seriously, and that is the extent to which the Muslim community in Australia has been quite improperly and disgracefully attacked by some people when the reality of their position is very largely exactly the opposite to the one for which they are being insulted. The great bulk of the Muslim community in fact belongs to and attends mosques and community associations which are heavily funded and subsidised by the Saudi Government with whom we are allied in this matter. One of the reasons those mistaken attacks on the Islamic community here go on is because Saddam Hussein has quite improperly called this war a jihad, a holy war. That of course is absolutely ludicrous. You cannot have a holy war against other believers. A holy war is only against disbelievers. </PARA>

As a result this call as if it were a holy war has confused many people, I believe, and certainly has caused distress within the Muslim community in Australia which regrettably has been divided on a whole lot of different grounds in recent years, and there have been very many bitter disputes. I do not want to exacerbate those disputes, but I must say that there are some religious groups in Australia which are funded by the Iraqis directly. I believe that that funding and those links, and some very pro-Iraqi statements that have come from people in those groups, put a special responsibility on the members of those groups and the spokesmen for those groups to remember that they are now Australians and in Australia, and that that is where their primary allegiance must lie. It is not a question of should lie; it is where their primary allegiance must lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I presume that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and whoever else is responsible is closely examining the whole question of the terrorist threat which is obviously a matter of some concern around the world. I am not suggesting that members of those communities I have just spoken about are likely candidates, but I would remind the Senate of the ASIO report of only last year. This follows on a recent report in the Sunday Age which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's security services fear Iraq will launch an international terror campaign against the member countries of the international coalition in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>We have already had a question at question time today about what happened to four entry visas from Nigeria which magically seem to have disappeared, and the people seem to have disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know whether there is a security threat involved or where the Nigerian entry visas came from. We have the right to expect a very speedy reply to that kind of situation. I remind the Senate that the ASIO report said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia continues to play host to a number of representatives of foreign intelligence services from various countries, whose activities are regarded as hostile to Australia's interests. Over the past year ASIO has discovered a higher level of representation and activity in Australia by some hostile intelligence services than had been previously known or suspected. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . the threat from these services has been shown to be significant. The lowering of world tensions over the past year arising from political reforms in some countries has not reduced the level of activity of hostile intelligence services. </PARA>
<PARA>When I was dealing with this report I noted this as a matter of great significance because we are in an environment in which the general view is that the detente between the East and the West should lead to a relaxation of our guard. Australia simply cannot afford to lower its guard against the threat of hostile intelligence services operating in this country. I hope that it has not simply taken the present problem to generate that interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now return very briefly to the question of whether this can possibly be a jihad and whether the Muslim community around the world is or is not supporting Saddam Hussein. It has been mentioned in this debate that a large number of the 28 nations actively participating in the United Nations supported actions are Islamic nations. One of them, Saudi Arabia, is probably the key nation of all of the Islamic nations, being the centre of the most holy places. On 29 November last Sheikh al-Sabah of Kuwait addressed the United Nations and said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our goal is peace. Our Islamic faith advocates peace and enjoins us to work earnestly and sincerely for peace. But, by the same token, true Islam makes it incumbent upon us all to resist aggression and not to yield in submission to the aggressor. Perhaps God the Almighty has defined for us a prescription for fair and just recourse in the face of such an aggression, for God says in the Holy Koran:</PARA>
<PARA> If two parties among the believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace between them:-</PARA>
<PARA>`Hear, hear!', we should all say-</PARA>
<PARA> but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then fight ye (all) against the one that transgresses until it complies with the command of God; but if it complies, then make peace between them with justice, and be fair: for God loves those who are fair (and just). </PARA>
<PARA>There is a clear admonition, if you like, in The Holy Koran for an aggressor to be resisted. It is with that confidence that the Saudis and their colleagues are resisting the aggressor, the man who is using and misusing the Islamic faith for political and personal and disgraceful and dishonest reasons. The Koran also states:</PARA>
<PARA>True justice accords with Allah's Law. </PARA>
<PARA>Follow not men's selfish desires,</PARA>
<PARA>But Allah's Will, which was revealed</PARA>
<PARA>To Moses and Jesus, and now to Muhammad. </PARA>
<PARA>Take not for friends and protectors</PARA>
<PARA>Those in whose hearts is a disease-</PARA>
<PARA>To whom religion is a mockery</PARA>
<PARA>Or a plaything-who worship evil-</PARA>
<PARA>what a magnificent description of Saddam Hussein-</PARA>
<PARA>Proclaim the Truth of Allah, and be</PARA>
<PARA>Not afraid. Eschew their iniquities,</PARA>
<PARA>Which were denounced by David</PARA>
<PARA>And Jesus. But recognise with justice</PARA>
<PARA>Those who are sincere and humble,</PARA>
<PARA>Though they may be themselves</PARA>
<PARA>Not of your flock, if they witness to Truth. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is another admonition for the Saudis to bring in people, whom Senator Tate might suggest could otherwise be described as infidels, to be part of the fight for truth, for they witness the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is always difficult on a major issue to dismiss the thought that there is no room for dissent. Obviously there is room for dissent. Obviously there is room for disagreement. But let all those who dissent from this motion, who dis-agree with it, recognise the consequences of their actions, that among the major consequences of those actions are that they bolster the aggressor and make the peaceful outcome we all seek so much more difficult. </PARA>

However, eight senators out of the 76 in the Senate have spoken against the motion and I wish to confine my remarks to Senator Vallentine and the Australian Democrats. The Democrats' view can be summarised as a plea for more time. It reminds me of Samuel Beckett's play, Waiting for Godot. Two days ago a reply came to them from their former leader, Mr Chipp, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>

In another place this evening my colleague Don Dobie reminded us that 400 officers were executed by the Iraqis when a reverse occurred in the war against Iran and that 167 Iraqi officers were executed when there was a reverse in the war against, and occupation of, Kuwait. Yet the Democrats plead for more time-time to stockpile and manufacture chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. I refer them also to an article by Malcolm Browne which appeared in the New York Times on 18 November last year. He states:</PARA>

This fuel could be used to make one crude nuclear weapon relatively quickly, although it is regularly inspected by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that it has not been diverted to military use. Several weeks ago Iraq invited the Agency to conduct a new inspection, suggesting that Baghdad has no immediate military plans for the fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> Other speculations have been based on seizures by European governments of materials and components bound for Iraq that could be used for the production of nuclear weapons. In March 1990, British Customs officials, acting on information from the United States authorities, seized a shipment of special capacitors consigned to Iraq. That is no speculation. Such devices can store electricity and release it in a millionth of a second as a powerful pulse. Iraq has planned nuclear weapons of this type for many years. As a matter of fact, on 15 July German Customs officials in Frankfurt seized a consignment of Swiss-made machinery which was bound for Iraq. The shipment consisted of items fabricated from high-strength, corrosion-resistant steel essential for the construction of gas centrifuges-advanced devices capable of separating fissionable uranium 235 from its inert isotope, uranium 238. </PARA>

<PARA> Yellowcake must be subjected to a complex series of processes to produce fissionable uranium 235. Polish engineers who were held briefly as human shields by Iraq have stated that the first chemical steps of that process are already being performed at a large chemical plant at Al Qaim north-west of Baghdad. The end chemical product in this complex chain is uranium hexafluoride, a gas needed for the isotope separation process in which bomb fuel is produced. It is a matter of speculation how quickly a full scale uranium separation plant might eventually be built. </PARA>
<PARA> The Simon Wiesenthal Foundation of Los Angeles has circulated a list of more than 200 companies in Europe, Asia and the United States that have supplied Iraq with materials and technologies potentially needed by a nuclear weapons industry. Iraq has three nuclear research laboratories at Mosul, Erbil and Tuwaitha. And the Democrats want to give them more time. </PARA>

<PARA> I now want to refer to Senator Vallentine. It is a matter of historical record that 144 nations condemned Iraq at the United Nations. Forty nations agreed to provide or help sustain military forces. Four nations in fact voted against this: Jordan, Cuba, Yemen and North Korea. I would not try to persuade Senator Vallentine. She said, according to yesterday's Hansard, that the world has not agreed to go to war; that only 28 countries had agreed. She and her followers in the gallery yesterday have a similar characteristic, an ability to believe their own rhetoric which for them becomes their truth, a schizoid-type reaction. I have treated many like her and her followers in the past. Senator Vallentine needs the help of myself and another medically qualified person. I would contrast this rabble with the 400 young Australians who yesterday signed up as members of the armed forces. </PARA>

<PARA> Perhaps when we meet again in February, we can remember these lessons when we are talking about our economic problems. Why can we not work together to try to solve our economic and resultant social problems in the future? I challenge the Government to this end, as there is time to achieve a common end in the interests of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Peace is about fullness, health, positive life with coherence and justice and complete development, but not at the expense of others. Peace is positive and secure. But I am not a pacifist, and neither was the one I have quoted-Jesus, the son of David the King. I regard pacifism as an idealist distortion to be rejected. Of course, I respect the handful of Australians who are conscientious pacifists, and there is only one senator in this chamber who is a pacifist. It is my view that taking the pacifist path often frustrates the achievement of genuine peace, and it has always been so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Achieving peace requires the resisting of evil. Peace requires the protection of the innocent and the defenceless. Peace requires us to stand between the aggressor and the victim to take the aggressor's blows but, more often, to disarm the aggressor and stop the aggressor. Winning peace requires action to resist evil, but the action is qualified by restraint and is subject to the objective of securing an enduring peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The resisting of evil is more often required of a community than of an individual. We support police forces, except where they become corrupt or officious. The resisting of evil is certainly required at a national level. The necessity of a strong defence force is the experience of every nation. The objective of these forces is to secure peace. Only a pacifist would want to abandon any police force or any national defence force. These are the principles I have understood since I was a teenager. They are derived, as for millions of Australians-and for millions of christians in this country-from reading the scriptures, a study of history and open discussion. For example, when I was an undergraduate I studied in detail the rise and fall of Nazi Germany and of Japan, and the lessons of the Second World War period in Europe and in Asia, but my study of history is not confined to these recent episodes. At that time I was directed to Dietrich Bonhoeffer's experience and writings in Germany. Ever since, I have identified with his assessment of war and peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not surprised, then, that Senator Tate, in his moving speech yesterday, referred to Dietrich Bonhoeffer in underlining conclusions which he personally had reached-conclusions which I share. Senator Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I find it impossible to maintain that it is never justified to use military force to remove a tyrant. </PARA>
<PARA> I have moved to the same painful conclusion as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great famous German pastor, who found himself against every previous understanding he had of the claims of the gospel. This great pastor, particularly amongst the youth of Germany, involved himself in the assassination plot against Hitler because he came to the painful, reluctant conclusion that he had to be part of the process of removing a tyrant who was claiming the lives of so many innocent victims. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1984 I was a founding member-an original co-convener-of the all-party Parliamentary Peace and Disarmament Group. I am still a member and still a co-convener. I had the encouragement of my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties to do so. Particularly in 1988, the International Year of Peace, the group had a very active program of activities engaging the attention of the super-powers and the other nuclear-armed nations. </PARA>
<PARA> We continue within our several parties to work for an initial 50 per cent cut in nuclear weapons and a disarmament which is not unilateral but mutually accepted and verifiable. We work for the total elimination of chemical weapons and the strengthening of the Non-proliferation Treaty, the eventual ban of all nuclear weapons tests and the most stringent safeguards on the use of uranium for the generation of electric energy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a part of the peace movement. I represent the Opposition on the Australian Government's advisory committee on peace and disarmament. I have contributed to the review of the Australian National University Peace Research Centre, successfully urging its greater concentration on strategic international peace issues, including the effectiveness of deterrents and the effectiveness of the joint Australian-American facilities, including Pine Gap and Nurrungar. In 1988, the International Year of Peace, I led the first Liberal Party contingent in the Palm Sunday peace marches, and our banner motto of `peace through strength' boldly expressed the conviction shared by the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I conscientiously believe that the ethics to which I have referred lead in a reasonable and just way to the pursuit of peace through strength. This has been the means to end the Cold War. We would not have the Gorbachev-Bush accord, the new atmosphere in international relations, and the end of the Cold War had not our allies pursued peace through strength. This has been the means to peace. It is also a principle endorsed by the United Nations Charter, by the United Nations decisions since 2 August and the series of 12 resolutions adopted overwhelmingly by the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council that were referred to very directly by Senator Brownhill and by Senator Jones. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on the basis of peace through strength that I speak and endorse Australia's actions in the Gulf. I appeal to all senators, not least the minority of 11, 12 or 13 senators who dissent, many of whom share the values and explicitly the Christian ethics to which I have referred. I am convinced, for six or seven specific reasons, to which I will briefly and shortly refer, that the Australian defence contingent should be part of the United Nations sanctioned multinational force of some 40 countries now actively engaged in military action against Saddam Hussein and against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> I want Australians serving in the Gulf to know that we have confidence in them and that we support them, not just out of Australian solidarity but because we believe it is right that they be there. They are acting for us in resisting evil, and they are acting with restraint and in the firm hope of eventually being successful in securing peace. The overwhelming majority of members of this Parliament and of the Australian people support our Navy contingent on the Sydney, Melbourne and Success, and on Westralia which is now heading north-west to relieve Success. We support our defence medical teams, our logistics group, and those 20 or so defence personnel seconded to allied forces serving in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the motion before the Senate in this debate sets out this confidence in our armed forces and our support for them-support which has been directly referred to admirably by my colleague the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I take the opportunity, as the Minister did, to commend the contribution that our armed services make to our security. Those who give a life of service in this way, who know that in the event of hostilities it will be their lives that they commit for our protection, deserve much greater community recognition and support than they usually receive. This commendation includes their families, who make sacrifices simply by being service families but also know that their loved ones might be called upon at any time to make the supreme sacrifice. In commending Australia's forces in the Gulf, I include those who just as easily could be there. The Defence Force must know that we genuinely appreciate and recognise their key contribution to our society and our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA>What I have said up to this point is only a foundation for considering the actual elements of the present situation in the Gulf and for determining Australia's response to Iraq's invasion, occupation and destruction of Kuwait. All the evidence needs to be understood and evaluated. Even then, a judgment of whether to commit military force and when to act must be made. My judgment-and that of the Government and the Opposition-is that with the passing of the mid-January deadline that the United Nations had set and with the elapse now of 5 1/2 months of the Iraqi-induced war, the time is right to act by military means, as has happened by the United Nations sanctioned multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that a minority of honourable senators have made a contrary judgment. I respect their view but I strongly believe they are wrong. Senator Vallentine implies that the time to act in this way is never. Senator McLean said to this question, `I do not know'. Even to my interjection he acknowledged, `Yes. The evil goes on but I do not know'. Senator Spindler and Senator Kernot dissented, implying that military action should not at any time be entered into. At least they urged that military action be avoided, now that we have come to a supposed new enlightenment in the 1990s. They appealed to a nobler solution but did not convince me that there was any hope of it actually working. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reynolds, as a former Minister of this Government, gave a brave speech confessing to being unconvinced from the beginning that our ships should be in the Gulf. She said that she opposes their military action now. Senator Childs is in another category. I see that he is just entering the chamber. I am sure that we all listened to his careful and sincere speech, but he remains almost alone in his derogatory references to President Bush, in his actual views about Hussein's tactics and in what I see as an overestimation of the bite of sanctions. The great majority of us disagree with his assessments.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, dissent in the debate, being already concluded in the House of Representatives and being almost concluded here in the Senate, stands at less than 20 per cent in the Senate. Judging from those who have spoken, even taking into account my three colleagues who have already indicated their support for the motion in front of us, it may be a low as only a dozen-eight Australian Democrats, Senator Vallentine and two or three Government members. The rest of the Senate genuinely supports the five-part motion moved by the Government and strongly supported by the Opposition. In the House of Representatives the dissent was considerably lower than 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's public opinion polls show that 18 per cent have indicated their opposition to the multinational force and perhaps as many as 24 per cent are opposed to Australia's involvement in that multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming majority of the Australian public has been shown, by polling, to support the multinational force's military action in the Gulf this past week and Australia's involvement to the extent that has been decided. While I recognise the genuine judgment of those dozen-some of whom I particularly referred to just a moment ago-it is clear, not only from the numbers but also from the personal genuine statements of support made so variously towards the one end of supporting the five parts of this motion by the great majority of members of Parliament, that there is overwhelming support in this chamber and in the House of Representatives and among the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> I stand in this debate with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), not slavishly but having independently reached the same conclusion. I stand with my colleagues, Senator Hill and Senator Durack, and with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, and with the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, all of whose speeches yesterday I heard or, in the case of the House of Representatives, I have read. I stand with Senator Newman in her references to the Australian Defence Force, with Senator Campbell in his references to Australian youth and with Senator Reid in her references to some of the Australian media. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote two brief sections from the speeches given by Mr Hawke and Dr Hewson yesterday on this motion. These statements are typical of their sound contributions to the debate yesterday, and they are statements with which I fully agree. I quote the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision to commit Australian forces to this war in the Gulf is without historical precedent. Never has Australian military action been undertaken with such global consent and within such a broad alliance. We stand with a coalition of nations the like of which, in its diversity, strength and authority, has never before been assembled. Never have the nations of the world acted in such overwhelming concert to condemn and to reverse an action as they have in these last few months condemned and acted to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from Dr Hewson, whose speech I found excellent in all that he said in the House of Representatives yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian interests in the current Gulf crisis are real and they are vital. We cannot expect others to protect them for us. They are interests that go to the heart of our values as a nation and our hopes for a newer and better world. They require us to be clear-eyed about why this war began and about the only way it can be ended. They may well require us to be in for the long haul in what may well be a very difficult campaign. They require us not to lose our nerve. And they also require us not to let rightly expressed differences of opinion among us obscure what is at stake for us as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I now wish briefly to summarise the six or seven specific factors based on evidence that have led me to the conclusion I have now outlined. I do not ask the Australian public or honourable senators to be moved to this conclusion by considering one or two of these reasons but by considering all six or seven reasons which I will now address. Firstly, I am convinced that sanctions have not been politically effective. Moreover, I believe they had no prospect of being politically effective. They were tested over a period of five months. I am not saying that the sanctions themselves were ineffective because clearly they were an effective net against 95 per cent of items of trade-that is, against items that were otherwise entering or leaving Iraq. However, it had become clear over the five months that the sanctions would in that fashion remain at the 95 per cent net virtually forever without leading to any change of mind, any response or any political change in the decisions of the government of Iraq. They were not politically effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I believe that the attempts at diplomacy eventually failed. I do not suppose that in a period of four or five months there had ever been seen such intensity by the world through its diplomats, through its presidents, through its foreign ministers, to achieve the withdrawal of Iraq by diplomatic means. The Arab diplomacy had already failed by 2 August. The United Nations diplomacy failed despite stronger and stronger resolutions backed up by negotiation through 12 resolutions that have been referred to over these five months. Ultimately, there was the Secretary-General's, Perez de Cuellar's, tragic singular rejection by Saddam Hussein earlier this month. In particular, even the extraordinary diplomatic measures taken by the United States of America failed. On this point I briefly quote Senator Durack, the shadow Minister for Defence, who is here in the chamber. In his speech yesterday he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We in the Opposition would certainly want to emphasise the leading role that the United States has played in putting together that coalition of multinational force over these months. It has been a notable piece of diplomacy and leadership by the United States. But, of course, we must give credit to all those nations who have responded-as the Australian Government has responded, with the support of the Opposition-ever since these events commenced in August. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with those remarks and I agree with all those who have commended the United States for its diplomatic initiatives over the last five months with the support of the Soviet Union, China, France, the United Kingdom and of other nations immediate to the region-Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Syria. But my conclusion is that that diplomacy failed. The end point which was demonstrated abundantly in the first two weeks of this month was a slap in the face to all of them by Iraq and a total rejection, a total defiance, by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration is the brutality of Iraq which continues unrelenting day by day. I do not need to go over what more than 50 senators have already referred to in Iraq's aggression and its occupation of Kuwait-the murder, rape, looting, killing of children and the destruction of hospitals. Remember the capture of hostages-the thousands of hostages and eventually the 26 Australians-who were held against every international convention, who were held by a criminal Iraq. Now we have the intolerable news today that Iraq is beginning to treat prisoners of war in the same way as those hostages against all of the Geneva conventions. That is a criminal act by the Government of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are these offences continuing day by day, but the deception of the people of Iraq, by the Government and by Saddam Hussein in particular, has brutalised the people of Iraq by Hussein's distortion of Islam. Tell me of one imam in Australia who regards Hussein's interpretation of the Koran as orthodox or regards the brutalising of the people of Iraq, the hatred of Saddam Hussein of Israel and the allies in Saudi Arabia, his inciting of a jihad, his whipping up of religion and race as reasons to attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I give consideration to the greater threat to Israel and the holocaust to the Middle East that could have eventuated had there not been this intervention by the multinational force earlier this week. We have now seen the Iraqi attack on Israel, born out of Hussein's hatred; not out of any action or policy of Israel, not primarily out of the Palestinian issues. It is my view that Iraq's Scud missile attack on Israel this past week is intolerable; but it is also my view that it was inevitably coming from Iraq whatever happened this month. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference since 16 January is that the world can reasonably appeal to Israel not to hit back but to rely upon the multinational force that is in place to eliminate urgently the Scud missile launchers, the chemical weapons apparatus and any other equipment that Iraq is prepared to use in its unilateral attack on Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Should Israel react, the consequences will be an increasing disarray and a new polarisation in the Middle East. Even now there is no assurance that Israel will not be further provoked to respond. However, the actions this week by the multinational force have considerably relieved the danger that would have eventuated had such an attack been made unilaterally on Israel by Iraq without the multinational force being able to respond to eliminate that threat to Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, it was time to act to prevent Iraq developing chemical and nuclear weapons and other consolidations of its military equipment. Iraq already has chemical weapons, as we well know; Iraq is developing nuclear weapons. I believe that if more months had gone by we would have seen a greater threat to the countries of the region, indeed to world peace, with an enhanced militarised Iraq-five months of extra military preparation by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, I consider that it is time to act so that Iraq's hoped for tactic does not succeed. Here I disagree with Senator Childs in his comments on this very point. As I see it, Iraq hoped to call the bluff of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and even France to pursue the tactic of delay and more delay, and delay until even the people of our countries would hesitate and turn away from the resolve to act at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventhly and finally, the consideration in my mind is that there was a need for a response to defiance. Saddam Hussein was unquestionably defiant. There was a need to respond to ensure the credibility of the United Nations; to ensure that the multinational force was believable; that the statements made by our allies, indeed by our own country, were believable, that they were not idle threats; to ensure that the post-Cold War pattern of international relations is consolidated and goes in a positive direction; to demonstrate that invasion by an aggressor will in fact be resisted by the whole world; and to ensure that the Middle East is not left to the complete instability and disorder that would have followed. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion before us rightly refers to the security of Israel and to the resolution of the Palestinian issues. This is something which I am sure the majority of the Senate supports and is rightly a part of this motion. Senator Hill's remarks were particularly pertinent to these two elements of the instability in the Middle East over the past four decades. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by urging the Australian Government not only to act on the bases and for the reasons that have been set out by all of us in this Parliament, but to keep an open dialogue with the Australian people; to respond to the Australian people; and to ensure that we have in this Parliament and in the Government of Australia the full confidence of the Australian people. Finally, we pray for all those who are committed in this war, that they will see a successful peace. We pray for the families and the loved ones of those who are serving Australia and all nations in the Gulf, that they may see a speedy end to this war and the return of their loved ones. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before the chamber. The chronology of events leading to the situation in which the world finds itself has been well canvassed by other speakers, and I will not repeat it. It is sufficient to say that a small country, Kuwait, was attacked and occupied by a powerful neighbouring country, led by a person who is recognised as being a sadistic killer. Real fear existed that, having taken Kuwait, the next move by Iraq would almost certainly have been into Saudi Arabia, and hence the location of troops in that country and the subsequent sanctions. All forms of diplomacy were used to convince Saddam Hussein to withdraw, and they were all exhausted. The United Nations voted for military intervention if all else failed, and when all else was correctly perceived to have failed, the United States, sanctioned by the United Nations and supported by 40 countries, attacked strategic targets in Kuwait and Iraq.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No sane person wanted this war. Everyone views with horror the death, injuries and destruction which come with war. To go to war is the most difficult decision any government will ever take. To commit its armed forces to a war zone is one of the most serious and grave decisions that can be taken. The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, made the point in his address that the easiest way of winning publicity and cheap political points, particularly for an Opposition, would be to exaggerate popular fears and inflame suspicions-an easy option, as Dr Hewson said, but a course of action we in opposition would not pursue. That was the view of every member of the Opposition without-even though Senator McLean implied otherwise-being coerced by anyone. If the Australian Labor Party had been in opposition, I wonder whether it would have adopted such a reasoned approach. I doubt it; in fact, I am sure it would not have done so, and people who sit as Ministers on the other side of the chamber would almost certainly have been leading marches down the streets. </PARA>

<PARA> If we were subject to similar attacks, would the Democrats be calling for sanctions and be leading the so-called peace movement? If the same thing happened again, would Senator Kernot be saying, `There is no such thing as a just war'? That is what she said: `There is no such thing ever as a just war'-without qualification. Or would she be calling for our allies, and particularly the United States (US), to come to our aid, as we did in World War II? If the US had not responded in the Battle of the Coral Sea, it could well be that the State in which both Senator Kernot and I live would have been occupied. </PARA>

<PARA> Senate McLean interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes I think Senator McLean thinks he is the Kruschev of the Parliament. The only thing he has not done yet is to take his shoe off and hit it on the desk so that the rest of us cannot hear. When I saw the radical group in the Parliament yesterday-inflamed by certain senators here, quite deliberately for their own self-gratification; not worrying about those young people at all, just their own self-promotion-I could not help but think that they had no realisation that, but for the action of their grandfathers and with the support of United States men and women in times of crisis, particularly in World War II, there is every probability that they would not have been here yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those people would not have existed. Let us recognise that reality. After that war, the United States did something that had never before been done. These things must be recognised. The United States assisted the vanquished Germany and Japan to get back on their feet. I do not think that such a thing has ever occurred before. After the atrocities, which were still fresh in their minds, and in the emotional aftermath of that war such an act signalled that man was capable of deeds which spelled hope for the future of civilisation. The United States has continued to carry the burden, both in human sacrifice and in economic terms, for the free world. For goodness sake, let us give recognition where it is due. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet again the United States is carrying the major burden. The aggressor in this war in the Middle East has been Iraq. Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait. Iraq rejected all pleas, even those of its own neighbours and of the United Nations. A stand had to be taken.

However, I find that I am the penultimate speaker. I state right at the beginning of my short speech that I too support the motion relating to the Gulf war moved by the Government and supported by the vast majority of members and senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the basic principles of a democracy is that majority rules. In this case it is not just a large majority of parliamentarians who support Australia's role in the Gulf. According to yesterday's Australian newspaper, it appears that almost 75 per cent of the Australian people agree with our involvement. That is not to say that the opposing view has not been well aired. Elements of the print and electronic media have certainly promoted the minority view. Indeed, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation seem to have shown a certain bias against the Government's position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have tried to take the high moral ground in their usual muddled way. On the one hand we have them opposing the use of force in the Middle East and, on the other, we have Senator Bell giving a notice of motion advocating that Latvia establish a self-defence force to combat the aggression being perpetrated on the democratically elected government of Latvia by elements of the Soviet Army. </PARA>
<PARA> But do not take just my word for it. The Australian Democrats' position is well summed up by two articles that I read in yesterday's newspapers. One was in the Herald Sun and the other was in the Hobart Mercury. </PARA>

<PARA> Ever get the feeling that everyone is out of step except our Democrats?</PARA>
<PARA> Talk about keeping the bastards honest! They can't even keep themselves on the right road. </PARA>
<PARA> Never has there been a political party in Australia so full of misfits, each going his or her own way, each chasing his or her own star and all of them jumping in to support any issue going as long as it will get their names in the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, Senator McLean is going to get his name in the paper when he replies to the editorial in the Mercury. Terry Vine went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> When Don Chipp and John Siddons ran the Democrats, they seemed to have some purpose in life and their policy of keeping the major parties honest had real meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> Now they have degenerated into a bunch of idealists and most of the time they can't even agree among themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about Janet Powell. Anyway, enough of the Democrats. We have had interjections right through this very long and very serious debate from the Democrats. I did not interject on Senator McLean, but I presume that in the few minutes I have got I will certainly get plenty. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, yesterday when I was carrying out a similar duty to yourself as the occupant of the chair, I had the opportunity to hear many fine speeches on this grave situation and to emulate them in the short time I have available to me would be futile. What I would like to do, as one of the final speakers, is to sum up what seems to me to be the major reasons for Australia's position in this crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, when one is forced into a fight, one's first task is to assess the character of who one is fighting. In this case, the opponent is Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad, a tyrant and dictator who will stop at nothing to get his own way. This man has no principles, as shown on countless occasions, which I think is agreed by everybody in this place. He has encouraged torture, looting, killing and rape in Kuwait. He has attempted to use hostages as a human shield. In the last few days he has ignored the Geneva convention and used prisoners of war for his own political purposes. He has shown disregard for every convention. He has used poison gas on the Kurdish people, citizens of Iraq-his own people-and no doubt when ready he would resort to the use of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> The human rights atrocities have been well documented by Amnesty International. I must say that I was very moved by the contribution of Senator Tate, a fellow Tasmanian and a man of high Christian and moral principles, who explained to the Senate why he had wrestled with his pacifist principles to arrive at a position where he could condone Australia being involved in war. No-one could help but be moved by the description of the atrocities conducted on the Kuwaiti people, particularly the unforgivable actions against 300 helpless premature babies. So we know our opponent, a cruel, barbaric tyrant, has to be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I believe it is appropriate that in the Australian Parliament we recognise the selfless efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, in his own personal efforts to secure peace in the Middle East. It became apparent towards the end of these efforts that Saddam Hussein was not interested in peace but rather sought to pursue his own political agenda. The United Nations represents the rule of law of the world as we know it, and it should not be forgotten that the Security Council of the United Nations has now passed a total of 12 resolutions which have condemned Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait and called for its withdrawal. In addition, the use of hostages has been condemned and, finally, after the failure of economic sanctions, there was no alternative but to approve the use of force to evict Iraq from the neighbour which it had invaded. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Senator Vallentine and the Australian Democrats have asked for more time to allow sanctions to work. After some 5 1/2 months, it is quite obvious that Saddam Hussein will not withdraw from Kuwait. Senator McMullan and others on that side of the House have explained how Daniel Ortega had stated to Mr Craxi, the former Socialist Prime Minister of Italy, that Saddam would not be convinced to withdraw from Kuwait. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The one word Saddam Hussein intends not uttering is the word withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA>All opportunities for a peaceful solution have been exhausted. It was interesting to note Senator McMullan's admission that, as one who strongly opposed Australia's involvement in Vietnam, he could now see no alternative but to fight the aggression in Kuwait. It is also interesting to note that one of the leaders of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Bolkus, has pleaded with his left wing colleagues and the peace movement to support our presence in the Gulf. This crisis has brought most of the factionalised Labor Party together in support of our armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition position is quite clear. Dr Hewson, our leader, and every other member of the Federal coalition supports this motion. We are not confused like the Democrats, nor divided like the Labor Party. We know the enemy; we know the consequences of our action; we know, as Senator Short said during the debate, that we are part of a multinational force of 28 nations which has the support of some 140 independent countries of all political views who support United Nations resolution 678. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that times of war tend to bring out both the best and the worst in people. We have already heard Senator Newman and Senator Robert Ray criticise the despicable rumours which have been deliberately perpetrated on the subject of conscription and an escalation of Australia's involvement in the Gulf war. These have been spread purely to cause concern and anguish against the families of Australian young people. There is no basis or foundation in any of these rumours and the perpetrators should be held liable for their acts, be they for political or personal gain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the more scurrilous efforts has come, not surprisingly perhaps, from the Tasmanian Aboriginal activist, Mr Michael Mansell, the so-called national secretary of the so-called Aboriginal provisional government. Senators in this chamber may recall that it was not that long ago that Mr Mansell was in Libya attempting to grovel at the feet of another well known assassin, Colonel Gaddafi. Mr Mansell has recently called for Aboriginals in the armed forces not to fight in the Gulf war but rather to take up arms against the Hawke Government. These comments are nothing short of traitorous, and I trust that if there was ever any doubt about Mr Mansell's intentions his recent outburst has placed them in their proper perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in my lifetime, we have an opportunity to be part of a new world order-a phrase used by President Bush, our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and many others. Let us hope that if this new world order is allowed to work in the Gulf, then this new world order can be used to stop the blatant abuse by the Soviet Government against the independent Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. For the first time in my lifetime, we have a chance to allow the United Nations to achieve peace-a peace we have been lucky enough to have in our lucky country of Australia; a peace that has been achieved in Australia not by appeasement but earned by our people because they believe that if we are to have peace and we want peace, when all else fails, we have to be prepared to fight for peace. If Australia had not been prepared to fight for peace in the past and support our allies as they have well and truly supported us, then this country would have already in its 200 year history tasted war on our own soil, as Senator Parer said earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> If it had not been for our American allies in World War II, Australia would certainly have been involved in war in its own land. How can we expect other countries to help defend us if we do not support other countries in their fight for peace? Finally, we know the enemy, we know the consequences, we know why we are there, and let us hope for a quick solution so that peace can be restored. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my concern to the families of three Tasmanian peace activists whose whereabouts are currently unknown, although I did notice tonight that they made contact, I believe, through another source. I refer to Mr Tom Lynch of Lune River, Mr Jack Lomax of Lachlan and Ms Liz Denham of Hobart, who formed part of the Australian contingent of an international peace delegation to the region. I do not condone their actions, which I think have been best described by others as irresponsible and fruitless, but at the same time I trust that they may safely return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I wish to add my support for our armed forces in the Gulf, my prayers for their safe return and my best wishes and support for their families and friends. On behalf of Tasmanians, we send our support to those Tasmanian sailors serving in the Gulf. To our Telecom technicians working in Saudi Arabia, we hope that they and their families are safe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a particularly sad time for us all-that is, of course, except the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine-as we are discussing what in effect is a commitment of our fine Australian service men and women to a world war. I am the last of 58 speakers-there are 76 senators-to contribute to this debate. This debate has been particularly significant inasmuch as in the six years that I have been here I do not think anything as critical as this matter has been debated as thoroughly. But some of the lunacy contributed by a very few honourable senators has been disturbing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I except the expression of sadness from the Democrats in this debate, and I also except that of Senator Vallentine for a very special reason. They are delighted to have this issue as something through which they can attempt to attract a minority of people to vote for them at the next election and improve their waning support. Their contributions over the last two days have simply reinforced that position. Their short-sighted view is of course purely anti-American; no more, no less. This typifies their lack of understanding of Hussein's atrocities and thereby virtually condones his actions. </PARA>
<PARA> If they saw the news tonight and saw the state of those hostages, I cannot believe that they would continue with the sanctimonious claptrap that they have gone on with now for two days in this place, let alone the amount of time they have spent outside the Senate. The way Senator Powell and her Democrat flunkeys and Senator Vallentine have engineered such appalling behaviour from so-called peace-loving people is a monumental disgrace. If the way in which the demonstrators have conducted themselves over the last few weeks is meant to be indicative of peace, they are clearly barking up the wrong tree. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been like sitting in a bird cage for the last two days, with Senator Powell rabbiting on and Senator Kernot rabbiting on. But, of course, Senator Vallentine has not necessarily contributed much because, as my colleague Senator Campbell highlighted just after 8 o'clock, at that stage she had been in the chamber for only two out of 14 hours. At this stage I think she has only been in the chamber for certainly not much more than four out of more than 20 hours. </PARA>

<PARA> The difference between us and them a la the Democrats and Senator Vallentine is that we first of all consider what is right and proper for the welfare of all Australians and the world at large. For Senator Powell to acknowledge, as she did at Question Time today, an unruly protester as it was escorted out of the gallery shows Australia the contempt in which she holds the institution of the Parliament. On the subject of contempt for the institution of Parliament, Senator Vallentine has the ability to equal, if not better, Senator Powell.

Of course, all who know her would be well aware that she was seeking to get thrown out-again-and to obtain more publicity. However, the fact remains that she behaved, and continues to behave, in a manner now considered highly inappropriate by the public for members of parliament. Foul language and inciting people to misbehave is hardly becoming of a senator or any other member of parliament. Senator Vallentine is guilty on both counts and Senator Powell certainly on the latter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not question the right of people to express their views, but why not do it courteously and within the law? We have seen members of the Australian Labor Party say that they are going to abstain from the vote on this resolution.

We have no doubt that if the boot were on the other foot we would probably have it poked down our throats at a rate of knots. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is important that we are seen to be unified on this issue, and that is why we have gone along with the motion in its entirety. Why also should the truth not be told? Why is it that Senators Powell and Vallentine choose to keep promoting the lie that they are speaking for 50 per cent of Australians? Not only do all polls conducted in Australia-and around the world, for that matter-not go above 25 per cent opposition to the war, but these two senators also use the figures for people who have marched against the Government's and the Opposition's decision. </PARA>

<PARA> One of the things that has staggered me over the Democrats position is their total and unequivocal ditching of their founder and former leader, Don Chipp. How he must wish that he could keep the bastards honest now. The only difference is that it is a different set of bastards. Mr Chipp has written and said that Hussein deserves this fight, and I would like to quote from two articles written by Mr Chipp. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>If we are to talk about the probity, or lack of it, of using force against Hussein, surely the first question to be determined is do we have the right to defend ourselves?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe I have the right to defend myself and my loved ones by reasonably violent means if we are being physically attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider the Iraqi dictator in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> He climbed to his position of power through murder, torture and terrorism. In September, 1980, he revoked a border treaty with Iran and began an eight-year war which was to account for more than a million people being killed. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If such a man is allowed to hijack the worldwide Islamic renaissance, a global holocaust of breathtaking proportions would be inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA>The founder of the Australian Democrats wrote that-quite clearly, quite succinctly-yet Senator Powell takes them off down another track. In another article Mr Chipp also wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be intolerable for any Arab or Muslim to be allowed to support publicly Hussein's cause with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a person should not only be liable to criticism by the Australian media, but should be charged and, if found guilty of sedition or treason, put away for the duration. </PARA>
<PARA>Would that not be gorgeous? I have certain people in mind, of course. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>We are at a time when we should contemplate the devastation, suffering and death that man, assisted by a few fanatics, can inflict on humankind if their greed and lust are allowed to go unchecked. </PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi killers have already been responsible for more than a million deaths, inflicting hideous pain through chemicals and by terrible acts of torture on their own people. </PARA>
<PARA> Now they imperil the economic and political stability of the entire world. </PARA>
<PARA> They have jeopardised the hopes and happiness of hundreds of millions of people in newly emerging eastern European economies who have not known financial security for 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA> If the 28-nation task force in the Gulf succeeds, it will certainly begin a new era in world politics where it can be proven that the United Nations can provide peace and safety for small nations.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Powell has taken over the leadership of the Australian Democrats, and she has not only taken them to the left, but to the left right out position of the Parliament, and at least through this issue has had a greater opportunity to show Australians exactly what she is like and what a bunch of lunatics she represents. It must be cause for great concern for their founder, seeing just what a monster he created. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one wants this war, and I find it singularly offensive for Senator Powell and Senator Vallentine in particular to claim that they have a mortgage on the desire for peace. Those of us who are supporting the motion before the Senate this morning actually do care about peace and are prepared to make the hard decisions in an attempt to achieve it. Those supporting this motion are also prepared to put politics aside and act in the national and global interest. I wish I could say the same for the Democrats and Senator Vallentine. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australians who are serving their country overseas and their families deserve our support and our gratitude. Let us not diminish that and have it overwhelmed by groups or individuals who simply seek cheap publicity for their own ends and not for the security of Australia and the world. </PARA>

Senator Schacht suggested that I did not understand Martin Luther King saying that there was no recognition of evil or no need to resist evil. Senator Schacht completely misunderstands the meaning of active resistance. I have never advocated passive resistance, which is what Senator Schacht claimed.

Earlier Senator Campbell said that I personally conspired to disrupt the Parliament by going upstairs. Senator Knowles repeated the allegation. It is not true. When I went up to the gallery yesterday, I was quite surprised that there was a round of applause from the gallery. I did not know that people were up there at that point. This was very early on, Mr President, as you may remember. I went up there after you had cautioned people for applauding from the gallery. I went up to the people in the gallery and said, `You will be thrown out of here if you make noise. You have to remain silent in the gallery. If you want to listen to the debate you must be quiet and you must not applaud. If you interject you will be thrown out'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Including Senator Powell's performance. It is unbelievable to be able to say that, but the fact of the matter is that, during the two days the Parliament has been sitting, that has been so. Of course, the issue should have been debated seriously because it was one of the most difficult issues to come before this Parliament as it involves the commitment of Australian armed forces to military action in the Gulf authorised by the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I express my thanks to those senators who have taken part in the debate, regardless of their party or affiliation. I must say that I think I have to do that regardless of their views, a number of which I do not share personally. Each of us has different views and different points of emphasis in considering the enormous issues which are associated with this commitment by the United Nations and the commitment of Australian forces to that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a fair degree of realism and a shared concern for the best interests of Australia, even across party lines and even across differences of opinion which have emerged in the course of the debate. I am very pleased that this motion will be passed with a significant majority, because it is important that we as a parliament carry out our responsibilities in the shared spirit of commitment to Australia's national interest that has characterised this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that we send a strong message to a number of people who normally might not take much notice of this Parliament's deliberations. I think it is important that we send a message to those serving personnel on the three ships in the Gulf and to our allies in the coalition whose parliaments have had similar debates. That message involves condemnation of Iraq's attack on Israel and the original occupation of Kuwait. To that extent, it involves an expression of sympathy with the people of Kuwait and more recently with the people of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> The message also underlines this Parliament's concern that once this crisis is over, there will be intensified efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, something which is overlooked and ignored on a day by day basis in the political debate in this country. It is important that commitment is there in the motion which is hopefully about to be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that Australians understand the facts of the situation, however confusing some of the arguments may have been. Although there have been differences of opinion about the facts, I think that the debates which have taken place and which I understand have been widely listened to in the Australian community, will ensure a better understanding of the issues and of the concerns of the majority in the Senate and the majority in the House of Representatives to establish a degree of commitment to what is happening in the Gulf and a commitment to our allies in that operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes the view that we have made the right decision on behalf of the Australian people. It is important that all those who are carrying out that decision in terms of their personal commitment, whether they be in the Gulf or elsewhere in the Middle East, understand the commitment and support of the Australian Parliament. Accordingly, I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>
