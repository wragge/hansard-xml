<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate representing the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister be requesting the honourable member for Blaxland to submit himself to cross-examination by the Western Australian Royal Commission in order to give a full explanation of any activity on his part as Treasurer in the rescue of Rothwells in October 1987? If the former Treasurer refuses to so appear before the Royal Commission, what steps will the Prime Minister take to ensure that all actions of senior Government Ministers in relation to the Rothwells rescue are made public before the Royal Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the article in the Sunday Tasmanian of 8 September 1991 which stated that veterans' services were being downgraded by the introduction of a prescription charge?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1233" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see an article in the Sunday Tasmanian which reported a Mr John Cleary making a statement-which, I am sure, was just deliberate mischief-making and has caused a lot of anxiety out in the veterans' community-about the fact that the Government does intend to introduce a prescription charge of $2.60 per prescription from 1 January 1992 in relation to repatriation benefit prescriptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Mr Cleary failed to do was to point out that each of those veterans will receive every fortnight a payment of $5.20, which will be a pharmaceutical allowance added to their present entitlements. This will enable them to cover the cost of their prescriptions as they obtain them in the course of the year. If in the course of the year a particular veteran takes more prescriptions than would add up to $135, from that point onwards all those prescriptions are absolutely free.</PARA>
<PARA> From every point of view, a veteran obtaining a pharmaceutical product will be covered either by the $5.20 per fortnight pharmaceutical allowance or by the safety net provision which cuts in after the equivalent of $135 has been paid out for prescriptions. One has a situation where all veterans will be fully compensated for any payment they make in relation to prescriptions they obtain. So, far from downgrading services to veterans, the Government's care and support for those veterans who require pharmaceutical products is there indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> I think what emerges from this particular exercise is that either Mr Cleary has needlessly upset members of the veterans' community-particularly in Tasmania-or he knew in advance that what he was doing was mischievous and, in a political attempt, set out to destabilise the community of veterans in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the whole problem is whether Mr Cleary is acting as the national vice-president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or whether he is acting as a Liberal member of the State Parliament in Tasmania. He cannot decide which hat to wear. In the interests of veterans I would urge him to act in a more professional way rather than as a petty politician seeking to score a very easy political point.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations and refers to the Minister's constant complaints in this chamber about executive salaries and perks. Is the Minister aware that a former Keating staffer, Dr Edwards, received a termination pay-out of almost $80,000 after only four months on the job? On what basis did his Department advise that such a huge pay-out was appropriate? Does the Minister himself believe that this was a fair pay-out in the light of the termination conditions available to ordinary Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator Kemp for acknowledging at last that I, on behalf of this Government, have been a rousing critic of the excessive level of executive remuneration in this country. At a time when wage and salary earners have been looking at wage growth per annum of around 6 per cent, as I recall it, on the statistics we are looking at executive salaries shooting ahead by anything between 12 and 20 per cent. In those circumstances, captains of Australian industry enjoining Australian workers to exercise wage restraint for the good of the country is an obscenity. I am glad that Senator Kemp at last has been prepared to recognise that advocacy by the Government. I trust that recognition will be followed by some action from the Opposition to join us in calling for the executive level of this community to exercise the same restraint that we are asking ordinary wage and salary earners to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. The honourable senator should exercise some patience. Let me now turn to the question of severance payment to Dr Edwards. Although this is the first time that I have heard the figures that are set out in Senator Kemp's question, I do not in any way challenge their authenticity. I am not familiar with the contractual arrangements that were entered into by the former Treasurer and his most senior economic adviser. Of course, it is appropriate that the Treasurer of this country should seek the best economic talent available and write a contract which would remunerate that individual at a level that that individual would command elsewhere, either in academia or in the field that I understand Dr Edwards pursued for some while-as an economics commentator and journalist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am unaware of the actual terms of that arrangement. But I do know that for contracted consultants to Ministers, a termination criteria is written into the standard contract. If that contract is terminated before its due time-as I imagine it would have been in this case, given that the Treasurer resigned office before the completion of the parliamentary term-the normal contractual arrangements would apply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I asked the Minister not whether the money was legally paid out-I have no doubt that it probably was legally paid out-but whether he thought it was fair that a man who has worked for this Government for only four months should receive a termination payout of $80,000. I further ask the Minister: is it correct that there will be an effective tax rate of only 5 per cent on this $80,000?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Macdonald will just wait a few minutes, I may just come to that matter. If he wishes to interfere with my answer, I may choose not to come to that question. He can please himself. He should give me a chance to answer the question-in other words, he should be quiet-or I will deal with it in the way in which I want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have the terms of the actual contract in front of me. The question I am being asked is whether it is fair. That suggests that perhaps Senator Kemp is arguing that a government should break a contract that it has is entered into and that the breaking of a contract would be a fair thing to do in particular circumstances. I would be interested to know under what circumstances Senator Kemp feels a contract entered into by a government ought to be able to be broken.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of fairness, as I say, I do not know the terms of the contract. If it is true that Dr Edwards worked for the Treasurer for only four months, it is obvious to me that he may well have passed up the possibility of other appointments and that that is an element in the question of compensation in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> I return to the fundamental point in this issue: what is a reasonable level of remuneration for the Government's most senior economics consultant; and what is, therefore, the most reasonable level of severance in the event of that contract being broken outside of the responsibility of that consultant. These are questions about what the particular rate for that level of position might be. They are not matters touching on the level of broad salary constraints, as they are being pretended to be--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Reynolds's reasons for asking this question but, I am pleased to say, we do not actually have a form of government in this country that is sufficiently centralised to require airlines to moderate their commercial practices to that extent. The question of incentives that are offered by airlines to their fliers is very much a matter for the commercial judgment of those airlines, but it is important to the Government that regional air services are maintained at a healthy level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that respect, I was interested to note that, in the case of the rescheduling of Hazelton's routes in New South Wales and, I must say, the very welcome decision by the New South Wales Government to open up to deregulated competition those Hazelton routes over which the Government had a monopoly, only a matter of days-it did not take very long to happen-after the suspension of those Hazelton services 10 of the 14 ports vacated by Hazelton now have other operators operating air services which, in some cases, are direct from those ports to Sydney. It is very much a matter for the market to determine what incentives are offered to frequent fliers or, indeed, any other fliers who utilise the services of the airline.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VC5">Senator SOWADA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. In the light of the recent decision by the Premier of New South Wales to implement a four-year fixed term for the New South Wales Parliament, and given the very warm reception this has received in the media, the business community and the public alike, firstly, does the Government agree that a fixed term would be a sensible reform to the parliamentary process, thereby allowing for more long term government decision making and increased business confidence in a stable election-free political environment; and, secondly, will the Government give an undertaking to investigate proposed amendments to the Constitution for a four-year fixed term for the Federal Parliament? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1236" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sowada seems to be unaware of the Constitutional Centenary Conference, held in about April of this year, at which a very wide ranging discussion on constitutional reform was held by people representing many parts of the Australian community. I think the discussion was chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen, a former distinguished High Court judge and Governor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of that meeting, a unanimous view was expressed, as I recall, by that conference in support of a four-year term for the House of Representatives. I think there was less unanimity as to whether that should be a fixed term or just a maximum outer limit to which the House of Representatives could run. Of course, there are many more difficult questions on the relationship of terms of the House of Representatives to the terms of honourable senators: for example, whether honourable senators should have an eight-year fixed term. It is a very real question for which it would be, in my opinion, very difficult to secure support out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sowada also asks whether it would be a sensible reform. I think a sensible reform would be one which was so convincing to the community that it would engender sufficient support to have a majority of electors in a majority of States give their assent to that reform. That is a hurdle which Premier Greiner does not have to face in New South Wales in his constitutional reform; it just requires an Act of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in order to get the sort of support required for sensible reform, one would need to have certainly bipartisan support-and I know that the Prime Minister has held discussions with the Leader of the Opposition in this respect-and tripartite support from the Australian Democrats would be extremely desirable. I hope that all major parties-and indeed the Independents-in this place can be involved in any discussions which would lead to putting to the Australian people the question of the parliamentary term for this Federal Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister noted criticism of the International Labour Organisation in some recent newspaper editorials? Do these criticisms demonstrate any knowledge of the ILO by the editors of these papers? Since the ILO is a United Nations agency and this is only the second time its world head has visited Australia, is the Minister surprised that none of the critical newspapers have sought to interview Mr Hansenne?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1237" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noticed the criticism in some editorials. It seems that some editorial writers have simply swallowed the Liberal Party's propaganda line on the International Labour Organisation without in any sense checking for themselves to see the nature of this organisation. Some of the more bizarre implications in terms of editorial writing have been that the ILO is simply an international body of Labor parties or an international union body when, of course, the ILO is an agency of the United Nations, tripartite in nature. It is the longest running such agency, having been established under the old League of Nations in 1919.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The criticisms that I have seen go to the allegation that the ILO may not know about Australian industrial relations law. That may be something that entertains the back reaches of the minds of some editorial writers. It has some superficial appeal, one might say, given the unique system in this country of compulsory arbitration. But Australia has been a member of the ILO since it was first founded in 1919. The Australian Government has been an almost continuous member of the governing body of the ILO since it was reconstituted under the United Nations in 1946; there were only two gaps of one term each.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has, through Sir Halford Cook-no relation of mine-presided over the governing body of the ILO. The Australian union movement, through its President, Mr Martin Ferguson; Australian employers, through the Chief Executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry, Mr Bryan Noakes; and the Government are all currently members of the ILO governing body. That body is indeed well informed about circumstances in Australia. But under convention 87-the Freedom of Association Convention which this country adopted 18 years ago-we have been required by governments of both Liberal and Labor party persuasion to report annually to the ILO events and developments in Australia. Against that background, it is therefore idle to say that the ILO may not, as the editorial writer in the Melbourne Herald-Sun said on Friday, know enough about Australian industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> The most serious criticism that I have seen is that which supports the view expressed by Mr John Howard that he as a lawyer is entitled to criticise the Committee of Experts. It is simply one lawyer criticising the views and opinions of other lawyers. The Committee of Experts is a quasi-judicial body. Mr Howard is, after all, a suburban Sydney solicitor. Let us compare his qualifications to those of the 20 members of the Committee of Experts. Which countries do these eminent lawyers come from?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It cannot be said that that sample of countries does not represent the whole spectrum of world opinion. Let me now turn to the qualifications. Eleven members of the 20 countries are professors of law at leading national universities in their own countries; six are chief justices of their own countries; and three are members of the International Court of Justice, one a vice-president, and one a former president of the International Court. They have unanimously made a clear finding that Australian industrial law is not in conformity with the Convention on Freedom of Association because there is no provision for the right to strike in the law of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What stands before the community as clear as a pikestaff is that our law does not conform to international minimum standards and what is acceptable by the relevant United Nations agency as adjudged by a qualified panel of world ranking jurists. That is the question for Australia. For Mr Howard to be portrayed as simply one lawyer debating with other lawyers and the suggestion that that is therefore permissible is, I believe, quite a caricature of the current circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my answer by saying that in isolationist, introspective Australia this cannot be a matter which we simply debate among ourselves. Australia has been called to answer in the world community. In this region, more importantly than in other regions of the world, it is vital for a developed country such as ours to uphold minimum international standards lest those of our neighbours who are less inclined to do so take our example as an example for themselves to do something else.</PARA>

It is equally sad to report that the export enhancement program conducted by the United States, which enables its wheat to penetrate our markets at an uncompetitive rate enhanced by the taxpayers' dollar in the United States, is not indicative of a level playing field. It is sad to report that they are the circumstances that afflict our rural economy on the world stage at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government is, of course, opposed to those types of artificial barriers-be they royal decrees, tariffs or other forms of non-tariff protection. That is why we have led the world in forming the Cairns group of countries to agitate in the GATT round against the protection that is afforded unfairly to particular countries against free and open trade in the world. That is why we will pursue, through that round and through other bilateral measures that we can take, the freeing up of world agricultural trade.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know that the Eagles will come good. One of Australia's most famous songs starts with the words, `Out on the boards the old shearer stands'. It is sadly true these days that, this season, fewer Australian shearers are standing out on the boards, and a number of shearers from New Zealand are standing in the stands where Australian shearers ought to be standing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two reasons for this. One relates partly to the question I answered a moment ago which was asked by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. I refer to the collapse of the world wool market and the fact that the Australian clip is down and, therefore, seasonal workers such as Australian shearers are not in such great demand.</PARA>
<PARA> The other reason is the apparent campaign sponsored by the National Farmers Federation to encourage the breaking down of the rates and conditions under the Federal shearing award, and the growth of quasi employees who are working on contrived contracts of employment under the pretence that they are not employees but are, indeed, contractors. That campaign is being conducted in rural Australia at the present time. Unfortunately, it is a campaign in which many of the economic refugees from New Zealand who face the harsh strictures of a high unemployment economy led by the New Zealand National Party are finding their way across the Tasman to Australia. They are prepared to accept those contracts against the background of no similar award protection in their country, and no tradition in our country in terms of the application of that award.</PARA>
<PARA> It is wrong to pick on the subcontractors simply because of their nationality. I do not. I think that unemployed workers in New Zealand are being exploited in those circumstances and being put against the interests of Australian workers. What I do criticise is the Australian employers who engage in those contrived employment practices and hire those workers in need, such as those New Zealanders, who then come in and break down conditions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crane may object to it but, of course, he is wrong on so many other matters. Those workers break down the conditions that apply legally and properly in shearing sheds around this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Every small businessman in every wool town in Australia must also be concerned. Shearers make up a substantial part of the rural populations of country towns. If they are unable to get work because contractors are being brought in from outside those country towns, the local rural economy suffers grievously. There have been reports in the weekend press that this may lead to violence. Consistent with what I have always said, I would deplore that if it arose. However, one can understand the circumstances in which local shearers see sheds being populated by people brought in from outside the district to do work which they may have done, or traditionally expected to do, for the past 20 or 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department, through its awards management branch, will be conducting random inspections in country Australia to ensure that the conditions of the Federal shearing award are properly observed, that any contrived employment arrangements aimed at gypping Australian workers out of their jobs will be dealt with and that the proper observance of award rates, conditions and standards will be carried out by contractors in this area.</PARA>

When that process was exhausted, Cape Lambert went into voluntary liquidation, setting at nought the progress made by the Seamen's Union. A new company then sprang up immediately and the whole process looks as if it will go through again.

This has to be consistent with the countries with which we compete.</PARA>

He has put a figure of between $1 billion and $2 billion on this. He goes even further than that. He is reported as saying that the residents in these dwellings will have legal rights to have these houses acquired and demolished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Mr Williams is reported correctly, he has grossly misinterpreted the facts as contained in the draft environmental impact statement. The facts are that, as the EIS shows, the number of dwellings experiencing noise levels of 25 ANEF or greater will fall dramatically as a result of the construction of the third runway at Sydney airport from nearly 20,000 houses in the 1988 case to 9,705 in the year 2010. That is a net reduction in excess of 10,000 dwellings. Furthermore, of these 9,705 dwellings, the number of dwellings newly exposed to noise levels of 25 ANEF or greater as a result of the third runway is in the order of 2,300, which, I would suggest, is significantly fewer than the 10,000 claimed by Mr Williams.</PARA>
<PARA> The implication that Australian noise standards dictate that existing residential dwellings subjected to noise of 25 ANEF or greater have to be acquired and demolished by the Government, which Mr Williams is reported as saying, is also factually nonsense. The relevant standard-that is, Australian Standard 2021 1985-is regarded as a planning document for land use compatibility with aircraft noise in the construction of new dwellings and not existing dwellings, as claimed by Mr Williams.</PARA>
<PARA> Claims that the third runway will result in noise mitigation costs of up to $2 billion are therefore grossly exaggerated. These claims are significantly inflated by including residential dwelling acquisition and demolition costs in those figures, which will not be incurred. Press reports of insulation costs of $460m to $630m refer to the cost of insulation for all dwellings exposed to greater than 20 ANEF within the third runway area, including residences that are currently exposed to those noise levels or greater.</PARA>
<PARA> The draft EIS estimates costs for insulating residences newly exposed to noise greater than 20 ANEF to be somewhere between $170m to $230m. But there is an important point that has to be made: there is nothing whatever, in terms of the legalities of this, in government policy or in regulation which requires insulation of residences affected by aircraft noise. Therefore, the key assumptions that are used to support these statements by Mr Williams are fundamentally flawed. Issues concerning noise mitigation are being addressed by the environmental impact statement process.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, might I say that the Government is pressing to the fullest extent the Federal Airports Corporation-the proponents of the third runway-and its consultants, Kinhills, to bring this process to a conclusion. I will be having a further meeting with the FAC and Kinhills on Wednesday of this week to once again raise this issue with them. Hopefully, I will be in a position to provide the Senate with more information later this week.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aquitaine Australia Minerals Pty Ltd was engaged in mineral exploration in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia in the early 1980s under the South Australian Government's exploration licences. These licences included land on the margins of the Maralinga restricted area, known as section 400, which contains former British nuclear test sites controlled by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Some of this land was within the Woomera prohibited area of the Woomera rocket range controlled by the Department of Defence. Aquitaine obtained Defence Department approval for access to the Woomera prohibited area and approached the then Department of National Development and Energy for approval to construct an access road through the south-western corner of section 400 to exploration areas near Lake Dey Dey. Approval was given on the basis that all movements through the area would be notified in advance to the Australian Federal Police detachment at Maralinga village. Aquitaine was also permitted to locate survey points within section 400 under AFP supervision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In April 1982 the Department was advised that Aquitaine had constructed a spur road from the Lake Dey Dey road to the north-east ending, approximately 10 kilometres from section 400. This road did not require the approval of the Department as it lay outside the test site area. Nevertheless, Aquitaine was asked to provide a map showing its location. In June 1982 the Department received a map showing roads constructed by Aquitaine.</PARA>
<PARA> This map was shown on a recent SBS Dateline program as evidence that Aquitaine had constructed a spur road into the Maralinga area and undertaken exploration in the area. Rather than showing that Aquitaine had penetrated Maralinga, as claimed by Dateline, the documentary evidence presented by the SBS show that the spur road, the drilling site located near the end of this road and a radiometric anomaly referred in the program lie outside the section 400 area. The SBS program does not document unauthorised activity by Aquitaine within the Maralinga section 400 area. On the other hand, there is clear evidence that Aquitaine, and a number of other mining companies, were involved in metal exploration in the region. There seems to be no cause for further investigation of this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to table the Report of the Australian Human Rights Delegation to China. The delegation, which visited China at my request from 14 to 26 July 1991, has produced an excellent report, detailed in content and fascinating in its insights, which will attract the attention of all those concerned with human rights in China. I warmly commend for their efforts the leader of the delegation, Senator Schacht, and the other members-Mr David Connolly, Senator Vicki Bourne, Professor Stephen Fitzgerald, Professor Alice Erh-Soon Tay, Mr Chris Sidoti, Dr Richard Rigby, Mr Kevin Garratt and, not least, the secretary, Mr Jon Sheppard. The expertise and professionalism of the delegation is illustrated not only in the report but also in the results achieved through this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Foremost of these results is the fact that a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue on human rights has been conducted to the satisfaction of both sides. In the course of the dialogue Australia's concerns on a range of human rights issues and on individual human rights cases have been clearly conveyed. It was pleasing to hear that the Chinese authorities accepted the representations made by the delegation on behalf of the Australian Government regarding a large number of prisoners of conscience, and that new information on several of these cases was provided. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the delegation has listened carefully to Chinese perspectives on human rights and has gathered much useful information on the Chinese legal, judicial and penal systems. The delegation's report explores in some detail Chinese views on the importance of economic rights and the place of the individual in Chinese society. It examines the question of a state's right to restrict political and other fundamental freedoms, and the proposition that a state or a ruling party can interpret the will of the people and determine the collective good at the expense of the individual. The delegation has concluded that these arguments do not stack up against the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I share that view. I believe not only that civil and political rights are equally important as economic, social and cultural rights, but also that the practice of individual freedoms in all these areas-with the physical and intellectual mobility and flexibility that involves-is, in fact, more likely than not to stimulate economic growth. I see no incompatibility between China's modernisation goals and granting greater individual freedoms to its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of these differing perspectives, the visit by the Australian delegation has advanced the principle of the universality of human rights. This is because, in accepting the visit and engaging in intensive dialogue, the Chinese Government has accepted that human rights has a legitimate place on the international agenda and is a proper subject for discourse in its bilateral relationships. This is a major step forward from China's defence of its actions against the Tiananmen demonstrators when it argued that its forceful response was purely an internal affair and, as such, not subject to international scrutiny. It is important that the Chinese Government should understand that the international community takes a different view and that its relationships with countries such as Australia will be affected by the way in which it treats its own people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that we should expect any sudden or dramatic changes as a result of the Australian delegation's visit. Neither I nor the Government at any stage had any illusions that the delegation's visit would achieve any dramatic or immediate changes in the present human rights environment, which is not a happy one. But we do believe that, by the range and quality of its contacts and the unprecedented nature of the dialogue which did take place, the delegation has made an important contribution to improving that climate in the longer run. </PARA>
<PARA> While there can be rapid change in a state's treatment of human rights-and we only need look to the Soviet Union as an example-we are prepared to work over the long term on encouraging changes within China and other countries. I am hopeful that the delegation's visit will contribute to a better understanding on the part of the Chinese authorities that there are alternative approaches to human rights issues and that there are advantages to adopting a more open and human attitude. I am encouraged by the delegation's conclusion that there are elements within the Chinese leadership and within its legal and judicial systems who appreciate that a less repressive social and political environment would enhance economic growth and stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also like to make the point that the dialogue that the delegation to China has embarked upon should be seen in the context of the Australian Government's overall approach to regional human rights issues. We are aware that differing perspectives on human rights in our region require understanding on Australia's part and a willingness to enter into discussions-not just declamatory condemnations. Our aim is, so far as possible, to avoid confrontation and to reach common ground from which there is a better prospect of achieving improvements in human rights. We should never lose sight of the fact that, in all our concern to make our voice and our values heard, improvement in human rights on the ground is always the basic objective. </PARA>
<PARA> As the delegation has done, the Australian Government bases its position on the rights and principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We believe that the universal observance of these principles would result in a more just international order from which the security and prosperity of all nations and individuals would benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now respond specifically to the recommendations in the delegation's report. It follows from all of this that the Government has no difficulty with the delegation's recommendation that the process of dialogue should continue. I am pleased to note that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has expressed his Government's willingness to receive a further visit by the delegation, and this is a matter which we will, of course, follow up. The question of timing will be a matter of mutual convenience. Vice Premier Zhu has also accepted the Government's invitation to visit Australia, and arrangements for his visit are progressing. That is referred to in chapter 7 paragraph 18 of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has likewise indicated its readiness to receive a visit to Australia by a Chinese human rights delegation. This was an integral part of the agreement for reciprocal visits reached between myself and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen last April. To date, we have not been approached by the Chinese on this matter. Chapter 7 paragraph 19 of the recommendations refers to this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation has made a number of proposals on the further development of contacts between China and Australia in the human rights field. The Government will give careful consideration to the idea of training for Chinese judicial and security personnel and the possibility of further two-way exchanges. We hope that non-government organisations will also see fit to take action in this area. This is referred to in chapter 7 paragraph 21 of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the delegation's recommendation to continue exploring the establishment of a joint Australian-Chinese working group to act as a mechanism for on-going discussion on human rights issues, I agree that the idea has merit and that, although the Chinese side has rejected the proposal, we can look at it again as the dialogue develops. In the latter respect, I welcome Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's conclusion that the existing arrangement for reciprocal visits and the contacts established during the Australian delegation's visit constitute an open channel for further pursuing our mutual human rights interests. For its part, the Australian Government will certainly follow through on the representations taken up by the delegation in both Beijing and Lhasa, and will continue to press for information and express its concerns over individual human rights cases using these channels. Paragraph 20 in chapter 7 of the recommendations refers to this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also continue to urge China to respect internationally accepted standards of human rights and to become a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. As a major world power, a member of the United Nations Security Council and a country which has identified itself as a leader of the Third World, China can play an important role with regard to international and regional human rights issues. Australia will encourage China to adopt a positive approach to such matters in international forums, including through our shared membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have spoken of dialogue and cooperation, it is important to stress that Australia will not resile from its firm commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in its relationship with China or, indeed, world wide. The delegation's report has highlighted a number of disturbing aspects of human rights in China. Australia will continue to take a close interest in these areas. We will, for instance, closely monitor the fate of prisoners of conscience- including those charged with various forms of political dissent-and will maintain our consistent position of opposition to capital punishment. This is covered in chapter 7 paragraphs 22 to 24 of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government also shares the concerns expressed by the delegation over the human rights situation in Tibet. I have no difficulty in agreeing with the delegation that is desirable that there be discussions, without preconditions, between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama with a view to improving human rights conditions in Tibet. This is referred to in chapter 7, paragraph 27, of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am conscious of the controversy and the scope for abuse in relation to China's family planning policies and again the Government and I share the delegation's concern over some aspects of the implementation of those policies. At the same time, it is important to recognise the immense problems facing China in terms of population growth, to which the delegation has itself drawn attention. We will give consideration to the delegation's recommendation for Australian assistance in this field. This is referred to in chapter 7, paragraph 25, of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation has commented on Australia's policy of accepting international accountability in regard to our own human rights record. The Parliament can be assured that our open and frank approach in this regard will not change and indeed will very shortly be reinforced through our accession to the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, by which Australia will recognise the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive complaints relating to Australia's obligations under that covenant. We will also not fail to respond as fully and directly as we can to the type of inquiries made to the delegation while it was in China. </PARA>
<PARA> On the particular issue of refunds to Chinese students enrolled for education in Australia, I have noted the case put to the delegation as reported. However, I should note that the Government has taken steps now to address the genuine hardships being faced by a number of students in China who lost fees prepaid to Australian colleges which have since closed. On 5 September, in a joint statement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who has policy responsibility in this area, and me, the Government announced that it would extend the eligibility date for acceptance of refund claims in relation to institutions where closure was attributable to Government measures to tighten entry requirements. This is referred to in chapter 7, paragraph 26, of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I once again congratulate the delegation on the successful completion of its task. I realise how difficult this exercise was for both sides, especially as we were both breaking new ground. The Australian delegation did not take any backward step in holding to its belief in the universality of fundamental human rights and did not shy away from asking difficult questions. At the same time, it made considerable progress in promoting human rights goals and demonstrated-it is worth saying again-how such a sensitive issue can be approached in a non-confrontational and constructive manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I also think it significant, in terms of our bilateral relationship, that this new form of contact should have been initiated between Australia and China. It should be a matter of some satisfaction for both sides that our bilateral relationship has the breadth and the maturity to accommodate such a dialogue. I look forward to its further development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, I wish to respond in only a preliminary way as I have only just received the report. As the Opposition expressed some reservations about the concept of this delegation, I think it is important that I make some comment and put the report before us in that context. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) congratulated the delegation on the successful completion of its task. In a technical sense, no doubt, that is correct. It took the task; it went to China; it gathered some information within the limitations that the Chinese permitted; and it clearly promoted human rights goals. The real question is whether this delegation, other delegations and other means are, in fact, resulting in an improvement of the human rights position in China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recognise that the Australia-China relationship is an important relationship to Australia. Therefore, it is perhaps not easy for us to raise and press issues that might in some way have a detrimental effect upon other aspects of that relationship, perhaps economic or in other fields. Nevertheless, basic human rights according to the internationally accepted standard are so fundamentally important to us, so much a part of our basic values, that we would not be doing ourselves justice if we did not take every opportunity to press these issues upon a country which simply does not accept or comply with those minimum internationally accepted standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, China is still in that category. Regrettably, when I look at reports of Amnesty International, reports of the United States State Department, in its annual report on human rights throughout the world, and reports of Asiawatch, it is difficult to see any significant improvement in human rights in China having occurred since the terrible events of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I guess that in some ways the only positive side is that China, despite continuing to press its point that human rights are an internal matter, is now for the first time accepting delegations that are visiting China for the purpose of discussing these issues. In fact, this delegation, as I understand it, commenced with an invitation from China. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, if we believe that the opportunity to communicate, to develop a dialogue-to use the Minister's expression-is important if we are to influence a change of attitudes, we would have to say that that is a positive development. Our reservations were really as to the motivation of China in so inviting us and our fear that Australia may well be used as part of the most favoured nation debate that China was having with the United States. In other words, it was a fear that China would be able to promote to the United States, in particular, that its situation in human rights was being improved by the fact that it was prepared to invite and host international delegations to China. </PARA>
<PARA> We still do not know whether that initial reservation was well founded, but we decided in the end that the further opportunity to communicate our values-our values which are internationally accepted in this area-to the Chinese outweighed that risk, and that is why the Opposition parties supported this initiative. We are pleased that we were represented by Mr David Connolly, the honourable member for Bradfield, who is going to speak this afternoon in the other place on this report and give some further detail. </PARA>
<PARA> We supported the visit and the report is interesting and confirms some of our concerns. Clearly, it indicates that the delegation was able to communicate to Chinese authorities Australia's concerns and the generally held views within Australia. I think I can say that fairly. We regret that when the Opposition, through its leader, Dr Hewson, myself and others, last year visited China and put these concerns to China's leaders, our doing so was condemned by the Minister. We trust that his acceptance of China's invitation that we send a delegation indicates that he has changed his views as to the importance of a dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, one might say that the major distinction is that we were able to put those views to authorities at a much higher level. It was in fact interesting that even though China's leaders put to us that human rights were purely an internal matter, they were nevertheless prepared to continue by arguing to us that the number of students being held post-Tiananmen was not what the international press claimed and also that Chinese students who had engaged in democracy demonstrations out of China could return to China without fear of prosecution. So, whilst on the one hand they claimed that this issue was purely internal, on the other hand they were prepared to debate it, indicating that even at that time they were starting to recognise that it was an issue that had wider international concern and was an issue that the international community would press. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of specific concerns that I want to mention. One of them is the information that is now coming out of the most recent visit of a delegation which, of course, was from the United States. It is worth nothing that since the Australian delegation there have been two further parliamentary delegations-one from France and the other from the United States. The US delegation, which visited China in the week prior to 4 September, was unfortunately barred from visiting imprisoned dissidents and claimed that the human rights position had worsened. </PARA>
<PARA> My particular concern, and the concern that I want to raise again today-as has been raised by others in recent times-is that of the health and welfare of the dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming who were both gaoled for 13 years for allegedly organising the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. There have been recent reports that the two have been on a hunger strike, although this has been denied by the Chinese authorities. Wang was reportedly hospitalised in early September. His relatives claim that he is suffering from viral hepatitis and that he did not receive treatment for the disease while in prison. I have been unable to get any recent reports of his condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the families of the prisoners told the US delegation that they were harassed, subjected to surveillance and deprived of the ability to make a living. These are serious allegations and concerns, and I trust that the Australian Government will be doing all within its capacity to raise those concerns with the Chinese authorities and press the fact that the imprisonment of these two dissidents-in accordance with the spirit, as I see it, of the delegation's report-does not meet fundamental internationally accepted human rights standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that when the British Prime Minister, John Major, during his recent visit to China, raised the issue of human rights with Chinese Premier Li Peng, he was given what is unfortunately something of a standard line by the Premier who argued that China had been bullied and humiliated over the past 100 years. There is no wish on the part of the international community to bully and humiliate China. In fact, we would argue that it is very much in China's best interests to meet these minimum human rights standards. If it did so, China would be much better accepted within the international community and it would be helped in all sorts of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased-and I hope that the Australian Government will adopt a similar attitude-when Mr Major told a press conference at the end of his visit that the UK would maintain pressure on China in respect of human rights issues, saying that it was, `unrelieved, unremitting pressure that often gets results'. I mention that because some time ago the Australian Government, in our view, prematurely lifted its sanctions on aid to China. One must remember that those limitations on the relationship were imposed not only as a protest to the events that occurred at Tiananmen Square but also as an exercise to influence China to improve its human rights behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, in accordance with what I have put to you this afternoon, unfortunately that improvement has not occurred. Yet, the sanctions were lifted, which tends to indicate to the Chinese that they were not applied in a serious manner in the first instance. So I do hope that the Australian Government will join with others, such as the British Prime Minister, and maintain unremitting pressure upon China to at least get up to this minimally accepted human rights standard. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other issue that I wanted to touch upon, because it is current in this context of China's attitude to human rights, is the position of Hong Kong. Not surprisingly, the people of Hong Kong are nervous about the extent to which they will be able to maintain after 1997 their standard of human rights, which has been so much higher than that in China. It was worrying to us that after the Hong Kong legislature passed a Bill of Rights to try to protect Hong Kong once it loses the benefit of the common law, the message came from Beijing reminding Hong Kong that under the terms of the basic law the Chinese Government can review all pre-1997 legislation. The interpretation in Hong Kong was that the Chinese Government would not accept the protections that the Hong Kong legislature was trying to write in for basic human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the international community will continue to maintain pressure to protect the human rights that Hong Kong has been able to achieve. In some small way, I make mention of the role that Senator Chapman will play next weekend on behalf of the Opposition parties here in Australia. He is leading an international observer mission to the Hong Kong elections. The democratic process, at least to the limited extent that will be permitted before 1997, is part of the very minimum protections that members of the Hong Kong community are looking for to sustain them in the years past 1997. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I pick up the notes of concern in the report about the position in Tibet. I guess that the disappointment by the Committee is fairly consistent with what I have said-that there are ongoing breaches of human rights beyond that which the international community can accept. I take this opportunity to urge the Australian Government to continue to apply what pressure it can upon China to improve its standard of behaviour in this regard. That will not only be in the best interests of Australia and the international community but also in the best interests of China itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the tabling by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) of the report of the Australian human rights delegation to China. Naturally, as leader of the delegation, I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate. I would like to say a few words in support of the Minister and the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was very honoured to lead the delegation. In recent years I have been on a number of overseas delegations-both parliamentary and non-parliamentary. I have to say that this delegation was second to none in terms of the way in which its members went about their work. I believe that the delegation membership was, as the Minister has already mentioned, a very good balance between members of parliament, governmental officers and experts on China and Tibet. That enhanced the work of the delegation. It also meant that our Chinese hosts very quickly realised that they were dealing with a delegation that did contain considerable expertise on China. </PARA>
<PARA> This expertise was manifested in different ways. Three members of the delegation were fluent in Mandarin; one member of the delegation was fluent in Tibetan. All members of the delegation had a long interest in human rights issues in general. Specifically, they had a long interest in China and Tibet. It took only a matter of a day or so for our Chinese hosts to realise that it was not good enough just to have a standard form of meeting where a presentation would be made and then that would be the end of the discussion. As a result, in many of our formal meetings, the discussions went for two, three or 3 1/2 hours. The delegation often asked to have further meetings the next day to complete all the work on all the issues we wished to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Chinese were a bit surprised at some of the detailed knowledge the delegation already had. In particular, I think Professor Alice Tay knew more about the Chinese legal system and the Chinese constitution than did many of the officials with whom we had dialogue. That added greatly to the ability of the delegation to stick to the major points and to get answers from officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation was criticised before we left for China to the effect that we would do nothing other than whitewash the situation there and would not be able to achieve much. The people who expected, just because we were visiting China, that prisoners would be released, laws would be immediately changed and so on were mistaken. Certainly, delegation members did not expect to achieve those things. We would have loved to have done so, but they were not in our normal expectation. We went there to achieve the beginning of a dialogue with China on human rights. The fact that the Minister was able to negotiate our visit with the Chinese authorities was the beginning of that dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA> During our two weeks in China we had lengthy discussions with a whole range of governmental officials. Although at times they were robust, frank and often argumentative discussions, I give due credit to the Chinese officials that they did not break off the discussions. They sat them out hour after hour as we hammered away on the points about human rights. I think that should be acknowledged in respect of the Chinese officials. They stuck out in the discussions when, I suspect, some of us believed that on a number of occasions they might easily have ended talks forthwith. But we were able to present to the Chinese officials individual cases of human rights abuses, which are well known and have been documented. More than 200 such cases were presented both in writing and-in individual cases-verbally. It was the first time, as we understood it, that any foreign delegation or foreign government had been given information on a number of those cases. We were given a promise that we would be given more information. We will have to chase up that matter as a Government, as a parliament and as a delegation so that the promise of further information should not be allowed to rest. </PARA>
<PARA> We raised with the Chinese the persistent issue of the death penalty and its use in China. It is the official policy of the Australian Government to oppose the death penalty. The raising of these issues at times created some tension and agitation with the Chinese officials. We consistently asked for information as to how many people had been executed in the calendar year 1990. In Beijing, this information was not forthcoming. It was basically denied to us on the ground that it was a state secret or on the ground that the bodies we were speaking to did not have the authority to release such information. Ironically, it was in Tibet, where one suspects there are the worst cases of human rights abuse, that we got an acknowledgment that in 1990 there were five death sentences given, two of which were carried out and three of which were under probation. None of the five cases was for political crimes or political dissent. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions asked about the Chinese legal system during the visit gave information to the delegation that indicated that the Chinese legal system in its concept, structure and operation is very deficient in terms of any definition that is adopted in a country such as Australia. Again, it was Professor Alice Tay who said that the Chinese legal system in its operation is about where Western Europe was a couple of hundred years ago. Notions of appeal and due process are just not in the system. One of the most interesting figures we received came from a defence lawyer. It should be noted that there have been defence lawyers in the Chinese legal system only in the last decade. A defence lawyer in Shanghai told us that there were 16,000 prosecutions last year in Shanghai and only 23 acquittals. That is a success rate for the prosecution that we in Australia would find unbelievable if it were to happen here. We also discovered from the same set of figures that fewer than half the people charged had access to a defence lawyer. Even when there is access to a defence lawyer, it happens only after a person is charged and not when first investigated. Such a person can be detained for long periods without having access to a lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably one of the quieter successes achieved by the delegation was that in these long discussions with Chinese officials, in raising these issues and questions as to how the system operated, we got them to start thinking about the weaknesses of their own system. Our impression from talking to defence lawyers-we were the first foreign delegation that had had the opportunity to have lengthy discussions with those lawyers in China-was that as they work the system they are becoming more keenly aware that there will have to be improvements in the structure of the law and due process. For example, a lawyers' association has now been formed, and one of its representations to the Chinese Government is to give people who are being investigated, and before being detained and charged, the right of access to a defence lawyer. I see that as a beginning of a process that we should enhance wherever we can. I hope that in the dialogue that proceeds in the intermediate future we can arrange for appropriate lawyers from Australia to go to work in China with defence lawyers and that we can invite defence lawyers from China to work with appropriate bodies in Australia to enable them to get used to dealing with a system that is more open and transparent in providing legal process than is the case in China. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister said and as is dealt with in our report, we looked at the family planning issue. Many questions have been raised in the West, and even in this chamber, about the operation of the Chinese family planning program. Certainly, there can be no argument but that it is a draconian program. The one-child policy and the financial penalties that are imposed if a family has more than one child are quite severe. This raises moral questions about the interference of the state in such private and intimate matters as family planning. When we were in Szechuan Province-one of the most populous of any in China, with 110 million people contained within an area about the size of Tasmania-it was made very clear to us by the officials, who were very open with us, that China has no choice. The effects of a policy involving no family planning would mean that within 30 or 40 years China's population would total some two billion, which would be catastrophic in its environmental and social impacts on its society. It would mean that the Chinese would not be able to improve the living standards of their own people, and that would lead to chaos in all its forms. Therefore, the argument put to us by the Chinese was that, draconian though the system is, they have no choice if they want to create a stable society. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions have been raised about the use of abortion in the family planning program. It is quite clear that the Chinese do not see abortion as the main means of family planning but as a last resort when other family planning methods fail. In Szechuan Province last year there were some two million births and 600,000 abortions. The evidence that we could see was that, overwhelmingly, those abortions resulted from the failure of the other contraceptive devices provided within the family planning program. </PARA>
<PARA> My own view-and I say this without equivocation-is that Australia should look to its bilateral aid program to providing assistance in a major way to the Chinese family planning program. We should provide assistance to improve the contraception that is available and information about it to the Chinese people. I am not an expert in contraception, but I have to say, looking at the locally produced IUDs that are available to Chinese women, which involve a steel ring, my impression was that they looked more like torture weapons than devices for the prevention of conception. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Vicki Bourne, a member of our delegation, said, the issue of family planning in China is really an issue of women's health and it should be seen in that light. Therefore, it is quite justifiable for Australia, with our modern technology and modern medical system, to be able to provide advice to the Chinese on the issue of family planning. </PARA>
<PARA> Tibet was a very sad episode of our visit. I do not think any of us expected that the circumstances of the Tibetan people would be as bad as those we saw when we were there. The Tibetan people are clearly unhappy with present governmental arrangements. It is clear that an overwhelming majority-I have said previously in press releases and press comments that I would estimate the figure at about 90 per cent-of Tibetan people support the Dalai Lama not only as a religious figure but also as a political figure. Everywhere we went in Tibet that was quite clear. People were asking for photographs of the Dalai Lama, irrespective of whether they were 10-year-old monks or very elderly people. </PARA>
<PARA> Another member of our delegation, Kevin Garratt, who is a Tibetan linguist and expert, described Chinese policy in Tibet as ringbarking the culture. Australia has a long knowledge of the impact of ringbarking trees. It is a very apt description of the way in which the culture of Tibet is being slowly starved by present policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There will always be dissent and disruption in Tibet by the Tibetan people against the Chinese authorities while no accommodation is reached with the Dalai Lama and proper Tibetan autonomy. We urge in our report that the Chinese Government enter into a serious dialogue with the Dalai Lama to reach an accommodation for proper autonomy within Tibet so that the Tibetan culture, language and people can govern their own affairs at a level that the rest of the world would see as reasonable and therefore overcome the cycle of dissent and uprisings which then leads to repression in all its forms. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier in my remarks that when we went to China we did not have any great expectations that we would be able to get people released from prison or that we would be able to dramatically change Chinese law. We went there to establish hopefully the beginning of a dialogue. I believe that that was our major aim and we successfully achieved it. In a meeting that was organised very quickly at our request, we spoke with Zhu Rongji, the Vice-Premier of China, one of the three or four senior leaders of the country. An indication of how important the Chinese saw our visit was the fact that we were able to meet with Vice-Premier Zhu. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very open discussion we had with him, he made it clear that there is now a formal dialogue established between Australia and China. It is formal and open, which means that in the future Australia can raise with the Chinese Government, without inhibition, human rights issues. We might not always get the answer we like but at least we have established that channel for dialogue. This means that individual cases can be raised, although most of them will be raised privately. General issues can also be raised. That is a small but very significant step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that Zhu Rongji's invitation to the delegation to return to China in the near future is a significant step forward. As the Minister said, although the Chinese have held the formal view for a long time that human rights are an internal matter for China, the fact that they have invited us back to discuss human rights issues means that they are accepting that human rights are on the international agenda. No matter how much an individual country may wish to ignore them, the members of the rest of the world community will raise them when they are concerned about the evidence in a particular country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the invitation to return is an offer that should be taken up during next year. Members of the delegation are more than willing to be part of that delegation on its return. I believe that there is a good case to be said for as far as possible having the same members of the delegation return to China. What we learnt on our first visit to China about the Chinese system of government and the contacts we made have given us a well-established basis to improve the level of dialogue and raise particular issues again even more strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making two points. Firstly, it is said that, as a Western country, we should be sensitive to the cultural differences of other countries in how they see human rights, which may not be the same as in a Western democracy. I believe that we should not put too much weight on that view. Human rights are basic rights for all people. No matter whether one is a peasant in China or Ethiopia or is an oppressed person in Eastern Europe or wherever, one is entitled to enjoy the basic rights that everyone understands. Poor illiterate peasants do not want their families gaoled at will, their crops confiscated without compensation, or members of their families tortured and held without trial for long periods. These basic individual human rights are, in my view, well understood by ordinary people all over the world, irrespective of the different political cultures of different countries. I do not think that Australia should be in any way backward in raising issues of individual human rights, despite differing political cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to comment on why we should not let up and why dialogue with China is important. In the discussion about China's legal system, the delegation got into long dialogue about the definition of political crimes, such as counter-revolutionary activity. We tried to get from the Chinese officials what these things actually meant. I gave an example to one official. I asked whether putting up a sign outside a house saying `Down with Deng Xiaoping' was a counter-revolutionary crime? The official paused and said, `If it is an attack on Deng Xiaoping personally, it is not a counter-revolutionary crime. But if it is an attack on the State and the existence of the State, it is a counter-revolutionary crime'. I then asked who decides upon the definition. The response was confused, which indicates the real problem of human rights in a country such as China. The legal system does not define such things as counter-revolutionary activity. The definition is whatever the local official concerned with the incident defines it to be. Therefore, nobody is sure whether the activities being carried out are legal or illegal and it becomes a standard, repressive measure. If people are not sure of the definition of the law, they therefore do nothing in case they act contrary to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The dialogue with the representatives of China should be about making it clear to them that over time their law has to be reformed and that the wonderful clauses in their constitution talking about equality, et cetera, have to be carried out in their administrative law and clearly defined so that people can understand them. These things should not left to the whim of an individual official because when that happens, there will be abuses of human rights and basically a lawless system will result. There are the beginnings of signs amongst Chinese officials that they understand that, if they want a modern, technologically based industrial society, they have to have the rule of law well established, and understand that there cannot be a modern society with a modern economy without understanding the need for individual human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I was honoured to lead the delegation to China. Our report is by no means a definitive one on the human rights situation in China. We hope that it has begun the dialogue between both countries and become a document for debate, not only within Australia but also in the international community so that the international community with Australia can be involved in continuing the pressure on the Chinese Government to improve human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Human Rights Delegation to China and Tibet was not an easy one. Nevertheless, it was a fascinating and, I believe, extremely worthwhile experience. I am very pleased that I went. I am grateful that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) invited me to be part of the delegation, and I hope that I was able to make a worthwhile contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the significant differences between Australian and Chinese interpretations of human rights, I was encouraged by the relative willingness of the Chinese to discuss human rights with the delegation, particularly towards the end of the trip. I was also encouraged by the seniority of the bureaucrats with whom we met. Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji indicated that the Chinese Government regards the process of dialogue begun by the delegation's visit to be both formal and open and that the delegation would be welcome to return for a further visit. I believe that this is a significant step in Sino-Australian relations and a significant step towards China's acceptance of human rights as a legitimate universal concern. As Senator Schacht has said, we never expected this delegation to change the world in one fell swoop. However, we still believe that this was a worthwhile initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the larger sections of the delegation's report is concerned with its perceptions of Tibet. I must admit that Tibet was one of my main interests on this trip. Tibet is the saddest place to which I have ever been. We were in Lhasa for four days. We found the oppressive presence of armed security forces everywhere, including about 20 paces behind us wherever we went. </PARA>
<PARA> The word `Tibet' conjures up majestic and mystical images and sounds: the awesome magnificence of the Himalayas; vast plains; craggy, snow covered, cloud shrouded mountains, unimaginably high to those of us who are used to thinking of Mount Kosciusko as the highest mountain in our continent. Tibet is known by many names: the Roof of the World; the Land of Snows; Shangri-la; and the Forbidden Kingdom-all romantic and beautiful names. Tibet still has the aura to most of those who have not seen it of an inviolable and charmed country. But this pristine image is a false one. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that since the Chinese occupation of Tibet in the 1950s the destruction of this beautiful and fragile area has been immense. In our four days in Tibet, we were able to see Lhasa and some of the surrounding countryside. As Lhasa is 12,000 feet above sea level, most of us suffered to some degree from altitude sickness, which did not help our mobility. Nevertheless, we were all determined to see and do as much as possible in our short time in Tibet; in fact, we did achieve much. </PARA>
<PARA> The most striking features of our visit to Tibet were the massive presence of military installations and personnel; the deeply religious nature of the Tibetan people; the stark difference between the two cultures, with the consequent suffocation of the Tibetan culture; and the enormous support among the Tibetan people for the Dalai Lama. Everywhere we went we were asked surreptitiously and openly for photographs of the Dalai Lama. Among the striking features of Tibet, the most striking is the landscape, which is spectacular, remote and wild. </PARA>
<PARA> The forests of Tibet represent the largest forested landmass now available to China. Domestic demand for timber in China is rising steadily, growing by 44 per cent from 1982 to 1988. According to official Chinese reports, timber worth $US54 billion has been logged in Tibet since 1959. It is interesting to contrast that figure with the $US3.3 billion which we were told has been generously given to the Tibet autonomous region by the central Chinese Government during that period. This means that the value of the timber alone taken out of Tibet is equal to 16 times the value of the aid given back to the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Tibet is also reported to hold rich reserves of more than 40 minerals, including copper, gold, iron ore, borax, jade, magnesium, nickel, silver, tungsten, petroleum, coal and, importantly, uranium reserves which are estimated to be the largest in the world. Since the 1950s the Chinese have substantially worked many of these deposits. It is estimated that the value of borax extracted from North Tibet enabled the Chinese to repay their debt to the Russians incurred during the 1940s and 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> The main forests of Tibet are in the Brahmaputra catchment area. Kingdon Ward, who visited the area in the 1920s and 1930s, described how every village was sheltered by trees such as pear, crab apple, willow, walnut and white poplar. He considered that in summer it would be one of the most delightful spots in the world. A very different scene is described by Clair Longrigg and Bradley Rowe in their article `Deforestation in Western China'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Endless convoys of timber trucks travel from expanded towns . . . and many of the nearby hillsides have been shaved bare. Perhaps the most distressing sight is the sheer waste of wood. Only the largest trunks are removed by truck and the rest is left to rot. No effort is made to replant and soil erosion on the steep slopes soon ensures that regeneration of the forests becomes virtually impossible. Downstream, the increased silt levels pose a serious risk of floods in India and Bangladesh. </PARA>
<PARA>In Chengdu, we saw several trucks coming from Tibet laden with logs of varying size, the largest of which were massive. Sawn logs were also in evidence in the river to the west of Chengdu, coming from the Himalayas. The greatest devastation is reported to be in the catchment area of the Yangtze where tributaries have been stripped so bare that they are described by Longrigg and Rowe as `deserts'. </PARA>
<PARA> An eminent British botanist, visiting the Yangtze catchment in 1986, observed over 80 per cent loss of forest and no serious attempt at reforestation. He was told that a quarter of a million walnut trees were declared elitist during the cultural revolution and were promptly destroyed. The cultural revolution must have been one of the most senselessly destructive periods in world history. Throughout China and Tibet, we were frequently confronted by the consequences of the mass hysteria of that time. While our Chinese hosts, whose lives had been intimately affected by the cultural revolution for a very long time, did not appear to be as appalled and distressed by it as we were, they showed deep regret and sorrow over the excesses of that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The magnificent Ganden Monastery, built into the side of a remote mountain, which must once have been one of the most breathtaking sights in the world, is now a collection of heaps of rubble. It is being painstakingly and slowly rebuilt by peasants and the monastic community. During the cultural revolution, the vast majority of the treasures of the Tibetan monasteries and nunneries were looted by the Chinese. Statues were melted down, sold or used as landfill. Other precious artefacts also disappeared and religious texts were destroyed en masse. </PARA>
<PARA> We were frequently told of the marvels of modernisation in Tibet, as evidenced by the building of roads. Before 1950, there were few roads in Tibet. By 1970, a comprehensive network of roads had been established. Since then, hundreds of minor roads have been built to give access to remote areas. Large volume timber transport and, therefore, forest destruction is impossible without roads. I do not recall seeing any other vehicles on the roads outside Lhasa besides military transports. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a decade ago, the problem of deforestation was identified and apparently accepted by the Chinese. However, Landsat images, eyewitness reports and assessments by Chinese and Tibetan environmentalists all demonstrate that deforestation is continuing at an alarming rate, with no prospect of being arrested. The China Daily reported in March 1989 that only 26 million out of 153 million hectares replanted in the last 40 years had survived. Replanting has concentrated on `the four besides'-beside water, beside houses, beside fields and beside roads. Replanting remote areas has a very low priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1950s, snow leopards, blue sheep, antelope, gazelle, deer, kiang, mountain cats, musk deer and bears-all of which roamed freely in Tibet in harmony with each other and the land-have all but disappeared. In and around Lhasa, we saw some sheep and cattle, hundreds of dogs and yaks. Indeed, in my experience, yaks have an all pervasive presence in Tibet. Yak butter has a scent uniquely its own and a scent which I shall never forget. The drinking of yak butter tea is a unique experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation's brief was, of course, to obtain information on Chinese policies affecting human rights. Chinese policies in Tibet appear to adversely affect almost every aspect of the life of Tibetans. This is summed up in paragraph 8 of the chapter on Tibet. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Tibetans unconnected with the Government overwhelmingly opposed Chinese control of Tibet, sought independence and the return of the Dalai Lama, were unequivocal about lack of religious freedom and civil and political rights and talked of a lack of justice, education, employment and freedom of expression, as well as restrictions on movement. They asserted that Tibetan culture and religion were gradually being submerged by the sheer weight of Chinese influences. The Delegation was told of their fear of arrest, interrogation and detention for merely being seen to converse with foreigners. Monks often spoke of close surveillance, yet the authorities insisted that security personnel were only stationed inside the major monasteries to protect property-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, what property is left. Many of these fears were backed up by empirical evidence. Although outward manifestations of religious observance were in evidence at most sites the delegation visited, it appears that the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism inside Tibet are crumbling. The number of teachers able to impart the doctrine to the next generation is very small and is declining. Scholars with whom the delegation met attested to the difficulty of attaining high academic standards nowadays. Very few religious personnel are qualified at the highest level. Study is made difficult because fewer monks and nuns means those who are left have heavier workloads and teachers are few and far between. Education can be freely obtained in the Tibetan language at primary school level but becomes more difficult to obtain at secondary school level. Tertiary education is available only in Chinese, except for Tibetan Studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of China's nuclear testing is reported to have taken place at Lop Nor, on the northern border of Tibet. However, the delegation received no answer to questions about nuclear testing. We did not meet any officials who had any information on nuclear or chemical weapons or on the disposition or size of the People's Liberation Army in Tibet. According to the US Tibet Committee, however, one quarter of the People's Liberation Army nuclear force is located in Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, although to my untrained eye about half the population of Lhasa appeared to be Han Chinese-a great many of them in uniform-the people I spoke to were not keen to stay in Tibet for any more time than was strictly necessary. They were all looking forward to returning home at the end of their contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> Before 1950, Tibet was inhabited by Tibetan tribes and a few Mongol settlers from the time of Kublai Khan. The only Chinese were a few traders and administrators in market towns along the main caravan routes. At least in Lhasa that situation has changed dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say a few words about the members of the delegation. It was a very hard-working delegation. I believe that, in one radio interview, Senator Schacht described the trip as `gruelling'. I would agree with that. We extended our meetings as long as we possibly could and, in general, we would get back to the hotel after one meeting and would have to be back in the lobby in 10 minutes to get going for the next meeting. If we were lucky, we had up to half an hour in which to get ready for dinner. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht led the delegation with some style. He generally remained quite calm, even after considerable provocation, and always knew exactly where the fine line was between forceful advocacy of human rights and pushing the Chinese too far. I can recall one incident when he told our translator-and I hope I am not misquoting him- `translate this very carefully-that is a ridiculous excuse and an insult to our intelligence'. I must admit that I waited with some trepidation to see whether we would ever get out of the Beijing No. 1 prison, but we did. Senator Schacht demonstrated yet again that he had not gone far enough over the line for us to have caused trouble, although I must say that I believe that they were pleased to see the back of us when we left that establishment. Mr Connolly added panache to the delegation, although it was a bit of a shame that he spent his birthday on the sick list in Tibet. In spite of that, he demonstrated remarkable determination by attending meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Fitzgerald is obviously still well known and well respected throughout China. His knowledge of Chinese history and affairs and his ability to speak fluent Mandarin were invaluable. Professor Tay is an amazing woman. Her knowledge of the Chinese legal system is extensive and very detailed, and her language skills were very useful. She was also the most disgustingly healthy and energetic person on the delegation. Mr Sidoti had a special interest in prison and detention centre conditions and race discrimination. He also had some very interesting ideas concerning a visit to Tiananmen Square but, unfortunately, we were unable to find the time for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sheppard, the delegation secretary, has an extensive knowledge of Australia's actions and policies in the field of human rights. Dr Rigby is said by the Chinese themselves to speak better Mandarin than many Chinese. Mr Garratt's expertise in the Tibetan language and culture were absolutely invaluable. He is also the only westerner I have ever met who actually likes yak butter tea. He drank it voluntarily at breakfast. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of hard work was put in by all members during the preparation, during the trip and afterwards in writing up the report. Despite the disparate nature of the substantial contributions to the first draft from all members, I believe that the finished report is a cohesive and competent reflection of the delegation's findings and I am very pleased to be associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that I truly believe that the only way in which the Chinese Government will ever come to any satisfactory arrangement with the Tibetan people is by recognising their fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights covenants, and by negotiating without preconditions with the Dali Lama. Most honourable senators will know that article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights calls for the self-determination of peoples. The Tibetans are a distinct people with a distinct history, appearance and culture. I believe that they are entitled to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> On our last day in China, I was asked by one of our escorts whether, now that I had been to Tibet and seen the conditions there for myself, I was still a splittist-someone who wants Tibet to be split from China. All I can say is that, after having visited Tibet, I am now more of a splittist than I was when I first moved in the Australian Parliament a motion on Tibet. If the Tibetan people want to govern themselves, they should be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Europe is changing. Africa and Asia are changing. China cannot maintain the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat forever. The political unrest throughout Tibet and China itself cannot be contained much longer. While China has made significant advances since the dark days of the cultural revolution, it cannot be denied that the human rights situation in Tibet in particular leaves much to be desired. I believe that the delegation made this point strongly throughout China and Tibet. I hope that we have encouraged the Chinese Government to come closer to accepting the universality of human rights. If we have, the trip has been worth while. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I present a discussion paper entitled Methods of Dispute Resolution prepared by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs as part of its inquiry into the cost of legal services and litigation in Australia. This is the fourth discussion paper prepared by the Committee as part of this inquiry. It is directed towards the examination of paragraph (d) of its terms of reference, which requires the Committee to inquire into and report on whether there are any practicable alternatives to the present legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware that the methods of dispute resolution available outside the formal litigation process have been the subject of some considerable interest in recent times. It is also aware that they have been the topic of a considerable number of investigations and reports. However, evidence that the Committee has obtained so far leads it to the view that it is possible that alternative dispute resolution techniques, if properly used, would result in savings in the system. Therefore, the Committee is going to consider them in some detail as part of its `cost of justice' inquiry. The discussion paper is designed to further the current debate concerning methods of dispute resolution and to highlight issues on which the Committee would welcome further evidence. I emphasise that it does not represent the Committee's final views concerning this aspect of its inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now make some comments about the people who prepared the discussion paper. Stephen Marshall, who unfortunately has left us, did splendid work on the paper together with Fiona Matthews, who has been an adornment to the Committee since she joined it. James Warmenhoven, the Acting Secretary, has also done a lot of good work. The departing Secretary, Bronwyn McNaughton, who has gone to Harvard to become an ivy leaguer, also deserves mention. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of an alternative dispute resolution is worth pursuing. However, the question always arises as to what jurisdiction the superior courts of the land should have over that. I am very conscious of the concern that the Supreme Court judges of Victoria had about that. They dealt with it in their 1988 annual report. I notice that reference is made in the discussion paper to the Supreme Court of Australia. Of course, it should be the Supreme Court of Victoria, and that will be corrected when the final report is presented. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I am very conscious of is the very recent decision in the Polyukhovich war crimes case, in which the High Court of Australia also turned to the question of how the judiciary should have control of the decision-making process in so far as that decision making relates to matters judicial. The Committee and I will turn our minds to the extent to which the legislature or the Executive-an arm of government outside the judiciary-can discuss and properly look at matters such as those that are contained in this paper, bearing in mind what the High Court has said about matters to do with the administration of justice, including the question of costs. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I have great pleasure in presenting to the Senate a Private Members Bill which seeks to protect the biodiversity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the United Nations Environment Program (1991), ``estimates of the number of living species on Earth vary from 5 million to 30 million, of which only 1.4 million have been identified and classified . . . '' They state that ``though there is no precise estimate of the number of species that have been lost, . . . experts believe that 25 percent of the Earth's total biological diversity is at risk of extinction during the next 20 to 30 years . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA>Australia, like nearly every continent on earth, is suffering a major crisis in the loss of biological diversity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Threatened Species Bill 1991, is designed to establish a comprehensive and co-ordinated response to the alarming loss of species that is common in this and most other countries throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA>There are four reasons why we, as Australians and global citizens should preserve our biodiversity:</PARA>
<PARA>* Natural ecosystems, comprise a complex web of species, populations and ecological communities, providing indispensable services. Ecosystems are the life support systems of our planet. If they fail, not only will we jeopardise our current standard of living but potentially the entire wellbeing of humankind. </PARA>
<PARA>* Protecting biodiversity confers significant potential economic benefits. Plants, animals and micro-organisms provide all our food, and many of our drugs and medicines, and other valuable resources such as fuel, building materials, clothing, paper and leather. Novel chemicals and unexpected genetic information is being discovered continuously. Once lost a species containing this information is denied to all later generations. Options for our dependants are foreclosed. For example, some Australian marsupials contain genetic information which allows them to closely control their fertility. This information may be vital to human survival. </PARA>
<PARA>* The third reason for conserving species and habitats is one of cultural and aesthetic reasons. Species and habitats should be preserved because their beauty and intrinsic interest are of great emotional value to our community. </PARA>
<PARA>* The fourth reason is based on an ethic of concern and compassion for other creatures which share this planet with us. Other species have a right to exist. </PARA>
<PARA>Traditional conservation methods have not dealt with the problem of species and habitat loss adequately. </PARA>
<PARA>``Traditional conservation activities are too disparate, fragmented, and limited to bring about fundamental changes necessary to bring the loss of diversity to a halt. The best way to slow the loss of biodiversity is through diverse, coordinated, and participatory programs that attack the problem at its roots, builds support among wide-ranging institutions and individuals, draws on the best modern science, and establishes biodiversity conservation in its rightful place as a basic prerequisite of development policy.'' IUCN, 1990</PARA>
<PARA>These principles are embedded in the Threatened Species Bill presented to the Senate today. If accepted by this parliament, the Bill will provide a substantial basis for the movement of our society towards ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA>``The world's renewable resources, such as forests, fisheries, wildlife, and crops, are of immense use to people, while the genetic diversity of these resources allows continued adaptation to the world's changing conditions. What's more, the highly diverse natural ecosystems that support this wealth of species also maintain hydrological cycles, regulate climate, build soils, absorb and break down pollutants, and provide sites for spiritual enrichment, tourism and research. To waste Earth's riches, is to rob the world's rural poor of sustainable livelihoods, and deprive future generations of the resources they will need to survive and prosper.'' IUCN, 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Threatened Species Bill will begin to address the fundamental causes of the loss of our wildlife and as a consequence the stability of our ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA>GLOBAL SPECIES EXTINCTION</PARA>
<PARA>The IUCN (1990) note that:</PARA>
<PARA>``The world is being impoverished by the loss and degradation of its most fundamental living resources-its genes, species, habitats, and ecosystems . . . This loss of the planet's living richness is both wrong and dangerous. Wrong, because we should accept that all species have a right to exist, as the U.N. General Assembly stated when it adopted the World Charter for Nature in 1982. Dangerous, because the world's environmental systems are humanity's life-support mechanisms, and we do not know which components are key to maintaining their essential functions.''</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Michael Archer, from the University of New South Wales describes humanity's destruction of its life support systems most graphically. He argues that ``we have to book ourselves into the same league as the comet that may have struck the earth and obliterated half of the vertebrates from the world 65 million years ago. We are that sort of catastrophe. We are an extincting force, the like of which the world has never seen before''. (Earthworm, May 1991)</PARA>
<PARA>A British ecologist puts it just as graphically when he calls man's destruction of nature as the ``greatest setback to life's abundance and diversity since the first flickering's of life almost 4 billion years ago.'' (Time Magazine Jan, 1989)</PARA>
<PARA>It is incredibly arrogant for Homo sapiens, in 1991, to think that it knows enough about the operation of the natural world that, in any sense, it will work better or even as well with more and more species being removed through humanity's uncaring exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA'S RECORD SINCE EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT</PARA>
<PARA>The problem of species extinction is not restricted to overseas countries. Indeed, European Australia has one of the worst records of species extinction of any country and our extinction rates are still unacceptably high-even today. </PARA>
<PARA>In the past 200 years, since the settlement of this continent by Europeans, Australia is known to have lost 30 large and visible animals and 100 plants. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Harry Recher from the University of New England notes that ``Recognition of the impact of European settlement on the Australian landscape and its flora and fauna has been slow to emerge. Most Australians view the continent as vast, unspoiled and underpopulated. Yet in historical times, no other continent has experienced the massive changes in the distribution and abundance of such a large proportion of its vertebrate fauna as has Australia. In 200 years Europeans have recast the evolutionary biogeography of the continent.''</PARA>
<PARA>And this appalling record is continuing. Australia has an estimated 111 animals and nearly 1000 plants that are currently threatened with extinction. (Endangered Species Program)</PARA>
<PARA>But unlike other nations, the great tragedy is that most Australians don't even know about the wildlife we are destroying. Australians know more about the plight of the African elephant or the Bengal tiger than they do about the Thylacine, the Bilby or the Quoll. That indeed is a great tragedy that we must urgently redress if we are to gain community support in preserving our biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an outrage, that a nation whose high standard of living is dependant almost entirely on the natural environmental assets of this continent, can have such little regard for its continued health, and show such indifference to the plight of many unique native species that share this continent with us.</PARA>
<PARA>THE CAUSES OF EXTINCTION</PARA>
<PARA>To satisfactorily address the real causes of extinction, it is necessary to turn to principles of population ecology and to the historical record. </PARA>
<PARA>Three processes affect the extinction of species (Clark, 1990). They are described in figure 1. </PARA>
<PARA>Extinction is a complex process which occurs over many years. It is not simply the death of the last individual of a species. The first stage involves major systematic factors such as habitat loss or change. Populations become fragmented. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, random factors, such a drought, fire and floods are unpredictable in occurrence and consequence. The smaller the population size, the more susceptible it is to extinction from chance events (Shaffer, 1981). </PARA>
<PARA>The third process wipes out the remaining isolated individuals or small groups. By now extinction os inevitable without expensive and very deliberate human intervention. </PARA>
<PARA>Extinction occurs at the level of populations and not at the level of species (Gilpin &amp;Soule, 1986). Because of this, conservation strategies must focus on managing for population viability. </PARA>
<PARA>Figure 1</PARA>
<PARA>The Extinction Process</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>[FIGURE OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 1265]</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The following examples work at one or several of these levels in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> * Habitat destruction, from expanding human populations and activities, because most species cannot exist outside natural or semi-natural ecosystems;</PARA>
<PARA> * Habitat change and degradation, such as changed fire regimes, weed invasion, erosion and grazing by introduced herbivores;</PARA>
<PARA> * Introduced animals, such as the fox and cat which are now abundant and are implicated in the disappearance of remnant populations of mammals and ground-dwelling birds;</PARA>
<PARA> * Introduced plants, which have in some instances taken over complete ecosystems;</PARA>
<PARA> * Introduced diseases, such as a root fungus in south-western Australia where in some places 90% of the plant biomass can be lost;</PARA>
<PARA> * Direct exploitation, by hunting of animals such as the Thylacine, Southern Right Whales and Fur Seals;</PARA>
<PARA> * Climatic change, which is increasingly likely to be a cause of extinction in the future due to changes caused by the greenhouse effect and the difficulty for remnant natural ecosystems to adapt; and</PARA>
<PARA> * an interaction of one or more of the above causes. </PARA>
<PARA>A substantial proportion of the current extinctions and threats of extinction have come from a combination of habitat alteration, introduction of herbivores, such as sheep, cattle and the rabbit, and the introduction of predators such as the fox and cat. </PARA>
<PARA>``With this theory of extinction as a background, it seems obvious that in developing management strategies for species conservation, we need to manage populations and their habitats with the goal of maintaining large, viable populations of all wildlife species. This notion is at the heart of preventative conservation programs. If we do not carry out these programs, we will be forced into crisis intervention in case after case-an expensive and time consuming proposition.'' (Clark, 1990)</PARA>
<PARA>This principle underlies this Threatened Species Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>HISTORY OF SPECIES EXTINCTION IN AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA>Recher and Lim (1990) note that ``The impact of European settlement (on terrestrial fauna) has been greatest on mammals and birds. In the 200 years since the colony was established in 1788 at Port Jackson, 17 species of terrestrial mammals, three taxa of birds and the Adelaide blue-tongue lizard are known to have become extinct. </PARA>
<PARA>``Eight species of mammals formerly occurring on the mainland survive only on isolated, small offshore islands.''</PARA>
<PARA>Many people think that the great extinctions of our wildlife and their habitats occurred in the very early days of European settlement and that damage has all but stopped. </PARA>
<PARA>This view could not be farther from the truth. The rates of extinction on this continent are as rapid now as they were at any time in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>Recher and Lim (1990) state that: ``In describing the decline and extinction of the Australian terrestrial vertebrate fauna, we are not describing changes over 200 years of settlement. Instead, most events occurred within 20 or 30 years of an area being settled. For most of the continent the changes described occurred within this century. The impact of Europeans on the Australian environment is not measured in centuries, but in decades. This pattern is now being repeated in the south-west and north-west of the continent as settlement of these regions intensifies.''</PARA>
<PARA>THE THREATENING PROCESS</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the mammal extinctions and threats can be linked to this combination of factors and frequently they occur over a relatively short period of time. </PARA>
<PARA>Recher and Lim (1990), predict that ``there will be further significant declines in the distribution and abundance of birds throughout the same regions where the native mammal fauna has already disappeared. These will follow the same pattern as the mammals with the rapid extinction of species or a reduction in abundance to small, tenuous relict populations persisting where conditions remain marginally favourable. Although we talk of species, the patterns described are of entire ecosystems disappearing. The scale of change is not of individuals or populations, but of functional units of interacting organisms. Once destroyed, it is no more likely that an ecosystem can be restored to its original state any more than an extinct species can be resurrected from its bones recovered from a museum draw.''</PARA>
<PARA>If Australia is to save its fauna and flora, emphasis needs to shift from, species preservation to the management of ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Threatened Species Bill recognises that preserving biodiversity means retaining viable populations in natural ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA>A 5 STEP PLAN TO SAVE OUR</PARA>
<PARA>BIODIVERSITY</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats suggest a 5 point plan that we believe the government can and should adopt, to reverse the threatening processes that affect the species in our unique natural and rural environments. The Threatened Species Bill is one important part of this plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Step 1: Funding to conserve threatened species and habitats</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government proudly boasts an Endangered Species Program which provides funding of $5 million this year. This represents 0.005% of the Federal budget. The Federal Government's current funding level represents about 31 cents a year for each Australian to save its irreplaceable heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government spent more on landscaping the grounds around this Parliament House, than they have spent on saving species in Australia in the past three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the current financial and structural arrangements, the Endangered Species Program is reactive in its outlook and will do little to overcome the enormous problem we are facing with the loss of species and habitats. </PARA>
<PARA>Michael Kennedy, from the World Wide Fund for Nature has described the current level of funding as ``laughable''. He has stated that this level of funding is perhaps a thousandth of what we need for the coming decades. </PARA>
<PARA>``It will not serve to stop the growing list of species under threat, it will simply serve to watch the list grow longer: it's just not enough.'' (Earthworm 22/5/91)</PARA>
<PARA>Unless we as Australians make a commitment now to start to fix the fundamental problems with the management of our natural environment we are never going to solve the problem, and extinctions will continue. </PARA>
<PARA>This lack of funding is compounded by the lack of certainty and continuity of funding. This lack of continuity leads to programs being devised which do not take a long term perspective and instead rely on achieving quantifiable results in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>As a nation, we were able to plan a 25 year Snowy Mountains Scheme to help improve our economic wellbeing, but it appears a far simpler task of providing funding certainty to repair our natural environment cannot be done. </PARA>
<PARA>That of course is a nonsense-the problem in not the inability to provide certainty, it is the lack of political will to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia must prepare, in consultation with the community, conservation, industry, farm, fishing and forestry groups, a 200 year Australian conservation plan, which contains action plans, and funding targets for a least the first 10 years of this plan. </PARA>
<PARA>If it is good enough for the government to build a Parliament House to last 200 years, it is good enough for that Parliament to prepare a plan to ensure our environmental heritage is protected for that same amount of time. </PARA>
<PARA>The 200 year plan must integrate the management of all extinction threatening processes: the loss of habitat, protecting endangered species, populations and ecological communities, and controlling the numbers, type and range of many feral animals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy should be jointly managed by appropriate government departments and community groups to ensure that the most efficient funding programs are put in place and that the community feels part of the process of saving our environment. Bureaucracy alone is unlikely to achieve these goals effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>By 1994-95 funding for this program should reach $100 million per annum, with $40 million being for habitat protection (replacing the Save the Bush Program), $30 million for ensuring the survival of threatened species, and $30 million for the control of feral animals. </PARA>
<PARA>Step 2: An enhanced National Landcare Program</PARA>
<PARA>The existing Landcare program is an excellent initiative of the government, in that is encourages local communities to become involved directly in the conservation of their local environment. For this it should be complimented. However, we consider that funding of the program is not adequate, because the task is enormous and because landcare is a responsibility of all Australians and all Australians should share the financial cost of repair. </PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO claims that ``since European settlement some 52 per cent of Australia's agricultural and pastoral lands have been degraded and are now in need of reclamation. There is no reliable estimate of the cost of land degradation to Australia, nor of the status of our soils. Many believe that the value of the lost production is in excess of $600 million per year.''</PARA>
<PARA>This problem needs to be overcome rapidly if we are protect our agricultural economy and the natural environment on which it depends. The Australian Democrats would suggest therefore that the current program be expanded and restructured under the title of the ``National Landcare Program''. </PARA>
<PARA>Administration of the program should be by a National Landcare Council. This Council should be responsible to the Minister for Primary Industry, and comprise representatives from the Dept. Primary Industries and Energy, Dept. Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation, the National Farmers Federation, The Australian Conservation Foundation and Greening Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Landcare Council should include the existing National Soil Conservation Program, the One Billion Trees scheme, the National Water Research Program. </PARA>
<PARA>Funding levels should commence at $90 million in 1991-92 and increase to $170 million in 1993-94. Internal funding arrangement's should shift from an initial emphasis on research and extension to ensure the correct action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Landcare groups become more organised, and as the research and information on species types and planting techniques improves, a greater proportion of the increased funding should go to these groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Step 3: Biological and resource information research</PARA>
<PARA>It is critical to the management of our natural environment that we know what it consists of and how species interact with each other. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Biological Resources Survey (ABRS) which was established in 1973 is therefore, one of the most significant activities being undertaken in Australia at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>The ABRSs role is to identify the kinds of plants and animals that are in Australia and where these plants and animals are found. </PARA>
<PARA>The work of the ABRS is fundamental to any discussion on ecologically sustainable development. Without the basic information about the environment which we inhabit, it is impossible to plan an ecologically sustainable future.</PARA>
<PARA>However the level of funding given to the ABRS is so inadequate that it will not complete its work until the year 3000! This is clearly ridiculous and the government should set a priority to have the data base of all known flora and fauna completed in time for the bicentenary of Federation in 2001. </PARA>
<PARA>ABRS must be expanded and incorporate a program which I have called the Australian Biological and Environmental Survey. This program should:</PARA>
<PARA> * survey the type and location of all major Australian flora and fauna. This would allow the ABRS and their Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN) to upgrade their existing programs and undertake a comprehensive national biological and environmental resources survey;</PARA>
<PARA> * include a National Land Capability Assessment (NLCA) program of the Australian continent, Australian ocean fisheries and all Territories. The NLCA should survey all natural and rural lands in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> * establish an Environmental Resource Library (ERL) that provides access to data and modelling capabilities to interested nongovernment organisations on the same principle as that of a public library.</PARA>
<PARA>This program should receive funding of $24 million per annum, with $5 million towards the existing ABRS, $3 million for the NLCA, $15 million for ERIN and $1 million for the ERL. Such funding should be guaranteed for the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Step 4: Management of natural resources based on sustained yield harvesting</PARA>
<PARA>The Government should get fair dinkum about the long term management of our natural resources through proper research, monitoring and setting sustainable catch/harvest limits on our renewable resources, rather than trying to continue to deplete our environmental capital to hold up a poorly managed economy. </PARA>
<PARA>History has shown this to be a very difficult concept for our community to deal with, and considerable resources need to be put into achieving these principles. The history of our forest industries and fisheries are testament to poor management of renewable resources in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government should abandon its proposed resource security legislation. The ACF is quite correct when it states that ``resource security legislation is subsidising industry to destroy native forests''. </PARA>
<PARA>This was most clearly spelt out in The Australian on the 5th July where it noted that:</PARA>
<PARA>``In a rundown of the various State (Forestry) Commission performances . . . :</PARA>
<PARA> * Tasmania had not made a profit since 1935 and by 1989 has a notional shortfall of $520 million;</PARA>
<PARA> * Queensland had not made a profit since 1947, and its cumulative loss, in current terms, was more than $1.5 billion;</PARA>
<PARA> * The cumulative loss in Western Australia since the mid 1960s was $440 million;</PARA>
<PARA> * Victoria had cumulative shortfalls of about $1 billion by 1984, although much of this could be due to substantial investments in plantations;</PARA>
<PARA> * NSW had reported surpluses for two years, but had carried forward investment of more than $1 billion since 1981; and</PARA>
<PARA> * South Australia had a surplus since 1983.''</PARA>
<PARA>Step 4 in the Democrats plan is therefore administratively quite simple-the Government should immediately withdraw its intention to establish Resource Security legislation, put a real price on the value of our publicly owned renewable resources, such as the timber in our native forests and allow plantation forestry to become economically viable, instead of subsidising an inefficient and environmentally destructive industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Step 5: Legislation to protect endangered species</PARA>
<PARA>Step 5 is the legislative component of the programs I have just suggested. This Threatened Species Bill is designed to implement this essential element in a comprehensive national conservation program. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter to the Minister in May this year, the peak conservation groups (WWF, ACF, TWS and Greenpeace) stated that ``One of the most important tools in carrying out this long term recovery task is the development of Commonwealth Threatened Species Legislation.''</PARA>
<PARA>Endangered species legislation has been in existence in the United States since 1983, and it is urgent that Australia introduce such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>PROPOSED THREATENED SPECIES BILL</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill establishes a community based Commonwealth Threatened Species Advisory Committee (which includes conservationists, farmer groups, educators and scientists), and a Scientific Advisory Panel which provides scientific advice to the Committee and the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Administration of the Bill is to be by a Threatened Species Unit, which is given guidance in the administration of programs by the Advisory Committee and the Scientific Panel. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill establishes endangered species lists which identify threatened species, populations and ecological communities which the Commonwealth is obliged to protect, and requires the implementation of Threatened Species Recovery Plans. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also gives power to the Minister to issue Conservation Orders to restrain acts that are likely to be detrimental to threatened species, populations or ecological communities. </PARA>
<PARA>It provides for compensation to landholders who may be financially affected by aspects of this legislation or who wish to enter into voluntary Habitat Management Agreements with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Objects</PARA>
<PARA>The objectives of the Threatened Species Bill are to redress the fundamental problems facing Australia in the continuing loss of its biodiversity. The Bill identifies six objectives which address this problem. They are to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) ensure that threatened species, populations and ecological communities can survive and flourish;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ensure that threatened species, populations and ecological communities retain their genetic diversity and potential for evolutionary development in their natural habitat;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) prevent further species, populations and ecological communities from becoming endangered;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) encourage the States by way of resources and financial incentives, to introduce complimentary threatened species legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) provide programs-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) of community education in the conservation of flora and fauna; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to encourage co-operative management of flora and fauna between government authorities, corporations, landholders, community groups and individuals; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) assist other nations and negotiate international treaties to protect the biological heritage of humankind. </PARA>
<PARA>Powers to Protect Biodiversity</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill requires the Commonwealth to properly exercise its powers to protect threatened species, populations and ecological communities by imposing controls on the activities of government agencies, within Commonwealth Territories and, by foreign corporations and trading corporations. </PARA>
<PARA>Community Participation</PARA>
<PARA>The success of conservation of biodiversity lies in extensive processes of community co-operation and involvement in specific programs that overcome the processes that threaten species with extinction. </PARA>
<PARA>These participatory procedures are vital if the community at large is to feel that protection of biodiversity is a responsibility of all of us, and not just government and scientists who have traditionally administered conservation programs. They are essential if governments are to have the widespread community support for these protection programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The task is far too great to rely on a few people-it must involve the whole community through education and local action and co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>A community based, Commonwealth Threatened Species Advisory Committee is therefore established, which is to have a major influence in the management of endangered species programs. </PARA>
<PARA>This Advisory Committee comprises three government appointed officers and six representatives nominated by community groups such as the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greening Australia, the World Wide Fund for Nature (Australia), and the Australian Association for Environmental Education. </PARA>
<PARA>This Committee is given wide responsibility for overseeing programs and for providing guidance and assistance to the Minister on matters relating to conservation. These responsibilities include giving guidance on the preparation and of a Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy, the preparation of Species Recovery Plans, and on the preparation of Threatening Process Action Plans. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the establishment of this and other community committees, the Bill gives any person or organisation the authority to nominate a species, population or ecological community as threatened, and also allows any member of the community to take action through the courts to ensure that a threatened species are given full protection under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Assistance and Advice</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for Commonwealth financial support to the States. It also provides for financial support and expertise to be given to landholders, conservation organisations, local government bodies and Landcare groups that wish to assist in the conservation of Australia's biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA>This financial support includes grants to States to facilitate development of their own threatened species legislation and to assist in the control of threatening processes. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial support is also made available for community involvement in the development of a national education program. </PARA>
<PARA>International Obligations to Protect Biodiversity</PARA>
<PARA>Because Australia has an important role to play in the international efforts to protect global biodiversity, the Bill also deals with Australia's international obligations and highlights Australia's responsibility towards foreign assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill establishments a Foreign Assistance Program to support less developed countries, especially those in our Pacific region, and an Advisory Committee to assist Australian representatives on international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMUNITY</PARA>
<PARA>It is my intention to let this Bill lie on the table for a sufficient length of time to allow its full consideration by landholders, conservation groups, Landcare groups, government agencies and any other person interested in the future of our unique environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I also ask that Government and Opposition Senators also take advantage of this period to give the Bill serious consideration. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard and to table the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to make it clear that a statutory provision does not take away the privilege of freedom of speech in Parliament unless that provision expressly provides for that effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Until August last year it had not occurred to me, nor to any other person having any knowledge of the law relating to Parliament, that it would be necessary to have a bill to state an obvious principle. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time, however, an opinion of the Solicitor-General was provided to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. This opinion suggested that, in some circumstances, the secrecy provisions of section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act, although those provisions do not refer to the powers of the Committee established under the Act, could prevent the provision of evidence to that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many other such secrecy provisions in other acts of Parliament. Generally speaking, they provide that a person who discloses information obtained under an act without authorisation is guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>It had always been believed by those acquainted with the law of parliamentary privilege that these provisions could have no application to inquiries by parliamentary committees, because:</PARA>
<PARA> * the giving of evidence before a committee is a proceeding in Parliament, and a person may not be sued or prosecuted for anything said or done in the course of proceedings in Parliament (this was made clear by the declaratory provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987)</PARA>
<PARA> * it is a fundamental principle, confirmed as recently as 1985 by a joint opinion of the then Attorney-General and the then Solicitor-General, that parliamentary privilege is not affected by a statutory provision unless the provision explicitly states that the law relating to parliamentary privilege is amended by the provision (if this were not so, there are innumerable statutory provisions which could be interpreted as taking away parliamentary privilege). </PARA>
<PARA>The Solicitor-General's opinion raised the suggestion that all of the very many statutory secrecy provisions (there are estimated to be over three hundred of them) would prevent the provision of evidence to parliamentary inquiries in relation to any matter covered by those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a conclusion would virtually bring the inquiry activities of the two Houses and their committees to an end, because there would be virtually no subject which could be inquired into without encountering a statutory secrecy provision. </PARA>
<PARA>This possibility was raised even more starkly by an opinion of the Attorney-General's Department dated 15 April 1991 and tabled in the Senate on 30 May 1991. This opinion claimed that a statutory secrecy provision, which has absolutely no reference to parliamentary inquiries in it or in the act in which it appears, would prevent the provision of information to a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA>On 8 November 1990 I had introduced into the Senate a bill, the National Crime Authority (Powers of Parliamentary Joint Committee) Amendment Bill 1990, to make it clear that the secrecy provisions of the National Crime Authority Act do not have any application to inquiries by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The appearance of the Attorney-General's Department opinion, however, indicated that it was necessary to take action to deal with the effects of secrecy provisions generally. I therefore set about preparing this bill. </PARA>
<PARA>On 30 May 1991 another Attorney-General's Department opinion, dated 14 May 1990, was tabled in the Senate. This opinion took a completely contrary view to that of the opinion of 15 April 1991, and indicated that general statutory secrecy provisions do not prevent the giving of evidence to a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA>It thus appeared that the Attorney-General's Department had given contradictory advice on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>In response to a question which I asked on 16 August 1991, the Minister representing the Attorney-General tabled an opinion of the Solicitor-General dated 12 August 1991. This opinion indicates that a general statutory secrecy provision does not have any application to the giving of evidence to a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA>This opinion, however, still gives cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA>First, the Solicitor-General considers that a statutory provision may alter the law of parliamentary privilege not only by express words but also by ``necessary implication''. This raises the possibility that a secrecy provision may be interpreted as taking away parliamentary privilege if a ``necessary implication'' can be read into it. Thus it would still be a matter of interpretation as to whether a particular secrecy provision has any effect on parliamentary inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the Solicitor-General is still of the view that the secrecy provisions of the National Crime Authority Act may have some application to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. This is because a ` `necessary implication'' could be read into that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the opinion implies that that secrecy provision may bind not only the Joint Committee but the Houses of the Parliament themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, the opinion suggests that the law should be ``clarified'' in relation to the presentation to parliamentary committees of information which is the subject of secrecy provisions. This raises the possibility of legislation to impose new restrictions on parliamentary inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons, I have decided to proceed with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The bill would declare, and put beyond doubt, that a statutory provision affects parliamentary privilege only if it contains express words indicating such an effect. This declaratory provision would put to rest the suggestion that a general statutory provision can be invoked to stop a parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted by the adjournment of the Senate, I was in the middle of a speech on this Bill and was expressing my concern about the availability of assistance for people currently on invalid pensions. I was discussing the early intervention theory which the Government is putting forward as important, with which I do not agree, for getting people early when they go on disability pension and encouraging them through training and rehabilitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has finally admitted that the eligibility criteria for the invalid pension have been too lax for many years, hence, the reduction in the effect of socioeconomic factors in 1987 and a further tightening by this legislation. Also, there were very large numbers of long term sickness beneficiaries originally with supposedly temporary ailments who had transferred to the invalid pension. During the last five years, over 100,000 people have transferred from sickness benefits to the invalid pension, with over 25,000 people transferring during the last financial year alone. If these people remain on the invalid pension, as a very high percentage of them will, they will cost the Australian taxpayer close to $1 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sceptical about the applicability of early intervention theories to many people with disabilities. Often it is more difficult to cope with a disability in the period immediately following its onset. Over time, with the help of the community and family networks, it is not uncommon for there to be a marked reduction in the debilitating effect of a disability. In fact, many of the worthwhile reforms that the Government is implementing in accordance with the Disability Services Act are based on this very premise. However, the Government's income support policy for people with disabilities is based on a very different assumption; namely, that it is not worth while to assist people who were receiving invalid pensions before 1990 to access mainstream employment.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that 131,000 people or 42 per cent of current invalid pensioners are under 50 years of age. Sixty-two per cent of women receiving the invalid pension are under 50. Many of these people have significant work force potential. Not only do they possess a variety of work-related skills, but also the courage, determination and perseverance that they have exhibited in overcoming their disabilities would be a most valuable asset to any employer. What they need and what they desire is not one endless government handout, but access to training and job search assistance which will help them harness and enhance their skills so that they can achieve financial independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The hesitancy of the Department of Social Security in promoting these reforms does not mean that it believes that anyone who was on an invalid pension before the 1990 Budget cannot and should not be assisted. The main reason why DSS is not telling current pensioners about these reforms is that the Government has only provided sufficient rehabilitation and training places to cater for a minority of new claimants. An analysis of the allocated Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and DEET training places reveals that it would be difficult to cater for the estimated 12,000 active extreme disability service pensioners and 8,000 sickness allowees who will require rehabilitation and training annually, let alone any volunteers from the current pensioner population. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, 3,000 invalid pensioners and about 3,200 sickness beneficiaries access CRS places, while DEET training programs are off-limits to these people. The Government has allocated a further 4,500 CRS places and 4,250 DEET training places to cater for these reforms. There will be an increase of 4,000 in the number of supported and competitive employment places under the Disability Services Act. There is also a commitment to provide 8,000 CRS places for sickness allowees, although how this figure impacts on the 4,500 overall allocation has not been spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA> The best possible scenario is a parity between places and claimants. However, a number of other factors need to be taken into account. A significant proportion of claimants will need to access more than one program of assistance before they are ready for employment. The assistance required by many people will be longer than one year in duration. Some of the 4,000 places allocated under the Disability Services Act will be taken by people who are not in the 20,000 strong active stream. All these additional training and rehabilitation resources will only be phased in over the next three years. The combination of these factors raises doubt as to whether there are sufficient resources to cater for the designated active claimants, let alone an influx of further volunteers, particularly during the interim period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to look at the staff resources that have been allocated to implement these reforms. Initially, their administration will be coordinated by 75 disability support officers working in DSS. Their numbers will swell to 120 in 1993-94. Initially 46, but ultimately 72, DEET disability job seeker advisers will assess the training and Job Search needs of up to 24,000 clients. By 1993-94 there will also be an additional 168 CRS staff providing rehabilitation related assistance. There is little doubt that the workloads of these officers are based on an assumption that there will not be an influx of volunteers from the current pensioner population. Given the size of the staff allocation, it is also obvious that they would not be able to cope with such an influx. </PARA>
<PARA> A responsible government cannot simply say that the past is the past and leave over 316,000 existing invalid pensioners stranded in the too hard basket. From the start, the Government must promote these reforms within its current pensioner population. All pensioners should be informed that assistance is available and told how they can access it. Instead of using unconvincing, early intervention theory excuses, the DSS should direct some of its vast financial and staffing resources to undertaking a comprehensive study of the work force potential of its current invalid pensioner population. Upon completion of this study, work force potential indicators should be designed and used to implement a highly targeted, voluntary program of incentive based, work force related assistance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I commend the Minister for the direction of these reforms, but in view of their restricted application one must ask whether this Government has the courage to move away from the outdated, discriminatory and wasteful concept of permanent, no questions asked welfare for people with disabilities. I support the amendment moved by Senator Alston, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the Government for failing to extend the proposed reforms to Australia's current unacceptably large invalid pensioner population, with the inevitable result that there will be two classes of pensioners, poor targeting and a reduced capacity to assist the most disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) expresses its concerns at the Government's totally inadequate consultation with medical practitioners, health professionals, welfare groups and representatives of people with disabilities and their carers, resulting in serious uncertainties about the reliability and validity of the proposed Impairment Tables as well as over 100 proposed amendments since the bill was guillotined through the House of Representatives. </PARA>

It is unbelievable that, with such an important Bill as the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill presently before the chamber, the Minister for Social Security has not shown the chamber the courtesy of being present for the completion of his Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are in the process of the second reading debate, and I do not intend to take up much of the Senate's time. I believe that we have spent days on this Bill during legislation committee hearings and, therefore, because our contribution to this debate has been made by Senator Patterson, there is really no need for me to go into any further detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to say very clearly how well the new Senate legislation committees system on Fridays has worked. I do not believe we would be anywhere near finishing this Bill if we had not had that committee system functioning. The Minister told us very clearly in words of one syllable that he had consulted widely on this Bill with the various organisations that would be affected by the changes the Government has put forward. This was obviously far from the truth. The Minister consulted with a couple of umbrella organisations but many people came before us saying that they had not spoken to the Minister-the Minister had not contacted them in any way-and they were not members of the umbrella organisations. It is ridiculous, really, that because the Minister had not consulted widely enough we now have before us 116 amendments put forward by the Government-116 amendments! That is how widely the Minister consulted with the various organisations who represent the people that this Bill will affect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees went into great detail about the lack of consultation that had gone on, but we have presently a complete back-down by the Government. Obviously, the Government did not consult widely enough and there were so many unintended circumstances as a result of the legislation that it put before us originally that the Minister found the need for so many amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pleaded with the Minister to give us a new Bill to debate in this chamber. It is unbelievable that we have before us a Bill which needs 116 amendments to be dealt with during the committee stage, and that we have not been presented with a proper Bill which includes those 116 amendments. To my mind it is so inefficient and so typical of this Government and the Department that they present us with a Bill with 116 amendments to look at. However, Senator Richardson has seen fit not to attend but to send a Minister in his place-the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook)-who has absolutely no idea what in the world the Government is talking about and what the amendments are likely to be. It is a shame that Senator Richardson is not here to defend his position. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up time by going through the detail. I have not yet received a copy of the Australian Democrats' amendments, and I do not know whether they have all been tabled as yet. I ask whether Senator Lees can tell me when they were tabled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government I wish to respond to a number of points made by honourable senators from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the course of the second reading debate. Quite a number of honourable senators appear to take the line that consultation on the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991 was in some way inadequate. This inadequacy is supposed to be demonstrated in a number of ways, including the number of amendments being made to this Bill. I intend to have a look at that in the course of this discussion so that people understand how wrong that assertion is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, it ought to be noted that consultations on this Bill began in 1984 and have gone on continually ever since. One wonders what kind of consultation people want. In the course of the preparations of the disability task force in particular the consultations were long and exhaustive. It just cannot be said that consultation here has been inadequate. What can be said, of course, is that some groups do not like everything that is in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Opposition senators are in that category and so are some of the lobby groups. The fact that the Australian Council of Social Service in particular would not be happy with some aspects of this Bill is hardly surprising given that ACOSS has opposed the Newstart and JSA initiatives involving training. Mind you, it is not the kind of group that Senator Walters has been given to support in the past. Given that neither she nor the other members of the Opposition support any of their other assertions on this Bill, I am surprised that they would simply pick up on this. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not all that shocked by the attitude of the Opposition in claiming that there was inadequate consultation, and this is proved by the number of amendments. The person who has taken this to by far the greatest lengths has been Senator Lees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite a normal situation for Senator Walters to be wrong and me to be right, but it is a democracy, so she has a right to be wrong. I have an extraordinary press release here from Senator Lees which refers to 103 amendments. From my last count there are about 116. This is apparently an example of inadequate consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Walters listens she will hear what they are. A changed date of commencement forces 17 of the 116 amendments to come in because the date is often referred in the course of legislation; so that is 17. References to persons `in an institution' were changed to read `in disability accommodation'. That is a semantic change requested by a number of groups which affects nothing that is in the Bill-no substantive point. This caused 26 amendments. There are also a few amendments concerning sensory impairment.When we get to some of the really heavy stuff-the sort that normally comes in in every Bill-such as inappropriate words that might have been used, a wrong cross-referencing in a section, et cetera, we discover that about 78 of these amendments amount to absolutely nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact. Senator Walters's problem is that she has never been able to sort out rubbish from fact. What really irritates me is that when we look at the changes not in that category of being semantic, cross-referencing or whatever, we still do not get to any changes made in this Bill which in any way alter its thrust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were, as is always the case, consultations with affected groups, with the Opposition and with the Democrats. There will always be times during such discussions when the Government will agree to amendments. It happens in this chamber every single day. It is not unusual. It always happens, and for the very best of reasons. We have a democracy and people have an opportunity to consult with the Government, and as a result we make some changes. There is no question that every other Bill either I or any other Government Minister presents in here will suffer the same fate because, naturally enough, when one talks to more and more groups about their problems with the Bill one does agree to change. </PARA>
<PARA> I agreed to abolish penalties in this Bill. That is hardly a momentous decision, given that they were not going to apply for two years and given that I have said that we will have some further consultations on them before bringing them back. But again that does not amount to any substantive part of the Bill being amended because, as I have said, they would not start for two years. We have made changes concerning the incentive allowance, which will be able to be regained after being lost because of the commencement of work if the person resumes sheltered employment within two years. There are some changes to impairment tables and a change to the way the sickness allowance can be extended. But these are not in any way changes that alter the thrust of the Bill. So the claims made by Senator Lees are particularly disappointing. The claims made by Senator Walters are normal for Senator Walters. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that, particularly since March 1991, an enormous number of groups have been consulted and the attachments number in the hundreds. The idea that this is some sleight of hand trick pulled out of a hat at the last minute is absolute rubbish. It is also a pretty big insult to those people who worked in the disability task force for as long as they did and as effectively as they did to produce what is a major change in the way that we administer this policy in Australia; a major change from the way it has been done in the past; and, in my view, a change for the better. </PARA>
<PARA> To go through some other points raised during the debate, both Senator Alston and I think Senator Patterson raised the question of reviewing all existing clients. To attempt to do that would be a massive exercise. </PARA>

<PARA> A number of honourable senators have raised problems with impairment tables. These are worth commenting on. I have never claimed that impairment tables are perfect instruments. However, it is the case that there must be a basis for payment, a basis which will enable all Australian residents to be assessed in the same way. The impairment tables are the only way that I know of doing that assessment. These impairment tables have been in existence for some years; they are not brand new instruments. Most have been fully tested, with only one or two exceptions. Over time, I think they have proven to be the only way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no suggestion that impairment is the same as incapacity to work. I would have thought, particularly in reference to what Senator Lees has had to say in this debate, that was fairly obvious from the legislation. There is a two-stage process here. The first hurdle to jump is related to the 20 per cent impairment; then we look at those incapacity to work factors. They take into account a range of non-medical issues, but only after the impairment test has been passed. That is where a person's skills, literacy problems or whatever will be taken into account to determine the sort of training that might be appropriate. For those aged 55 years and over, a number of local factors can be taken into account. That is not a significant concession, given that more than 40 per cent of the invalid pension grants last year were made to those aged 55 years and over. </PARA>
<PARA> The impairment tables will be monitored very carefully during the next 12 months. We will involve medical experts from outside the Public Service as well as within. We will involve experts in the field of rehabilitation and we will look at where those impairment tables stand after that time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of her contribution Senator Lees raised the question of a reduction in payments for those who are aged under 21 years. The common allowance structure was put in place to remove any incentive for young persons, in this case those with disabilities, to attempt to reduce their employment potential which would allow them to get onto a pension very early. In so many cases, those people stay on the pension for a very long time. That long term dependency was, at least in part, the reason behind this legislation in the first place. So many of the groups who represent the disabled, and the disabled people themselves, mentioned the problem of the very young getting a pension very early. There being no training, no rehabilitation, available for them, they stay on those payments for very long periods. I do not really believe that any sensible government would have a choice but to do as we have done. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Patterson said that she did not claim that we should review all existing pensioners. She certainly did say that we should focus more on existing pensioners. I think that this point, at least in part, comes from the suggestion that there will not be any big cut in the rate of increase in grants of the new payment as against the old. I am not sure that the purpose of this part of the legislation was just to cut the rate of increase of the pension. If people can pass what the Parliament of Australia can agree upon as the relevant test, they ought to get this payment or any other. It is not a matter of any government being in a position to say that any rate of increase is in some way wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government certainly does acknowledge that the rate of increase over the past few years has been there because so many non-medical factors were being taken into account. That is why the 20 per cent impairment test was introduced. A medical test has to be passed, not a language skill test or so many of the other factors which had been taken into account in a threshold way in determining eligibility for the old invalid pension. The focus on these new entrants will be on links to rehabilitation and training. I would have thought that was a very important reform. I did not hear all of Senator Walters's contribution, but I do not think that she added anything new to the points that were made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's general view was that in some way these reforms are too soft, that they do not tighten up eligibility enough and that we need to do more to maximise the work potential of people. That is probably fair evidence that we have got the legislation about right. With ACOSS telling us that the provisions in the legislation are too hard and the Opposition telling us that they are not hard enough, the legislation is probably somewhere near right. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding this debate, I should say that I have been very pleased indeed with the attitude taken by so many groups representing the disabled who have supported the thrust of this legislation. They know this legislation will mean that training and rehabilitation will become available as a matter of routine to a whole class of people to whom it has been denied in the past and that much of the long term dependence on the old invalid pension system need not necessarily be the same for many entrants in the new system. Instead, there will be real hope that their work force potential will be realised. That can be of real benefit not only to them but to the whole of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be opposing these amendments. However, I just comment on some of the remarks that the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, made about consultation. Going back into the dark ages on consultation, when these reforms were first mooted in the August 1990 Budget it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Community consultations in all States will follow the Budget announcement of these reforms. A substantial publicity campaign is planned to promote these changes and inform and educate people in the community and employers well before the changes are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>There is overwhelming evidence that this is a Budget promise that the Government did not manage to keep. The Minister said that approximately 70 of these amendments were minor corrections, but I still think it is appalling that we have the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill coming in with that number of minor corrections. If we have some substantial amendments to the Bill, it is because of lack of consultation. Some of the amendments are responses to some groups. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about lack of consultation, I note that peak bodies such as the Australian National Association for Mental Health, the Australian Council of Alcohol and Other Drug Associations, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Australian College of Rehabilitative Medicine have not been consulted. I was talking to members of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of Australia only the other day about another matter when I asked them whether they had been consulted on this Bill, and they said no. That organisation caters for a huge number of people who are recipients of a disability pension and who have an illness which sometimes affects them-the very type of illness which has posed some assessment problems in the past. These people would have had constructive suggestions to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of my interest and background, having taught at the Lincoln Institute, where there are speech pathologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, et cetera, I gave these people the tables to look at, and they were horrified. The orthoptists looked at the vision section. These people, unlike many medical practitioners in rehabilitative medicine, have been trained in assessment of function. Basically, many of them assess people's function and ability to work, the very thing that we need to be doing to assess whether people should be eligible for a disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of experts in the allied health professions could have made a considerable contribution. I have been told by departmental officers that an ongoing assessment is to be made of these tables, and hopefully it will be. But when I asked at the hearing of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs which public and private medical welfare and other groups were consulted during the formulation of the impairment tables, I was told by the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>Consultations have been held with a number of experts in the rehabilitation field. The process was, however, essentially one of refinement rather than formulation and . . . was based on experience gained from utilisation of the current tables together with outcomes of reliability and validity tests. </PARA>
<PARA>Understandably, I considered that this answer was inadequate and asked the question again. This time I was told:</PARA>
<PARA>The tables evolved over a period of three and a half years. Modifications have been made over this time. In this evolutionary process, various experts have been consulted about aspects of impairment and disability assessment. These have included Dr Robert Oakshott, Professor Dennis Smith, Dr Bruce Kinlock, Director, Rehabilitation at the Rehabilitation Hospital in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the second answer indicates a narrow and inadequate level of consultation in regard to these important impairment tables. As I said, a number of allied health professionals have expressed to me their concern about the validity and reliability of these tables. These are people in the business of functional assessment. Some of them have claimed that the publication of the American Medical Association, Guide to the Evaluation of Medical Impairment, upon which these tables are based, has been widely discredited as a means for measuring functional capacity resulting from disability. That is the professional opinion of one group of people. It would have been good to have had those sorts of consultations and to have been able to evaluate whether this is the best impairment table. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that before a ball has even been bowled there have been 12 Government amendments to the impairment tables, which is an indication of the Government's lack of confidence in these ill-prepared tables. It can be gauged from the Minister's promises that anyone with an impairment level of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent can be reassessed while a social security advisory council working party will formally monitor the operation of the tables over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting the extent of the changes that have been made to this Bill since it passed through the House of Representatives, after which the Government belatedly realised that it would not be able to get away with not consulting with the various groups representing people with disabilities. These changes include the power to direct clients to seek medical treatment being removed and all penalties and deferment periods for failing to undertake rehabilitation or training being removed. Provision has been made for the sufferers of recurring, chronic illnesses to reapply for sickness allowance before the end of the disqualifying period. Incentive allowance will continue to be paid to current recipients who enter employment but then return to benefit. Special provisions were inserted to ensure that people who are undergoing drug and alcohol related treatment are not disadvantaged by the 12-month sickness allowance time limit. Transitional provisions were inserted so that the sickness allowees would not be disadvantaged when an extant application is being considered by the Department of Social Security. Formal recognition has been given in the legislation to the provision of rehabilitation and training to pensioner recipients as well as rehabilitation to sickness allowees. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that we can consider those to be minor changes. I am not saying that I do not agree with those changes, but it seems to me that the Government could have consulted much more widely. There has been a lack of consultation on both the legislation and the impairment tables. I hope that the testing out in the field does not mean that this Bill will be coming back for amendments that we would like to have made here and now. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, as the Department has promised, the consultation on the tables will continue so that we can iron out the problems and so that groups such as those at the Lincoln Institute, the Curtin University and Cumberland will be consulted. There is a wealth of experience in the people of those three institutions, whose primary role in teaching and research is in functional assessment. I hope that these tables will be given to them and that their critical and constructive comments can be taken into account. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Lees, Senator Patterson and I have all commented that the Minister did not consult. Surely officers in the Minister's Department have informed him of the evidence that was given in his absence-the Minister was not there all the time, which is justified-at the hearing of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs when each group told us that they had not heard from the Minister and that he did not consult. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no use the Minister coming into this chamber and telling Senator Lees, Senator Patterson and I that he consulted with everyone years and years ago. The people whom this Bill will affect indeed told us that the Minister had not consulted. In addition, we have all received letters from various groups saying that they had not heard from him. As I said in my speech, which he was not here to listen to, he may have consulted with ACOSS and some umbrella groups, but many of the groups which came before us were not members of ACOSS and the Minister had not consulted with them. </PARA>

The disability task force, for example, has been operating for a number of years. We acknowledge the Cass report which has been produced.

We removed it because it was a power that was never used. It had been there before; it was not being used. There was no suggestion that it would be used, except in the most extreme case. I saw no point in keeping it there just because it had been there before, so I was quite happy to remove it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to Senator Lees that the change to the sickness allowance comes within the category of the normal parliamentary consultation. When Bills are before this chamber, amendments are accepted from the Opposition, the Democrats and the Government. This happens because discussions are held, not just amongst the parliamentary parties but also with groups in the community. Unfortunately, some groups often equate consultation with agreement. Far too many groups seem to think that they have been consulted only if the Government has concurred with their view. That is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> A handful of groups came before the Standing Committee on Community Affairs as against the hundreds upon hundreds that had been consulted during this the whole process. All of them were consulted about the policy thrust which is behind the Bill. That is what is normally done. The idea that there would be training, rehabilitation and an active stream in this form of payment was totally new. That had not been the case before. We do not get into a change of that kind without consultation, and the consultation went on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon drafting this Bill, anyone who wanted to be consulted and be involved was consulted. I notice that Senator Patterson referred to a schizophrenia association. A number of psychiatric groups were consulted over time on schizophrenia. Of course, episodic illness is one of the difficulties that will always be handled. It will very often be the case that people suffering from schizophrenia will finish up on a sickness allowance rather than a disability payment. That will be for the very reason that medication can improve some sufferers for a time but then there can be relapses. Naturally enough, we have attempted to take that into account. One of the groups which claimed it had not been consulted was a very new group indeed. It is always a matter of determining which group is truly representative and which group is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, I would be happy to refer the impairment tables to three institutions named by Senator Patterson. I do not recall them now but I am quite happy to have the impairment tables referred to them over the course of the next 12 months for their views and comments. It is in everyone's interest to make sure that the impairment tables are as accurate as they possibly can be. I have no difficulty whatsoever in extending a role in that process to the institutions that she has referred to. I am quite happy to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there will be no publicity campaign until the legislation has been passed. But we will have a duty to ensure that this legislation gets very considerable publicity over the course of the next 12 months. I think I can guarantee that that will occur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A moment ago the Minister said that the Government was removing a clause which indicated that people may be required by the Department of Social Security to undertake medical treatment. That is the whole essence of the debate we are having here at the moment. Many of the people who are affected by this Bill have an impairment of some description; some of them have a mental impairment. They latched hold of the Bill that was circulated in the House of Representatives but they do not understand that it can be amended by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of my staff members went to a meeting in Melbourne at which disabled and intellectually impaired people expressed very grave concerns about that clause. It is all very well for us to stand here in the chamber and talk about the removal of this clause but those people must now be adequately informed about what has happened. A certain anxiety has already been engendered in the community and this will make it more difficult to implement this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government on a number of the thrusts of the Bill. But, because of the lack of consultation and because this Bill was not thought through fully, people with disabilities have been upset.

If there is a job somewhere in Australia that the Department deems them capable of performing, off they will go, and amendment No.6 attempts to rectify that position. </PARA>

<PARA> The effect of the Democrats' amendments is to go back to where we were before this reform-that is, to have the non-medical factors being regarded as important as the medical factors in determining eligibility for a payment. I do not think that is acceptable. If there were an unfortunate feature of the old invalid pension system, it was that where people did not fit neatly into a category the Department was inclined to put them into an invalid pension. Many people who had some medical difficulty but who, in the main, had language difficulties or other problems were put in that category. To get away from that system, we have been going along the direction of this reform for several years, with all the consultation I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally do not believe that there is any alternative, if the system is to have real integrity, as a first step, to the passing of an impairment test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be supporting this group of amendments put forward by the Australian Democrats. I do not always agree with Senator Richardson, but on this occasion I do. One of the Democrats' amendments will make assessment much more subjective. Although I am not jumping over the moon about the current tables, if we add a factor that was there before, it has meant that many people have gone onto invalid pension when they have not fitted into any other category. The Opposition and the Democrats should be demanding in respect of the people who fell into those categories that we look at the DEET programs in terms of language and other rehabilitative programs. We should be seeking to assist those people rather than putting them into the invalid pension category as a neat way of dealing with the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should seek to spread the social security cake across those who really deserve it. We must ensure that we do not leave loopholes to enable people to cheat the system. Could the Democrats guarantee, when one takes into account the availability of work and training in a local area, that people will not migrate to areas where there are no jobs or training simply so that they may receive support pension? I am not saying that everyone will do this, but it leaves it open for people to do so. They could say, `I have moved to Wollongong where work is difficult; therefore, I should get a higher score, and possibly have a lower disability, because I am unable to obtain work in that area'. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of whether people deliberately injure themselves or blind themselves to obtain the disability support pension, we cannot accept the amendments. The Bill is specific in that the person must injure himself with the intent of obtaining benefit. I presume that the clause does not apply to somebody who injures himself due to the effects of mental illness-in other words, he or she would not be disqualified from disability support pension. I presume that if a mental illness is involved and the person concerned makes himself disabled in some way, such a case would not be covered by these provisions. I think the clause makes clear that that is not the case. Therefore, we are unable to support that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>1. Government Amendment No. 17, omit ``at award wages or above''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government amendment provides that, for a person to be eligible for the disability support pension, he or she must not be able to work 30 hours a week at award wages or above. Originally, the legislation referred to award wages or those wages that the secretary had deemed reasonable. This caused a furore, as the Victorian Trades and Labour Council believed that the legislation would allow the payment of below award wages to people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was then changed on 15 August to include the reference to award wages. On 23 August these amendments were amended again to take out the reference to award wages. The reference to award wages has now been reinserted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not be supporting the Government's amendment on the grounds that the term `award wages' is not an appropriate term which represents the reward that is provided to workers as payment for their labour. A large number of workers are not paid award wages; these include the self-employed, people who operate franchises and people who work as subcontractors. The term `award wages' is an industrial relations term only. It refers to the wages that are paid to a person as set out in an award which has been ratified by an industrial relations tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, the majority of workers are now covered by awards-the majority, but not all. I include in the group `not all' those people who are self-employed. Whether people will continue to have their wages and conditions set out in an award is an industrial relations matter. With the onset of enterprise bargaining-supported now, I might say, by both sides of politics-it is possible that in the future the wages of far fewer workers will be set down in awards than is the case today. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this amendment and the original clause in this Bill was to refer to what is normally considered to be 30 hours worth of work in the mainstream work force. The Opposition believes that the original clause reflected the fact that some people are not covered by awards provided for them. Those people have now been excluded from this clause due to the hankerings of the trade union movement. The Opposition does not support the concept of people being paid below award wages but, rather, being paid reasonably for their labour. I believe that the way in which the Government has set out the clause at the moment really does not express the real intent of what is meant. </PARA>

<PARA>Further work is planned to consolidate the program and to ensure that effective support structures are put into place when needed. </PARA>

<PARA> Considering that the Department of Social Security informed Senator Knowles during the hearings of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs that it was not able to estimate the proportion of current invalid pensioners who would be likely to volunteer for assistance, could the Minister inform me what headway has been made with these two Budget promises? Further, does the Minister agree with me that these two Budget promises constitute a very important part of the groundwork that is required in making an assessment of the work force capacity of current invalid pensioners-an aspect that has been largely ignored in this legislation? Finally, will the Minister confirm or deny whether panel assessment training rehabilitation will be available to volunteers from the current invalid pensioner population from the 12 November start-up date, or will the application of these reforms to the current invalid pensioner population be postponed for 12 months?</PARA>

As part of the consultations I have promised generally on penalties, we would need to have that kind of information available in an ongoing way so that we can keep interested groups informed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to go back to the questions I asked before Senator Lees spoke about one of the other amendments. First of all, I have not seen the survey so I do not know what was in it, but I presume it did not involve an assessment of a random survey of people currently on disability pensions to see whether they would take up the offer of training or rehabilitation voluntarily. I mentioned in my speech that it seemed to me to be reasonably simple to do a random survey just to test the waters to see how many people would take it up. The Minister has now admitted that the Department has not undertaken what was indicated in the 1990 Budget Papers about the development of a computer based system for the use of matching labour force assessment and people's abilities for the requirements of different occupations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As there are a limited number of places available, how does the Minister know that he will not get a flood of people who are currently on disability pensions wanting rehabilitation and training? What burden will be placed on the limited resources if there is a demand from both current disability pensioners and those going on to the new benefit which exceeds the places that are there?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As with Newstart and JSA, it is not the case that every person who wants assistance can necessarily be helped. In the provision of training places and rehabilitation, we have to try to increase their numbers at a pace which can be absorbed. In consultations with colleagues, I am not sure that we can go much faster in the provision of these places. I have undertaken to check the survey results and provide them to Senator Patterson. Should there be any great disparity in the number that we are providing and the number who may be interested as a result of that survey, I will certainly undertake to look at it again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> 9. Clause 13, page 20, at end of proposed section 116, add the following subsections:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(6) Where the medical practitioner includes in the certificate an opinion under subsection (4) that the person's impairment under the Impairment Tables is less than 20%, the person may request a further examination and assessment by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. </PARA>
<PARA> `` `(7) If, upon further examination and assessment, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service includes in the certificate an opinion under subsection (4) that the person's impairment under the Impairment Tables is less than 20%, but that the person has a continuing inability to work under subsection 94, the person shall be eligible to receive a Disability Support Pension.''</PARA>

<PARA>11. Clause 13, page 21, proposed paragraph 117(d), lines 3 to 5, omit the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment 9 entitles a claimant to a further assessment by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service where they are originally assessed as having an impairment of less than 20 per cent. As with previous amendments, this amendment seeks to clarify the difference between `impairment' and `incapacity' for the purpose of eligibility for the pension. I stress, as I did in my speech in the second reading debate, that inability on the part of the Government to understand the difference is at the heart of the problems that the Australian Democrats have with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments 10 and 11 relate to payments for young people with disabilities. I acknowledge the Minister's continuing reference to equating all young people's support at a very low level. We believe, in this case in particular, that it is not appropriate. We have consistently rejected the Government's program of bringing all of these benefits down into line. All income support measures for young people are now reduced to the point where they are below the poverty line. We reject this further step to similarly cut the levels of income for young people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with what the Minister said earlier-that somehow we will be encouraging young people to take up a pension. Considering the very tight requirements that will now be in place relating to the impairment tables, and only the impairment tables, I think it is really a nonsense to suggest that somehow we need this move by the Government to ensure that young people do not get on to the pension and stay there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced a number of measures that will now give young people the opportunity to undertake rehabilitation and training if they are on the pension. I do not agree at all with the Government's reasonings for reducing the payments to young people. The payments have been reduced to the point where many parents have said that they will find it extremely difficult to make ends meet, considering the additional costs they are forced to meet for a young person with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA> The groups which provide accommodation for young people rely on part pension for being paid. Is the Government looking at any additional support for these organisations which provide young people with accommodation? These organisations will now find that a person over 21 will be able to pay the full rate. But, as the pensions of young people have been cut-who, I must stress, cost the same to feed, clothe and look after-they will now not be able to keep contributing. Those people coming onto the pension will now be paying less for their accommodation. Has the Government looked at the possibility of supporting these organisations by making up the difference?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to amendment No. 9 of the Australian Democrats, the Government has already agreed to have a second CMO assess any case that is rated between 10 and 20 per cent. That part of the amendment is not a problem for the Government. Basically, the Democrats are asking for the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Government cannot accept proposed subsection (7). We have already made a number of changes to impairment tables. I do not think we are prepared to go further than that. Senator Lees knows about the 19 per cent being rounded up. We did include a gynaecological table. There is clearer treatment of the use of `pain'. If a person is rated as between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, they can get that reassessment, as well as retaining full appeal rights. A body has been established to monitor these tables, as we have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> On Senator Lees's comments about the common youth allowance structure, the important point to note is that nobody gets cut. We are talking about new entrants. No-one on a payment gets cut; therefore, no-one's circumstances are altered by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of ways in which the disability support payment for 16-year-olds to 20-year-olds will differ from the common youth allowance. They are subject to the more generous pension, income and assets tests; 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds will not be subject to parental income and assets testing; and 16 year-olds and 17 year-olds who are unable to live with their parents due to their medical condition will receive a higher independent rate applicable to their age. There are a number of differences, all of which are on the right side for those who are in this position. There are more generous provisions available to young recipients in institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As to those who provide accommodation, I will have to check with my colleague Mr Howe on what arrangements are being made. They are also subject to some discussions with the States. I am not certain where that is up to, but I am happy to find out. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, as announced by the Treasurer in the 1991-92 Budget, this Bill will amend the wholesale sales tax law to change the current exemptions for certain goods and motor vehicles for use by people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has already made decisions on the Industry Commission Report on Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities. The Bill implements the majority of the Industry Commission proposals relating to sales tax. It also provides additional exemptions and concessions beyond those recommended by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures demonstrate the Government's concern that the taxation treatment of goods for use by people with disabilities should be both equitable and responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>Goods used in modifications of motor vehicles</PARA>
<PARA>Under the current sales tax law, exemption is only available for goods used to modify a motor vehicle to adapt it for driving by a person suffering from a physical disability. The Bill will significantly widen this exemption to include goods used to modify new or second-hand motor vehicles to transport a person suffering from a physical disability. </PARA>
<PARA>This exemption will assist those who are required to modify their vehicles solely for the purpose of transporting a family member, relative or friend who is suffering from a physical disability. </PARA>
<PARA>This important new exemption was not included in the Industry Commission proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemption for certain new motor vehicles</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will place a limit on the sales tax exemptions available for new motor vehicles for use by certain defence force veterans and other people with specific disabilities. The current exemptions are completely open-ended, and those most able to afford expensive new motor vehicles are able to derive greater benefits than those with less income. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will ensure greater equity in this area by providing that a maximum sales tax benefit (or ``cap'') will apply to all new vehicles purchased under these exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales tax exemption will be limited to motor vehicles with a wholesale sale value equal to or less than the current ``luxury'' motor vehicle sale value threshold of $30,505. This corresponds to a retail list price of $45,462, and is the amount above which sales tax on motor vehicles is now payable at 30%. </PARA>
<PARA>Where the sale value of the vehicle exceeds the threshold, the vehicle will be taxable. However, tax will be payable on a reduced sale value. This will produce a benefit equal to the amount of sales tax that would have been payable if the vehicle had been priced on the threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>This is more generous than the Industry Commission proposal, under which vehicles above the threshold would have been fully taxable. </PARA>
<PARA>Commencement</PARA>
<PARA>The changes made by the Bill will apply to all taxable dealings that occur after 3.00 pm standard time, 20 August, 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The net cost of the proposed changes will be $3m for 1991-92 and $3.5m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight in the adjournment debate on a matter concerning a Mr and Mrs Hardwick, who live in the Bendigo area of Victoria. North West Country Credit propose to put the Sheriff in possession of their property tomorrow. The history is a long one. The property comprises 138 acres, of which 38 acres are used for accommodation for approximately 72 people. It is being used as an environmental education centre. Part of the property can be subdivided into a small farm of 100 acres and the 38 acres would be zoned for business. The couple intends to put it into a trust so that it may remain a study centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The couple got into difficulties some years ago when a loan, which currently stands at $164,000, was taken out at an interest rate of 15 per cent. The rate they are being charged now is 22 per cent, making it almost a certainty that financial difficulties will arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of my putting this case on the record is not to ask that that be forgiven or that substantial changes be made, but simply to ask that a proposal which was put to North West Country Credit this afternoon by the firm of Fisher Dowell and Co Pty Ltd be given due consideration by the board. From a superficial assessment, admittedly, of the figures, the proposal deserves consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal basically is that North West and the Hardwicks sell the farm land in lot B, some 100 acres, by private sale as soon as practicable to reduce the debt; that North West allow the Hardwicks to remain in occupation of the study centre-that is lot A-until 30 January 1992 based on the first mortgage already in place; and that the Hardwicks continue with efforts to re-finance or sell to the trust the study centre and so pay back North West. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hardwicks have forward bookings which will generate a net income of over $12,000 by 30 November 1991 and a very real likelihood of achieving better results if allowed to trade without interruption. In fact, North West might be asked if it is prepared to reduce the interest rate to a more realistic current market rate than the Hardwicks are currently being forced to pay. That would further improve the possibility of the rescue being successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought I should put this proposal on record because I have been told-only just 15 minutes ago-by the Manager of North West Country Credit that they are not disposed to defer the Sheriff going into possession of the property; that, in its opinion, the Hardwicks need to be put out of the property. The Hardwicks have worked hard to develop the property over a period of 18 years and I believe that the proposal that has been put forward deserves a chance to be looked at carefully and sympathetically. I think we are at a period in the history of our nation, particularly in Victoria, where many people are fighting for survival. Rather than push them down and deprive them of their life earnings and savings, we should do everything possible to assist them to survive. The figures I have been supplied with and which I have seen this afternoon-I cannot vouch for them of course-indicate a positive net asset value exceeding $90,000. In that position, one does not put people out of an enterprise that is still functioning, however poorly. I believe that the board of North West Country Credit should look very carefully at the proposal being put to it and should give it sympathetic consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A matter which I hope to speak about at greater length later, but which is important enough to raise tonight, is a decision of the Federal Court-and a very strong Federal Court it was last week-which said that it was proper that the legal advisers of a litigant be allowed to look at Cabinet notebooks. I think there is a lot to be concerned about in that judgment, and it is a matter that we as a Parliament will have to address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not suggesting for one minute that the judiciary is doing this, but if the judiciary were to take over what is, in fact, the proper role of the legislature-which is, as it were, to oversee the Executive-that would be an unhappy situation. The Executive is responsible to the legislature, not to the judiciary. It must be said that perhaps we as legislators-as parliamentarians-have not brought the Executive to account as efficiently as we should. But that, it seems to me, is a matter where the Parliament-the legislature-has to raise its game rather than the courts coming in and substituting for it. </PARA>
<PARA> A proper balance of power-a proper separation of the three functions of government-involves a situation where the three of them reserve themselves to the limits that are properly set so that good government overall can take place. I have not read the judgment, and I am not suggesting that in this case it has, but if it were to lead to a situation where not only did the judiciary go into the Cabinet room more often to see what went on there but also it allowed the Cabinet discussions to be made patent to legal advisers, then a very difficult situation for the proper balance of power would have been reached. </PARA>

<PARA>  Note B: Includes a pool of 4.75 ASL for re-allocation by Central Office.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) OLMA was not established in 1988 for the sole purpose of investigating disparities in regional unemployment levels. It was established for the purpose of:</PARA>
<PARA>    assessing the impact of structural change on labour markets at the national and regional level; and</PARA>
<PARA>    developing strategies and programs/labour adjustment packages on an industry, regional and enterprise basis to assist those facing retrenchment or being retrenched as a result of structural change.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) OLMA has developed a number of regional packages to assist regions where the local labour market has been adversely effected by structural reform. Existing OLMA packages operating in 1991-92 cover:</PARA>
<PARA>  Northern Rivers and Cobar (NSW);</PARA>
<PARA>  Ballarat and Geelong (Vic);</PARA>
<PARA>  Sunshine Coast, Logan City, Wide Bay/Burnett and Goodna/Inala (QLD);</PARA>
<PARA>  Eyre Peninsula (SA);</PARA>
<PARA>  Kalgoorlie (WA);</PARA>
<PARA>  Tasmania (State-wide package); and</PARA>
<PARA>  Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>  Specific packages are developed to address the situation for each region. There is flexibility under the packages for funding information or coordinating projects to improve the operation of the local labour market as well as giving individual assistance. Funding is provided to develop the infrastructure and capacity of regional communities to manage and monitor structural change and to develop strategies for improving the economic and skill base of the community. Retrenchment assistance includes formal and preparatory training, wage subsidies to employers and re-location allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) There has been no change to OLMA's charter. OLMA has continued to develop and administer labour adjustment packages for the Textile Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industry and the Passenger Motor Vehicle (PMV) industry since OLMA was established in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the context of the March 12 Economic Statement, the Government increased OLMA program funding in total by more than fourfold and upgraded the operations of OLMA in 1991-92 from a Directorate to a Branch. This recognises the increasing impact of structural change and micro economic reforms on industries, enterprises, and specific communities/regions.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) There has been no change to OLMA's charter.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) OLMA is continuing to develop packages for regions adversely affected by the process of structural adjustment. Most of the regions assisted under the regional packages have experienced significantly higher relative levels of unemployment than other regions.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) Expenditure in 1990-91 on direct assistance to workers through the payment of the Formal Training Allowance was $2.504m. Total program expenditure on the industry and regional packages which provided funding for retraining, re-employment assistance and re-location assistance for retrenched workers was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>    Industry Packages (mainly TCF and PMV)--$4.761m; and</PARA>
<PARA>    Regional Packages--$1.350m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Funding is made available both through the Annual Appropriation Acts and various Special Appropriations. In most cases, part of the Commonwealth's funding for statutory authorities represents the transfer to the relevant body of the receipts from levies on various primary products collected by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>  The bodies for my portfolio and the total Commonwealth funding are listed below. The amounts shown are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. Please note that with many non-statutory bodies, there is no direct funding made through or by my Department. However, the Department may provide full or part-time secretariat services for bodies such as Ministerial Councils. In such cases, the salary cost is not shown. The cost of any goods and services supplied by the Department to these bodies is included.</PARA>
<PARA>  Please also note that there are two minor errors in the listing of Commonwealth Bodies. The Director Australian Safeguards Office is a Statutory Office holder and should therefore be included in the section `Statutory Offices'. The Murray-Darling</PARA>
