<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is concerned that the regulations under the Freedom of Information Act appear to provide a period of five years during which the public is automatically denied access to important material, without any procedure to require a Minister to make even an adverse decision. The regulations under the Trade Practices Act cause less concern. However, they will have an impact on Australian business and in all such cases it is usual for the Committee to seek extensive assurances about the effect of such impact. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a short statement of the aspects of these regulations raised by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRADE PRACTICES (CONSUMER PRODUCT INFORMATION STANDARDS)(COSMETICS) REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1991 NO.327</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations provide for the labelling of cosmetic products to indicate the ingredients used in those products. The Explanatory Statement advises that a number of people may be sensitive to certain of these ingredients. The Regulations are intended to satisfy consumer requests for information about ingredients, enable value comparisons between products and enable consumers to avoid ingredients to which they may be allergic. The Regulations are closely aligned with United States requirements in this area. It is believed that the European Community will also move to align itself with United States standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee does not raise questions about the policy merits of these or any other instruments of delegated legislation. Rather it confines its examination to ensuring that such instruments comply with its high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context the Committee noted that the present Regulations provide important safeguards for those affected by them. Thus, there is a full right of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of adverse decisions by the Minister in respect of the administration of the scheme. Also, the Regulations do not come into effect until 31 October 1993, which is more than two years after the Regulations were made. On the face of it this is a reasonable lead time period for those people whose businesses may be affected by the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Committee always looks carefully at any instrument which affects Australian business or modifies the way in which people may earn their livelihood. The Committee has received a representation that the present Regulations may be uncertain and confusing in effect, due to the number of different ways in which ingredients can be described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has passed the representation on to the Minister for consideration. We have also asked the Committee's legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, to prepare a special report on the Regulations. In the meantime, the purpose of this notice is simply to ensure that the matter is kept on the agenda of the Committee. It does not necessarily indicate that we have substantial difficulties with the Regulations at this time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freedom of Information Act 1982</EMPHASIS> (the FOI Act) provides that certificates may be issued which conclusively determine that material in documents is exempt from public disclosure under the Act. These certificates may cover material relating to national security, defence or international relations; relations with the States; cabinet; the executive council; or internal working documents. Section 36A of the FOI Act, which was inserted by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freedom of Information Amendment Act 1991</EMPHASIS>, provides that the Regulations may provide maximum periods during which such certificates may remain in force and may provide for the manner in which they are revoked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Regulations provide that these conclusive exemption certificates, which exclude public disclosure, remain in force for five years. However, they may be revoked earlier by the Minister or the Secretary to the Department or agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This period of five years appears lengthy. There is no explanation in the Explanatory Statement why five years was chosen as the appropriate period. The Committee is concerned that this period should be reasonable, and half a decade may be excessive, particularly for internal working documents. Now, under the new s.36A of the FOI Act, if a certificate is given in respect of s.36 (and, of course, the other relevant sections) material then apparently the public is automatically denied access to the material for five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee appreciates that the Minister or Secretary may revoke a certificate. However, it is not clear whether there is any process for the public to request a revocation and whether there is appropriate AAT review if such a request is refused. The Committee would be concerned if it was not intended to establish such a process. As drafted, it appears that the public may be shut out of the process for five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee will write to the Minister seeking further details. In particular, it will seek advice on whether public participation has been diluted by the Regulations and whether it is intended to provide for the public to initiate any revocation procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I had moved amendment No. 18 and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) had just got to his feet to comment on it. I would like to comment briefly. We are picking up halfway through an amendment and it is understandable that there is a little confusion. We address two items relating to offences in our proposed amendment No. 18. The amendment reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a person furnishes a statement. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister suggested that `statement' should be changed to `return'. We would accept that amendment. Our amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a person . . . is required to furnish under Division 5A that contains particulars that are, to the knowledge of the person, false or misleading. . . punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $5,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister stated that under the Government's amendment the penalty is $10,000. We would be happy to accept that amendment. That is the first part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part, about which we are very concerned, relates to discrimination against a donor to a political party when that donation is made known because of disclosure. The other side of the coin is where a person or a body is coerced into making a donation to a political party. We believe that this matter relating to disclosure is a very real problem. It is the area that Dr Hewson drew attention to when the coalition parties took the view that they would accept disclosure. One of the major conditions was that people in society were protected against discrimination. It is a very real concern in the hearts and minds of many people. To give some teeth to protection against discrimination and coercion, we recommended in our amendment that, if the offender is a natural person, the fine would be $5,000 or imprisonment for two years or both, and, if the offender is a body corporate, the fine would be $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the level of the fine in both cases was to act as a deterrent to people going into the grubby business of intimidation. The reason for the two years imprisonment was to make sure, within the terms of our Federal Constitution, that if a person was convicted of this sort of thing he would be precluded from ever standing for Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why ever not?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two reasons. First of all, there is a problem with the drafting of the Opposition amendment. I am sure, once again, it would not have been deliberate, but I do point this out as one of the two reasons why the Government is not supporting this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition amendment applies only to discrimination where a person has made a donation to a registered political party. The Government proposal will make illegal discrimination where a person involved is one who makes a donation to any political party, whether registered or not. As I say, it may not have been intentional on the part of the Opposition, but at least our parameters are broader in that respect and more people would be protected in these circumstances where some people have concern that there might be political intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is that we feel the penalty provisions that we are proposing are appropriate and adequate; they are in conformity with the principles that apply to penalties that have been applied consistently across the spectrum of Commonwealth offences. The penalties under the Bill are $1,000 or six months imprisonment. I think six months imprisonment is a fair enough whack in itself, and any person who may be involved in this sort of activity would be quite deserving of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other penalty which is important to take into account here is that offenders who offend under the Opposition's proposals would, ipso facto, under section 44(i) of the Constitution, be ineligible, for ever, to run for Parliament. Given the fact that there is a $1,000 penalty or six months imprisonment under our proposal, the further penalty for life against standing for parliament may be a big one&mdash;though I must admit, having gone through the last two days, it may be something people would appreciate, in one sense. We think the penalties in our proposal are adequate but, more importantly, our proposal covers a wider spectrum of possible offences as opposed to the Opposition's. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that, we are happy to make the net as broad as possible to catch anyone who would engage in what I believe is something that is totally unacceptable; certainly it is totally unacceptable to the Opposition and I am sure it is totally unacceptable to the Democrats. In the interests of doing that, we would be prepared to remove the word `registered' from the term `political party' so that it applies to all political parties throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that the Minister considers that the penalties we are proposing are too great. Evidence was given to the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures on the issue of this sort of intimidation. I remind the Senate of the evidence that Mr Sherry gave to the Committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On two separate occasions, purely as a result . . . of the threat my research, which was turning into a book . . . I was warned by Bob Hendricks, the State Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union of Queensland. He did not touch me but he threatened me with physical harm. On both of those occasions I took notes of it. On one of those occasions I taped one of the phone calls.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a record that I made of it. At 4.20 p.m. on 7 August 1990, Bob Hendricks, the State Secretary of the Queensland Branch of the ETU, said that my book did not have the support of the ETU:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`If you're trying to fix the Union, then why should I help you? If I find out you're trying to fix the Union, then don't worry, I'll fix you good and proper, good and proper.</PARA>
<PARA>Two days later Bob Hendricks elaborated on the threat&mdash;and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I had evidence of that, that's what I'd do. When I say fix you, yes, I didn't say fix you, I said fit you. F-I-T. And that means fit you. And I mean by fit, I mean, quite bluntly, well, you can work it out for yourself. I used the word fit. And I guess that I'd become, I may become violent.

Mr Sherry said&mdash;and I just hope members of the public in the gallery can understand what the Labor Party is doing&mdash;that the union was threatening him, he feared for his life, so he taped the telephone conversation. Yet Labor senators said to Mr Sherry, `You shouldn't have; it's illegal to do so'&mdash;not horror, horror, about the threat; just, `It's illegal to do so'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) is saying that our penalty in this clause for intimidation is too great because it seeks to debar someone for life from entering politics. Quite frankly, that sort of intimidation is extreme. And do not let us forget that, after I read out that quote the other day, Senator Cook interjected, `What's wrong with that?'; so he did not think there was much wrong with that telephone conversation. We, on this side of the chamber, think there is a lot wrong with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus today has underlined his belief that there is nothing very wrong with it. He believes that our penalties are too great; that someone should not be debarred for life from entering this Parliament. I do not agree with the Minister in any way at all. I believe that that is the very least we should do in respect of someone who indulges in that sort of intimidation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to enter the debate on this clause. However, in view of the fact that Senator Walters, in referring to the evidence given to the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Disclosures quoted the remarks of Mr Sherry and, in doing so, named the people he made allegations against, I think it only appropriate that I should put on the record the fact that the Select Committee wrote to all the members so named in Mr Sherry's evidence, bringing to their attention the allegations made in that evidence so that they would have the opportunity to respond accordingly. Already some have responded with affidavits, which have been tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that, as this evidence by Mr Sherry was given towards the end of the Select Committee's period of existence, those citizens who were named, if they so chose, can put forward material to refute Mr Sherry's allegations through the Standing Committee of Privileges of this Parliament, so it can be put on the record. It should be noted that Senator Walters accepts absolutely the allegations made by Mr Sherry. It is her right to do so. However, they are allegations and, so far, the people who have responded completely deny them and have done so in the form of sworn affidavits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There should be no-one in this Parliament who does not agree that there has been, is, or is the potential for, intimidation. The Opposition's amendment seeks to protect people. I am not going to get into a debate with Senator Schacht about this. I simply wish to say that our amendment seeks to protect individuals. Anyone who believes in human rights and the ability of people freely to go about Australia and make contributions to whomever they like would agree that they should be entitled to do so. If they breach that, they should be subject to the harshest penalties, and that is what this amendment is about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We should limit ourselves to a discussion of the principle. There is a question mark over the Committee's view as to whether it had sufficient evidence of intimidation, leaving aside Mr Sherry. The principle is a very serious matter. The Opposition's amendments aim to provide a strong deterrent. It has brought the penalty into line by changing it to $10,000. I guess there is an argument that $1,000, not six months gaol, may not be a sufficient deterrent. It is very hard to argue that somebody who would engage in such behaviour would be a suitable candidate for Parliament. On the principle of this amendment, I indicate the Democrats' support.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have known Bob Hendricks for more than 20 years. He has struggled very hard on behalf of trade unionists and those who have been oppressed in this nation.

That is the picture of a man who was scurrilously attacked by Senator Walters.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not hinder or interfere with the free exercise or performance, by any other person, of any political right or duty that is relevant to an election under this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the principal Act. Our intention in our clause 21&mdash;which, to save time, was to be amended&mdash;was to amend section 327 to add another subsection which would say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person must not hinder or interfere with the free exercise by another person of the other person's right to make a gift to a political party, a candidate or a group of candidates.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, the intention was to add to the existing section 327 a provision that would make illegal any interference with donating to a political party. I am suggesting that we leave section 327 as it is, but that we add after the existing section 327 in the Act a proposed new section 327A, which would encompass the Liberal Party's proposed subclause 11, which is being discussed at the moment. It is not my desired position but, given the fact that the numbers are for it, I would suggest that the Liberal Party's provision against discrimination go in as a proposed new section 327A. </PARA>

There already exists at law the common law of tort and anyone who suffers damages by such actions would have that access available to him or her. The other problem that I have been advised about with proposed subclause 12 is that there are definitional problems with it. In fact, by its vagueness, it may limit other existing rights. Essentially, there are rights available under the common law of tort. Given the fact that now we will be incorporating provisions that will mean a $5,000 fine, imprisonment of two years and life disqualification from parliament, I suspect the only thing we have not incorporated in this legislation is a public execution. </PARA>

Claims and counterclaims have been made across this chamber in respect of that. We have had them in regard to organisations such as the ACF and the Greens. We have also had them in regard to road organisations. And so the list goes on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a brief comment on the matters raised by Senator Kernot. One of the tests in this Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is how far we are prepared to go on disclosure. We are saying that if organisations are in receipt of government funds&mdash;many of these bodies receive substantial government funds&mdash;and they wish to take part in an election, and that is fair enough, they have to disclose where their funding comes from. One of the very dramatic changes which has occurred in the last decade, particularly under this Labor Government, is the vast use of taxpayers' funds to be given to special interest groups. There has been an explosion of instances where taxpayers' funds have been given to various bodies, some of which have been mentioned, such as trade unions and so forth. That is fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not saying that governments at the end of the day have to make those choices. We are saying that if organisations are in receipt of substantial government funds and they wish to take part in an election campaign&mdash;we are not quarrelling with that&mdash;they have to disclose in small type on press statements, and when they go out and make statements, that they are in receipt of government funding. This is an even-handed proposal. It affects the groups which support us, the groups which support the Australian Labor Party, and the groups which support the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view there is, quite rightly, increasing community concern about the use of government funding. This is a central matter of disclosure. We are now seeing how far the Government and the Australian Democrats are prepared to proceed down this disclosure road. I think Senator Kernot has at least recognised that there is a problem in this area. She does not appear to recognise that government funds given to particular organisations free up the funds of the organisations for other activities. I urge Senator Kernot to reconsider her position and the position of the Australian Democrats on this very important disclosure issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to try to convince Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats of the importance of this matter. I say to Senator Schacht that I feel provoked enough to rise on this matter. Through the very Estimates committee process that Senator Schacht referred to a few minutes ago, I uncovered&mdash;both last year and this year&mdash;the abuse of community sports grants. We uncovered in the various States that somewhere between 80 and 90 per cent of those sporting grants go into marginal Labor seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia last year something like 84 per cent of voluntary sporting grants and community facility grants went into marginal Labor seats. I think there is a similar figure in New South Wales. In Western Australia the year before, something like 90 per cent of those grants went into marginal Labor seats such as Canning and Stirling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I think it is important for Senator Kernot and other Democrat senators to know how this Government operates and how these funds are used. I have also uncovered a specific case where some community facility grants and sporting grants were given to some organisations which have made submissions to the electoral commissioners in the redistribution process. What I am saying is that some groups which have received between $10,000 and $50,000 have put in submissions to electoral commissioners supporting the submission of Labor Party members in the redistribution process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not need to reflect on those organisations. But my strongly held view is that where a government grants money to those sorts of organisations, or any other organisation, and they make a political statement in support of or in opposition to that government, it is quite proper for the voters to know that those groups have received that funding. If one political party says, `We're going to stop funding some of these organisations' and the other party says, `We're going to keep funding them', and those organisations go out and spend money convincing the Australian people to vote for the party that promises to maintain their funding, it is appropriate that people know that the organisations are receiving funds from the government and that they have a vested interest in the re-election of that government. That is the crucial part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats should understand that this sort of political corruption is going on. I know that the Democrats are opposed to this sort of activity. It comes down to the fact that we have a government giving money to organisations which then support submissions by Labor Party members to electoral commissioners to change boundaries. That is the very sort of corruption that the Democrats are opposed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell has made an appeal to the Democrats on something that is not even covered by the Oppositions's own amendment. He is complaining about a sporting body supposedly supporting a Labor Party redistribution. Opposition amendment 320A(1) says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Well, sending off a letter in support of a redistribution is not covered by any of those descriptions. So what Senator Campbell is raising is outside even his own amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties of this amendment are not appreciated by the Opposition. For example, in the last election the National Association of Forest Industries spent well over $1m on putting its viewpoint in quite a political way. The Association used authorised political advertisements to put forward its viewpoint on what it thinks should happen in the forestry industry. I have not been through all the companies associated with the National Association of Forest Industries but I will bet two bob to London Bridge that somewhere in there a local government body or a State government has given a tax concession, or a land tax concession, to a timber mill; that the Association or a member of the Association has, directly or indirectly, received some sort of financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell is suggesting that at the end of its television advertisement the Association should run up a list saying, `We got this tax concession on land tax from the Nunjikompita Council and so on'. That is the sort of outcome that we will see from the Opposition's amendment. It is just absurd. If the Opposition wants transparency, it should adopt the processes of the Parliament, which are well known&mdash;for instance, the Estimates committees&mdash;FOI Act requests and so on. I am sure that Senator Campbell, with his diligent ability, will continue to chase all these rabbits down every warren and burrow around the place to find out whether these organisations are getting this sort of money. That is his right; it is part of the democratic process. But to say that the National Association of Forest Industries now has to put a tag on its television advertisement indicating that its membership has got all these bits and pieces of financial assistance from either Commonwealth, State or local government is an absurdity. </PARA>

It is a trial. If it is to apply at the following election the legislation will have to come back to be amended. If Senator Parer is in government, heaven forbid, I am sure he will not put it through.

If there is any provision of public funding in any form &mdash;either in this Parliament or other Parliaments&mdash;he says every time that he will not have a bar of it. If it is carried, he is up the front line with everybody else getting his hands in the till to get his share of it. If he was so principled about it he would say, `We won't have any of it. You can stick it'. But no, he is straight up the front.

The Democrats have to understand quite clearly that if their proposal for tax deductibility gets up, or the Opposition's proposal for tax deductibility gets up, both that and this will not be able to survive.

The background to this is that the Labor Party has a substantial advantage over every political party in this country. It is the political arm of the trade union movement. All union dues, as everyone knows, are tax deductible&mdash;and no-one is disputing that. However, amounts of money are paid from those tax deductible union dues as affiliation fees to the Labor Party. That does not happen to any other party in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, any donations that come from the union movement to the ALP come from tax free money. This is not commonly known. Unions are a different kettle of fish from what they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago, when they existed simply to look after their members. They have become very big business and, in some cases, they are as big as any other big business in this country. They own lots of CBD property and they have income-producing operations. They are now at the point where, in fact, if they owned part of the casino on the Gold Coast&mdash;they may well own part of it; I do not know&mdash;all income paid to the trade union would be tax free. Any donations that flow on to the Labor Party are tax free donations. </PARA>

For goodness sake, let us try to level the playing field; let us get a bit of fairness into this. I have been over this time and time again in this debate and it was talked about in the second reading debate. We are stuck for time, but let me just say that I understand that the Democrats intend to move an amendment the intent of which is to put a lid of $100 on those donations. It was my view that we would have been happy with some sort of a lid. We believe that what the Democrats propose is too low. In fact, an appropriate lid would have been the level at which disclosure was required, and anything below that would have been satisfactory.</PARA>

Therefore, any bona fide membership would have to be disclosed by specific regulation, because we all know that memberships do not go over $1,500 if they are bona fide.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was a deferred discussion from yesterday, when it was felt that the proposal that was before the Committee was not flexible enough to accommodate individual State situations and State concerns. The matter was particularly raised in respect of the opposition parties in Queensland. Thereafter, Senator Boswell raised with my office the question of the National Party in Western Australia or whatever it may be called there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had to focus on a number of other issues which go, for instance, to what happens when in the case of a Senate election a senator has not had to run in the preceding election but ran in the one before that, and how essentially one takes into account all State peculiarities. The proposal that is before us is one that, I suppose, if one were to describe it generically, could be classified as democratic proportionality, and that is the concept that we have tried to pick up. That is one concept; another concept has been to incorporate flexibility. The third concept is, in the context of flexibility, to ensure that State peculiarities are also picked up and can be accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the clause is very general. It ensures that regulations will be formulated for each State. It also ensures that there is capacity for the break-up of time to be made on a State rather than a national basis. I give the assurance that the regulations will be in place within six months. That is, I think, a concern that some people have had. As I say, the regulations are disallowable by either House of Parliament. So there is that ultimate guarantee that if the regulations are not fair in the way that the Senate or the House of Representatives determines, they can, in a sense, be rewritten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us is a mechanism which, for instance, would accommodate the situation that Senator Harradine would have: he did not run at the last election but he ran in the election before that. His position could be accommodated in regulations. In addition, the emergence of new parties is accommodated. The principles and the letter ensure that 90 per cent of the total time will be made available to existing parties which are represented in the respective parliament; 10 per cent will then be available for emerging groups and they would have access to that. </PARA>

I believe it is most appropriate, therefore, that these considerations be put in that subsection and in subsection (1) of proposed new section 95DD now to keep the consistency of this amendment and to give clear effect to what the Minister has said.

Paragraph 3 makes it quite clear that there is flexibility within the regulations to account for the difficulties which I can understand the National Party has.

Once we start writing this into the Act now, we will go in a cycle in which we will never be satisfied.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sad day for democracy when, because the Australian Democrats and the Government get together to ram through a Bill with such far reaching implications, we could well have the situation whereby the Democrats will have a vastly increased share of the free time&mdash;something like 13 per cent&mdash;the Labor Party and the Liberal Party will do fairly well out of it, but people like Senator Harradine, Senator Vallentine or some other Independent who may happen to be in the Senate could get absolutely nothing. The minor parties, which are not even here, could well end up with not one second of time. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is fundamentally flawed because we cannot have 115 per cent of 100 per cent. It just does not work. But because this Bill has been chopped around so much, it ends up allocating more than 100 per cent of total free time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I maintain that I have not seen it come through the chamber. I do not know whether the amendment which the Minister is proposing is the one that will end up in here. In fact, I understand it has been amended once already. It shows that 90 per cent of the time will go to the political parties which have people in parliament. I refer the Minister to clause 95DF(2), which says that other people&mdash;meaning people in parliament who are not members of a political party&mdash;will have a minimum of 5 per cent of the total time and a maximum of 10 per cent of the total time. If there are three Independents in the Parliament, three times 5 per cent is 15 per cent. If we add 15 per cent to 90 per cent, we get 105 per cent. What will happen with that? What will happen to all the parties which are not represented in parliament and all of those Independents, such as Mr Ted Mack? Where does he go? Where does he get his free time from? We have already spent 105 per cent of the total time. How can it be done? This Bill is fundamentally flawed because people have gone around trying to amend it on the run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the most important Bill that has ever been raised in relation to free speech and democracy in this chamber. It is an absolute sham and a mess because the Government has not had the time or the inclination. It has been aided and abetted by this crew in the corner who call themselves the champions of democracy in Parliament. We have not had the time to debate this. If we had, these sorts of things would have been brought to light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention, in relation to that thing which shows that the whole Bill is fundamentally flawed, that the Government is completely taking away from councils like the Brisbane City Council and the Townsville City Council&mdash;just to name two&mdash;the right to advertise on the electronic media. If that had been the case before the last election, the Labor Party, with all its lies and its misinformation campaign, would not have got up. So maybe it is a good thing. Although that right has been taken away, the champions of democracy in the Australian Democrats have not even addressed its loss. I hope that Senator Kernot answers to her Brisbane electorate for that when she gets back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those things, there are myriad complaints about this particular clause.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole Bill is fraught with opportunities to rort the system, to give the ALP additional time. The question then arises whether one takes it State by State; the Minister has given some undertaking on this. Does one take it upper chamber, lower chamber?  What happens if all the green groups around Australia unite and become a section of the Australian Democrats? Do their votes from the last election go into it? They are things that could really happen and have to be looked at. They cannot be looked at on the run and they cannot be dealt with in regulations because the legislation is going contrary to that particular idea. There are an enormous number of inequities and unfortunate things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Harradine and Senator Vallentine that they could well be without any free time. It just so happens that at the moment both of them are associated as parties. But Senator Vallentine came in here not as that. Which party is Mr Mack in? If he wants to come here as an Independent, where does he go? The Democrats do not care because they have 13 per cent of the public purse; the Government does not care because it will make sure it gets its snout in the trough yet again. But it does not give a damn about the Independents, the smaller parties and those that represent the majority of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Macdonald's remarks. We are in a tight situation here and we are trying to make the best of it. The proposition we have at the moment is that the parties in this Parliament or the State Parliament get 90 per cent of the appropriated time allocated on a proportional basis on the vote they received at the last election. That raises problems of its own. For instance, at the last Queensland State election the National Party got a very bad vote. I have seen that happen to the Liberal Party. Probably every party has its ups and downs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If appropriated time is locked into the last performance, that then entrenches the last performance. The party will never break out of that. So it goes around in ever-decreasing circles. Because it got a bad vote last time it cannot advance its vote the next time as it does not have any access to the appropriated time. That is a problem that I think the Government has not considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party contests a very small number of seats. Yet, in the seats it does stand for, it can get a very high proportion of the vote. In Maranoa and Gwydir, for example, the National Party gets 70 and 80 per cent of the vote. Yet the National Party has only 8 per cent of the total vote in Australia. The Government might say that we can allocate that back into the States, but it certainly will not work that way. I know that time is running on and Senator Walters wants to have access to the floor, but we have to advance the belief that this 8 per cent, translated into free time, will never allow the National Party to advance. This provision will never allow any other minor parties to advance. </PARA>

There is the constitutional question of appropriation of property&mdash;in this instance, from the television stations concerned&mdash;for which no compensation is being offered, which is highly debatable.

That issue has not been properly debated or resolved in this chamber. It has been put to me&mdash;and I do not doubt it, as it has been put by most eminent institutional experts&mdash;that there is a very good chance that the Bill will fail on that ground. It will fall because, quite reasonably, the Commonwealth should not be able to interfere in the electoral process within the States.

The Government is not just banning electoral advertising in Commonwealth elections, it wants to ban it in all State elections and in all local government elections as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government Whip came in earlier today and asked why we wanted an extension of time to 12.45 p.m., as we had already had X number of hours. Senator Schacht interjected a moment ago that we had had 40 hours so why would we want more time. I will tell them why we want more time. Because the Government has amendments and amendments upon its amendments on legislation that it has introduced in this Parliament. It is the Government that has been fumbling, inept, incompetent and inefficient in presenting legislation and amendments to this chamber. We on this side of the chamber, the Democrats and the Opposition, have had to attempt to amend on the run the Government's legislation with the principal Act. We have had only a few hours in which to try to put this legislation into some reasonable shape and form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Bishop and other speakers put on the record constitutional advice from Sir Maurice Byers that this Bill will be constitutionally invalid. If it is constitutionally invalid, we will resort, under the broadcasting provisions, to the Government's original intention, which is a complete ban on advertising. The legislation as it is now with the amendments that we have made and the bandaids that we have put on it for the last few hours means that the councillors and the Mayor who are standing for election to the Brisbane City Council&mdash;which, incidentally, is bigger than the Government of Tasmania&mdash;are totally disenfranchised from advertising in any form. That is what we have done&mdash;disenfranchised that section of local government within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Government Whip, Senator Schacht and other members in this chamber that the Opposition made no request for General Business today. That is 2 1/2 hours of our time that we have devoted to debating this legislation. We did not seek to take it away from the Government. We gave it up for the purpose of debating this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that the ABC has raised the difficulties that it sees with this legislation as it relates to the ABT. I know the Democrats are concerned about that, as we are. But there simply has been no time to consider drafting amendments. The Table Office and the draftsmen have done an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances in trying to keep the amendments up to members and senators. But the point is that within the ABC there are difficulties and they have been identified. We have not had an opportunity to address those in the form of drafting amendments. We ought to refer this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so that it can then undertake appropriate drafting and report back to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber that this will not delay the passage of the legislation. The House of Representatives is not coming back until 17 and 18 December. The Senate has a full sitting week next week. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs can meet tomorrow and give consideration to constitutional advice on the validity of the laws that we are attempting to pass, recognising that if the laws are invalid, as clearly eminent advice has suggested they are, they will be tested and thrown out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manner in which the number of amendments that, as I said, have come cascading through, and the misunderstandings and the areas of uncertainty show quite clearly that we need further time to debate this issue and that it needs to go to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

I said that we would give leave for that to be moved, obviously. You are about to call the motion, despite the expiry of time, that the amendments circulated be voted upon. Senator Macdonald has asked to debate that motion, which is quite legitimate, as I understand it.

I am saying that it is usually the practice of the Chair, if this is debatable and the call has not been finalised because the Chairman has not seen the honourable senator, to continue to give that senator the call. I do not think there is much doubt about that; that has been the Senate practice. Mr Chairman, I do not know whether you want to rule on that second matter: if someone rises after you have started calling the ayes and the noes, whether a senator is recognised and whether that is done at the mid-point or right up to the end. That is the second area that we would have to determine.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. The motion as moved by Senator McMullan was not as Senator Coulter described it, `to bring to a cessation'; it was indeed to extend, because the cessation came at the end of the application of the guillotine. The position is, as I understand it, that Senator Macdonald was on his feet at the first available moment, that is, when nobody else was on his or her feet.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator Bishop</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right. Indeed, there is a motion before the Chair from Senator McMullan which we ought to be debating. Senator Macdonald was on his feet at the first available time that the Standing Orders permit him to be on his feet; that is, when there is nobody else on his or her feet. Mr Chairman, I do not know whether you were gazing at the Government side and did not notice him before you started to speak. That is quite possible. I do not know whether Senator Robert Ray was gazing somewhere else before he saw Senator Macdonald, but the bottom line is we have a motion before the Chair which properly ought to be debated, and you have a foreshadowed motion from Senator Hill. If you choose to rule against the right to debate the motion, as moved by Senator McMullan, then we will take another course of action. Clearly, as Senator Macdonald was on his feet at the proper time, the proper thing to do is to allow him now to debate the motion as moved by Senator McMullan.</PARA></TALK.START>

In order to avoid further procedural matters, Senator McMullan has gone outside the terms of the guillotine and has sought leave to move a motion to allow other circulated amendments to be put. That is not within the scope of the guillotine at all. He has moved that motion and in the normal proper way we have sought to debate that motion. I respectfully suggest that the matter is being wrongly ruled upon to say that we do not have a right to debate that motion. I find that astonishing. If that is your ruling, under the normal contingent notice of motion, I then take the procedure that allows us to suspend Standing Orders to debate matters that are outside the guillotine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order on that point. You are obviously interpreting the leave which was granted to Senate McMullan as lengthening the time of the guillotine. That is not what it did. When Senator Hill rose to put his motion, in fact business had been concluded. In terms of guillotine, business had been concluded. There had been no vote on Senator McMullan's motion at all. The reason that Senator Hill's motion was foreshadowed and, indeed, is being put is that you have denied rightful debate on Senator McMullan's motion. Therefore, we have no option but to use that mechanism. There has been no vote on Senator McMullan's motion. If the motion is lost&mdash;which is quite possible&mdash;the guillotine would still apply. So it is quite clear that Senator Hill is, in fact, speaking at the time of conclusion. The point that Senator Ray raised about standing order 142(6) is not relevant because it talks about the commencement of business. What we are talking about is the conclusion of business. Let us remember that it is the Government's guillotine; we did not want it.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator McMullan was forced to move an amendment after the debate has been supposedly guillotined. I understood that Senator McMullan and his Party, and Senator Coulter and his group down at the end of the chamber, moved a guillotine motion for consideration of the Bill to be extended beyond 7.30 last night. The time has been extended on a number of occasions since then, the last being an hour ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a point of order, Mr President; the case put by Senator Alston prima facie is right. There are two different sections of the Standing Orders: 145 which deals with the committee as a whole and 198 which deals with presidential rulings. My reading of 145 infers that we do not want these matters determined in committee; we want them determined in the chamber as a whole. Therefore, I think there is a weakness in Standing Orders that allows it virtually to be put without debate when it is a presidential ruling but not with a deputy president's ruling.</PARA></TALK.START>

If you do think it is within your or that person's rights, how do you then propose that any member of this chamber access the Standing Orders other than by using a point of order to draw them to your attention?

The first standing order that is never remembered is that commonsense will prevail.

So, Mr President, all I am saying is that this is a double-sided coin. I think Senator Vanstone's interpretation of the point of order is pretty much right. Sometimes, remember, there is so much noise over there it cannot be heard. So there are some instances of that. But there are also some clear ones where it may occur and a senator is not recognised.

<PARA>The recent Industry Commission annual report outlined the true impact of protection of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The cost to consumers in terms of higher prices paid for clothing and footwear totalled some $2 billion in 1990-91. This amounts to an average of over $300 per household, with the taxing effect of the assistance being regressive across those households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, what I am saying is that the degree of protection given by way of tariffs to clothing and footwear amounts to a tax upon ordinary, struggling Australian families who are suffering under this Government's imposed recession. The continuing high levels of assistance to some textile, clothing and footwear industries mean that there is an effective rate of 176 per cent on clothing and footwear and that textiles attract a rate of 68 per cent. These rates are really out of step with the rest of the manufacturing industry sectors. The average effective rate of assistance for manufacturing is estimated at about 15 per cent for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of the implementation of the Government's announced changes of the 12 March 1991 statement in 1996, the effective rate of assistance across manufacturing industries should have fallen to about 5 per cent. Looking at particular areas within the TCF industries, the precise extent of assistance becomes apparent. In 1990-91, for instance, the effective rates of assistance were 166 per cent for man-made fibre woven fabrics, 152 per cent for textile finishing, 139 per cent for household textiles, 142 per cent for textile floor coverings, 135 per cent for hosiery, 237 per cent for cardigans and pullovers, 201 per cent for men's trousers, 140 per cent for men's suits, 187 per cent for women's outwear, 187 per cent for foundation garments, and a massive 238 per cent for underwear and infants' clothing. In other words, there is imposed upon what the Government often refers to as the basic essentials of life a tax, by way of tariffs, of huge propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that protection to manufacturing industries, whether it be in tariffs or other forms, not only increases the price of imported goods but also leads to an increase in the price of domestically produced goods. The broad measure of the additional amounts consumers pay as a result of assistance to domestic manufacturing industries is known as the consumer tax equivalent. It stood at $7.1 billion in 1990-91 across all manufacturing industries, of which $287m applied to textiles and over $2 billion applied solely to clothing and footwear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem which arises, particularly in the TCF industries, is associated with the disparities in the levels of assistance between and within industries. The larger the disparities in nominal and effective assistance levels, the greater the potential for resources to be used in activities which fail to maximise economic welfare. The Industry Commission uses the standard deviation as a measure of those disparities, such that the higher the standard deviation the larger the variation in rates of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard deviation for effective rates of assistance within the textiles industry was 57 percentage points in 1990-91, while it was 60 percentage points for the clothing and footwear industries. That gets put into perspective when one contrasts it with the standard deviation of 29 percentage points across the whole of manufacturing. By 1996, at the present rate under the present scheme, with the completion of the 1991 program, the TCF industries will have standard deviations for effective rates of assistance of more than double the next highest sector in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the textiles, clothing and footwear plan that the Government has been so proud of and in which it has expressed its pride from time to time is in fact a plan that effectively works a tax on ordinary Australian families so that they can buy clothing and footwear at a price which is cheaper than that they are forced to pay now. But it is interesting that, despite the heaviest levels of protection for any of the manufacturing industries which TCF attracts, it has been on a downturn. If one drew a graph, it would show a continuing downturn. This, of course, reflects the recession but it is the continuance of a trend which shows that the industry, despite its protection, is not benefiting or lifting itself. Textiles, clothing and footwear have been on a downturn over a period of time:  profits are down, production is down and employment is down. Historically, this has been the continuing pattern, but the most recent figures are really quite alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between November 1978 and November 1985, TCF employment fell by 16,000 people. That is, in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, 16,000 people lost their jobs. That is about 13 per cent of the work force. This is in spite of the fact that the effective assistance during the period was around 70 per cent for textiles, 170 per cent for clothing and almost 200 per cent for footwear. To try to describe the TCF industry as being the sunrise industry and in need of help so that it can get on its feet&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I am. I have just set out in some detail, for the Minister's elucidation as much as anybody else's, the enormous levels of protection. I have noticed over time that he does not seem to have a great deal of contact with his Department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get back to the state of the industry, the one which during the period Senator Button has presided over it has gone into decline. The Minister may or may not take that as a personal vote on his ability, as he sees fit; or, perhaps more particularly, the Australian people will. Indeed, while I am about it, maybe that is the reason why his colleagues are trying to get him to stand down&mdash;so that they can bring back Mr Keating. Maybe they are right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the state of the industry, the one that the Minister has been presiding over during its downfall. In the time that I was dealing with&mdash;that is, 1978 to 1985, just so the Minister can remember those dates&mdash;employment in the TCF industry dropped by 16,000 people. TCF has been hit even harder by this recession&mdash;that is, the one organised by the Minister and his colleagues. Senator Button was one of the organisers of this recession. Now that we have the recession, the figures for the last three months have fallen by a further 10 per cent, or another 13,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not suppose that the Minister would worry about that. After all, he kept telling us the other day in Question Time what a great job the members of the Government were all doing and how brilliant they all were. The Minister criticised our plan of action, which is designed to put two million jobs back into the workplace. All he could do was stand there and say, `At page such and such of your report' and then misread it. As I said in answering, it is a great shame that the Minister, in his ageing process, is losing not only his ability to read but also his ability to reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for the terrible impact of the recession on the TCF industries is the inward looking nature of them. Despite the recent increase in exports amongst manufacturing industries generally, the export-import ratio for TCF remains at 10 per cent. This means that the industries have been virtually unable to cope with domestic economic fluctuations during this period. We can see a very good example of this in Victoria, the Minister's State. The capital is `Bleak City', Melbourne. Another Labor Government put that State virtually into liquidation. If it were possible to put a State into receivership, my gosh, a receiver would have been appointed in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Victoria. In the leisure wear industry, Sportscraft&mdash;a most efficient Australian company&mdash;announced the closure of its Bendigo factory last week. In 1989, the Bendigo operation employed more than 200 staff. Last week, it announced the lay-off of its last 34 workers and its intention to try to sell that factory. The view of the workers and the works manager at the Bendigo plant was that many of those who had been laid off would find it very difficult to get another job. That is just part of the continuing story of the bleak hope for the State of Victoria as a whole, which has been compounded by the Government putting a recession in place, as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the production of the TCF industry is in decline. According to the ABS industrial index, clothing and footwear production slumped by 23 per cent in 1989-90, compared with the manufacturing industry's average increase of 3 per cent. Even in the boom times of 1987 and 1988, clothing and footwear production was third of the manufacturing average of 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, we have introduced the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Amendment Bill 1991, to which I have formally moved an amendment.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate is of the opinion that the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Amendment Bill 1991 is indicative of the Government's failure to deliver a climate conducive to restructuring and long-term growth of the industry, in particular because it:</PARA>

The really sad part is that the Australian Democrats have acquiesced in what the Government has done because they get an advantage out of it&mdash;$1.8m worth of advantage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Amendment Bill 1991 contains amendments resulting from the changes in assistance announced in the 12 March industry statement of this year. The Australian Democrats will be supporting this Bill without amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Act which established the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, which has a brief to alleviate restructuring problems likely to occur whilst making TCF industries more competitive. The Bill repeals provisions relating to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority&mdash;or TCFDA&mdash;raw materials processing and plant and equipment modernisation programs and repeals the requirement that the TCFDA review and report to the Minister by 30 June 1992 on the operation and effectiveness of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will set in motion two programs which will be, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) announced, stronger and more flexible than the original programs and which will help potentially competitive firms survive the pressure of protection cuts. These programs are: the new incentives for international competitiveness program, which provides assistance to specific companies, and the infrastructure support program. The Government is providing an increase of $15m per annum for support to these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 12 March industry statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a Competitive Australia</EMPHASIS>, the Government announced that it would revise four main programs: the two that I have previously mentioned, plus the import credits program and the capitalisation grants program. Although all four of these programs will be administered by the TCFDA, the capitalisation grants program and the import credits scheme will be managed in cooperation with the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TCF Development Authority reported in 1990 that these industries, despite adjustments being made, still remain some of the most highly protected industries in Australia; indeed, up to 12 times higher than those applying to industry in general, and that more adjustments are required if TCF industries are to become internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has announced that reductions in protection for TCF industries will be accelerated; tariffs will be phased down to a maximum of 25 per cent by the year 2000; quotas will be terminated by March 1993; and bounties will be abolished by June 1995. Therefore, these two programs have far-reaching implications for a very large sector of the Australian work force&mdash;those thousands of people employed in the textile, clothing and footwear industry whose livelihoods depend on their company's economic survival in the light of the reduction in the protection that they have formerly enjoyed. The Australian Democrats have already made it plain that we support the provision of tariffs and bounties to Australian business so that it can compete with international companies that enjoy a number of generous subsidies and other economic advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vibrant manufacturing sector able to compete internationally is vital to the economic health of the nation. Nevertheless, the economic rationalists inform us that the tariff reduction program is having its desired effect and that inefficient Australian manufacturers are being subjected to market forces. Tell that to the many thousands of people who are losing their jobs in this area. However, the concept of a level playing field, on which these tariff reductions appear to be based, is not a panacea for Australia's economic woes. There are numerous countries that provide enormous protection to their own industries&mdash;the United States being a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Metal Trades Industry Association has consistently questioned the need for Australia to adopt this kind of flat earth restructuring program with such haste. Mr M.A. Besley, AM, National President of the MTIA, in a recent speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What an increasing number of Australians are beginning to question is why this country should pursue a policy which gives a high unilateral trade concession to manufacturers overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>This Government is seeking to establish a level playing field of Australian industry in an international climate which is not fair and is riddled with protectionism, tariffs and quotas, as other countries seek to defend their jobs and industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the manufacturing sector complains that the Government's industry restructuring policies have happened too quickly, without a reciprocal speed up in the micro-economic reform process. Despite gains, there are still massive inefficiencies on the waterfront, in transport, and in the overlap of Commonwealth, State and local government regulations, which must be dealt with to help increase the competitive nature of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats fully recognise the need to invest in new plant and equipment, value add our primary products and engage in wide-ranging micro-economic reform to assist industry. However, the Government's commitment to lowering protection levels throughout manufacturing and acceleration of reductions to protection may confer more problems than it solves at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that TCF companies desperately need to be more competitive internationally. The new incentives for the international competitiveness program will extend assistance for capital re-equipment and rationalisation projects, investment in manufacturing systems and raw materials processing projects by broadening the eligibility criteria so that more firms can benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that applicants will be required to submit their business objectives in relation to production of TCF products in Australia, their plans for achieving those objectives in terms of certain matters, including organisational restructuring, investment, export development, raw materials processing and other matters, plus information regarding their international competitiveness at the time when government assistance ceases. This will help ensure that, where government assistance is to be given, companies will have a clear vision of what they seek to achieve and how to get there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TCF industries themselves must make a commitment to improve their efficiency and reduce dependence on government support. It is only right that support provided under the industries development strategy will be conditional upon TCF industries making a commitment, both financially and by addressing those problems which have inhibited their competitiveness or restrained development. Changes in attitude within the TCF industries will be essential to ensuring the success of the new plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw honourable senators' attention to the recent closure of the Rocklea spinning mills at Kotara near Newcastle. When the Authority was established in 1988 the Minister advised that `where employment reductions are involved, support will be conditional upon recipients adopting a responsible labour management plan and minimising involuntary employment reductions'. Despite this clear direction, 327 workers lost their jobs in an area already suffering from a severely depressed job market without any of the required consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button criticised Rocklea for this omission but it was far too late. So much for the highly touted labour management plan. The deed had been done and the workers became instant unemployment statistics. To compound this appalling episode, Rocklea received a bounty of $15.9m which it promptly allocated to its Bendigo plant. This is an example of the Government's failure to check the conditions under which its grants will be spent. Taxpayers' money must have strings and accountability attaching to its use. The Government has said that it will ensure that appropriate consultative measures will be put in place to ensure that the Rocklea fiasco will not happen again, but that is a bit late for those workers who will lose their jobs. The Australian Democrats would still like to see, however, an overhaul of the guidelines for administration of the bounty system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TCF industries are still geared only to the Australian market. Apart from scoured wool and wool tops, they export less than 5 per cent of sales. The TCFDA advises that restructuring has begun in some sectors but that the restructuring needed to become internationally competitive was being inhibited by continued high protection. In other words, if we remove the protection, companies will be forced to become internationally competitive to survive. Some will survive, but how many will go to the wall?  Why is Australia, almost alone, pursuing a policy which gives a huge unilateral trade concession to manufacturers overseas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians must look at their own business environment. This headlong charge towards tariff reform must be countered by the implementation of macro-economic and micro-economic reform. We are burdened by entrenched inefficiencies and infrastructure and the high value of the Australian dollar. These problems must be seriously addressed if Australia is to regain a sound economic footing. The Australian Democrats commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

However, as we have come to expect from this Government, it has failed to provide the full range of supporting structural reforms in industrial relations, taxation, transport and the public sector that will allow the textile, clothing and footwear industries to remain viable in a more competitive environment. Instead, the failings of the industry and its precarious position at present are in large measure due to the Labor Government's failure to tackle full scale reform of the structure of our economy&mdash;the so-called micro-economic reform&mdash;right across the board. This failure has contributed greatly to the devastating billion dollar plus current account deficits Australia is racking up month on month. We heard a couple of days ago that the figure for the October current account deficit is a disastrous $1.3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The textile, clothing and footwear industries in Australia have existed since Federation on a foundation of protection of one form or another. These have consisted of bounties, tariffs and quotas which have effectively shielded the industry from international competition. Internally, this artificial protection resulted in the 1980s in a concentration of productive and financial resources through mergers and acquisitions. The adage `big is beautiful' became the byword, as it did elsewhere in the Australian business world. This was in stark contrast to the developments in the leading textile industry countries of Germany, Italy and Japan where industry integration in large scale firms has been largely dismantled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concentration has been removed from the textile industry in these countries and has been replaced with a large number of smaller specialised firms. This has allowed much greater flexibility to enable firms to concentrate on niche markets in the fast changing fashion world. This sort of flexibility is impossible in large companies. The Prato region in Italy is a case in point. Woollen fabric has been made in the Prato area for some 600 years. In 1975 there were 750 firms there, but by 1985 there were 14,000 firms employing some 60,000 people. Firms have become smaller but more numerous under a public policy strategy that provides a framework and environment for them to develop and to make their decisions. There are no cash hand-outs. Instead, there is infrastructure support and group services for marketing and exchange of information on products and technologies which have resulted in a high quality, high value added product and high wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison, the Australian textile industry during the 1980s under the Labor Government's textile, clothing and footwear plan received contradictory signals. There was nothing for small firms; everything was large scale, without strategy and with no framework of support. The only support was overwhelmingly protectionist with cash hand-outs&mdash;this is all that bounties are&mdash;$30m of which went to only three firms. However, in 1988 the Labor Government announced the textile, clothing and footwear assistance reduction plan and allocated $120m until 1995 to assist firms to restructure. This assistance is aimed at cutting out quotas by 1993, bounties by 1995 and reducing tariffs to 25 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, the annual Budget allocations have been consistently underspent. For example, in 1990-91, of a total allocation of $9.9m, only $4.9m was spent and no projects were funded under the raw materials processing program. So much for the concept of developing value added to Australia's primary industries&mdash;in this case, the wool industry. No projects at all were funded under the raw materials processing program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Opposition will accept this legislation, the Liberal and National parties are totally committed to accelerating reductions in protectionism, with the aim of achieving negligible levels by the year 2000. This is in line with our overall policy for all manufacturing industry in Australia, including the motor vehicle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the major difference between the Liberal and Nationals parties' Fightback policy and the bumblings of the current Labor Government is that we do not see the reduction of protectionism in isolation. Rather, it is just part of a total integrated package of reform as announced in our Fightback program. Because of its long history of protectionism, these industries have become uncompetitive and are in a very parlous state. The industry will not survive with or without assistance unless there are some major modifications made across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Profits, production and employment have declined markedly in recent years in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, despite effective levels of assistance of around 70 per cent for textile manufacturing, 170 per cent for clothing and almost 200 per cent for footwear. So when we hear Senator Sowada talk about the impact of reduced protection on employment, as she did on behalf of the Democrats a few moments ago, let us remember that reduced protection has had nothing to do with reductions in employment in this industry. For a long time now, because of their inefficiencies, these industries have been unable to maintain their employment levels in spite of these excessively high levels of protection. For example, in just three months last year employment fell by some 13,000&mdash;about 10 per cent. As I have said, so much for the flawed argument that protection saves jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The textiles, clothing and footwear industries have fared badly compared with other Australian manufacturing industries, despite these much higher levels of protection. For example, clothing and footwear production slumped by a massive 23 per cent in 1989-90, while manufacturing industry overall averaged a modest 3 per cent increase. It is obvious that high protection has not solved the industry's problems; rather, it has exacerbated them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not forget that assistance to one industry has to be paid for by someone else. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Again, I ask Senator Sowada to remember that: wherever protection continues in this country, someone else in this country is paying for it. In the main, it is our efficient export industries&mdash;those industries that we want to encourage, that we want to see grow and develop because they earn the very necessary overseas exchange&mdash;that are penalised when protection continues for these other industries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government itself, of course, is moving in that direction, however slowly. Even the Metal Trades Industry Association has now accepted that tariff protection must go. As I have already said, there is not much point in removing tariffs if one is not going to remove all of the other impediments to making industry competitive. Fortunately, Senator Sowada did make some comments with regard to needs in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let us look at the tax system, which is one of the major impositions on manufacturing industry and business in general. Business is subject to a whole range of taxes: wholesale sales taxes of $9.4 billion, payroll tax of $5.8 billion, fuel excise of $6.6 billion, customs duties of $3.3 billion and the training guarantee levy. The next Liberal-National government, which now is not far away, will abolish all of these and reduce the tax on exports by $1.7 billion. The capital gains tax will be revised and lowered and the present depreciation allowance arrangements will be reviewed. Our overall reform package will drastically reduce business costs, some by as much as 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the key to economic recovery in this country is reform of the industrial relations system and the introduction of genuine enterprise bargaining. Only by giving employers and employees a choice and the ability to be flexible in their work arrangements can we ensure real increases in productivity. The Liberal-National policies for industrial reform have been well documented, so I will not dwell on them here today, other than to say that they are based on the fundamentals of enterprise bargaining, voluntary agreements and voluntary unionism. Workplace reform will not only benefit the textiles, clothing and footwear industries directly, but also make huge improvements in the efficiency and the costs of road and rail transport and the waterfront, which will have a direct contributory effect on industry's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long this country has been too complacent, too content to be the lucky country, without realising that the rest of the world was leaving us behind. Hiding behind our tariff walls, we did not notice that our manufacturing industries had become inefficient, uncompetitive and outdated, while we continued to pay ourselves higher and higher wages for less and less production, living farther and farther beyond our means. From being one of the wealthiest nations in the early years of this century, we have declined now and are in just fifteenth place among the industrialised countries of the world. </PARA>

Instead, it has made token gestures which have succeeded only in tinkering around the edges of what really ails us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to say a few words about the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Amendment Bill 1991. As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) well knows, for many years I have supported reductions in protection in this industry, but I have always been of the view that, at the same time as those reductions in protection are implemented, there should be a reduction in the burdens imposed on this industry. I refer to the taxation burdens, in particular the burdens created by the current industrial relations system which, as the Minister would know, have in fact guaranteed increases in real wages during the term of this depression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been encouraged to join in this debate mainly because of the views expressed by the Victorian Minister for Manufacturing and Industry Development. That is an interesting title for a Victorian Minister&mdash;industry development. As a result of the way that the Victorian Ministry has been behaving in the last three, four or five years, there has been no development going on in Victoria in any way. The Victorian Minister for Manufacturing and Industry Development, Mr David White, a colleague of Senator Button, said that the Federal Government's adoption of Federal Treasury policy towards manufacturing industry is flyblown&mdash;that was his word&mdash;and is driving manufacturers offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He suggested that the Government adopt policies to stimulate industry, including accelerated depreciation allowances for manufacturing plant and equipment and other such proposals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Minister that the task he and his Government face is to generate sufficient economic growth to create jobs for new entrants to the labour market and some of those in the unemployment pool while, at the same time, not rekindling inflationary pressures. Indeed, I put it to the Minister that the Government will have to be very careful to ensure that there is no short term gain in unemployment figures at the cost of greater economic dislocation in the medium term, so that lower inflation is then locked in and the balance of payments problems of the nation get worse. </PARA>

Those opposite say that, if the Liberal Party were in office, the Bendigo factory of David Bardas Sportscraft would not have closed&mdash;that all the textiles, clothing and footwear industries in this country need is the trains to run on time and a bit of structural adjustment. Some of these industries have labour disabilities of 100 per cent. Senator Bishop ought to understand that OECD countries recognise that fact. Some of these industries have disabilities of 100 per cent in terms of labour costs. That is why we are lowering protection. Throughout the world, other countries do exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole of the European group and North American countries belong to the international multifibre agreement, as it is called, which accords those industries just as much protection as these much maligned industries in Australia are accorded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of industry restructuring is a careful art, in my view. We have to take a number of things into account and we have to do it in a way which allows industries, as much as possible, to adjust in a sensible way to a regime in which employment will be less and in which the competitive advantages which we have in Australia can be best enhanced. Those areas where we have no competitive advantage because of total labour cost disabilities, or for some other reason, should be phased out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a process which requires intelligence, a degree of pragmatism and thought. And, in a sense, that is what this Bill is about, in that it is trying to allow the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority to help these industries through a process of adjustment. That does not mean that some of them will not close; some of them will close. The sad fact is that they ought to, because they are not capable of competing on the international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come in here and say, as Senator Chapman and Senator Bishop have, `We will do away with all the protection of these industries; we will just get rid of that overnight' is the lazy person's way of doing it. That is the way which does not require the thought and the adjustment processes which I have just referred to. That is the lazy way to go about it. That is why <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> is such a lazy, sloppy document in relation to the motor vehicle industry. In order to make a case about protection, it says that market share of the Australian motor vehicle industry has been steadily declining over the years. That is untrue&mdash;a deliberate distortion of the facts, I assume. It is an argument which relates very much to Senator Chapman's bullish allegation that `there is no such thing as a free lunch'. It is a false argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an appropriate time to comment on the September quarter GDP numbers. Of course they are weaker than the forecasts which have been made by the Government or most private sector commentators. But before Elmer Fudd over here goes off and the Opposition starts getting too excited about a bit of bad news, I should point out that the overall figures are heavily influenced by the continuing poor conditions in the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GDP declined in the September quarter by 0.3 per cent&mdash;that is seasonally adjusted and in real terms&mdash;to be 1.9 per cent below the September quarter 1990. The main reasons for these quarterly numbers are, firstly, that both private and government consumption are up moderately, contributing 1.2 percentage points to GDP; secondly, investment&mdash;which Senator Short referred to&mdash;is down moderately, detracting from growth by 0.1 per cent; and stocks detracted strongly from growth. And I agree with Senator Short's implicit comment about the causes for that. On the other hand, net exports were very positive, adding 0.3 per cent to GDP, and the farm sector detracted from growth by a large 0.6 percentage points. There is no comfort or joy for the Government or industry in these figures. I suppose if there is comfort it should be seen in the continuation of the strong growth of net exports.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not say that. I said if there is comfort it can be taken from the strong growth in net exports and from the modest 0.4 per cent growth in the non-farm sector, which sets aside the influence on growth of a deeply recessed rural sector. I should also point to the continuing improvement in inflation. The change in the non-farm GDP deflator is now down to 2.4 per cent, and I think it is instructive to look at the annualised trade figures which show net exports for the year contributing a massive 3.2 percentage points to growth. Those are the sets of figures in respect of trade performance which are vitally important to the future of this country. Any policies which increased inflation or increased interest rates, which would be very detrimental to that trade performance, should of course be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In view of the Minister's answer and his lack of denial that there is a continuing rolling recession, will the Government now adopt the proposals contained in the coalition's Fightback program of economic reform which do address the underlying problems facing the Australian economy and which do provide the leadership, the vision and, more particularly, the hope that all Australians are so desperately seeking?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is no&mdash;and I want to tell Senator Short, as he has asked the question, why it is no. Firstly, on any objective analysis which is freed from these mindless assumptions which clutter the heads of people like Senator Short, there is a clear message in the so-called Opposition Fightback program. As to the export figures which Senator Short has just asked me about, the message is particularly clear for Australian exporters that, under an Opposition coalition Government, inflation would rise, interest rates would rise, and the only thing that we could say with confidence would fall would be tax for people on $90,000 or more a year. We can say with certainty that they would benefit from a package like that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the same point exactly. As usual, the Opposition does not want to hear these unpalatable figures because its policy&mdash;which we reject&mdash;is a mixture of false assumptions, misleading information and conjecture, and has been put together as a tax led recovery for this country. One element of a tax led recovery is, of course, that everybody in this country will pay 15 per cent more for everything they buy. The Opposition package is filled with columns of things which are called `compensation'. Why are they called compensation?  Because they would compensate for that burden which would be imposed on everybody in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the Opposition's sudden interest in human rights in Burma, as expressed during the debate on the political ad ban and disclosures Bill, can the Minister indicate what the Government is doing about the Burmese regime which has now been condemned by the United Nations General Assembly for its refusal to end human rights abuses and introduce democratic reforms, and what can be done about the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are very encouraged&mdash;and I would hope the Opposition is too&mdash;by the UN General Assembly's resolution on 30 November which expressed concern over `the grave human rights situation in Burma' and which called for early improvement in the situation. The resolution also welcomed the Secretary-General's appeals for the early release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and will help to maintain, obviously, international pressure on the Burmese regime to release her unconditionally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was very active in the UN exercise to ensure maximum support for that resolution, in cooperation with a number of other countries&mdash;in particular, Sweden, which played a very valuable role. The important thing to appreciate is that the resolution was a consensus one which attracted very widespread support from the international community&mdash;in particular, from Burma's regional neighbours who, I think for the first time, went on the public record in this way to indicate through this resolution their concern for the human rights situation in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burmese delegation opposed the resolution in debate but, in the light of the country's isolation on the issue, did not in fact call for a vote. The resolution does send a strong and unequivocal message to the regime. Concern about the country has now been expressed in the clearest possible terms by the international community, and I do not think anyone in Burma can be in any doubt now about the steps which it should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the particular situation with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, I am pleased to be able to say&mdash;because it did not get very much publicity&mdash;that the Thai Foreign Minister recently announced that there had been confirmation from the Burmese regime in response to a request from Thailand, which is itself encouraging, that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is alive and well. They also said&mdash;and this was reported&mdash;that she will now be able to receive letters from her husband.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concert with the US, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand, Australia initiated a joint demarche in Rangoon three weeks ago concerning Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. It expressed concern over reports that she was ill and called for visiting rights to be accorded to her, and it condemned the regime's refusal to take any meaningful step to respond to the clear wishes of the Burmese people expressed last year for a transfer of power to a democratically elected government. We called in the Ambassador to Burma on that same day and presented him with the points contained in the demarche. I personally made it very clear to him in a conversation a little earlier that the feeling of the Australian community and Parliament was absolutely unanimous on this issue. Australia was also associated with a further demarche coordinated by the European Community to similar effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will continue to play an active role through these international institutions and mechanisms and processes to focus international attention on the human rights situation in Burma and to bring pressure to bear. We will do so at our next available opportunity, the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva early in the New Year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although, as honourable senators will obviously be aware from following news broadcasts, the situation in Yugoslavia remains very tense, there are encouraging signs that the cease-fire that has been brokered by the UN envoy, Mr Cy Vance, is still holding in most areas. There is, however, particular continuing concern over the fate of the Croatian town of Osijek, which is surrounded by units of the Yugoslav national army. The prospects for a peaceful settlement do obviously rest on the maintenance of this cease-fire and the possibility flowing from that of the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 November, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 721, which responded to a request from Yugoslavia for the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation. That resolution approved the activities of Mr Vance and foreshadowed a willingness to consider the establishment of a peacekeeping operation as requested. Mr Vance is now still in Yugoslavia negotiating with the parties. He has called for more progress to be made in implementing a general cease-fire and in lifting the siege of the Yugoslav national army barracks in Croatia. He is expected to make some recommendations to the Secretary-General quite soon,  whereupon the Security Council will reconvene to consider the question. What is being looked at seems to be a peacekeeping force numbering around 9,000 to 10,000 troops, at a cost of no less than $US200m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Australia's continued involvement in this, Mr Duffy, as acting Foreign Minister, in mid-November announced the economic measures we would take and explained that Australia did propose to follow the European Community's practice of exempting the republics of Yugoslavia which cooperate in the peace process. The European Community has now decided to restore trade and aid concessions to the republics of Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus retaining the measures against the republics of Serbia and Montenegro&mdash;although the case of Montenegro is subject to review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp is asking me what would be the effect on mortgages. I have said on a number of occasions in the Senate that, because the figures are published in the document, the effects on the taxation income of various groups in the community would be very different. For example, the income level of $30,000 a year would receive a tax cut per week of $30 and an income level of $75,000 a year would receive a tax benefit of $135 a week&mdash;all, as the package says, as compensation to buy the goods and services which would have a 15 per cent tax imposed on them at the value added level.</PARA></TALK.START>

For example, Senator Kemp, mouth open as usual, was asking for the Treasury figures on this. Let me tell him. A 4 per cent increase in interest rates would have this effect on mortgages: $82.50 would still be the benefit from the tax cut available to somebody on an income of $75,000 a year; and a person on $30,000 a year would be $22.40 worse off per week.

If the Treasurer now intends to use non-farm GDP to measure recessions by excluding droughts&mdash;which, by the way, in 1982-83 cut gross farm product by 33 per cent over five quarters but only by 16 per cent in the latest quarter or 8 per cent over the latest five quarters&mdash;does this mean that, even without the drought, this recession is still more protracted with four consecutive non-farm GDP falls than the recession in 1982-83 when there were only three?</PARA></TALK.START>

In answer to the earlier part of Senator Brownhill's question, the non-farm growth figures in the national accounts for the September quarter were not out of line with the Budget forecast and with the sort of figures one would expect. It is certainly true that the fall in farm growth pulled down those figures. While the drought may have contributed to that fall in farm growth, I think it has been on a downward trend for some period earlier than the effects of the drought would indicate. For example, wool sales, sales of a number of other rural commodities and so on, both in terms of prices and volumes, have been down, mostly related to questions of access to international markets for exports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot said that it had nothing to do with the dispute. I do have some figures: at the end of the recent dispute, there were 17,758 claims outstanding in Queensland. As at last night, there were 11,469 claims outstanding. That is a 35 per cent reduction in the backlog in 10 working days. I believe that is a great effort by DVA staff to return the claims processing to what I am informed is a normal processing period of seven to 10 working days&mdash;a fortnight. Certainly, it is hoped that the backlog will be cleared by 20 December in Queensland. I would think that the specialists who communicated their concern to Senator Kernot may have been caught up in the dispute, although she says that that is not so. But if there was a problem, they should communicate with the Brisbane office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and have the matter resolved that way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. When will the Minister ask his Department to investigate the anomalies still present with regard to war widows pensions?  There are some 34,000 war widows aged over 60 receiving up to $53.75 per fortnight less than those who have other income equivalent to a war widows pension. There are 8,000 war widows who have rental assistance receiving up to $113.75 per fortnight less than other comparable pensioners. Some 630 war widows with dependent children receive less than comparable civilian widows or single parents. In effect, they receive no compensation for the war caused deaths of their husbands, most of whom served in Vietnam. The social security age pension available to war widows was frozen in 1986, as the Minister would know, at $60.05 per week. This has been whittled away by inflation. Other similar economy measures in the 1986 Budget have since been reversed&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite simply, there would be quite an effect on inflation by the introduction of gap insurance because patient charges and gap insurance are taken into account when compiling the CPI; whereas, where services are bulkbilled and insurance is effected through the taxation system, those matters do not enter into the components that are assessed for CPI purposes. We can be quite sure that the introduction of gap insurance will have an impact on the CPI and will feed into the increases, with all the disastrous consequences which will flow to the Australian community from an increase in the cost of living, in the CPI.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not be contemplating introduction of gap insurance because, quite clearly, it will increase the health care bills for ordinary Australian households&mdash;for all Australians, in effect. Not only will they have to pay the levy of 1.25 per cent on their income; they will also be put in a situation where they virtually have to take out this private gap insurance, because all the pressures will be there to enable people to make a payment when they go to see their doctor, their primary health care giver, their GP, because he will be charging the benchmark AMA schedule fee. There is no doubt about that. The reason he will be charging that AMA schedule fee is that those opposite want to take away the competition&mdash;they will be forbidding, prohibiting, not permitting, a GP to choose to bulkbill those who are not pensioners or card holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation, without that competitive pressure which should come through the marketplace in the provision of services given by GPs, the Australian Medical Association schedule fee will become the benchmark. That particular fee of course will be set by the AMA in association with the private health insurance firms. That is the cosy deal which will be done. Gap insurance is designed to ensure that there is a transfer of money from the pockets of Australians seeking medical help and attention into the pockets of the doctors. Some $900m will be transferred in that way. For those reasons, of course, the Government will not be contemplating the introduction of gap insurance.</PARA>

I have not had a chance to peruse a press release which Senator Patterson apparently refers to. I understand that the reason is that the figures which were first thought to be correct were not a sound foundation for the decision that was taken.

Under the Fightback program announced by the Opposition, the Opposition intends to ensure that community pharmacies are entitled to make Medicare payments to people who present their bills for payment, their receipts from services that they have had at a GP. In that situation, the chemists would need to have a black box in order to check with the Health Insurance Commission as to the eligibility of the person asking for a payment. I would have thought that that is a very privacy intrusive matter. Where there are persons who have had a service and want to be paid by Medicare at the community pharmacy, pharmacists will be in a position to get hold of all of the information relating to the type of service which was provided to them. I believe that that is very privacy intrusive. I will be quite happy to do battle with Senator Patterson on that issue.</PARA>

I will also say a few words about how the current wholesale sales tax regime bears on the operation of the freight service. With a consumption tax, there is a 15 per cent tax on the value added at each stage before the good is received by the consumer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I was asked a question by Senator Reid relating to dead birds that had been found at Parliament House. I have a very long answer. I would like to incorporate it but I do not believe I will get the leave, so I will read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Secretary to the Joint House Department has provided me with the following information. It is a fact that some dead magpies and other birds were found on the weekend, 10 in all, with a further two dead birds found on Wednesday. So as to avoid inconvenience to building users and at a time of low activity, spraying of Malathion and Pennside chemicals, mixed with water, was carried out at 5.30 a.m. last Saturday in the Parliament House courtyards. The building's air-conditioning system is shut down, all intakes and exhausts into the building are covered and the chemicals are mixed with water before spraying. Within 15 minutes of spraying the courtyard, watering systems are turned on to water the chemicals down into the soil to attack the major grass pest&mdash;the Argentine stem weevil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately the spraying occurs, insect activity takes place in the grass and thatch layers. Last Saturday morning this activity attracted a number of birds, probably because another major infestation of bogong moths occurred last Friday night. The procedure outlined above has been followed in the past without any noticeable harmful effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When dead birds were found later in the weekend, the Parliament House gardening staff collected the birds and sought the assistance of the ACT Parks and Conservation Service. Autopsies carried out on the birds suggest that they died as a result of eating black beetles stirred up to the surface of the grass layer by the spraying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Secretary to the Joint House Department is most concerned about what has happened and has directed that all steps be taken to prevent a recurrence. To this end, the Parliament House gardening section is investigating all aspects of the matter with the CSIRO, the Australian Turf Grass Research Institute and the ACT Parks and Conservation Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Secretary has also pointed out that the Department has a strong record in terms of environmental protection. In fact, in the peripheral landscape zone of the building&mdash;that is, outside Parliament Drive&mdash;no spraying takes place at all and the area is left to natural controls even though at times considerable damage is caused in the area by insect pests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Spraying does take place, however, in the grass areas of the landscape with the principal pest being the Argentine stem weevil which can destroy hectares of grass in a few weeks. However, spraying for this pest is done only on demand. That is, it is carried out only when testing shows that the weevil is becoming active. The chemicals used, malathion and pennside, are two of the registered chemicals for control of the weevil and are of a lower toxicity than a number of other chemicals that can be used. All spraying is done in accordance with the ACT Pesticides Act and the Dangerous Goods Act of the ACT. These chemicals are used throughout the Canberra environment to control the weevil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint House Department has for the last couple of months, in conjunction with expert consultants, been carrying out an environmental audit of its activities in Parliament House. That report is soon to be presented to the Department. The Secretary informs me that in a briefing from the consultants he was advised that the Department already had in place very good environmental controls. Nevertheless, this incident and anything arising from the environmental audit will be examined very closely to ensure as far as possible that Parliament House and its environs are safe, not only for humans but also for birds, animal and plant life.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the statement that you have made is interesting and, in one particular respect at least, seems very different from the stories that many of us have heard about what occurred last weekend in relation to the number of birds which have been found dead. Certainly the advice that I have received is that it was considerably more than 12, but I do not challenge that as the figure you have been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that, if 12 birds were found dead within the courtyards of this building, it is nothing compared with the number that would be found dead further away from the building as being birds that have been here and have left the area. Those that have died and have been found here are obviously those that lived in the courtyards. For that reason I find it absolutely astonishing that it is only 12, because everybody knows that far more than that have been living around the internal courtyards of this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the rest of them?  They are not there now. None of us have seen birds there this week and we are very conscious of the fact that they have gone. I am told that, depending on the substance used, it could be up to three months before its effects have gone. Any birds that do come back now risk the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I would like to ask is: why do they not concentrate on using more natural remedies for dealing with the Argentine beetle at the weevil stage?  If the lawns were sprayed with a mixture of eucalyptus, sawdust and molasses, the weevil would come to the surface of the lawn to eat that substance and then would be devoured by the magpies which are their greatest natural predator&mdash;if the magpies were there. We should be encouraging the magpies to come into the area so that these pests would be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that most of us cannot see all the other predators of the weevil that have also been killed as a result of this method of treating the Argentine weevil. Other insects and creatures around the lawn would also have been killed, which we cannot see and which cannot be collected in the same way as a dead magpie. There are other remedies as well&mdash;a mixture of one part molasses to 10 parts water is one. It is not a permanent cure, but it does have an effect on the beetles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you have referred to a number of things. I wonder whether we can be told of the chemicals which are used around this building and whether the audit report you referred to will be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One disturbing aspect was that I am told there was a Christmas party held on the lawns near the staff cafeteria on Saturday afternoon of last week, and those who partook of that were not informed that this chemical had been sprayed on those lawns earlier the same day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that we ought to take a much greater interest in the chemicals that are used around here, especially in the courtyards. It may well be that the doors were closed and the air intakes for the air-conditioners were covered for that period of time, but do we have an assurance that that period of time is adequate for the effects of this chemical to dissipate? Why not put in feeder tables to encourage more birds so that the weevils will be eaten by them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people are disturbed by this. The birds in the courtyard are a significant part of the building and the ecology of the area, and I think this is regrettable, to say the least. I am not for a minute suggesting that what was done was deliberate or that anybody set out to kill the birds, but it is a consequence that we should take notice of and we should look to finding other means of controlling this and other pests. One often sees spraying going on around this place and I would like to know what chemicals are being used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Continuing with the remarks by Senator Reid, I am reminded that it was in 1963, I think, when Rachel Carson wrote her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silent Spring</EMPHASIS>, a very prophetic title, when one recognises the quietness in the courtyards around Parliament House in the last few days, compared with the carolling of magpies and the calls of other birds with which we are familiar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly distressed to learn that so long after the publication of that book&mdash;which, of course, referred specifically to organochlorin pesticides in those days&mdash;other pesticides are now being used without an adequate understanding of their more distant consequences. While I have no knowledge of the particular remedies to which Senator Reid referred, certainly there are more natural pesticides which could be used than these quite toxic pesticides&mdash;malathion, being an organo-phosphate pesticide, is an acutely toxic agent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply comment also that since we have been in this place I have been impressed by the vicious and somewhat ridiculous cycle in which we pour water and fertiliser onto the lawns and, of course, make a lovely and attractive area for beetles and all sorts of other pests. Then we have other large areas of lawns that die because of the infestation of beetles and we have to spray these pesticides&mdash;or that is apparently what has been happening. Then, to repair the damage, we have to pour on more water and more fertiliser. I suspect that if we were a little more frugal with the water and the fertiliser we might have lawns that looked a little more like Australian lawns, with less infestation of pests and less need for the application of these toxic agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly join with Senator Reid in calling for a more comprehensive reporting on just what is used. I certainly enjoin the gardeners and those who are responsible to look at far less toxic agents than agents such as malathion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I also wish to support the motion moved by Senator Reid to take note of your statement. I am disappointed that this matter needed to be raised here. It is a matter which has, of course, concerned many of us. On Tuesday the previous Chairman of the recently concluded Senate Standing Committee on Animal Welfare, Senator Brian Burns, was pleased to sign a letter which Senator Meg Lees and I had addressed to the Secretary of the Joint House Department asking for this matter to be investigated and explored further. I thank Senator Burns for his ready agreement to explore the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Wednesday morning Senator Lees and I were in receipt of a comprehensive briefing from Parliament House staff regarding this matter. I do not say that the answers we were given there are fully satisfactory, but they did follow the lines of the answers that were provided by your recently read statement, Mr President. They were also in general accord with the answers given on an ABC program earlier this morning when Parliament House staff were asked about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what did not satisfy me or Senator Lees at the time was that we were told of a code of practice which had been implemented in this area of the Parliament House gardens. It is manifest that the code of practice, which had been carefully thought out and obviously undertaken with all good intent and purpose, failed due to an inability, after getting rid of the immediate pest, to follow up on any unforeseen consequences. It is those consequences that were not foreseen that we are all worried about today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like Senator Reid, believe that there are many other more natural possibilities which have not been sufficiently explored. I do not know so much about the mixture that Senator Reid was referring to, but I am absolutely certain that there are a number of other remedies which may or may not include the use of detergent, which is a traditional method of relieving Australian lawns of grub pests or other insects that live underground. After something like detergent, soapy water or vinegar and water is applied to the lawn, they are prevented from coming to the surface. Flood irrigation is obviously out of the question here. It may be possible to conduct these activities when bird activity is unlikely to occur, whether that be at night or in a different season. It seems to me that not enough attention has been paid to other possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised a similar matter not so long ago when I drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that last year at about this time the red-headed cockchafer was chased with malathion. The unforeseen consequence of that was that the worm population was found to be dead on the paths around Parliament House. Some short time after that, it was found necessary to aerate the lawns by plugging or coring them&mdash;a function which perhaps the worms would have performed at much less cost. That follows very much the sort of theme Senator Coulter was following&mdash;that our lawns are perhaps pampered to the point where it is very difficult to unpamper them. Perhaps if we followed some of Senator Reid's suggestions, we would find an easier and more economical path to look after our lawns. I support the motion moved by Senator Reid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the March statement this year we announced a number of changes to the anti-dumping system. They were intended to speed up the processing of complaints, to provide better access to the system for agricultural producers and to modify slightly the three-year sunset provision for dumping and countervailing duties. Legislative changes to implement those decisions were made in June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are announcing further changes which will make the Australian anti-dumping system one of the fastest in the world, one which recognises the need for applicants to substantiate a case, provides assistance to all parties and is fair in its judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping occurs when goods are exported at less than their normal value in the exporting country. Normal value is usually the price of like goods sold in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country. Subsidisation occurs when the government of the exporting country pays certain kinds of subsidy, bounty or other assistance on the production, freight or export of goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping and subsidisation are condemned internationally if they cause, or threaten to cause, material injury to the industry producing like goods in the importing country.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective anti-dumping and countervailing measures are necessary to protect Australian industry from injury caused by unfair trading practices. However in taking anti-dumping and countervailing actions there is a need to strike a balance. A balance between providing local producers with effective relief, and ensuring that relief does not unjustifiably impede trade or increase costs to Australian consumers. Anti-dumping decisions require judgements to be made involving a blend of economic and commercial considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has kept Australia's anti-dumping system under examination. In 1988, following a study by Professor F.H. Gruen of the Australian National University, we established an independent Anti-Dumping Authority. The Authority brings economic and commercial expertise to the assessment of material injury to an industry; and a rigorous examination of the link between the alleged dumping and the injury being felt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangements introduced in 1988 the Australian Customs Service has the important role of examining each complaint made and conducting preliminary investigations leading to decisions on whether provisional measures should be put in place. The results of the Customs' preliminary investigation form the basis of information from which the Anti-Dumping Authority commences its own inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For its part the Authority has the roles of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">advising the Minister as to whether or not dumping or countervailing duties should be imposed</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">recommending whether the Minister should revoke a dumping notice or release exporters from undertakings</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reviewing, on request, negative preliminary decisions of the Comptroller General of Customs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">providing the Minister with advice on anti-dumping issues in general.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Authority is independent, its Act requires it to have regard to the Government's intention that anti-dumping duties should not be a substitute for assistance to import competing industry in Australia. Nor should they be used to shield industry from the need to adjust to changing economic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest review has been conducted by officers from my Department, in consultation with Customs and the Authority. The review team consulted widely with the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. It took account of the June 1991 Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology  Inquiry into Australia's Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Legislation, and a recommendation from the Report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review has found that there are many misconceptions and myths about what is dumping and subsidisation, and exactly what is caught by the Anti-Dumping legislation. Both Customs and the Authority have been asked to upgrade their public information activities to dispel some of the myths about dumping. The Government would like to take this opportunity to clear up some of the more common misconceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not all dumping is caught by the legislation. The law provides that anti-dumping action can only be taken when dumping or subsidisation causes, or threatens to cause, material injury to Australian industry producing like goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In September 1990, the Government gave a formal direction to the Authority on how material injury should be assessed. The Direction is consistent with the Government's policy that dumping duties should not be used as a substitute for assistance to local industry, or as protection against international competition. It provides that the Authority should only recommend duties be imposed where, because of dumping or subsidy, the injury which has occurred, or is threatened, is not immaterial, insubstantial or insignificant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government did not impose a quantifiable threshold on the notion of `material' injury. Rather, it chose to provide the Authority with guidance on the circumstances in which injury may be found to be `material' and when it may not. Material injury should only rarely be taken as proven when the Australian industry producing like goods has not suffered, or is not threatened with, a material diminution of profits or when the dumped or subsidised imports do not hold (or threaten to hold) a sufficient share of the Australian market to cause or threaten material injury. During the review, some parties claimed that it is not clear how the material injury test is applied. I propose to write to the Authority and Customs suggesting that particular issues should be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the present state of the law does not prevent the Authority from judging the `materiality' of the injury caused by a given degree of dumping differently, depending on the current economic conditions of the Australian industry suffering the injury. The Authority should be able to find material injury when an industry has experienced a diminution in its rate of growth because of dumping. This can be just as serious to the Australian economy as the movement of an industry from growth to decline. I recognise that such a proposition should be demonstrated by facts rather than assertions that an industry would have been far more prosperous if dumping had not occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly circumstances can arise under which an industry is suffering material injury from any number of causes, making it necessary to make judgements about relative causation. However despite the assertion that is sometimes made, it is not the Government's policy, or the practice of either Customs or the Authority, that dumping must be the sole cause of material injury before action can be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are claims that the period for assessing anti-dumping claims can be considerably shortened. Let me examine the background. Currently, the statutory time limit is 35 days to establish a prima facie case, a further 100 days to reach a preliminary finding and a further 120 days to a final finding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of determining whether the information provided by an applicant would, if substantiated, constitute a prima facie case is not something which can be done overnight. There is a considerable volume of information in an application and it all must be considered properly. In this period interested parties must be identified, a process which takes considerable time. In any event, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  requires that, where a country proposes to begin a subsidy inquiry, it should give reasonable opportunity for consultation with the exporting country. In practice, this is 20 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During a preliminary inquiry leading to a decision to take securities the evidence presented by an applicant about dumping, material injury and causal link must all be verified. Importers and exporters must be given an opportunity to respond to claims made by applicants. Currently, some 40 days is provided to importers and exporters to respond. Then, just as the claims of applicants are verified, the data provided by respondents is verified, usually in their place of business by Australian Customs Representatives overseas or, during time of high workload, by officers sent from Australia. Any statutory time limit short of 100 days for this process is likely to deny applicants and respondents some natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not see any basis for a less rigorous final inquiry by the Authority for which 120 days are currently allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is sometimes claimed that the system cannot deal with threats, either of dumping or of material injury due to dumping. The legislation provides that applications may be based on threats and that, where dumping has occurred, action may be taken to guard against a threat of material injury caused by dumping. Clearly it is more difficult to present facts to support the existence of a threat than to establish that something has already taken place. However the Authority has on several occasions recommended action on the basis of threats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a lack of understanding of the ability of the anti-dumping system to handle cases in which dumping is confined to a specific region of Australia, and causes material injury to that part of the Australian industry located in that region, without directly affecting the rest of the Australian industry. The law allows the Authority to take account of regional injury of this kind and, in appropriate circumstances, to judge such injury to be material to the industry as a whole and recommend action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are conflicting views on the rigour with which Australia conducts dumping investigations and imposes anti-dumping measures. Some argue that measures are put in place too readily, others argue that the burden of proof lies too heavily upon local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are of course arguments from respectable sources that Australia would be better off if it acted only against  predatory dumping. This issue is not new. It was canvassed extensively in the inquiry conducted by Professor Gruen in 1986. The Government's view has not altered. Effective anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements are necessary to protect Australian industry from injury caused by unfair trading practices; but without being an impediment to international trade. I am satisfied that the balance struck is right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent review has not identified the need for a radical change to the present arrangements, but has drawn attention to the need to make some important refinements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government proposes to continue the present Customs/Anti-Dumping Authority structure for investigating claims. We will extend the operation of the Authority by a further 8 years to September 2001. In addition, the following improvements are proposed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum time for initial Customs consideration of applications will be reduced from 35 to 25 days with a consequent reduction, to 125 days (except in unusually difficult cases), in the total time allowed to reach a preliminary finding.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs will be given powers to take reasonable steps during the initial consideration of applications to verify claims and fill gaps in applications using confidential information which was not provided by applicants.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs will be given the power not to accept applications that are not properly documented.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The automatic termination provisions on anti-dumping and countervailing duties will be extended to five years and an  opportunity will be provided for a review prior to automatic termination.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision will be made for suspension of an inquiry at the Minister's discretion upon acceptance of an undertaking, and for investigations to be re-opened if there has been a breach of a price undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will be given discretion in the apportionment of anti-dumping and countervailing duties in cases involving simultaneous dumping and subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new system for the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional resources will be allocated to the Authority and to Customs to enable those organisations to cope with a greatly increased workload and expand the operations of the Customs Business Liaison Unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposes to introduce amendments to the legislation as soon as possible to give effect to these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some industry sectors are particularly concerned with so-called "tender dumping" which involves the loss to overseas suppliers of contracts for plant and equipment offered at allegedly dumped prices. The Minister for Small Business and Customs will exercise his powers under Section 9 of the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 and refer the question of "tender dumping" to the Authority for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to outline briefly the reasons for these decisions, starting with our decision to retain the respective roles of Customs and the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the assessment of material injury and causal link must continue to be rigorous. An independent review process and appeal mechanism is essential to an efficient and fair anti-dumping system.  Under the present system Customs undertakes preliminary investigations and the Authority reaches the final finding or, on appeal, reviews the negative Customs decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternative organisational structures, such as those in Canada and the USA which split the assessment of the dumping and material injury issues between two bodies with the Courts acting on appeals, have been considered. It was also suggested that there should be a specialist Tribunal replacing the Federal Court to hear appeals on questions of law as well as merit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is satisfied that the split of responsibilities between Customs and the Authority is appropriate for handling anti-dumping complaints. The mix of economic and commercial considerations associated with a dumping investigation, and the rigorous examination which must precede the imposition of dumping duties, have not been changed since 1988. They remain strong arguments for the maintenance of the Authority as the independent body to advise the relevant Minister on the imposition of duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs and the Authority have established close working arrangements concerning the way cases are investigated and considered. Close liaison at the beginning of an inquiry to determine the methodology of the inquiry will continue throughout the preliminary and final inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to some opinions expressed in the course of the review, the Authority's inquiry is not a duplication of the Customs preliminary inquiry. Rather, it is a rigorous assessment of the facts and issues in a case. It affords importers/exporters and local industry the confidence that advice to the Minister on the imposition of duties for a period of five years is based on a sound analysis of the facts put before both Customs and the Authority. It gives parties the opportunity to present evidence in rebuttal or confirmation of preliminary findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that it is important that the Minister retains the current discretion to accept or reject the recommendations of the Authority. The creation of a specialist Tribunal body with similar expertise to Customs and the Authority to hear appeals on the merits would, we believe, increase the costs to participants. Overall the Government considers that the current organisational arrangements are cost efficient and fair to all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One matter of concern raised by industry and by the Senate Committee is the time involved in initiation of complaints because of the information required by Customs and the subsequent time taken to commence an investigation. The Government believes that this concern has been addressed by the establishment by Customs of a Dumping Business Liaison Unit in March this year. This shopfront advisory service has been very effective in significantly reducing the time spent by applicants in compiling a case. The Government has decided to expand the operations of that unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to 30 per cent of applications were previously rejected by Customs, but there has been a marked improvement in the quality of applications. Nearly all now proceed to investigation. As a result the Government has decided that the maximum time allowed for Customs to reach a prima facie decision will be reduced by a further 10 days to 25 days. This means that the total statutory time limit for ACS investigations up to the point of preliminary findings (when provisional measures can be put in place) has in fact been reduced from 175 days in 1988 to 125 days (or 145 days in the case of complex applications).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia now has one of the fastest administrative processes for handling complaints. By comparison the time limits in the US are 160-210 days to reach a preliminary finding and in Canada, 141-186 days. The EC has no statutory time limits, but I understand it is typical for nine months to elapse between the application and a preliminary finding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that any further reduction in the time allowed for preliminary inquiries would jeopardise the quality of the Customs investigations and its preliminary decisions. It would impede the opportunities for importers and exporters to make submissions and respond to claims of other interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering an application for dumping or countervailing measures, Customs can presently only consider the information provided in the application. This is very limiting as Customs is precluded from verifying any claims made. Applications can, and have, proceeded where it was evident to Customs that a prima facie case did not exist or was doubtful. I propose that the Customs Act 1901 be amended to empower Customs to consider applications critically and to take reasonable steps to verify information, particularly where import data has been suppressed or aggregated on confidentiality grounds. The amendment will also allow Customs, during the initial consideration of an application, to use import data which is not normally available to industry. That data will remain confidential to Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not believe that it should remove the onus on applicants to satisfy the Comptroller that there are reasonable grounds to conduct an inquiry. It does not consider that Customs should supplement an application with information which would normally be available to industry. To assist Customs consideration of applications it is proposed to amend the legislation to make it clear that the Comptroller of Customs may refuse to accept applications that are not properly documented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last financial year, there was a 135% increase in the number of anti-dumping investigations initiated. The figure is likely to remain high this year. This has placed strains on the current resources of Customs and the Authority. As a result of these demands and changes in procedures outlined in this  statement, additional financial and staffing resources will be allocated to these bodies to ensure that the quality of investigations and efficient handling of complaints is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has recognised industry's dissatisfaction, expressed at the Senate hearings and during the review, about the relatively short period that anti-dumping and countervailing provisions are in place. Industry also complained that there is no provision for a review of the duties before they automatically lapse. Accordingly the Government has decided to amend the legislation to extend the sunset period from three years to five years. We will also provide for applications for continuation of the measures to be made before the expiry of the sunset period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation with respect to undertakings is anomalous in that, where undertakings are accepted, consideration of an application is suspended indefinitely. In effect, there is no conclusion to the inquiry and no opportunity to revisit the case if undertakings are to be revoked or extended. The Government will amend the legislation to allow the suspension of a case upon the acceptance of an undertaking until such time as the Minister decides to continue consideration of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also aware that cases involving a combination of dumping and subsidisation have arisen which are difficult to deal with under existing legislation. It is proposed to amend the legislation to provide for the treatment of simultaneous dumping and subsidy cases and to give the Minister discretion in the apportionment of anti-dumping and countervailing duties in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new system for the imposition and collection of anti-dumping and countervailing duties will be introduced. The duty payable will in future be calculated on the basis of :</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the margin of dumping, or the amount of subsidy determined by the Minister subsequent to an inquiry or in a subsequent review; or,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a lesser margin or amount if that lesser margin or amount is determined by the Minister to be sufficient to remove the injury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an administrative review on request by interested parties twelve months after the duties are imposed. If, following the review, it is established that excess duties have been collected during the period of review, the excess will be refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the important part which imports play in our economy and reiterates that it will not see the anti-dumping system used as de facto protection. However, we believe Australian industry will welcome the changes which this Government is now making to the anti-dumping system. The message is clear. We will not allow material injury to local industry from dumped or subsidised goods. We have backed up that statement with a system that is one of the fastest in the world, recognises the need for applicants to substantiate a case, provides appropriate assistance to all parties and is fair in its judgements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's changes are the result of the Anti-Dumping Authority mid-term inquiry promised in the Government's 12 March statement. Before looking at the specific changes proposed, it is worth briefly considering the Government's recent record in this area and the reasons for its latest contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-dumping countervailing procedures were overhauled only a couple of years ago in 1988-89 following a review by Professor Fred Gruen in 1986. Among other things, he called on the Government to ensure that the then inquiry time limits of 55 days for the preliminary inquiry and another 120 days for the final inquiry be strictly enforced and adhered to. Instead, the Government proposed a three-tier inquiry process of 70 days for the prima facie hearing, 180 days for the preliminary inquiry, plus another 120 days for a final investigation by the newly created Anti-Dumping Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During debate in the Senate the coalition was admonished for proposing that at least the first two hearings should be reduced to 55 days and 120 days respectively. Senator Button said that the amendment would lead to it being `much more difficult for the Australian Customs Service to reach the sorts of quality findings it has been reaching in the past'. Fortunately, the amendment was accepted in the Senate, against the Government's wishes, and soon after it became patently clear that even these time constraints were protracted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in March of this year the Government reduced the initial prima facie hearing from 55 days to 35 days and the preliminary inquiry period from 120 days to 100 days. The overall three-stage inquiry process now takes 255 days compared with 295 days under the 1988 legislation, with provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures being available after 135 days&mdash;4 1/2 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government today is proposing a further marginal shortening of this timeframe to 245 days with a 10-day reduction in the prima facie hearing from 35 days to 25 days. In the coalition's view, this change, whilst in the right direction&mdash;and acknowledged as such&mdash;still does not go far enough. Our original scepticism of the Government's position a couple of years ago has been vindicated. Slowly the Government has inched towards our position and we believe it will be compelled to continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button's comment today that `any further reduction in the time allowed for preliminary inquiries would jeopardise the quality of the Customs investigations and its preliminary decisions', which is on page 10 of the statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), sounds familiar. He made the same response to coalition criticism about the promised 55-day, 180-day preliminary inquiry period in 1988. As we have announced in our Fightback program, the coalition now considers that the prima facie preliminary inquiry period could be shortened to 65 days in normal cases and up to 95 days in abnormal cases without affecting the quality of decisions or straining our commitments under  GATT. These changes would allow provisional measures to be imposed after approximately two months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that in order to meet these stricter deadlines some changes in procedures and resourcing will have to be made. But in the coalition's view, it is essential that, if we are going to have an anti-dumping mechanism, and we believe there must be a mechanism to deal with genuine dumping, it must be effective. To be effective it must have the capacity to deliver determinations and remedies as quickly as possible. That has not been happening. That is as important for importers, who require some certainty, as it is for local producers. There is no point in imposing penalties once the local industry has closed its doors and jobs have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's statement proposes a number of other changes, including the extension of the existing three-year sunset on penalties to five years, which is consistent with the procedures now being adopted by GATT and by member countries to the GATT proposals, with the opportunity for applications for continuation of the measures to be made before expiry of the sunset period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change was recommended after the recent Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into anti-dumping, and was announced as part of the coalition's policy in the Fightback package, released several weeks ago. The Government's decision to pick up this change is welcome because it picks up and endorses the Committee's report and also the coalition's policy direction. The five-year limit brings Australia into line with overseas practice and will give Australian producers some added certainty without making penalties open-ended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other major changes proposed include additional financial and staffing resources for both Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority. That is essential. However, it should not require additional Budget allocations, given reduced complexity of industry protection, et cetera, which will presumably reduce the workload of Customs in other areas and indeed the workload of DITAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be an expansion of the Customs shopfront advisory service. This was recommended by the Senate report. It makes sense to expand advisory and screening services. This will not only help local industry to know where it stands and what its obligations are; it will also facilitate faster inquiry procedures. There will be a granting of greater powers to Customs to access confidential information. This was recommended by the Senate Committee as a means of balancing rights and obligations of the parties in the screening phase of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes to which the Minister has referred include a new system for imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties and provision for the suspension of an inquiry at the Minister's discretion, upon acceptance of an undertaking. Provision for Customs not to accept applications that are not properly documented will be fully considered by the coalition when the legislation becomes available, as will the Government's proposal to extend operation of the Anti-Dumping Authority for a further eight years. Overall, however, these changes suggest that at least the Government, belatedly, is moving in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we need yet more changes to the anti-dumping countervailing arrangements, just three years after major legislative overhaul and some nine months after changes outlined in the 12 March industry statement, indicates that the Government initially got it wrong. It has now been forced to accept, at least to a degree, the direction proposed by the Senate inquiry and the coalition. Of course, it was the coalition which initiated that inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell wants me to ensure that his role in that Senate inquiry is acknowledged, which I gladly do. Dumping policy will always be a vexed issue because there are competing interests, but there is no need for so much indecision about the mechanism itself. Essentially, it must be fair and fast so that both importers and local producers know the rules and act accordingly. Continually changing the rules has merely added to their uncertainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing industry needs in this country at the moment it is some predictability and certainty about actions for the future. In this context, the statement's clarification of some applications of the dumping laws, for example in relation to regional dumping, the threat of dumping and definition of material injury and causation of that injury, is welcome and should help to allay concerns and misunderstandings in the business community. But given the Government's track record, no doubt industry will reserve judgment until the new system is in place and the improvements are tangible and seen to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general summary, the coalition shares the Government's view that we must have an anti-dumping countervailing system in place and that that system must be balanced and fair. Importantly, it must not become a back-door opening for industry protection. That would patently work against the coalition's commitment for negligible assistance by the year 2000, which is a vital element of our blueprint for building a world competitive industry sector in Australia. However, where dumping or subsidisation is taking place, there must be an effective mechanism in place, and we believe our proposals will deliver this more effectively than those proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that the concern from industry about anti-dumping arrangements is a product of the Government's failed industry policy. It has done only the easy side of the reform ledger to date. It has reduced protection, but not much else, which has caused difficulties and major problems for industry in this country. It has failed to deliver on micro-economic reform, industrial relations reform, or taxation reform and reductions. Hence industries' costs are being squeezed and competition tightened. It is not surprising that in these circumstances more and more industries have sought assistance from dumping remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's Fightback program will remove at least $20 billion of business taxes as well as implement comprehensive structural changes and reduce the size of government. That package will give industry an unprecedented opportunity to reduce costs and improve productivity and match and beat fierce international competition. We need to ensure that we put industry in this country on a more equitable footing than it has experienced in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that I speak as a senator from South Australia, which has suffered greatly in the past few years from dumping. The Riverland, unfortunately one of the State's highest areas of unemployment, has just had the huge blow of the closure of a tomato cannery, with the loss of some 100 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.</EMPHASIS> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator OLSEN</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was talking about the effects of dumping, particularly in the Riverland of South Australia, where a cannery recently closed with a loss of some 100 jobs. The reason for that was the dumping of tomatoes. These people have absolutely no hope of finding alternative employment anywhere in South Australia, and they know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I spoke about the region which has one of the highest unemployment levels anywhere in South Australia. That cannery, which successfully supplied the Australian hospitality industry with canned tomatoes, can no longer compete with canned tomatoes dumped from Italy, Portugal, Thailand and eastern Europe. Some 46 per cent of canned tomatoes now sold in Australia are dumped. South Australia bore much of the brunt of the dumped orange juice concentrate from South America, and particularly from Brazil. Now we have to contend with dumped peaches and pears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this report indicates that the Government is belatedly willing to move part-way in the right direction to deal with the problem&mdash;I certainly acknowledge that&mdash;there is a massive human element to the dumping problem which this report does not allude to. Dumping eradicates Australian jobs as surely as the Hawke Government's recession that we had to have has done. This has occurred in the factories, the farms and across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement, despite its points of worth, is a very clinical document. It makes no attempt to assess and deal with recent industry comment that eradicating dumping could well reduce Australia's unemployment rate by as much as one-third. Even taking into consideration that this may be an industry exaggeration brought about by deep concern, the Minister's statement is remiss in that it pays no attention to such claims, either to mollify the accusers or to give them credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last count, the industry in the Riverland believed that dumping had cost well over 1,500 jobs in that one tiny pocket of South Australia, not to mention the added human cost of failed businesses. When multiplied across Australia, this is no small problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which investigated the anti-dumping crisis in Australia, I conclude by saying that I am overall most disappointed with the Minister's statement. I have given recognition to its good points but I have to ask why this Government has always had to be led almost screaming to deal with the issue and why it resists delivering all that is necessary when it is necessary and not months and years too late. I would like to know why it consistently turns its back on the worst element of anti-dumping, unemployment. For every product that is dumped in Australia there are Australian companies and individuals having to cut back or halt their production in the face of a marketplace which naturally will choose the cheaper products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's statement does not indicate Government determination to eradicate this industry and social problem. I acknowledge that the Government is at least moving in the right direction, albeit belatedly. However, it needs to take greater account of the human cost of dumping in Australia. </PARA>

I brought the problem to the Senate and moved a motion to refer this matter to the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are faced with a situation of massive subsidies, leading to world overproduction, the flooding of world markets and world prices being pushed down below the cost of production both here and in the subsidising countries.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those countries supported by subsidies, unrealistic world prices do not matter as they are protected by their domestic price. But in Australia, where the industry has no assistance to back up its continued survival, the low world prices which have become the domestic price have devastated many of our rural industries and have cost thousands of jobs in the horticulture, wheat and sugar industries. They are all innocent victims of world subsidies gone mad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry knows that anti-dumping is not the solution. This Government should know it too, particularly with no corresponding tax and micro-economic reforms. Many actions over many years costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have been launched. Meanwhile, imports have flooded into Australia. The tomato growing industry has lost 40 per cent of its market to subsidised imports, the canned peaches and pears industry has lost 40 per cent and the pineapple industry has lost 25 per cent of its domestic market. All processors are suffering. It does not matter whether it is peaches, pears, apricots or beans&mdash;they are all subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers are forced to meet the competing lower prices of the import below production costs. But no industry can survive for long on that basis. Some processors, reeling from massive debt levels, have stated that they will no longer source some products from Australia.

It has nominated those products as tomatoes, potatoes, asparagus and corn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While appreciating that commercial decisions have to be made, we have reached the ridiculous situation in Australia where our efficient farmers cannot even get their products canned here because the Government has allowed the situation to develop where subsidised imports replace our own.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World subsidies gone mad have led to efficient Australian farmers and processors being run out of business because of totally unfair trading practices. Subsidies and guaranteed domestic prices protect and encourage our overseas competitors. The EC tomato industry is paid a subsidy of $425 a tonne. These same cheap subsidised EC products flood into Australia, reducing our growers' price&mdash;in the case of tomatoes, to $109 per tonne. The Italians and other members of the EC get $425 a tonne for their tomatoes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs will now be able to supply confidential import information for the application form&mdash;a recommendation of the Senate inquiry and a very good one. The onus of proof for grounds for an inquiry still stays with the applicant. I am pleased that the Government has picked up the Senate recommendation to extend duties for five years with a review prior to termination&mdash;another very good recommendation&mdash;rather than the present ridiculous situation where the duties are removed after three years and injury has to occur all over again before another expensive, long action can be brought to prove duties should go on again, at a cost of sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars. </PARA>

The Minister has stated that he proposes to write to the Authority and Customs suggesting what particular issues should be taken into consideration. I tell the Minister that the formula has not worked in the past, with only three successful cases last year. Relying on anti-dumping will not work, not when we are up against the rest of the world subsidising by $385 billion a year. The Government has given away every bargaining chip that we have ever had in the pack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Blewett has volunteered everything on behalf of our farmers. We have bent over backwards to be the whitest knight in the free trade tournament. We have got nothing back in return. I accept that we are locked into the Uruguay Round. We put so much into it and we must stay the distance for the next three months. But we do not have to deceive ourselves that our anti-dumping laws will defend Australian industry against an avalanche of subsidised and dumped imports. To use anti-dumping to stop subsidised imports coming into Australia is like trying to stop a bulldozer with a flyswat. The world must split its sides laughing when it sees Dr Blewett giving away more and more and no-one does the same. </PARA>

We have nothing left to give away and we have received nothing back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia becomes a further victim in its best export market when the United States cuts the beef quota this year using its protection measures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the case against imported peaches and pears from Spain and Greece. The case has so far taken 19 months. A final decision will not be made until January. The case has already cost the fruit growing industry in Australia $190,000, at a time of very depressed markets. In the first hearing Customs found dumping and subsidies existed, profit losses of 59 per cent for peaches and 38 per cent for pears, and job losses in the industry&mdash;yet no causal link was found. The case then had to be appealed to the Anti-Dumping Authority. The Minister's statement does not deal at all with the stumbling block of causal link between the dumping or subsidy and the injury. How can we bring an anti-dumping action when our industries are forced to sell at a low world price which is, in fact, a dumped price?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the sugar industry. I would like the Australian Democrats to listen to this. The sugar industry presently has to accept the corrupt world price of $230 per tonne, below the cost of production in Australia. This is all in a world scene where sugar exporters subsidise their producers. The United States subsidises its producers to 23c per pound, when the corrupt world price is 7.5c per pound. Thailand has a domestic price of $447 a tonne and the EC a domestic price of $551 per tonne. The Australian producer is forced to take a world corrupt price of $230 a tonne&mdash;8c a pound&mdash;which is lower than the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If world price sugar is imported to Australia, how can we challenge it when we are forced to sell our product at a dumped world price&mdash;under the cost of production&mdash;to meet world corrupt markets? That is a question that Senator Button has to answer. But it is not only the producer who is a loser; all Australians lose. </PARA>

Maybe Dr Blewett could take a few photostat copies and send the rules to other countries, because it seems that Australia is the only country that is playing by the GATT rules. We do not want to be the only country playing by those rules. If it is fair for us to do it, it should be fair for every other country. No other country keeps to the strict letter of the law of the GATT rules as we do&mdash;and it has cost us plenty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, with farmers and industry, am pleased that the Government picked up the terms of reference of the Senate committee and introduced the three changes in the March industry statement; that is, shortening the time period from 295 days to 255 days, extending actions to farmers, and applying duties for a full three years. These further changes announced today should help, but the Government cannot kid itself about our anti-dumping laws. It must be realistic; blind faith is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian industries are being wounded by subsidised imports. Australian farmers have reached a crisis point through having to accept world prices corrupted by subsidies way below the real cost of production. The Government's changes will improve the anti-dumping system; but, no matter how many patches and bandages the system is given, it will never hold back the flood of unfairly traded imports. No-one likes tariffs, but the Government's system of relying totally on anti-dumping will not work. The option is a variable levy that catches subsidies on imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world protection level has risen by 48 per cent over the last 10 years, creating annual subsidies of $385 billion and distorting world trade and world prices. The Government must realise that this is what our farmers and processors are competing against. It cannot afford to keep its head in the sand any longer. It cannot keep reducing tariffs on our agricultural products&mdash;to zero by 1996&mdash;when the rest of the world is increasing subsidies by 48 per cent and Australia has reduced tariff levels by 60 per cent. That is just burying our head in the sand up to our shoulders. A crisis point has been reached that anti-dumping laws can only dint but not attack. We must stand up for our farmers and processors. We cannot stand by and let everything they have built up in the agricultural sector over the history of Australia go down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this ministerial statement. It goes some way to helping the farmers, but it puts a total reliance on anti-dumping. That is just not realistic, and I have explained why in my speech. I will go along with it for three months but, if the Uruguay Round fails, Australia definitely has to come up with some fall back position. If Australia does not, we will not have a rural industry left, we will not have a horticultural industry left, and we will not have a dairying industry left&mdash;but we will have a lot more people unemployed. So let us see what the Uruguay Round brings. But if it does not bring some meaningful cuts in protection and subsidies, let us be realistic and not bury our heads in the sand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also support the statement made by Senator Button, pitiful though it is. It is a case of `a little bit is better than nothing at all'. His statement shows that the Government, ever so belatedly but, nevertheless, importantly, is doing something about anti-dumping measures. I wish Senator Button had stolen a little more of the Fightback package and taken our proposals for anti-dumping, the proposals enunciated by Dr Hewson, which will substantially ease Australian manufacturers' ability to bring anti-dumping actions, should it become necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has pinched the abolition of the coal export levy from our Fightback package, as it will no doubt take more of our package. I congratulate it for that; I just wish it would take the lot. Senator Ray understands what a great package it is. I know he would like to implement the lot of it. I think he was one of those who supported the consumption tax back in 1985. It is just a pity that he, Senator Button and Mr Keating, the now discredited former Treasurer, did not have the courage of their convictions back in 1985 and did not introduce the package that we are proposing. I invite the Government not just to steal some of the package but to steal the lot. However, I wish it had looked a little more at our proposals on the anti-dumping reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping is a very complex matter which I do not even pretend to understand fully. In travelling in my electorate of Queensland in recent months, I was favoured by being able to look through the sodium cyanide plant constructed by ICI at Yarwun, near Gladstone &mdash;a very exciting project, a plant that was built using the latest technology and all Australian materials, sources and resources to produce high grade sodium cyanide. ICI entered into this field because, in the past, overseas companies brought in most of the commodity. I do not want to be held to these figures, because I am not sure of their accuracy, but something like $2,200 a tonne was being charged for sodium cyanide which was being imported to Australia by Dupont from America, by I.G. Farben, I think, from Germany, and by companies from several other overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ICI built this plant, which is an exceptionally good plant. Its work force is working very happily under a section 115 agreement. That agreement is not as good as the enterprise bargaining agreements we propose for the work force, but it is as good as this Government will ever do, it is working well and it is a very efficient plant. ICI started producing the commodity at about $1,600 a tonne, I think&mdash;quite substantially undercutting the imported product and still making a good profit. Lo and behold, not long after that, the overseas competitors suddenly found it within their power to sell the product at less than $1,600 a tonne&mdash;from memory, something like $1,400 a tonne. They were charging the lesser rate to put the Australian industry out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very expensive anti-dumping action was mounted which required a lot of overseas investigation to get particulars of the costs and the prices at which the product was being sold overseas as compared with what it was being sold for here. The action was taken to Customs, which agreed, over a lengthy period of time&mdash;as it is able to do these days&mdash;that there was a prima facie case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action then went before the Anti-Dumping Authority and, again&mdash;I understand from the people involved&mdash;a very expensive proceeding ensued. The Anti-Dumping Authority then determined that the product was being dumped in Australia, from all sources. It decided to impose anti-dumping duties on the European and Asian importers, as I understand, but not on the biggest importer, Dupont. I believe that the reason for this was that Dupont said that if it had done it before it was sorry and it was not going to do it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that action was taken and no anti-dumping duties were imposed. That means that we rely on the word of an international giant not to compete unfairly with the Australian industry. There is no worry about fair competition, but the dumping of Dupont's product was found to be unfair. It guaranteed it would not do it in the future, but there is no bond taken, no penalties taken, in the event it breaks its word. There is just no back-up for this type of thing. We rely on the company's good word after it has already tried to put the Australian industry out of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be absolutely ridiculous that that sort of thing should be allowed to happen. If it does happen again the Australian-managed company which runs the plant at Gladstone will have to go through all that all over again. It will have to start its investigations, take its action and prove its case before it can get any relief. That seems to be quite a ridiculous situation and I had hoped that Senator Button's statement would have addressed that type of thing a little more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the comments of the previous speaker, Senator Boswell, regarding the sugar industry. Head to head, the Australian sugar industry will compete with any sugar industry around the world. I do not care whether it is a country which has cheap labour or even slave labour; it will not produce a tonne of sugar cheaper than the Australian industry will. So there is no fear within Australia of any imported sugar competing against the home-grown product, because the Australian industry is the most efficient. It will produce the cheapest and best sugar going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But imported sugar is coming into Australia. It is only in small quantities at the moment, but it is coming from countries which have a heavily subsidised sugar industry and a heavily subsidised means of production. I also suspect that it is being sold here cheaper than the cost of that heavily subsidised production in the country of origin. That is fairly well understood; I do not think there is any argument about it. But getting around to proving it&mdash;actually getting the evidence and following the trail of sugar and sugar commodities as they move around the world to the markets, brokers and international selling rooms&mdash;is a very difficult and expensive process. It is very time consuming, and the Australian sugar industry really does not have the money or the expertise to follow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That throws up a very big problem for the Australian sugar industry. It has to decide whether to just let this sugar come into Australia unchallenged or whether to set aside the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would be necessary in order to mount an anti-dumping action. It then has to wait for this enormous amount of time before it can do something about it and even then it cannot be guaranteed&mdash;particularly under this Government&mdash;that the results will be enforced when it gets there. They are some problems which should be looked at very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Australian exporters are also having a lot of trouble with their operations. Under this Government, the wholesale sales tax adds, according to Senator Button's departmental advisers, some 5 per cent to their cost of export. As I commenced by saying, if the Government or Senator Ray were prepared to adopt some of the proposals we have suggested in the Fightback package&mdash;he can have them; it will not be stealing; we will give them to him&mdash;then we would not have that sort of impost on exporters. If the Government were to adopt our form of GST, then the wholesale sales tax would be wiped completely and no GST would be imposed; it would be zero-rated for GST. Our exporters would then be able to compete on a par with their overseas competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very important to a town like Mount Isa, which is located in the area where I come from. It exports a lot of goods. The cutting of the wholesale sales tax on the things that the townspeople import, and in fact on all of the things that they use in their production process, would mean an enormous boost to the mining operation and to the community. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about Mount Isa and the Fightback package leads me to another matter which I want to raise briefly. It is a very sad day for Australian democracy when a Federal parliamentarian attempts to intimidate, or goes ahead and intimidates, the people of Queensland because they are attempting to have a say about a political matter. It has recently been brought to my notice that the ALP member for Kennedy, Mr Rob Hulls, attempted to intimidate someone in Mount Isa who wanted to take part in the GST debate, who wanted to raise this issue&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. If we can get down to that it will be a vast improvement on what we have had to date. I welcome the present cut but it is nowhere near enough. The present situation with a maximum of 245 days is okay for the bigger, stronger, widespread year-round sort of industry, but it is the small seasonal industries that are very much reliant on the weather which the anti-dumping measures need to protect. Those industries mainly lie in the horticultural section where there is one small crop all over Australia which may be harvested in a matter of three to four weeks or even less. Where a dumper comes in from Argentina, Brazil, Chile or any of those South American countries&mdash;Spain has also been mentioned&mdash;that industry can be wrecked in a matter of a few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-dumping measures should have a bond on them. A company should sign a bond to say that it will not kill off the industry. If the industry is killed off, and there is a penalty, that bond could then be distributed down the line to the industry. There is no such measure. A small industry can be wrecked in three or four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens then?  The next year the growers in that small industry have been driven out of business and they are not there to provide the crop; they have gone. One of two things can happen. The following year the dumping company&mdash;from Argentina or anywhere like that&mdash;may not have the production to dump in Australia; it will go somewhere else. It might have to satisfy its home market or the market next door. The company will not be able to provide the goods. The prices in that small industry in Australia will go through the roof. For example, the price of strawberries could multiply three times because our anti-dumping regulations do not allow a quick action to be brought on to keep that industry going. I believe in competition. I am in the agricultural industry. We have a lot of competition. I do not mind competition, but I believe in fair competition. Even though the Government has gone a small way towards cutting down dumping, it has not gone far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For only the second time in living memory Australia will be importing wheat. As I said earlier, I do not mind competition, but we should compete on a level playing field. I am sick and tired of hearing about a `level playing field', but I suppose I will use the phrase until we coin another one. When subsidised wheat comes into Australia to make up for what we have not grown, the injury is greater still. I do not mind competition, but that is what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The killing off of these industries will reflect on the balance of payments. We have to watch for that in Australia. If we cannot do anything further to put this situation right, we have to make sure that the agricultural producers, manufacturers and so on are able to compete internationally. This is covered in the Hewson package. We can do that by cutting the cost at the base: the manufacturing cost, the growing cost and so on. The Hewson package will remove all taxes on exports to the tune of $1.7 billion, which will give us a chance to compete internationally and get this country moving again. In short, I welcome the small measure which is to be introduced on anti-dumping, but it does not go far enough. For many industries, it will be too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the statement of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on the review of Australia's anti-dumping system. I have had a chance to look at the statement only very superficially. Dumping legislation has been an interest of mine for some years. It is an extraordinarily complex subject; there is no simple approach to it. Dumping is an essential subject. There is almost nothing that is made in this world of which a few more thousand units cannot be made at very little extra cost of production. They can then literally be dumped on a market in another country just to clear them. Of course, that could be done either for simple gain or to completely destroy an industry which is dependent on limited runs, particularly if enough product is put into a country with a small population, such as Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point that it is an extraordinarily complex field to get into. It is very easy to claim outrageously that a product is coming in here and being dumped. The definition of dumping, quite simply, is a product sold in another country for a price that is less than its normal sale price in the country of origin. It is often very difficult to prove that. If I have a criticism that I can encapsulate in a few words about Australian anti-dumping legislation, it is that it is eminently far too fair. It really does give the benefit to the importers, as opposed to Australian industry. If there is doubt about dumping, I would certainly give the benefit of the doubt to the local company rather than the importers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move briefly through the Minister's statement. The first point that the Minister makes on the top of page 4 is that not all dumping is caught by legislation. That is perfectly true. Countervailing duties and their legislative base is only one of the devices that can be used to protect home production in a country. In Australia we tend to operate closely with that as our means of controlling imports, whereas other countries use a lot of quite absurd and covert means of stopping importation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in Malaysia once when it was the Chinese New Year. The Chinese like oranges for the New Year. There is no embargo on oranges coming into Malaysia. Some Chinese merchant bought a whole heap of oranges in Singapore, loaded them on semi-trailers and drove across the causeway. Then he found that it took him six days or 12 days, in a tropical climate, to clear his paperwork. There was nothing wrong; it just took a little while to understand the paperwork. Of course, the oranges had to be dumped and the New Year passed. That might be a humorous example&mdash;if one is not the Chinese merchant involved&mdash;but it is the way a lot of the trade around the world is done. What is on paper, what is open and in full public view, is not necessarily the only impediment to trade. We can pretty fairly make the case in Australia that we do try to put our legislation, our tariffs and our dumping procedures in full view and rely on those and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next paragraph of the statement the Minister makes the claim that damage to industry is not immaterial, insubstantial or insignificant. That is putting it in lawyers' definitions. The real world is a little different. In the next paragraph he talks about proposing to write to the Authority and Customs, suggesting that particular issues should be taken into consideration. That is a bit of a weak response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister then goes on to make the claim that it is only necessary to show that there has been a decline in growth of an industry; we do not have to show, within the classical definition, that there has been a loss of market share within the country. If production which was increasing has decreased a bit, that may prove the case. That is an interesting interpretation. It may be possible to put that interpretation on the current legislation, but I would not advise anyone to spend much time trying to prove it, because the counterclaim would be made quite readily that we have an industry downturn. It is the industry downturn that is causing the problem, not competition from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most vexed points is the period of inquiry. We have a current statutory limit of 35 days for a prima facie case, 100 days to reach a preliminary finding and a further 120 days, which comes to about 255 days. That has been reduced by about 10 days so that 35 comes down to 25. It is a very long time. Most of a year has gone before we can prove a case. An awful lot of product can come into a country in that time and destroy a market, particularly where margins are tight, as at present, and companies cannot operate on low margins for very long. The Minister defends this when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any statutory time limit short of 100 days for this process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>talking about the preliminary finding case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is likely to deny applicants and respondents some natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA>I just wish the Minister would extend the same sort of natural justice to the Opposition that he seems to extend to importers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the report goes on with very fine sentiments, but a lot of it turns on this underlying belief in fairness. I make no apology for the fact that I think, if there is fairness involved, the benefit of that fairness has to go to our local producers, not to people overseas. We bend over backwards to be able to defend impeccably in any court any action we take. In the process we let a lot of product come into this country that would not get past similar barriers in another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza was talking about primary production and the importation of wheat. There is a great deal of concern in the community about the fact that we now import somewhere near $2.2 billion worth of foodstuffs a year. I would certainly like to see that stopped because there is nothing that we import that we cannot produce here. We can certainly live without the few lines like caviar and the rest of it for a few years until we get our balance of payments position right. If we could cut back $2.2 billion a year we would go pretty close to saving two months of balance of payments deficit. It really is quite a considerable and a very attractive goal to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as I said in this chamber last Thursday, while I think the Australian producers are very good, the marketing of Australian foodstuffs and the packaging and the promotion of them are often not up to world standard. That is certainly not true in all cases, but the test that I apply is to go round the supermarkets of the world and look at the shelves and see how much Australian product is on them. I can tell honourable senators that, if they go around the Asian and European capitals, they will find very little Australian produced foodstuffs on the shelves, whereas pretty well most of the other countries will be represented. The simple conclusion that we must draw from that is that the Australian product, while it might be of high quality, is simply not packed in a modern and attractive way, and it certainly is not promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few words, I accept the report. I do not think it really goes far enough. I would like to see it taken a bit further. I would like to see a bit more steel put into it, but it is an improvement on what we had before. </PARA>

There is nothing that will rile people, the consumers, more than seeing Australian products and Australian goods undercut, totally unfairly, and destroyed, because, whilst in the short term they benefit by dumping, in the long term they pay the price. That has happened quite often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to respond to a couple of points. Senator Panizza says that I personally have no interest in rural affairs. That is very hurtful. I hope he is watching on television right now. That is a very hurtful statement. I take a great interest in rural affairs, and the absolutely infamous senatorial tours around rural Victoria of a few years ago are testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have some problems in this area with GATT&mdash;as I think most fair people in the chamber would acknowledge&mdash;of trying continually to free up trade and to allow for some rational reform. Senator MacGibbon and many other people have seen other methods that can be used to stop the import of goods. One can insist that certain goods land in the middle of the country and then put one official on the gate who lets one car through a day or something. These are the sorts of practices that we are trying to expunge from the international scene long term. But if we get up to it ourselves we will lose all credibility. There is a line, however, that has to be drawn to make sure that we do protect people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note for the record that in about 1982 I remember looking at anti-dumping and the record of the Fraser Government. It was nowhere near as good as this Government's record, nor was it on tariff reform or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald got a bit excited about the Fightback package, so I will not go into that much. He said there was a great anti-dumping section in it. I just ask how many extra public servants will be employed under that, seeing the Opposition is going to sack about 20 per cent of the Public Service in the three years of its first government. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. But that is not surprising. I do not expect trained lawyers to understand economics.

<PARA>I will bring a few matters in this report to the attention of the Senate. The 1990-91 financial year saw a significant increase in R &amp; D expenditure by the Corporation from just over $2m in 1989-90 to $5.2m. I commend the Corporation on that because R &amp; D is a very important part of any of our industries. Some 239 projects in a broad spectrum of horticultural crops and production regions received financial support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary levies still comprise the main source of industry funding. However, the proportion is declining from 86 per cent in 1989-90 to 74 per cent in 1990-91 in favour of statutory levies which are more equitable and provide a sounder basis for planning and implementation of agreed ongoing programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to impose statutory levies is most commendable and shows a responsible attitude by the industry. I think the HRDC is to be commended for deliberately adopting a `lean ship' policy during its establishment phase because of the uncertainties as to the level of funding that would be received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the research that the Corporation has undertaken is a step in the right direction. Among the highlights of the R&amp;D program is work in the apple and pear area with a complementary disease resistant program at the Granite Belt Horticultural Research Station, which is now concentrating on producing apple scab and powdery mildew resistant seedlings. This is a step in the right direction. A unique project at Batlow dealing with apple pest management on a whole district basis is aimed at minimising pesticide use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An instance of pesticide use was talked about in the Senate this afternoon. I notice that a lot of magpies were back around Parliament House tonight. I think this is a great thing. We do not want to jump to too many conclusions too quickly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supervised pest control is being used with populations of all major pests and the incidence of major disease is monitored by pest management scouts. I think that is a great thing for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of predators to control pests was mentioned today when we were talking about the spraying of the grass around Parliament House. The point should be made that birds can eat only a certain amount of pests&mdash;they cannot eat every pest. The horticultural industry is doing something about this problem. A wide range of beneficial agents has been found since monitoring began. Spiders and ants have emerged as two major groups of predators in banana plantations. Predators can do a great deal of good at the same time as allowing industry to reduce its use of chemicals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last session the Government brought legislation into this chamber which had been brewing away for some time. In fact, Dr Blewett proposed a system whereby pharmacists would be required to use a compulsory transmission system, a computer system, to check the eligibility of Australian citizens for pharmaceutical benefits. Because of the concerns that were expressed by the Privacy Commissioner during the election campaign, or about that time, Minister Blewett withdrew the suggestion. But, as many of these things are inclined to do, after the election when the public has been hoodwinked by the Labor Government, back comes the insidious black box proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation came before this chamber and was sent off to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration because the coalition had very grave doubts about the estimates of the savings that would be made, the figures that were being used in those estimates, and the justification that was being given for those estimates. The legislation went off to the Committee and, after that, we were even more concerned about the fact that people were going to give up an enormous amount of liberty and privacy for what were likely to be very small savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government told us that if we did not do what it said there would be enormous problems. I remember that night well. It was very late. The Government used standover tactics to the effect that if the legislation was not brought in there would be a disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson has just said that some staff were told what would happen and how my name would be smeared across the nation amongst all pharmacists if we stopped this legislation going through. Despite that, we moved an amendment to the Bill that required an investigation of those estimates. Section (2)(6)(c) of the Act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) the day after a joint inquiry of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General has reported to both Houses of Parliament that the estimated savings contained in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991 are realistic estimates and that equivalent savings could not be obtained through the use of alternative eligibility checking systems which are no more intrusive than the eligibility checking proposals contained in the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Act 1991;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>
<PARA>There is the protection that the Senate placed on that legislation. We needed to be shown and we needed the Government to justify that those estimates on which that proposal was based were appropriate, adequate and right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have before us that report, for which we have all been waiting. It makes very interesting reading. The original estimates for gross savings were: 1991-92, $12m; 1992-93, $34m; 1993-94, $40m; and 1994-95, $40m. The original estimates for net savings were: 1991-92, minus $0.7m; 1992-93, $19.2m; 1993-94, $26.3m; and 1994-95, $25.8m. The Auditor-General's department shows a range of figures for the revised estimates of gross savings. It includes minimum and maximum figures and it gives the assumptions on which these figures are based. Its figures for the gross savings are: 1991-92, minimum $9.1m, maximum $13.6m; 1992-93, $9.7m, maximum $14.5m; 1993-94, minimum $10.7m, maximum $16.1m; 1994-95, minimum $12m, maximum $18m. The net savings figures from the department are: 1991-92, a minimum of minus $3.6m and a maximum of $0.9m; 1992-93, a minimum of minus $5.1m and a maximum of minus $0.3m; 1993-94, a minimum of minus $3m and a maximum of $2.4m; and 1994-95, a minimum of minus $2.2m and a maximum of $3.8m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this were introduced, the maximum loss of net savings would be $13.9m and the maximum gain would be $6.8m&mdash;a far cry from the figures we were given before. Why were these estimates so wrong?  Anyone reading Mr Staples's scurrilous and appallingly inaccurate press release would think it was all the Auditor-General's fault; that it was the Auditor-General who gave him the wrong figures and that is why it was wrong. This has to be one of the worst press releases I have ever seen&mdash;it is so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Auditor-General's department is blamed. When the department first estimated the ongoing savings, it used three figures: the incidence of ineligible claims against the PBS&mdash;people who get a PBS benefit when they are not entitled to it; the number of items processed; and the average value of the claims. The department told us that the incidence of ineligible claims was 4.5 per cent. That was sort of a rough guesstimate. It had a figure of 5.22 per cent that the Audit Office had given after it had investigated people getting benefits when they should not have been. The department admits that it made a sampling error in that. In addition, the Health Insurance Commission had given us an estimate of 3.5 per cent. To estimate the savings it did a rough in-between figure of 4.5 per cent, arrived at by applying a 10 per cent tolerance level to an error rate of 5 per cent and taking the lower of the two figures. It was like thinking of a number between 5.22 and 3.5, dividing it in half, adding on a few, taking some away and ending up with a number. So we started with 4.5 per cent. Both figures were based on inaccurate information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next basis for the estimate was the number of items processed. This has changed because of some government initiatives. Although it may not have been possible to predict exactly, that was not costed in; changes as a result of that budgetary initiative were not taken into account. I suppose that can be excused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next one is totally inexcusable. Mr Staples has the audacity to say, `If any of our figures are wrong, let them address their own problems first'. But this was a very simple problem&mdash;an error that I cannot believe the Department made. It was trying to estimate the average benefit per item that was given to a person who was a social security benefit recipient who received a pharmaceutical benefit. It estimated that it would be $12.50 for each person. But it made an extraordinary error. It forgot that all of us get a benefit for drugs which cost more than $15. In the averaging calculations, it had included the average drugs that a beneficiary received and their price&mdash;not the $15. So, when that was fixed up, the estimate of average benefit was $7.93&mdash;a basic error in estimating the average cost of the drugs that a beneficiary gets. It just forgot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does Minister Staples say that in his press release? No. He blames the Auditor-General's department. Where does the buck stop?  It stops with the Minister. And why did the Minister not ask the questions about these estimates?  If I had been the Minister, I would have said to the Department or the Health Insurance Commission, `Have you doubled checked these?  Have you triple checked these?  Who else could give us advice?'. A junior in the department should have picked up that error; it is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our privacy and freedom are going to be restricted&mdash;as they have been restricted today already in the Bill that has just been through the Senate earlier&mdash;on the basis of that sort of calculation, that sort of estimate. It is absolutely atrocious. With all due respect, and to give Senator Tate his due, he said in the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the exact order of these,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is as to the level of savings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you would need to have a look at them in a more sophisticated way than simply saying `$40m'.</PARA>
<PARA>He was dead right. We need to look at them in a more sophisticated way&mdash;sophisticated to the extent that we get the figures right in the beginning; that the averages of how much beneficiaries are receiving that they should not be receiving are calculated on an accurate basis. I suggest to Senate Tate that it is not so much a question of being more sophisticated, but of being accurate. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that is what this Committee has done.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, we did not do it. I said in my speech on this Bill that I was concerned that we would not have the opportunity. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately for us, but maybe fortunately for the Government, it will probably be impossible to check the accuracy of the Government's savings estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is because we do not have the resources to do that. But, thank heavens, we have a process and, thank heavens, on that occasion&mdash;although not today&mdash;the Democrats supported us to put this clause in the Bill to stop this going ahead, if it was demonstrated that the Government could not produce the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind all honourable senators that what was involved was that when every single one of us went into the pharmacy to get a scrip we would have to get checked to make sure that we were eligible. This was to be done because we wanted to discover whether there were immigrants and visitors who were getting benefits that they should not have been getting. That is why everyone was being checked. I asked the Department, `How have you assessed the number of immigrants and visitors who are not eligible for pharmaceutical benefits and who are receiving them?', and I asked, `How did you guesstimate that figure?'. Mr Hazell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We assessed that figure at about 200,000 . . . We then assumed that these people would have half the utilisation of drugs as other persons.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Department estimated that the 200,000 people a year who are visitors and immigrants would utilise half the quantity of drugs as other persons.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What rubbish!  My mother is an American citizen. She comes from overseas. She does not come and get drugs here. She brings them with her, as many others would. We know that there are some people who cheat the system. But most visitors would bring their own drugs, unless they get sick here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the hearings of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Mr Hazell from the Department was asked, `How did you guesstimate half?'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was really no base upon which it was done, Senator. We had to assume some level of utilisation rate. We felt that the full rate was certainly not appropriate, and that half was probably a more appropriate figure to work on. But, as there is no data concerning the use by foreign nationals, it required some assumption.</PARA>
<PARA>We have assumptions directly out of the heads of those in the Department. We have figures where they chose to go halfway between the Auditor-General's figure and the Department's figure. We have figures on how much it costs on average for each person who is on benefits to get a scrip, the basis for which was wrong. That is how this Government came to a decision that all citizens in Australia would have to have their card checked when they went into a pharmacy before they would be issued with a scrip. That was the basis of the Government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Government has the hide to go looking into our estimates and our budget for our Fightback package. It ought to be looking in its own backyard to make sure that its estimates are right and are based upon the correct figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his press release, the Minister blames the Auditor; he says it was the Auditor-General's fault. I think I have demonstrated fairly well that the Auditor-General did give a figure for the number of people who were receiving benefits when they were not eligible, but that was done in the context of an examination of the ways in which the Department could make savings. It was beholden upon the Department to examine the basis of that figure and to look at its own. When that was done, and the Auditor-General did that with a sample of 3,700, or whatever the figure is in the report&mdash;a very adequate sample was used&mdash;and looked at the number of people who were likely to be receiving benefits when they were not eligible for them, he came up with a range of 2 to 3 per cent. The Auditor-General said there was a 95 per cent confidence level that the actual error rate was in that range of 2 to 3 per cent&mdash;nothing like the 4.5 per cent guesstimate that the Health Insurance Commission had been using in its estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Staples makes some comment in his press release about how the withdrawal of the black box proposal would affect the coalition's policy in relation to retail pharmacists acting as agents for Medicare. He said that one of the things we have not done is consult the Privacy Commissioner. That caused me to laugh because we find&mdash;as I think I mentioned earlier&mdash;that, when Dr Blewett was proposing this, he was forced to abort the scheme when the Privacy Commissioner registered his significant concerns about the possible ramifications of such a system. The Privacy Commissioner also expressed his concern when it came into the chamber when we were investigating it on the last occasion, because he had not been adequately consulted. So we will not let Mr Staples tell us that we will not consult the Privacy Commissioner when, in fact, the Privacy Commissioner was not consulted properly when this proposal was put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report is an indictment of the Minister, the Health Insurance Commission and the Department of Finance in that they accepted these estimates unquestioningly. To an extent, it is also a criticism of the Audit Office itself in its original estimate of the number of people who were receiving benefits when they were not eligible to receive them; the ANAO admits that. But that is a minor problem when compared with the errors and the sloppiness of the others I have named. But those people are not listed in this appalling and scurrilous press release that the Minister has put out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, I suppose, very sad that people in the Auditor-General's Office have to put up with that sort of blame when the blame really lies in the lap of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that this process has demonstrated the important role that the Senate can play in reviewing and scrutinising legislation and also in calling the Government to account. This is about the interests of every single Australian resident, every single person, who goes into a pharmacist to obtain a pharmaceutical benefit. That includes people who get benefits at a lower rate, politicians and business people. I doubt whether there is anybody who chooses to pay the full rate because they do not want anybody to know. So every single Australian resident will be affected by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber and the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration have worked together to ensure that the interests of the Australian people have been met and that their privacy has been protected. This Government has been shown as the fraud that it is, in that it cannot get the figures right even when simply estimating the average cost of a benefit to a person on social security. The Government got it so wrong. It is a great lesson for us all that we should not take financial estimates at their base value. We should always question policy issues, and especially policy issues which affect the rights and freedoms of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Patterson has made a very thorough speech on this report of the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. As Senator Patterson has stated, this joint review was carried out following concerns expressed in the Parliament regarding the estimates of savings contained in the financial impact statement on the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991. Concerns were expressed about the privacy aspects of the proposed new methods of checking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs that looked into the Bill. We were very concerned about the figures that the Government put forward in its financial impact statement on that legislation. We said time and again that the figures were totally inaccurate. We even put forward options that the Government should follow to correct its estimates. The Committee went into it very thoroughly, and it was as a result of the persistence of the Opposition, and our Committee, that it was finally decided that a review must be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into the detail since Senator Patterson has already done that. To do so will just waste the time of the Senate. But let me make it very clear that the Government's estimates of the net savings in the year 1991-92 were minus $0.7m; in 1992-93, the savings were meant to be $19.2m; in 1993-94, $26.3m; and in 1994-95, $25.8m. That is what the Government said it would save, and that was the excuse used for the black box being introduced into all pharmacies around Australia for pharmaceutical benefits. The Government said there would be no capital cost because all the boxes would be leased; it would be all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Auditor-General reviewed the figures, as requested by us, a range&mdash;a minimum and maximum&mdash;was given for each of those years. The minimum for 1991-92 was not minus $0.7m but minus $3.6m; as a maximum it was $0.9m. For 1992-93 the minimum was not $19.2m but minus $5.1m with a maximum of minus $0.3m&mdash;a loss, not a saving of $19.2m. For the year 1993-94 the Government claimed $26.3m. The Auditor-General's minimum was minus $3m and the maximum was $2.4m, not $26.3m. For 1994-95 the Government estimated a $25.8m saving. The Auditor-General's minimum was minus $2.2m with a maximum of $3.8m. And the Government says it can find holes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the standard of work done by the office of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and his Department, is it any wonder that Mr Howe said on television the other night that, yes, he had made a dreadful mistake when he was criticising the Fightback package; the Department had given him the wrong figures?  The Department has given the Senate and the lower House of the Parliament the wrong figures once again. The figures were so wrong that the Government has been forced to withdraw the legislation altogether. It will not put forward the black box any more. It has withdrawn the whole idea because, if it did not, it would be running at a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the wonderful media release put out by Mr Peter Staples. Just like Mr Howe, he did not take the blame. The buck never stops with the Ministers in this Government. Whom did he blame?  The Auditor-General.  Mr Howe did not blame his office; he blamed the Department. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) does not blame himself or his Department; he blames the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with this Government that it will never accept responsibility?  It is never a Minister's fault;  responsibility is always shoved off to the departments. I do not think that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator McMullan, can possibly expect the Government to get loyalty from the departments while Ministers continually blame them and try a whitewash of their own responsibility. In his press release Mr Staples said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the decision not to proceed with the computer system was based on revised estimates indicating potential savings were not as great as first forecast.</PARA>
<PARA>Not as great!  There will be a loss. The legislation has not been withdrawn because of perhaps a $1m or $2m estimate being incorrectly perceived; it has been withdrawn because the estimates would result in a possible loss, if just a few hundred thousand dollars. The press statement also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Senate hearings, representatives of the Auditor-General stated that the 5.22 per cent figure was, in fact, conservative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the figure for prescriptions that were wrongly claimed. The Minister is blaming the Auditor-General. But it was not just the number of prescriptions that was incorrectly claimed. The Auditor-General was asked by the Opposition to look at other matters, including the incidence of ineligible claims against the PBS, the number of items processed and the average value of items claimed. After each one of those matters were looked at, this report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This resulted in a significant overstatement of the value of ineligible claims. . . .the total error rate reduced from 9.27 per cent to 5.6 per cent and from 5.22 per cent to 2.06 per cent for lapsed entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and tells us that the estimated 72 million pensioners really was not 72 million pensioners, it was more like 67.7 million&mdash;a vast difference.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Patterson has also made very clear, the difference with the $12.5 as an average was really only $7.93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The whole thing is a shambles. The Government goes ahead with legislation such as this without doing proper financial statements. They are so inaccurate that we can pick it up at a glance. We have not had the opportunity or the facilities to do the numbers, but in our Committee, as Senator Patterson said, they were so wrong that we knew at a glance. The pharmacists knew at a glance that the figures were totally wrong. That was why we asked the Auditor-General to go over them and to come up with what the figures were more likely to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a dreadful indictment of the Minister.

She was also concerned about the public relations problems&mdash;particularly those affecting the patients&mdash;and problems that arose as a result of the Government not keeping up its information base as it should, and the consequence and detrimental effect that this would have upon the patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the Government&mdash;indeed, it is a lesson for all Ministers and all government departments&mdash;be much more cautious in the future before presenting shonky figures to this Parliament. I feel confident that under similar circumstances the Senate would again refer such issues for further examination by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that, following a Senate initiated inquiry by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance, the Government's proposal to establish a highly intrusive computer transmission link between pharmacies, the Department of Social Security and the Health Insurance Commission has been scrapped. The figures were shonky. The report revealed that the potential savings were substantially less than the original figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must indicate that the Senate amendment which initiated this inquiry forced a delay in the introduction of this computer system until such time as the real savings in such a process had been established. The report tabled today has vindicated that amendment. Fortunately, the Minister has taken note and scrapped this transmission system with the result that what has become known as the black box is now dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we realise that the Senate debated the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. This is where the problems were first detected. At the time I recall accusing the Government of not having adequately considered the alternative methods of preventing unauthorised claims on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I am pleased that the joint report has addressed some of these other alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also drew attention to some of the inadequate internal auditing procedures that are used by the Department and the Health Insurance Commission. Following those concerns raised during the Committee hearings and within this Parliament, an amendment to the (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill called upon the Government to see that the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance produced a report. This report is the one we have today. Again, it is a vindication of the request that was initiated by the Senate. It highlights the important role of having a House of review, a second opinion and a second opportunity to get out into the community to assess the real problems and to inquire of the pharmacists and of the patients what is really in their best interests and the best way that money can be saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity of acknowledging the role at the time of Senator Tate. Following that debate, he acknowledged that there were some problems with some of the estimates that were put before him at the time. I thank him because he was honest enough to admit that some of the savings, to use his words, were not exactly or precisely known. I believe that even Senator Tate would be rather pleased with the results of that inquiry. The inquiry results in a significant reduction in the original estimates of the savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must emphasise that the error was essentially a departmental one. The mistakes that the Auditor-General's report have revealed reflect very poorly on the Department. Some of them were very elementary errors. They did not recognise certain features. For example, age pensioners tended to have a higher degree of responsibility and honesty than other sections of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross savings from introducing that highly intrusive checking system were estimated at $40m, less an amount of $15m for the ongoing lease of computer equipment. There were even suggestions that we should delay the matter for a year or two, but that delay would have resulted in an up-front cost for leasing this computer equipment. I believe it has been a successful result for the Parliament, for the taxpayers and for pharmacists, but above all for the clients of pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I must emphasise that the inquiry which was conducted jointly by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance to validate the estimated savings significantly reduced those estimates downwards. This would mean gross savings of only between $12m to $18m annually and the cost of supporting the system naturally made it not a viable proposition. So it is not surprising that Minister Staples scrapped the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a relatively short report. I think it is a very good exercise and perhaps the Senate should be using the offices of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General more frequently to substantiate certain Government estimates and claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also notice that the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has been very quick to gloss over this large gap in the estimated savings versus the actual. Instead he has chosen to concentrate on what this finding might mean for the Opposition's Fightback program. I think his press release was in poor taste. It does not address the original concerns. We are indeed pleased that he has scrapped the system, but the manner in which he addressed the question, the manner in which he threw allegations and the manner in which he blamed other people did not reflect all that highly on a Minister whom the community should respect. The Australian public would have been better served if instead the Minister had concentrated on how the Government was going to realise $10m to $18m worth of savings which this report has identified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a victory not just for the structure of the Senate; it is a particular victory for my colleagues Senator Patterson and Senator Walters because they pursued this matter at a time when it was not fashionable. Today we see in the Auditor-General's report the magnitude of the error. The magnitude of the error was not in hundreds of thousands of dollars or even in millions. It was as far as $26m out in the estimates for the year 1993-94, when the Auditor-General reported, in contradistinction to the Department's estimate, that in that period there would be, at the minimum estimate, a loss of $3m and, at the most, a gain of $2.4m. So this was a major error. It cannot be glossed over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon we saw Minister Tate caught quite flat-footed. He had not even seen his own Minister's press release. He had not read the Auditor-General's report. Then, when asked a question by Senator Patterson about this matter, he went on a diatribe about the coalition's health policy, talking about fee structures, which had nothing to do with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It brought home to me the stark contrast between the Government's approach to things and our approach: the contrast between a Government that believed in black boxes and more controls, more government intervention and intrusion into privacy considerations, and the coalition's approach of freedom of choice and assistance to individuals through self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a victory for the coalition. If I may draw the analogy with the black box, it was just another nail in the coffin of the Government. Not only is the Government nailing itself into the coffin, but the wheels are falling off the hearse as well. It has been demonstrated today with the attempt to control freedom of speech, and then this evening we have had the debate on the way in which this whole structure has been mismanaged, which was brought to light by the Auditor-General's report. I commend my colleagues for their approach. I also commend the Auditor-General for bringing to light the incredible errors made by the Government in handling this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the coalition health policy is not affected by this minor change in relation to the black boxes. It is far more detailed than that. In addition to the provision of pharmaceutical benefits concession cards to people aged 65 and over who are not currently in receipt of any government concessions, we will retain Medicare and significantly improve it. It will remain a system of universal health cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will restore the balance between the public and private sectors by encouraging individuals to provide for their own health care by taking out private health insurance. Higher income earners who do not take out private health insurance and who occupy public beds will be encouraged to take out private health insurance by being penalised with a higher levy if their income is over $50,000 per annum for married couples or $40,000 per annum for singles. It will not stop the funds acting as agents for Medicare and it will not stop the additional medical cover that can be provided by gap insurance. So the Minister's statement about the deletion of the black box is but a very minor matter in the overall approach of the coalition to its health policy. </PARA>

<PARA>I will be brief because I know that a number of my colleagues want to speak to this report. There is no doubt that this tired Labor Government not only has brought this country to its knees but also is accident prone. Is there no end to the mismanagement of the Australian economy by the Labor Government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of its recent planks of reform which was supported by the coalition, particularly the honourable member for Wannon, Mr Hawker, and the honourable member for Farrer, Mr Tim Fischer, was to improve the rail system in this country. Before it has even got off the ground, before the Bill has even come into the Senate, it is fatally flawed. This is probably the most extraordinary report I have seen in the six or seven years that I have been in this place. The Auditor-General points out that his report is unprecedented in that it has the agreement and support of the six Auditors-General of the parties involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain briefly what this matter is about. This might save my colleagues having to go through it again and allow them to speak on the broader issues. The National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill seeks to merge Australian National with the other State rail systems so that they can be integrated between the capital cities. The Commonwealth will contribute equity of $296m of taxpayers' money out of a total of $415m over five years and the States will make up the balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement, according to the Auditor-General, raises the fundamental issue of public accountability. There are two flaws to the way in which the Bill has been presented. Under the corporations law the Corporation will be a strictly commercial operation at arm's length from the Government. There are no problems with that. But what has happened is that, even before legislation has come before the Parliament of Australia, a private auditor has been chosen and the Australian National Audit Office was not even consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a similar issue came up some months ago in respect of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Wool Corporation, Senator Collins berated senators on this side of the chamber for suggesting that we would oppose a private audit. He argued, `After all, were you not the party that believed in contracting out and privatisation?'. He is quite correct. But as the Auditor-General points out, there is a massive gap between corporatisation and privatisation. When we have corporatisation, the money is being put in by the taxpayers of this country. For that reason, this matter deserves to come under the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Auditor-General points out that, under the legislation as proposed, there is no legislative requirement whatsoever for the Corporation to report to the parliaments of the Commonwealth or the States, notwithstanding the massive $415m of taxpayers' money being put into the Corporation by both the Commonwealth and the States. In one of his conclusions, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extraordinary, given the results of similar attempts in some other administrations, that a company, wholly owned and funded by the Commonwealth and State taxpayers, can be established and avoid accountability mechanisms (including the appointment of an Auditor-General) which are properly designed to protect the interests of Ministers, the Parliament and taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned previously, there was no consultation at all with the Australian National Audit Office in respect of the auditing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General goes as far as to request of the Parliament, of honourable senators and of members of the House of Representatives, that we amend the Bill to require the Corporation to report annually to the Commonwealth Parliament and to provide for the Auditor-General to be the sole auditor. I would have thought that this did not even have to be said. There is no doubt that the setting up of this organisation is a move in the right direction in respect of micro-economic reform. But the legislation is found to be wanting in that the Corporation does not even have to report to the Parliament which represents the taxpayers of this country. </PARA>

We know that the Corporation was to start operating last July.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General and the State Auditors-General have all voiced their concern that audits will not be carried out by the Australian National Audit Office but will be handled by a standard auditor appointed under the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the NRC is wholly owned and funded by the Federal Government, I believe that the Auditor-General should do the auditing on behalf of not only the States but all the taxpayers involved. First up, over the next five years a total of $415m will be put into this project. It is a worthwhile project because central rail has been run down through inefficiencies and will need to be put back on track again. The Commonwealth's share alone is $296m, which is not small bikkies. The Auditor-General stated:</PARA>

With that in mind, I believe that the Auditor-General's concerns should be relayed to the Government so that it can fix up something that has weathered by design or by negligence. We are not in a position to say. This is a commercial situation. We have to have an Auditor-General. The final underwriters of this undertaking are the Australian taxpayers.

This corporatisation, which Senator Parer said will lead us in the right direction, quite frankly is a disaster position. It is the worst of all worlds. I have mentioned this quite often in this place. I have spoken about government operations that have been corporatised without being privatised. What happens when they are corporatised is exactly what the Auditor-General has pointed out here&mdash;they are removed from the scrutiny that this chamber has, particularly in Senate Estimates committees, which quite frankly they must be subjected to.

There was no consultation with the ANAO in respect of the auditing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to go into that. Senator Watson will deal with that matter. My concern is with the disastrous consequences of exactly what the Government is going to proceed to do now. The Auditors-General of other States&mdash;New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia&mdash;agree with and support what the Auditor-General is saying in this report. The Auditor-General makes this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those implementing commercialisation (short of complete privatisation) must recognise the fact&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I underline the word `must', because this Government has not recognised it yet, having seen the disasters that its Labor colleagues in other States have brought upon themselves&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that commercially operating units are still part of government. They are underwritten by the taxpayer or given power by citizens. Ultimate responsibility has to be accepted by the Government whatever attempts it might make to create arms-length operations. Corporatisation should not be used to weaken public accountability, nor to cloud the responsibility Ministers have for public sector activities.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that, because this chamber received a letter from various Ministers of the Government&mdash;and I think Mr Beazley was the most gross offender&mdash;telling us that in Senate Estimates hearings we were not entitled to ask questions about or make any examination of those government corporations which did not depend on an appropriation of the Parliament; in other words, telling us to butt out of inquiries of these corporatised animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply intolerable.

<PARA>We say amen to that. My view is that we should not countenance more corporatising by this Government unless there will be privatising. In the past we have taken the view, `Oh well, it is setting up the system and making it easier for us to come in and privatise, as is our policy'. The more I see of this halfway house resting in this no-man's land of no accountability, of preventing our proper questioning, the more I am concerned about where it is leading us. I believe, from the experience of disastrous Labor State governments, that it is not good enough to say, `At least we are moving in the right direction'. If the Government is not going to do it properly, it should not do it at all. I think the Auditor-General's warnings are very sound.

But on this occasion, before the Bill has passed through the Parliament, I understand&mdash;and I hope I will be corrected&mdash;that the Government has already appointed an auditor.

It is a concern with which I concur today, as I did then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the recommendation of the famous Public Accounts Committee report 296 in the production of which I took a significant part. It was a report that the Government basically accepted. It was not only endorsed by the Committee, but also by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration; by a subsequent review of the Auditor-General's Office by a Mr T.A. Sheridan, a prominent South Australian State Government auditor; and by the independent auditor appointed by the Government itself.

We find a government agreeing with this recommendation yet, in this instance of the National Rail Corporation, it has chosen to ignore its own recommendations.

I commiserate with that private sector auditor for the position in which he now finds himself. </PARA>

In fact, the public sector in the last few years has fared remarkably well, because we have not had the sorts of scenes that have been witnessed in the private sector with so many people losing so much money. I think that is testimony to the work of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General said in his report:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it would seem that this is not a mistake on the part of the Government, as the Auditor-General expressed the hope that it was when it was first done five months ago. In fact, it is a deliberate policy of this Government; it is a direct attack on this Parliament's role in the scrutiny and reporting of the activities of public sector enterprises. In his letter accompanying this report, which is incorporated into the report, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that I should have to report in this way within six months of a similar report on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we see the lines drawn as far as accountability and responsibility are concerned. Whatever its commercial charter may be, the National Rail Corporation remains a public sector enterprise&mdash;an enterprise which is funded by the taxpayer. Replacing the Auditor-General with a private sector auditor involves removing appropriate accountability for that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of this Parliament in its report No. 296, where it recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Act 1901 be amended to require the Auditor-General to be appointed the external auditor of all Government companies. Private sector firms and partnerships which are the external auditors of Government companies would continue until their appointments expired, whereupon the Auditor-General would become the company's external auditor.</PARA>
<PARA>The latter part of that recommendation was obviously dealing with pre-existing government business enterprises, but the essence of this recommendation is that new enterprises being established, such as this Rail Corporation, should in fact have the Auditor-General appointed at the outset. Of course, that recommendation was endorsed by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. It was also endorsed by a subsequent review of the Auditor-General's Office by Mr T.A. Sheridan and by the independent auditor appointed by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, most importantly, the recommendation of this Committee was accepted by this very Government. In its tabled response to the Joint Committee report, the Government indicated that the Auditor-General was to be the sole auditor of all government owned or controlled entities subject to exemptions by the Minister for Finance in special circumstances. In fact, I understand that the legislative provisions in the proposed new legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901 include a provision which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General is to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth agencies and entities, except where the Minister for Finance has determined that an entity may make other audit arrangements. The Minister for Finance may not make a determination to grant an exemption unless he has first consulted the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA>This new audit legislation is still to see the light of day. It has not yet been presented to this Parliament. Perhaps this is yet a further example of the mismanagement of this Government which we see with regard to finances generally and with regard to government business enterprises in particular. Either it is mismanagement in that situation or else it is a very Machiavellian delay to allow this National Rail Corporation to avoid proper scrutiny by the responsibility for auditing being given to the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General is the linchpin of public administration. If the system of auditing by the Auditor-General breaks down, then the system of public accountability breaks down. The Auditor-General is the essential link between this Parliament and government business enterprises. Commercialisation of government activities does not remove this necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth referring to another report on this issue, the November 1989 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into government companies. With regard to the nature and function of audit, the report of that Committee makes the following statement under the heading `Audit is not a service to management':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the fashion for a move away from audit by the Auditor-General appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the role of an auditor. The purpose of audit is to provide an independent report on management, not a service to it. Management freedom should apply to management functions but the appointment of the auditor is the prerogative of the owners, not managers.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, as far as government business enterprises are concerned in general, and this National Rail Corporation in particular, the responsibility for audit reporting is to the owners&mdash;that is, to the Government in the first instance, but, more importantly, to the taxpayers, because the taxpayers are the owners of government business enterprises. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>It is this Parliament which is the representative of those owners, the taxpayers, and it is to this Parliament that that reporting should be done, and it should be within the responsibility of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only ground for removing from the Auditor-General the responsibility for ensuring accountability is where there is complete privatisation of a former government body. Obviously, in that situation taxpayers' funds are no longer involved;  it has become a fully private sector organisation with private shareholders. In that case it is up to those private shareholders to determine whom the auditor will be. So long as taxpayers' funds are involved, the Auditor-General should have that auditing and reporting responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only question the motives of a Government in removing the responsibility of the Auditor-General in circumstances other than full privatisation. In other words, in the circumstances relating to this National Rail Corporation it can only be regarded as a deliberate weakening of parliamentary scrutiny. Therefore, I trust that this Parliament and in particular this Senate will take notice of all of the issues raised in Audit Report No. 16 of 1991-92 with regard to the National Rail Corporation when the legislation comes before this chamber next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just refer in summary to two of the issues, the two which the Auditor-General raises in particular. In referring to the agreement between the various States and the Commonwealth for the establishment of the National Rail Corporation, the Auditor-General says that there are issues which are fundamental to public accountability. Firstly, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Corporation will be entirely publicly funded, it is intended that the Corporation will operate under the provisions of the Corporations Law as a strictly commercial corporation at arms-length from the Government. There is no legislative requirement for the Corporation to report to the Parliaments of the Commonwealth or the States (the taxpayers' representatives). </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the fact that it is Commonwealth Government policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as I have already mentioned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Auditor-General be the sole external auditor of Commonwealth-owned or&mdash;controlled entities, it is understood that a private-sector auditor has been appointed as the Corporation's auditor under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to spell out in detail the specific concerns which the Auditor-General has about those two aspects of the establishment of the National Rail Corporation, as it is established under the legislation which will be debated next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I trust this chamber will see fit to amend that legislation next week so that the Auditor-General resumes the responsibility for the auditing of this organisation and, therefore, accountability to this Parliament will be retained effectively&mdash;as indeed it should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise a matter in relation to equal employment opportunity as it is practised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Within the very large group of people who are interested in the extent to which the Government practises what it preaches in the equal employment opportunity area, Foreign Affairs and Trade as a department is frequently the subject of discussion. Of course, that is not to say that other departments do not enjoy such a deplorable reputation, but Foreign Affairs and Trade certainly has to be in the top group in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter has come to my attention which relates to a Mrs Sue Boswell, a constituent of Mr Sinclair. I want to say at the outset that I am aware that proceedings have been issued in relation to this matter and, therefore, I want to be somewhat careful in what I say;  but I am not of the view that simply because proceedings have been issued there is nothing I can say about this matter, nor am I of the view that there is nothing that the Government ought to be saying in response in this place to queries about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Boswell is unhappy&mdash;that is perhaps an understatement&mdash;with the treatment she maintains she has had from the Department. This evening I would like to put some allegations, which are public allegations on the record, and invite the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator  McMullan) to seek a response from the Department. If that response is forthcoming we can then examine it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegations are basically these. Mrs Boswell was subjected to an unprecedented two-year probation period in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is apparently quite extraordinary. I am not someone who is&mdash;to use a colloquial expression&mdash;full bottle on the rules and regulations governing Public Service employment and the progression there through but, as I understand it, a two-year probation period is quite extraordinary. It is further alleged that the Department failed to follow the Public Service guidelines in relation to this probation period, long as it was, and that during this probation period she was subjected to quite unusual procedures that were applied to none of her colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is an allegation that the Department found by its own inquiry that a supervisor had reported unfairly on her; that this supervisor had a direct and indirect influence over her throughout that entire probation period; and that this supervisor admitted sending her messages, shall I say, not directly associated with her work and which she took to be a form of harassment. This is the third allegation:  here was a supervisor that the Department has apparently established reported on her unfairly, at least in one respect; that this supervisor had direct and indirect influence over her throughout the entire probation period; and that this supervisor admitted sending her messages not related to her work, which she took to be harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a fourth allegation that a senior departmental investigation officer destroyed certain papers that Mrs Boswell sought for the appeal that she is undertaking, or has undertaken, to the Merit Protection and Review Agency. As I understand it, the material that has been destroyed is a record of interview with another officer of the Department. I do not recall now whether that interview reflected positively or adversely on Mrs Boswell but that is really not the point. The point is that an interview was done as part of some sort of assessment process, and the record of that interview has not been kept. The allegation is that the record of that interview has been destroyed by the interviewer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an unusual process. If that has happened, irrespective of the outcome of that interview, we deserve an explanation of why that sort of thing is allowed to happen and what has happened as a consequence of it. Has it just been ignored? Was this some sort of aberrant practice that everyone agrees should not have happened but about which we say, no, we will not worry about it because we think it will not happen again? I am not raising these matters just because they relate to Mrs Boswell. I have never met Mrs Boswell. I am relating these matters to the chamber tonight because I think it is important, as a matter of principle, to know how these matters are generally dealt with by a department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further understand that the Department denied Mrs Boswell her right to have an investigation under regulation 83 of the Public Service Regulations before her employment was terminated. What that means is that, if that maximum probation period had expired, Mrs Boswell would have been automatically permanently appointed to the Public Service. But just before the expiration of that period, Mrs Boswell, as I am informed, sought an investigation under regulation 83. We do not need to be bright to understand that if she sought that investigation very close to the expiration of her probation period then that investigation may well, and probably would, have carried on past the expiration of that period and she would have been a permanent appointee. The significance of her having been denied that investigation is that the time period of her probation was not allowed to expire; in other words, she was dismissed before that happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegations were further put to me that the Department had refused as of a couple of weeks ago&mdash;it may now have complied but in any event had not in what one would regard as an appropriate time&mdash;to furnish reasons required under section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has failed to respond to a written application for compensation for domestic dislocation which the Merit Protection Review Agency recommended be made. As I understand it, Mrs Boswell moved here with the expectation of getting the job. After the expiry of a significant period of time, that expectation obviously grew. One would have thought that if her performance was unsatisfactorily, and the Department was able to make up its mind, it would have dismissed her immediately. I would have no qualms with that at all. If the Department had decided that she was unsatisfactory within one week, two weeks, one month, two months, three months, four months, five months or six months, well and good&mdash;get rid of her. I am certainly not in the category of people who think that someone should be taken on who, on their merit, does not deserve the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To allow the assessment of that merit to go on and on, well beyond the period that the Department would let it go on for anyone else, and then to use some sort of technical mechanism to deprive that person of the opportunity of being appointed in a fair and reasonable time, seems to beg some sort of explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass these on as allegations that have been made to me. I have made no further investigation of the allegations. I believe they have been made in good faith. The allegations certainly fit in with the sorts of allegations that have been made in the past about the conduct of the management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are not out of place. I am not surprised by that. I ask that the Parliamentary Secretary take these matters to the Minister and seek some sort of explanation of them. </PARA>

I understand I needed to seek leave to discuss this matter as it is still on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is one of those benchmark questions which have to be fought at every turn. One of the most important reports of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament</EMPHASIS>. If the report had one strong message which had to stand out almost above all others it was that the Auditor-General must have mandate wherever the public purse is concerned. Very simply, that means that where there is a vehicle&mdash;be it corporate or otherwise&mdash;which is funded from the public purse the Auditor-General must be the auditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is very simple. There is a distinction to be drawn between investment in commercial operations and public operations. Those who invest in private operations take their hard-earned after-tax money and make a decision as to whether they will invest in a corporation. Once they have invested in that corporation, if they do not like what it does, they can dispose of their shares, get up at the annual meeting&mdash;they have all sorts of ways&mdash;and express a view about the management and other matters concerning that corporation, or they can vote with their feet and simply get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no such option available when the entity is in the public sector. The money is taken from taxpayers compulsorily. The decision as to how that investment is made is made by the executive of government and finally appropriated by the Parliament. There is no way in the world that an individual taxpayer has any say over where his or her money is invested in that corporation and whether it remains in that corporation. Therefore, the whole concept of accountability in the public sector is totally different from the concept of accountability in the private sector. That distinction must remain paramount in deciding who is the auditor. That is why the Joint Committee of Public Accounts said that the Auditor-General must maintain a mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Bill is finally presented, we will have an opportunity to see whether we can rectify this position, as we have done with a previous piece of legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the past month news headlines of several newspapers heralded triumphantly the fact that inflation in Australia had hit a 20-year low. The consumer price index for the September quarter was only 0.6 per cent. On this figure, inflation for the year was now only 3.8 per cent. Because of this low inflation factor, I would like to address my remarks tonight to the plight of provisional taxpayers whose incomes are deemed to increase by 10 per cent for provisional tax purposes. I use this opportunity to call on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) and his Government to take immediate steps to reduce what is known as the tax uplift factor to a more reasonable figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisional taxpayers pay their tax liability calculated in advance of their earnings. Customarily, three broad classes of people are provisional taxpayers. They include, firstly, the owners of small businesses operating as sole proprietors or in partnership. They could incorporate under existing rules but generally do not have sufficient funds or commercial sophistication to take that step. Secondly, they include self-employed professionals who are prohibited by the rules of their profession from incorporating. Thirdly, there are employed and retired persons who earn their income from investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade wages and incomes as a result of inflation have steadily increased each year. To ensure that the provisional taxpayer does not underpay his taxation liability, the Australian Taxation Office calculates the provisional taxpayer's income at an increased rate. It has been at a minimum of 10 per cent, and somewhat higher, each year. Simply put, this means that, if taxable income in year one is $50,000, the provisional tax for the next year is calculated on an income of $55,000&mdash;that is, if the 10 per cent uplift factor applies in that particular year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was concerned&mdash;and I spoke strongly earlier&mdash;about the Government fixing this uplift factor at 10 per cent. This low inflation factor, as revealed in the September quarter, is a vindication of the stand that I took then and I take tonight. The uplift factor of 10 per cent is based on the fact that for many years Australia has had high inflation, something in excess of 10 per cent. In addition, provisional taxpayers who are self-employed tend to earn more money with the passage of time. Neither of those assumptions is correct at present when Australia is in such a severe recession, with the consequence that provisional incomes especially are severely down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that our inflation rate has dropped dramatically. Therefore, it is appropriate and not unreasonable for a much lower inflation factor to be applied. Takings have dropped so much that during 1990-91 Australia reported a record 13,000 bankruptcies, with over 50 per cent occurring in the last 12 months. It is interesting to note that in 1982-83 there was less than half this number of bankruptcies&mdash;in fact, only 5,151&mdash;in Australia. The average weekly earnings only increased from $562 in August of last year to $569 in May 1991. There was a negative quarterly change of 2.7 per cent from February to May of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, I repeat, I am calling on this Government to immediately reduce the uplift factor that has been applied to provisional taxpayers for this year. The combination of reduced inflation and decreased takings means that the uplift factor for this year should be almost nil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, this reduced inflation rate and decreased takings is not something that has occurred only in the last month. Rather, there has been a steady decline over the whole year. Therefore, when the Commissioner of Taxation released in late July a media release announcing that assessments for paying provisional tax for 1991-92 will be issued from 1 July 1991, the media release assumed that the uplift factor of 10 per cent would remain unchanged. Of course, it remains unchanged unless changed by this Parliament. This was the dictate of this Government with the support of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The early issuing of provisional tax assessments will naturally benefit those taxpayers who will receive an early refund, but not everybody is entitled to a refund. The fact that the media release assumes that there will be no change in the uplift factor rather surprises and, I must say, disappoints me. Perhaps the ATO was privy to some private knowledge that the economy was going to improve, but the figures out today do not really suggest that. If the Government does not drop the uplift factor soon many of the provisional taxpayers will have to vary their liability. It is putting taxpayers to additional expense and possibly additional liability to penalties. So there are problems for a lot of people, particularly the elderly, in pursuing this avenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases taxpayers are unwise to lodge such a variation without obtaining professional advice. This costs them time as well as expense, money which many of these people do not have in difficult times. Many businesses and many people in these straitened times cannot afford professional advice. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Accountant</EMPHASIS> newspaper declared only recently that accountancy appointments had dropped to their lowest level since the last recession of 1982. The prospects for senior executives looked particularly bleak with more and more of the accounting firms shedding jobs. As well, even if the provisional taxpayer does obtain professional advice, there is still the possibility that the taxpayer's estimate will underestimate the income for the current year by 10 per cent or more. An underestimate may result in a penalty tax at the annual rate of 20 per cent. This Government should have announced during the Budget that a change in the uplift factor was necessary, because that was the ideal time for such an announcement. I regret that that announcement was not made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude I would like to highlight a section of provisional taxpayers who have been severely hurt by the uplift factor being set at 10 per cent. These are retirees who earn income from investments. This is the third category that I mentioned earlier. A retiree's investments are normally so structured that they receive, hopefully, a livable income. However, the retiree is hit on two counts. Firstly, the interest rate on savings and long term loans has been steadily decreasing over the past 12 months. It is now very difficult to invest at 10 per cent or more. Secondly, he is not in business and his investments are not increasing; therefore it cannot be assumed that his income increases by 10 per cent. In fact, in many cases it will be less than the previous year's financial income. Yet the ATO assumes that the retiree's income has increased by 10 per cent. There is no distinction between the various classes by this Government or by the Tax Office. I therefore believe that these people deserve special consideration and should be excluded from having the uplift factor applied to them, maybe on a permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let us not be distracted from the pressing need at hand. If this Government is concerned at how people are hurting in this recession, this is one way&mdash;with very little effort&mdash;in which the Parliamentary Secretary can give significant relief to a large sector of taxpayers in Australia. I believe that a failure by the Government to act promptly will cause scepticism that there is not a commitment to lower inflation; at the same time the Government can help the needy, particularly the aged, and also those struggling businesses whose incomes have dramatically declined. Now is the time to act. The 10 per cent provisional tax uplift factor needs to be reduced. I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's response. </PARA>

It deserves the contempt of all Australians, no matter what their political affiliations. The moment Australians are intimidated for their own political beliefs or freedom of association with a party of their choice, we are back in the days of Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Australian Capital Territory&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (11.03 p.m.)&mdash;There were several points raised on the adjournment to which specific response was requested. Senator Chapman and Senator Bishop used this forum to continue the debate that had been held on the Auditor-General's report and I will not comment on that. Senator Vanstone raised a matter about which I know absolutely nothing, but she asked me to refer it to the relevant Minister, and I will do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson spoke at length about the issue of inflation and provisional tax. I am sure I am as pleased as he is&mdash;perhaps more pleased&mdash;about the success so far in achieving a low rate of inflation, and I can tell him that there is better to come. But I have to remind him that the law as it stands in relation to a fixed rate of provisional tax was not the Government's preferred position. We sought flexibility in setting that rate and were denied it by this chamber. That is why the 10 per cent rate is set in the legislation&mdash;not because we wanted it, but because we could not get the flexibility we wanted passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are in the particular situation of concern to which Senator Watson refers should remember, firstly, that that is the case. Secondly, they should be made aware, as Senator Watson correctly outlined, of the options they have if their income is declining. I understand that falling interest rates&mdash;desirable as they are overall&mdash;do have an impact on the income of people who rely upon interest rates for their income. I understand that that obviously is the case, but, given the dramatic nature of the fall in interest rates over the last 12 months, I suspect that those individuals will have available to them options to adjust their tax obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to just let Senator Macdonald's remarks pass because they are part of the political give and take between Senator Macdonald and Mr Hulls. Mr Hulls is perfectly capable of taking care of himself and Senator Macdonald. But I was appalled that a series of overblown and quite inappropriate insults and remarks were thrown about. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Panizza thinks `rabble' and `Nazi' are equivalent, that is his judgment. The word `Nazi' has some special and important implications. To throw it around at all belittles the user and not the person accused. But to use it about another member of parliament in these circumstances is entirely inappropriate, in poor taste and shows poor judgment. I think `Mafia' is a category lower. But it is equally undesirable and inappropriate, and reflects upon the user, not the person against whom it is made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had allegations about things being un-Australian and whatever. I know nothing about the matter in hand and I cannot deal with it. As I said initially, I would otherwise have considered the matter to be one properly for debate between Mr Hulls and Senator Macdonald. But I think the language that was used was entirely inappropriate and the Senate is not enhanced by that sort of cheap shot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues are entitled to be debated. I take no exception to the right of Senator Macdonald to come in here and criticise the actions of anybody, including Mr Hulls or any of my other colleagues, to refer to information given to him with which he disagrees and to speak as vigorously as he chooses. But I think that sort of allegation is not well made. It does not enhance the Parliament or the reputation of Senator Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a matter about which I need to take any further action. I am sure that Mr Hulls is capable of taking care of it for himself. I reiterate that I will refer the matter raised by Senator Vanstone. </PARA>

The IAEA International Laboratory of Marine Radioactivity (ILMR) Report No 48 of 1991 provides a summary of radionuclide measurements of sea-water and plankton samples collected in March 1991. These measurements were conducted by three internationally respected laboratories. The samples were collected in the presence of a bailiff, providing legal guarantee that the IAEA protocol was properly carried out, and the analyses were conducted concurrently to enable cross-comparisons of measurements.</PARA>
