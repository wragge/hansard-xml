<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade how he justifies his own and the Prime Minister's statements, that as a result of the London Foreign Minister's meeting, there are no barriers to the resumption of sporting links with unified South African sports and that these could be resumed `straight away' when the facts show that the communique from the meeting agreed only that unified sports should be `recognised' in an unspecified way, subject to guidance by African National Congress (ANC) dominated unified sporting organisations, with the ANC still, by the way, being strongly opposed to the removal of sporting boycotts. Now that the Government appears to be admitting that the requirements of the Gleneagles agreement are being met, do the Prime Minister's statements mean that the Hawke Government is planning to resume sporting links, despite continuing ANC opposition and without further referral to a Commonwealth meeting on this subject which has been deferred until November?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="771" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said yesterday, in response to an interjection from Senator Michael Baume, there is absolutely no need for him to get his knickers in a twist about this. The sporting issue is being considered and resolved in a way that is entirely sensible and rational and meets the concerns, certainly, of the ANC and, certainly, of those of us who believe that it is appropriate that there be some measured response to the pace of change that is now occurring in South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision reached at the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers meeting over the weekend was as I described it yesterday. There was agreement in principle that those sports achieving unity should be recognised by the international community. There is further agreement that that pro- cess of recognition should take place in consultation with the relevant black African sporting bodies which, for the sake of completeness, I indicate from the discussions so far amount to the following: first of all, there is the Steering Committee on South African Sports, the so-called C10, which consists of representatives from the National Olympic and Sports Congress, including Mr Mluleki George, who was in Australia last week, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee, including Mr Ramsamy, the South African Council of Sport and a number of other familiar organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the Monitoring Committee of African Sport Representatives, which has been formed under the auspices of ANOCA, the African National Olympic Committees Association. Thirdly, in the wider international community, there is the Apartheid and Olympism Commission established by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It is understood, intended and expected that there will be consultation with all those different bodies before there is any actual implementation of international sports contact. But the basic principle that has been agreed is that that process of international recognition and the modification that is implied accordingly of the Gleneagles agreement should occur in relation to and only in relation to those sports which achieve a unified administration.</PARA>
<PARA> So that is the set of principles that has been agreed. The working out of those principles will take some time. The pre-condition is, of course, that unity be achieved in the particular sport. As I have indicated in relation to those sports in which Australia is interested, we expect that to be achieved in relation to cricket around the middle of the year; we expect it to be achieved in relation to the Olympic sports by the end of the year; and we do not know when it is going to be achieved so far as rugby is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> In any event, the process of moving from recognition of a sport as ripe and timely for international contacts to the point of actually having those contacts is something else again. There will be lead times involved, planning, preparation, tour dates to be fixed and so on. It is premature to speculate about just how early that could occur. I simply say again that the momentum is there. The principles have been agreed in a separate and distinct category of consideration from the principles governing sanctions at large, and they appear in different sections of the communique to reflect that particular reality.</PARA>
<PARA> Since Senator Baume makes the point, what has happened has been done not in any way against the opposition of the ANC. On the contrary, the particular process that I have outlined and described is entirely consistent with what the ANC has indicated to us that it would like to see happening.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I thank the Minister very much for that answer and for his clear distinction between the word `recognition' and the agreement to play sport. I ask the Minister: what indications does he have from the ANC that it will agree before the Harare meeting in November to play sport, not just to recognise a sporting body? What indications does he have from the ANC which would justify the Prime Minister's statement that as soon as sporting bodies are unified one could begin playing sport `straightaway'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to go into detail about the nature of the communications with the ANC that have led me to express the conclusion I have, except to say that on the basis of all the contacts I have had-including at a very high level last weekend with the ANC, as well as before that-I am completely confident that the pattern of response that I have described is not only acceptable to but is positively being encouraged by the ANC as an appropriate response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the Prime Minister's remarks, they are entirely consistent with what I have said. There is a sequence; there is a pattern of events being laid out. The pre-condition is unity and once that unity is achieved, we fully expect the rest of the steps to fall immediately into place.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications and concerns the situation on radio 2XX in Canberra in which a radio commentator, Mr David McMullen, was sacked from the station for `deliberately breaking the spirit of 2XX's policy of opposition to the war'. I ask: firstly, is that policy in breach of public broadcasting guidelines? Secondly, what action is being taken on that matter? Thirdly, should the name of the station be changed from 2XX to 2WANK?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have read that newspaper report and, as I understand it, so has the Minister. I will have to qualify what I say by making the statement that I have not had time to find out whether the details of the report are accurate-and I read it this morning. I am doing that now and the Minister's office is, indeed, doing it. It is an ongoing dispute. I understand that the allegedly sacked announcer and the manager of the radio station have both given interviews today on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which I have not heard either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the substance of the story is accurate, there is no question that this action is in breach of the very purpose for which public radio was established by this Government. It is something that I know the Minister is disturbed about, and so am I. It seems an extraordinary action. I remind honourable senators-not that they need to be reminded-that the very purpose of setting up public radio was to provide a wide range of diverse opinion on a wide range of subjects. My own experience in public radio, in which I have an interest in my own neck of the woods, is that by and large public radio has fulfilled that expectation very well indeed. This is the first time to my knowledge that such an extraordinary action has apparently been taken.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is responsible for oversighting the conditions of public radio licenses. It would appear that, if the substance of the story is correct, the action is absolutely in breach of those requirements. I can assure Senator Aulich that, if he or any other member of the public aggrieved by this action-I stress again that we are currently examining this-complains directly to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the Tribunal will investigate it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to an address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, this morning to the International Union of Housing Finance Institutions, in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Activity should pick up during the second half of 1991, aided by . . . the counter-cyclical workings of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA>This would appear to be at odds with a statement by the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, on the AM program on Friday, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no attempt by the Government to say, well, there's a recession, we should therefore loosen off on fiscal policy. That's not part of our thinking at all.</PARA>
<PARA>In light of these apparently conflicting statements, can the Minister advise what the Government sees as the prime role for fiscal policy in a recession, or is Alan Wood right in his suggestion in today's Australian when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, it-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking in terms of ancient history. It is talking in terms of political will. In answer to the question let me say that I have not read Mr Fraser's speech, but inevitably in a time of recession fiscal policy operates in a counter-cyclical way because the surplus is reduced by cyclical factors associated with a recession: unemployment benefits rise, corporate taxes go down. And inevitably that happens in a time of recession. So a surplus is reduced or a deficit-which is more familiar to Opposition senators than to us-rises. There is nothing surprising about that. What Mr Willis was saying in his comments the other day was that fiscal policy, as it affects government expenditure, has to be maintained tightly by the Government in the circumstances. That is what Mr Willis was talking about. I do not see any inconsistencies between the two, but I will look at Mr Fraser's speech to see whether there is any wisdom hidden in the depths of the speech which has not been revealed by the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All three Royal Australian Navy ships deployed in the Gulf region are operating in the Arabian Gulf supporting multinational force operations against Iraqi forces. The primary threat to shipping in the Gulf is from free-floating mines. In the northern Arabian Gulf the threat is further increased by minefields laid by Iraq to counter allied operations in the Kuwait area. The possibility of air launched missile attacks, mostly Exocet, cannot yet be discounted. The Iraqi surface naval threat has been neutralised. The HMAS Brisbane is located in the central Arabian Gulf conducting anti-aircraft warning support to the multinational force warships in the area, and HMAS Sydney is operating further to the north on search and rescue activities but outside the area of highest probability of Iraqi minefields.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the reported statement of the Prime Minister in Tasmania over the weekend. The Prime Minister is reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Federal resource security is not necessary for new projects, such as pulp mills, to go ahead. In order to get a development you don't necessarily have to have federal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Government made a firm decision not to pass so-called resource security legislation either in respect of Tasmania or the mainland, now or throughout its present term of office? Does Mr Griffiths' reply to a question in the House of Representatives yesterday mean that the Federal Government, while not passing resource security legislation itself, does intend to rubber stamp such legislation if passed by the States? If the Government does not intend any resource security legislation, does this commitment relate only to forests as a resource or does this undertaking extend to all resources? Finally, if the answers to parts 1 and 3 of this question are yes, can one draw from these decisions that the Government is beginning to understand that sustainable development not only means maintaining supplies of a sought after resource such as timber but also maintaining in perpetuity the rich biodiversity of forests of which exploitable tree species are but a small part?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is in four parts. I might deal with them one by one. Firstly, the Government has made no decision on whether to proceed with resource security legislation. Secondly, the Government has repeatedly said that if a proposal is brought forward by a State government it will be given prompt consideration. In that sense, having given those two answers to the first two questions, questions 3 and 4 are not applicable. Let me say, however, that in respect of the last part of question 4, where Senator Coulter raises the question of the biodiversity issue, yes, the Government understands that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does this statement not give the lie to the oftrepeated claim that the facilities are only for verification of arms control agreements? Does it not in fact confirm the claims made by me and others in this place, and by respected scholars elsewhere, that the facilities are literally about war fighting through the interception of Iraqi communications?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I ask about Australia's decision to normalise relations with China, to which I have urged the Australian Government to move immediately. I refer to radio reports today and to a front page article in today's Sydney Morning Herald. I ask: what is the timing for the Minister announcing Australia's decision? Besides normalisation of ministerial, parliamentary and official visits between the two countries, what other elements are included in the decision? Will the significant exception to the removal of sanctions be the current restrictions on defence sales and visits by some security officials?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="775" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has made no decision on this question and accordingly matters of timing do not come into it so far as when a decision already made will be announced. No decision has been made. I have said publicly-indeed I did it in answer to Senator Teague's adjournment speech the other night-that the Government is giving close consideration to these questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The background is as follows: following events in China in June 1989, as honourable senators will recall, we announced a few days later, on 13 July, a series of quite substantial restrictions in respect of Australia's official relations with China, which very substantially downgraded the relationship. Those measures were based on a series of principles which we articulated at the time: our global human rights concerns and interests; our concern to avoid action which would harm the ordinary Chinese people, and our encouragement of moderation and liberalisation within China by all appropriate means, keeping open channels of communication but at the same time preserving Australia's long term strategic and commercial interests. All those principles were relevant to the decision.</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1990 the Government essentially reaffirmed the decisions taken in July the previous year, but the policy was modified in two areas: to lift the blanket ban which had hitherto applied on ministerial visits and to consider them henceforth on a case-by-case basis, and to authorise me, in consultation with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), to make adjustments to other elements of the policy framework as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Although there have been a number of improvements evident in the human rights situation over the course of the past year, which will be very much in our minds as we evaluate the competing considerations now, I want to say clearly on the public record that we remain very concerned about the condition of human rights in China and the inhibitions on dissent in any form, and we will certainly continue to make strong representations to the People's Republic of China (PRC) authorities, both bilaterally and in multilateral forums such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, of which China is a member.</PARA>
<PARA> The other night in the adjournment debate I indicated that the Government is giving close consideration to a number of remaining restrictions, in particular the suspended procedures for consideration of new proposals for technical cooperation and agricultural research projects, the suspended consideration of concessional finance for development projects and the question of parliamentary and formal party visits. I made it clear then, and do so again now, that there are two other restrictions still extant apart from those, to which we are not giving any consideration or modification at this stage-defence sales and visits by security officials, because of their obvious continuing sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA> In considering these issues, we are taking into account the nature of our relationship with China, the various matters of principle to which I earlier referred and also current developments in the attitudes and policy responses of likeminded countries. That process is a continuing one and, when the Government has decided to make any policy change, it will make an appropriate announcement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is the Minister aware that the Australian Council for Overseas Aid claims that the Gulf crisis has already cost developing countries over half the total development assistance they receive from all sources? Can the Minister give an assurance that the Australian Government will give special attention to this critical funding need when overseas aid is considered in the 1991-92 Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of claims by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid that more attention needs to be given to the impact of the Gulf crisis on developing countries. As a government, we certainly recognise the problems that have hit many developing countries as a direct result of the Gulf crisis. The media have tended to concentrate only on some aspects of those problems, for example, the refugee issues and the displacement of guest workers from Iraq and Kuwait, without I think giving sufficient attention to some of the longer term considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the case that many developing countries have suffered very real and very substantial economic hardship, and that will continue long after the conflict ends. The major economic losses arise from the loss of remittances of guest workers, which is a very substantial contribution to a number of developing country budgets; the loss of export revenue as a result of trade sanctions-we are feeling that here, and it is being felt even more harshly in a number of other countries; and in particular oil price pressures on the balance of payments difficulties. That is not so acute at the moment because oil prices have come down, but for the long months of uncertainty before the actual conflict broke out the substantial increase in oil prices was having a devastating effect on a very large number of country budgets.</PARA>
<PARA> Quantifying the economic impact of the Gulf crisis in this respect is, however, extremely difficult. The World Bank is doing some valuable work in this area. We are receiving its assessments and continuing to monitor the situation but there is nothing that I can report at the moment in terms of a precise and credible quantification. We appreciate the difficulties that are being faced, as I have indicated, by developing countries. As to the last part of the honourable senator's question, we will certainly bear that in mind in considering our options for the 1991-92 aid budget. However, it is premature to speculate at this stage on the outcome of that deliberation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should probably thank Senator Parer for the compliment at the end of his question. I am sure, however, that that degree of power does not emanate from the portfolio of Administrative Services and that, if power did rest in that area, I would not exercise it in that way. The rest of Senator Parer's question raises a genuine issue which needs to be responded to seriously, unlike the last part of the question. There has been a restructuring of the Department of Administrative Services to bring together under one division all the various information technology responsibilities within the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that Senator Parer raises appeared in a column in the Canberra Times on 11 February, so this time the honourable senator is only nine or 10 days late. It was suggested in that article that, by placing the DAS role in oversighting the information technology tendering process in the same division as the branch of DAS which supplies information technology services, a conflict of interest could emerge. Some steps have been taken to keep the two branches of the organisation separate, but I have had discussions with the head of the Department in recent days to look at how we can ensure that there is no conflict that negates competitive and fair tendering. Some of the aspects of our discussion relate to the structuring of the organisation and whether it needs once again to be reviewed; and secondly, whether we need some code of ethics to guide the operation of this branch.</PARA>
<PARA> In the interim I have been given an assurance that the two areas of the Department that are involved in information technology have not been merged in a structural physical sense at this stage, and there has been no contact between the information technology services branch and the oversight branch in this instance. However, this is an area that to me poses a potential conflict and one that I will be addressing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman raises an issue which highlights not only the Government's attitude to policy in education but also major differences and distinctions between us and the Opposition. This particular issue starkly shows the areas of difference-the lack of application which has been shown by the Leader of the Opposition in what is merely a top of the head policy projection, with no intellectual or financial rigour applied to it. As well, it indicates the commitment to ideology over a commitment towards practical solutions. The Leader of the Opposition contends that we do not have a workable practical solution. To evidence that we should look at how funding operates at the moment and compare that to the proposal that has been floated over the weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Current arrangements for government funding of education services provide for three important goals, and they are goals that have been attained under this Government and are valuable ones. Firstly, there is an agreed and assured division of financial responsibility between the Commonwealth, States and individuals. Secondly, we have a pursuit of agreed goals in education. Those are goals which I am sure members of this Senate have been involved in for some time through Senate committees to achieve and define. Thirdly, there is the provision of special support via targeted programs and other equity measures to individuals and institutions disadvantaged in their access to educational resources. They are the three benchmarks of our policy directions and they provide equity and access in education.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare those to the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. The first result of Professor Hewson's policy would be to increase the potential for transfer to financial responsibility from governments to individuals. Of course, that would quite directly necessitate the introduction of fees where none currently exist and would involve the extension of increase in fees and charges where they already exist. The second disastrous effect would be to fragment and divide the system of education. It would be much more difficult to pursue common goals and policy strategies in the national interest if one divides the system in the way Professor Hewson suggests. Thirdly, it would leave the decision of allocation of resources largely to market forces without regard to assessment of relative need of individuals and institutions. Therefore, one would increase the present inequities in access to education. The end result would be to create confusion, uncertainty and administrative complexity on the one hand, and on the other hand it would exacerbate inequity and would waste resources. The short answer to Senator Foreman's question is no.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. With overseas travel scaling down because of the Middle East war, what measures, if any, are being implemented to channel would-be overseas travellers towards domestic tourism destinations? Have any programs been organised to promote the advantages of holidaying in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="778" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I do not think we can point to any official data yet, because the Gulf war has not been going that long, I think there is a fair degree of anecdotal evidence that Australians may well be changing their travel plans to favour domestic destinations. Both industry and press reports suggest that many Australians have recently postponed spending on overseas travel, and outbound corporate business is well below normal expectations. I think Qantas Airways Ltd can certainly confirm both of those points. Therefore, there may be opportunities for the tourism industry to focus greater attention on domestic holiday destinations to attract those Australians who have recently deferred overseas travel plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Responsibility for the promotion of those domestic tourism destinations, however, does rest with State and Territory tourism authorities. This was reaffirmed at a meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory tourism Ministers last October at which Ministers agreed that it was not the appropriate role of the Commonwealth to be involved in domestic advertising or promotion campaigns. Any Commonwealth involvement would, therefore, need to be supported by State and Territory governments and done in close cooperation with them, as occurred after the pilots dispute. In response to the downturn in outbound travel, several of the State authorities have indicated that they are going to strengthen their domestic promotion if it is in order to secure some of the potential increase in domestic travel.</PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory tourism Ministers, or their representatives, met last week with Mr Simmons, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, to discuss the effects of the Gulf war on the tourism industry. The meeting agreed that, from a national perspective, the Australian Tourist Commission should continue to actively promote Australia overseas to ensure that our share of international travel is maintained. That will include the Greg Norman advertisements which will be shown in both the United States of America and Japan in April and May of this year. The campaign will be funded, of course, from the additional $23m in funding for the Tourist Commission which was announced by the Government in only December of last year.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government and the Australian Tourist Commission are not just about short term responses. It is important that the Tourist Commission's programs overseas continue at this time to ensure not only that we pick up business which is being diverted from other destinations now by fears about the war but also that they are well placed to spring back once the war ends.</PARA>

But if I could just take the rare opportunities that are offered to me by the Opposition to talk in the Senate about the waterfront and explain--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, let us have a debate on it. The setting up of the ministerial working group arose directly out of a meeting that I had late last year with the Prime Minister. The meeting with the Prime Minister was requested by me late last year to urge on all of the parties that are involved in this process-that is, the only significant overhaul of the waterfront situation in this country for half a century-the urgency that the Government places on it and the need to expedite it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the report of the Inter-State Commission on what should be done to reform the waterfront was welcomed by the Opposition. In fact, even John Sharp applauded it and supported its recommendations. The process that we have in place is absolutely based on those recommendations at that time applauded by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> Might I say, quite unblushingly, that that process rests, for its successful conclusion, on agreement. It is a process of consensus, not coercion, which this Government is giving all of the parties involved in this very important issue an opportunity to take up. It is the first best option that this Government-indeed, any government-should adopt, because it is not just getting the agreements, as I have said to the Senate before, that is important; getting them effectively implemented, that is, willingly implemented, is just as important.</PARA>
<PARA> Before we go to the second best option, which is the one the Opposition wants us to adopt now, without specifying it-this is the `take the gloves off and get tough with the unions' approach-the maximum amount of pressure has to be brought to bear on the parties. I put that view to the Prime Minister last year and suggested to him that we needed to upgrade that pressure publicly, even if it was at the slight expense of any ego I might have. The Prime Minister agreed and, I must say, I was very pleased to be able to announce the formation of this group in Sydney a fortnight ago. It has held its first meeting and that meeting was productive. As a result of that meeting there will be further meetings held this week between the Prime Minister, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, unions and myself to stress again to the parties the need to go with the first best option-that is, the agreement and consensus option-before the Government is in a position to declare that option invalid and move to the other options available to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying this: the facts are that all of the `get tough' options that are available are certainly available and I am familiar with all of them. But the situation is that these cannot be applied in parallel with getting an agreement with the waterfront unions which will provide, firstly, the best level of reform available and, secondly, the most sustainable level of reform available. The Government is committed to that process and it will be successfully resolved.</PARA>

The Minister for Industry, the Minister for Trade and the Treasurer have a direct involvement in it, as does the Prime Minister. I suggested last year that, rather than continue to have these ad hoc discussions with a whole range of Ministers, it would be useful at this time to formalise that process in a meeting of those Ministers. In fact, that has been a successful process. I welcome it. It will help put some more pressure on the parties and I am absolutely confident that the first best option-that is, reform by agreement-will be achieved and it will meet the targets set by the Government.</PARA>

On 27 August 1990, the Minister announced that the Federal Government would contribute $21m to Australian National to upgrade 100 kilometres of the Melbourne to Adelaide main line. There is, however, no plan at this stage to re-route the line. The money will be provided under the land transport development program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The work is expected to start late this year and will take three years to complete. It will involve the replacement of old wooden sleepers with gauge convertible concrete sleepers. This will reduce the travelling time between Melbourne and Adelaide by about 30 minutes, substantially reduce maintenance costs and the problem with derailments. It will also facilitate cost effective conversion of this section of the track, should a decision be taken later to standardise the gauge on this particular line.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian National expects benefits of about $1m a year to flow from this project. The improved transit times and better reliability should prove attractive to shippers and induce an increased share of freight traffic between these cities onto rail. It is the type of project that would assist the operations of the proposed national rail freight corporation. Use of concrete sleepers will mean also that, over the 50-year life span of these sleepers, 5,600 river red gums will not need to be felled.</PARA>

<PARA> The proposal that Moore sanctioned is a proposal for an eight-year, slow-track amalgamation, able to be accelerated by any of the constituent unions in particular circumstances that apply in each of the States.

<PARA> Senator McKiernan asks me what this portends for industrial relations in the building industry. I think it portends a number of quite significant and important developments. It certainly opens the way for award restructuring to be realised more practically and across the wide scope of all the classifications-trade, semi-skilled and part-skilled certificated men who operate in the building industry-in order to get a more multi-skilled, universal trades type in the building industry and achieve some of the efficiencies that that type of restructuring has achieved in other industries in Australia.</PARA>

In so far as I have been asked whether there is any investment uncertainty in relation to this issue, I think the best I can say about that is that it is constantly said to be so by the industry.</PARA>

I am not sure how the Government expects that to be done, but I would be obliged if the Government could advise us now or later whether it intends to have the second reading debate on this Bill today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had been advised that there would be a second reading debate on this Bill today, but I had assumed that the first reading had taken place yesterday or some previous date. I am not one of those who would willingly agree to a debate on a Bill of such importance on the day that it had first been read, because the provisions of the Standing Orders are clear that the second reading of a Bill should take place on a subsequent day. Presumably the Government needs the leave of the Senate to have the second reading of this Bill debated today. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless I am completely wrong in how I have read and understood the Standing Orders to this point-unless I am completely misreading them and have been under a misapprehension for 15 years-the debate on such an important measure should, in accordance with Standing Orders, take place on a subsequent day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hate to have to confirm to Senator Harradine that he has been under a misapprehension for the last 15 years. Leave is not required in order to bring on a Bill in this way; it requires affirmation by the Senate of the motion that I will shortly move, namely, that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour of the day. That is the motion that I will move today rather than the more familiar motion that the debate be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. So it is a matter not of leave but of Senate resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bringing on of the Bill at a later hour of the day is, of course, a function of the urgency of this measure which, as I am advised, has to be passed this week. I hope that we can have cooperation in this respect from Senator Harradine, not to mention the rest of the Senate, in order to enable that debate to proceed, because of the magnitude and significance of the monetary allocation that is required. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Harradine that, while his point is well taken, we are not talking about substantive pieces of legislation, multiple clauses and Bills which need time to be read and absorbed, even if they have been around in another place for some time. When we are dealing with an appropriation Bill of the kind that this is-it is a short and simple measure, the only thing that changes from year to year being the date, the sum of money involved and the nature of the issues that one might expect to be debated in the context of a Bill such as this-we are not likely to need advance notice and preparation in relation to the specific terms of the Bill itself. So, while acknowledging the general point that Senator Harradine makes, I hope that we can proceed to endorse the motion I am about to move. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1990-91 totalling $234.1 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for certain proposed expenditure for the ordinary annual services of Government, in addition to the amounts which were appropriated by Parliament at Budget time. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1990-91 contains provision under Division 310 for an Advance to the Minister for Finance of $170 million to enable the Minister to make money available, inter alia, for expenditure which is urgently required and was unforeseen at the time of preparation of the Bill for that Act. However, departments have foreshadowed likely calls on the Advance, prior to the availability of funds from the Additional Estimates Bills, which significantly exceed the funds remaining in the Advance. Forecast requirements amount to some $291.6 million prior to the beginning of June, whilst only $84.4 million remains available. The sum appropriated to the Advance to the Minister for Finance in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1990-91 under Division 868 is, of course, not available for expenditure for the ordinary annual services of Government. Passage of the present Bill will alleviate pressure on the Advance. </PARA>
<PARA> The amounts in this Bill are being sought in advance of the Additional Estimates to meet urgent requirements which have arisen as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the repercussions of the invasion, of the subsequent United Nations' sanctions against Iraq and of the current hostilities in the Gulf to end the illegal occupation of Kuwait will affect Australia for some time to come. This Government has played an active role in support of the United Nations' sanctions. That role has not been without cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before this Chamber provides for $181.4 million for payment by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board, which were insured under the National Interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act. Iraq discontinued payments on its wheat debt after the imposition of the UN trade sanctions, and it is now considered unlikely that any payments will be made in the foreseeable future. This amount, to meet the Government's immediate obligation under National Interest insurance provisions, is payable prior to funds becoming available under the Additional Estimates and is to meet payments falling due on the first of each month. An additional payment of $29.7 million will be required in June, and this will be included in the Additional Estimates. Further claims, totalling $247 million in 1991-92 and $34 million in 1992-93 at current exchange rates, are anticipated. These will be handled in the course of the normal Budget appropriation processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides $52.7 million for the Department of Defence to meet equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Force to the Middle East. In addition to the costs of the deployment itself, additional expenditure has been incurred in Australia through the provision of stores and the fitting of additional equipment to vessels to counter the increased threat in the Gulf, and through the extra training and exercises conducted to ensure that our ships were at a full state of readiness before they reached the Gulf. Total supplementation for Defence costs associated with the Gulf deployment amounts to $68.9 million in 1990-91; the balance of $16.2 million will be included in the Additional Estimates. A further $27.5 million will be provided in subsequent years: $23.6 million in 1991-92 and $3.9 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has brought this Bill before the Chamber now because the amounts included in it are being sought in advance of the Additional Estimates to meet urgent expenditure. I am confident that honourable senators will join me in supporting this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Bjelke-Petersen) adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Gareth Evans) proposed:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make it clear that the usual efficiency on the part of the Parliamentary Relations Office was undertaken this morning and I knew that there was to be a second reading debate. That was not the point that I was making. I had assumed that the first reading of the Appropriation Bill had taken place yesterday. The motion moved by Senator Bjelke-Petersen was that the debate be adjourned. The motion now before the House is that resumption of debate be made an order of the day for a later hour this day. Mr President, I refer you to standing order 112, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>After the first reading, a future day shall be appointed for the second reading of the bill, and the bill shall be printed. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is the case, on the face of it there should be a preamble to the motion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) which indicates that so much of the standing orders be suspended as would enable the adjourned debate to take place at a later hour this day. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter particularly because I acknowledge that the Minister has said that in the normal course of events these matters would be considered on a later day. But I still maintain that on an important measure such as this the spirit of the Standing Orders should be observed. I would be interested to know how the Minister can move that motion in the light of the clear indication in standing order 112, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Except in respect of bills which the Senate may not amend, the question-That this bill be now read a first time-shall be put by the President immediately after the bill has been received, and shall be determined without amendment or debate. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) In respect of bills which the Senate may not amend, the question-That this bill be now read a first time-may be debated, and in the debate matters relevant and not relevant to the subject matter of the bill may be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) On every order for the reading of a bill the title only shall be read. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) After the first reading, a future day shall be appointed for the second reading of the bill, and the bill shall be printed. </PARA>
<PARA>We have had the first reading and I would have thought that, on the face of it, the standing order indicates that the second reading should be dealt with on a future day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take up this afternoon the theme that I was pursuing last evening in explaining why the Opposition is opposing the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990. I had made the point, during the course of my speech last night, that although Iraq is a party to the four Geneva conventions it has not constrained its behaviour or its actions. I cited many of the things that Iraq has perpetrated during the course of this war. I referred to the use of missiles on the populations in the suburbs of Jerusalem. Indeed, if we go back further we can recall the use of chemical warfare against ethnic members of its own community, namely the Kurds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement to the Convention by Iraq was not by signature but by act of accession, yet still that country is not constrained in its behaviour. Last night I pointed out to the Senate, and I do so again, that simply to ratify the protocol that is the subject of this Bill would, in fact, in no way ameliorate our enemy's behaviour and would, indeed, act, or could act, as a fetter on the proper conduct of the war in a way that I will outline during the course of the rest of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind the Senate just precisely what the four conventions are which Australia is seeking to ratify and, indeed, to which Iraq has acceded. Firstly, there is a convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field; secondly, a convention for the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea; thirdly, a convention relevant to the treatment of prisoners of war; and, fourthly, a convention relevant to the protection of civilian persons in time of war. </PARA>
<PARA> These conventions became part of our domestic law in 1957 under the Geneva Conventions Act. Under that Act it became an indictable offence for a person in Australia or elsewhere to commit, aid, abet or procure the commission by another person of a grave breach of any of the conventions. I have already given the Senate examples of where Iraq has breached those Conventions. I mentioned the allied pilots captured by Iraqi forces who were humiliated, beaten and forced to make false statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1977 protocols, which are the subject, as I have said, of the Bill, were an attempt to codify the existing treaty and customary international law relating to the rules of warfare and add new law to govern the conduct of hostilities. The result is complex and uncertain. For the Government to simply say that the Australian defence forces have no quarrel with their implementation, and indeed there is no way in which our own forces could be wrongly caught by the provisions of the Bill, is simply unable to be said with certainty. As I have said, the resulting codification of existing law and the protocols is complex and uncertain. This is evidenced by a commentary on these additional protocols which was published in Geneva in 1987, a formidable document of some 1,625 pages-surely not necessary if the law was to be clear-cut. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is thus opposing the legislation. Reasons that we include for opposing the Bill are these: our allies, the United States, take the view that the protocol is fundamentally and irreconcilably flawed and that a number of the provisions of the protocol are militarily unacceptable. Left wing members of the Government have argued in this chamber that somehow that is an indictment of us because we are agreeing with our allies and they engaged in their usual form of United States bashing. On the other hand, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in his letter to former President Reagan, acknowledged that the protocol contains a number of ambiguities and operational complexities. </PARA>
<PARA> If in our region, for instance, our allies and potential adversaries had not ratified the protocol, the benefits of the protocol would appear to be more illusory than real. The impact of the obligations on the Australian Defence Force (ADF) are real and immediate in terms of training obligations and operational restrictions. In practice, our adversaries-whether they be nation states or liberation movements-may only pay lip service to their obligations under the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> The protocol is vague. It is excessively legalistic. This is perhaps illustrated by the fact that article 82 requires that a legal adviser be available to advise military commanders on the application of the protocol and its effect upon military manoeuvres. Clearly, that is almost something which one would expect to be written into a farce. The preceding comment is further illustrated by the open-ended nature of article 5 which prohibits the use of unspecified methods of warfare which may-and the word is `may'-cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. One immediately asks the question: in whose judgment, and is the judgment to be made before or after the event?</PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, certain Government speakers made statements which inferred that the Australian defence forces were in fact content to go along with the protocols passing into our domestic law; whereas the more accurate view would be this: that in attempting to protect civilians, protocol No. 1 places unrealistic limitations on fighting forces. The Gulf war has provided ample example of the way the protocol would complicate matters. The destruction of civilian infrastructure, including roads, airfields, oil refineries and water supplies, may be essential to reducing an opponent's capacity to fight, but the protocol outlaws those attacks. </PARA>
<PARA> The protocol also limits the use of covert operations. It places unrealistic requirements on identification of enemy combatants, which is particularly problematic in guerilla war, and by restricting attacks which would have led to environmental damage by limiting scope for retaliatory strikes. One even asks whether that well-known tactic which became quite famous during World War II, which was made famous in a movie called The Man Who Never Was, would now be considered an acceptable tactic. It was a method of misleading the enemy as to what the intention for the invasion was to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The view of the Australian Defence Force is perhaps better expressed this way: the ADF's legal section has decided that the Defence Force could `live with' the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> This is hardly what we would call an enthusiastic endorsement and one not shared by many front-end force commanders. The problem, of course, which the ADF has is that this piece of legislation is a matter of government policy and, therefore, in a very real way, it is constrained in taking an active stance. However, in the quasi-official Defence Force Journal the view was put:</PARA>
<PARA>The ADF has not promoted ratification of the Protocols, that being a Governmental responsibility, but has acted responsibly in providing advice on their military acceptability. There is more than a semantic difference between the two positions but there is some danger of the two being merged in coming months before resumption of the debate in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That article was dated January-February 1991. As I said last night, the timing of this legislation being brought on to debate was extraordinary to say the least. In the middle of hostilities, when we have our troops exposed, it has become quite clear that the left wing of the Australian Labor Party has managed to roll the more sound voices in the Government to bring it on and the Government is simply pacifying the Left by allowing the debate to come on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other place my colleague Mr Peacock went into considerable detail to outline precisely which provisions of the protocol would impair the conduct of the proper affairs of the allied commanders in the Gulf. He outlined some of the following: the articles contain a blanket prohibition against the right of reprisal; the protocol forbids the use of weaponry likely to cause, as I mentioned before, superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering; it prohibits attacks on dams, dykes and nuclear power stations; it prescribes the distinction between military and civilian objectives; it prohibits attacks that may cause incidental loss of civilian life-and we have already seen examples of that-it obliges nations to ensure that legal advisers are available at all times to advise military commanders on their obligations under the protocol-as I said, something that perhaps would have been worthy of Gilbert and Sullivan. </PARA>
<PARA> The prohibition against reprisals is also particularly problematic. Let us take the current position of Israel. Under the protocol, if one party to a conflict-in this case Iraq-causes a fundamental breach of the protocol, the other party-Israel-is still bound to conduct its affairs in conformity with the provisions of the protocol. Are we then to assume that Israel's right to self-defence, as recognised in article 51 of the United Nations Charter is to be withheld? Israel's restraint is laudable and has been widely recognised but its right to self-defence is also recognised and ought to be preserved. Are we to believe that any measured and proportional response in which Israel must be forced to engage is to be prohibited by the protocol and that that act of self- defence would make the Israelis war criminals?</PARA>
<PARA> One should be aware that the mere fact of reprisal has considerable effectiveness in deterring aggression and preventing or bringing to an end breaches of international law. The Cold War victory of the West over the Warsaw Pact was founded on the strength of deterrence, as was borne out by the fear of reprisals. The appeasers in the Australian Democrats and their associates on the Left should consider the importance of the preservation of the right of reprisals and understand that it has led to multilateral nuclear disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not pacifism, weakness or unilateral measures that brought to an end the Cold War; it was deterrence, resolve and the preservation of international rights, such as the right of reprisal, which would be outlawed. To this point in the Gulf war, we have seen the United States preserve its right to respond in kind should Iraq resort to biological or chemical warfare. This has surely influenced Hussein's decision against such warfare up to this time. That is why last night I raised the question of controversy over the question of the bombardment of the shelter in Baghdad, the death of civilians, the contention that it was a military installation, the contention by others that it could have been either jointly a military installation used by civilians or, indeed, that it could have been a ploy by Saddam Hussein to give him some justification to begin to use chemical warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the sort of high-tech war that we are now engaged in, where we are amazed continually about the capacity to have accurate targeting and the stated intention of the allies to use targeted bombardment for military purposes only, is that it has led us to expect that the technology will always make it accurate. The Opposition has chosen to oppose the ratification of protocol I for the simple reason that it believes that there is adequate provision within international law as it is to act as both a punishment and a deterrent to people acting in a way which civilised people believe is not acceptable. We oppose it because we believe that the protocol places an unfair and burdensome restriction upon the ability of our own armed forces to conduct war to their best endeavours, bearing in mind that our point of view and the bipartisan point of view is that Australia is presently engaged in this war because we want a just peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Archbishop of Canterbury elect, at the service which opened this Parliament last week, said he had to draw issue with those who wanted peace at any price. He said that we could only have peace with justice. Therefore, when we are looking at the way in which we act and prosecute that war, we want just peace and not peace at any price. The protesters who simply quote slogans and say, `Stop it, and it will all go away.' do not realise that if one person's aggression is such that reasonableness, argument, logic and discussion will not bring about a just peace, then we must pursue the resolutions of the United Nations and pursue that just peace. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with a good deal of care, concern, discernment, logic and compassion that the Opposition is opposing the implementation and the passing of this Bill, because we believe that it is not in the interests of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to note that these protocols have been under debate for some years and that the Government has, so far, twice failed to ratify the signing of the protocols, despite having promised to do so five years ago. I am glad that we are at last discussing them, although very sadly we are doing so under the cloud of war. It is ironic that Australia originally signed the protocols at the time of the Fraser Government, so I am curious to know why the Liberal Party has chosen to change its position and what pressure it has come under to do so. Has the pressure come from the military in Australia? That is doubtful, despite the campaign of retired Brigadier P. J. Greville against the protocols.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans announced that Australia would ratify the protocols some five years ago, as I have indicated, and it is obvious that the Government's failure to do this is due to a lack of public interest in the issue and opposition from the Liberal Party. This opposition has been well aired by a number of speakers in the debate on the subject in the other place and it makes pathetic reading in Hansard. The honourable member for Kooyong, Mr Peacock, partly justified his decision to vote against ratification by referring to opposition to the protocols by what he called our major ally, the United States. We have just heard that reiterated by Senator Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA> Brigadier Greville provided the text in an article in the Pacific Defence Reporter in October 1988 when he quoted the then US President, Ronald Reagan, as believing that protocol I was fundamentally and irreconcilably flawed while his joint Chiefs of Staff concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of the provisions of the protocol are militarily unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what has been trotted out from the Opposition both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate last night and this afternoon-it is unacceptable militarily to the United States command. Obviously, under a coalition government, our foreign policy would be determined exclusively in Washington instead of only mostly, as is the case with the Hawke Government, and exclusively with military criteria applied as designated by the Pentagon. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a cause for some concern, but it is distressing to see that the coalition now chooses to oppose these protocols by looking over its shoulder at what the Americans think. I wonder who briefed Mr Peacock on all those clauses to the protocols that he objected to when he spoke on the subject on 12 February. Having just heard Senator Bishop's contribution referring to our allies' views on the military unacceptability of the protocols, the source of that pressure is pretty obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor do I have any doubt that the United States takes no notice what Australia thinks before making its decision. It takes no notice whatsoever of Australia's views and this has been demonstrated time and time again. I find it humiliating that the coalition behaves in this way as though Australian concerns are taken into account by the United States military. They dictate and the Australians obviously follow suit with very little critical analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that while the United States has not signed the protocols, 11 North Atlantic Treaty Organisation nations have signed them, including the United Kingdom and France, while others, including Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany, have ratified the protocols. I do not propose to go into the details of the protocols as much has already been said on the subject in here and in the other place for those interested enough to read about what is on the agenda but just from listening to Senator Bishop a moment ago, I cannot help say that all the prohibitions that she listed would be commendable rather than something to be afraid of. </PARA>
<PARA> Principally, I want to point out that the signing of these protocols is a matter of setting standards. It is no good pointing the finger at the other countries and saying that they have signed the protocols but then ignore them. Unfortunately, that is the case. As earlier speakers in the House of Representatives pointed out, war is not a nice matter, although they went on to add that it was sometimes a regrettable necessity. One of the problems of embarking on a war is that standards go out the window, they just go by the board-and that is across the board as well. Atrocities are committed on all sides in a conflict. A look at any military conflict will prove that point. </PARA>
<PARA> We embark on a war with noble aims, but in this century alone we can recall how the Boer War ended up with concentration camps; the First World War saw the use of gas; the Second World War ended up with gas chambers, obliteration bombing and nuclear weapons. In each major war this century, civilians have become increasingly the primary casualties. In the Gulf we are seeing the same phenomenon with the deaths of civilians now referred to as collateral damage, in sanitised Pentagon jargon-highly offensive. These deaths are always accidental, of course, caused by the evil tactics of the other side in hiding military facilities under a civilian bunker to score a propaganda victory, for example. Fortunately, the Sunday Times has now revealed that the Pentagon has conceded that the bombing of the Baghdad shelter was a mistake, but it would be good to get a public admission which our own Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) could then concede after his initial comment, taking the official day-after-Pentagon line. It is highly embarrassing that our Government just takes the Pentagon line and then sometimes gets caught out as in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Another justification for opposing ratification of these protocols concerns the fact that they involve wars of liberation. Most of the 30 or so wars going on in the world today are civil wars or wars of liberation. I suspect that many future wars will be along the same lines as the world tries to sort out its longstanding differences, many of them a hangover from the colonial era. This convention and its protocols are important, precisely because of this. I realise that they will be particularly hard to enforce because so many of these conflicts are wars of liberation, but that is where I come back to the setting of standards and that is really what most United Nations conventions are all about. </PARA>
<PARA> We worry a lot about victims in crime, but in war we seem to be more concerned about the boys and girls in the front line. I fail to understand why we call them that so often. Senator Bishop referred to them in that way when she was speaking yesterday. Perhaps it is because we are so conditioned to ageing politicians sending our young men and women off to fight their wars-the fruit of our youth being sent away to kill or be killed. In the Gulf war we seem almost totally fixated by the high-tech weapons as the media has been carefully sanitised to avoid the mistakes of the Vietnam war by not showing too many bodies. What bodies there are have mostly been on the Iraqi side, both military and civilian. </PARA>
<PARA> As I observed earlier, civilians are increasingly the victims in modern war. In the Second World War, there were 50 per cent of casualties in the civilian area; in Korea, 80 per cent; and in Vietnam, 90 per cent. The report of the International Red Cross Society on casualties in conflict, which was released in Melbourne last month, reiterated this latest figure of 90 per cent of casualties being civilians and pointed out that five million people were killed in armed conflicts in 1988-89 and at least 32 million wounded. Of course, this is often a cost of the war that people who take the country to war do not want to acknowledge. It is not only the bodies but the leftovers-the new generation of veterans-that we are creating when we have not dealt with the last ones yet. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition speakers tell us that war is nasty and it is unfortunate that civilians get hurt. But we have to be sensible and practical and we must not do anything to hinder the armed services. I noted with interest Senator Faulkner's comments yesterday on the bombing of the civilians in the Baghdad bunker, and agree with him that surely the United States would not have deliberately bombed civilians. For example, if the United States were to ratify these protocols and keep to them absolutely, this war crime would not have been committed. I do not blame only the United States carelessness for this gross error, Australia is also responsible and we have to look at the role of Pine Gap. It is quite possible that the targeting information, which was obviously erroneous for that bombing raid to occur, was transmitted through Pine Gap. Pine Gap is one of the chief sources of satellite pictures and military interception of messages. The fact is that war and atrocities go together. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq, of course, is also guilty of war crimes many times over in using chemical weapons against its own people, in its aggression against Kuwait, and in deliberately targeting Israeli civilians. If countries such as the United States and Australia were to ratify these protocols, we could bring a great deal more weight to bear on countries ignoring them-such as Iraq-rather than pussyfooting around and saying that if Libya and Syria signed them, then they are meaningless and we should not take any notice of them either. That is just not a logical position. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no justification for ignoring the attempts to set some ground rules for war. I abhor all war and feel very saddened that so many countries are now engaged in senseless slaughter in the Gulf, which will do nothing to solve the political problems and bids for power in the Middle East. The slaughter and its aftermath of increased enmity towards the West will add to those problems enormously. </PARA>
<PARA> War always brings certain casualties: truth, of course, is one of the first; human lives lost; ongoing suffering of millions of people whose lives are shattered, and of their families; environmental damage; and wastage of vast resources in both human and financial terms. We must not overlook the fact that war is dehumanising and absolutely brutalising because atrocities are always committed by all sides. It is nothing short of government ordered and organised killing; that is, murder on a massive scale. We must stop this killing not only because it will not fix the problems of the Middle East, but also because it is totally unacceptable on moral grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I must reiterate that the anti-war position taken by so many ordinary citizens around the world is not one of appeasement, as Senator Bishop so recently claimed, but a position which challenges the blinkered view that the only option is war. Of course Saddam Hussein must be stopped, but not by war; not by the desecration of Kuwait; not by the killing of innocent Iraqis; and not by offering as victims the hundreds of thousands of young service men and women who are increasingly being called `the cash register coalition'-that is, cobbled together by paying off this country and that to get them on side. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said before, sanctions would have worked given time. Negotiations should now be given a chance to be worked out, especially with the latest Soviet initiative. The Government of Australia must be criticised for its hypocrisy in championing Amnesty International's campaign to abolish the death penalty. I totally support that campaign. How the Prime Minister can square support for that campaign to abolish the death penalty, and yet send young Australians off to war to kill or be killed is hard to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has obviously, for some mysterious reason, changed its position and taken up an oppositionist stand to these protocols, which was not its position some years ago. Perhaps it comes down to Senator MacGibbon's expressed concern that such guidelines might prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction-chemical, biological and nuclear. He actually mentioned all these weapons yesterday. The Liberal-National coalition does not want that sort of constraint placed upon the military, they obviously want to keep those options open. That is indeed a shameful admission. I find it really hard to cope with people who come in here and argue that they want the options to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons left open for this country at some future time. Yet, that is exactly what the Opposition senators and members in the House of Representatives are arguing by their opposition to these protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Bishop: what sort of just peace is there she seems to think the cash register coalition is working and fighting for peace in the Gulf-when women and children are going to be the prime victims? The under 15-year-old age group makes up half of the Iraqi population. Those people are not responsible for their leaders' dictatorial, aggressive behaviours. Why should they be made to pay? This is not the way for brave people to seek peace with justice, it is the cowards way to obliterate the state of Iraq. The United States' objective is to make Iraq cease to function as a nation state and not to liberate Kuwait. That is absolute nonsense. It might have been an earlier stated objective but, behind that stated objective, there has been another agenda which has been very clear from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the United States not prepared to listen to the initiatives which Iraq made last Friday, although there were conditions attached? They were dismissed out of hand by our Government as well. There was no attempt, on the part of this Government, to convince the United States that enough slaughter had taken place; that the lesson had surely been learned. If Iraq were prepared to withdraw from Kuwait, that should have been heeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Americans are determined to go into a ground war-one can feel it when one watches the television reports; one can sense it from the way the military advisers are saying their readiness is now complete-and the Soviet initiative for peace is a very great interference with their timetable. It is irritating to them in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject Senator Bishop's allegation that the peace movement around the world is for peace at any price. We are not appeasers; we are not for peace at any price. We agree that Saddam Hussein must be stopped, but not by the senseless slaughter which is going to create problems in the future that we can hardly even imagine. As I mentioned before, the environmental costs alone would be enough to call for the cessation of this slaughter right now, because it is going to produce enormous consequences to the global atmosphere, to say nothing of the water supplies in the Gulf and the desert ecology. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many grounds for calling a cease-fire right now and yet we have people in here saying, `We do not want to limit the military in any way at all. We want to allow the military to do what it will, and to do what it thinks it must in the time of war'. I find that morally unacceptable. Although I very clearly disagree with the Government's endorsement of the United States-led war in the Gulf, I do support its decision finally to ratify these protocols. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking this afternoon in replacement of Senator Spindler who was going to take our part in the debate at this point. I personally support the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990, Senator Spindler personally supports the Bill and the Australian Democrats as a Party support the Bill for the reasons which have been outlined by the previous speaker, Senator Vallentine. The Bill, as other senators have said, seeks to provide increased protection for civilians and prisoners of war during international armed conflicts by authorising the Government to ratify protocol I. As the explanatory memorandum and other notes indicate, protocol II would also be ratified but does not require legislative change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth pointing out at this stage, as others have done, that we are debating this piece of legislation at a very interesting time. Senator Vallentine pointed out that it has been around for quite a long time and that successive governments have been rather slow in moving to pass legislation which would allow this ratification. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes at a time when the Australian Government, together with other governments under a multinational force-not, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations has repeatedly pointed out, a United Nations force but a multinational force-is engaged in an act of war in the Middle East. Several speakers, particularly from the Opposition, have been at some pains to criticise the position which the Democrats and Senator Vallentine have taken in relation to this war, so I think it is appropriate for me also to reiterate the position that we are not, as Senator Vallentine said, appeasers. We are not for a resolution of that conflict-which has been initiated by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait-without justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Where we take issue with both the Government and the Opposition is that we believe it would be more appropriate to seek a resolution to that conflict-as United Nation resolutions 660 and 661 anticipated-through the longer use of effective sanctions. All the evidence, including Central Intelligence Agency reports, was that sanctions were indeed working. That by no means is appeasement. That by no means is seeking a resolution of this conflict without justice. It is indeed seeking a resolution of the conflict with justice but by different means. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also reflect-because we are dealing here with the protection of civilians in times of war-on the question which was asked at Question Time today by Senator Bishop when she asked the President a question in relation to the demonstrators outside this Parliament. She linked her clear abhorrence of the behaviour of those who would protest this war with a question in relation to the preparation of the cells under Parliament House. I cannot help but, in my mind, link her vociferous objection to this legislation which is now before us with the attitude which she displayed in asking that question, because I find in that question and the line which one draws through that question an incredible sense of both cruelty and intolerance toward those who hold a different view with respect to this war. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the attitude which is guiding the Opposition-I hope it is not; I hope it is confined to only a few members-in relation to the ratification of this Geneva Convention, then I am indeed deeply disturbed. As I indicated earlier, protocol II provides similar protection, that is, to civilians and prisoners of war in situations of noninternational armed conflict-that is, in armed conflicts in which people are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination. I think that is particularly appropriate at this time when around the world we have many of those conflicts going on-in Central America and in many nations in Africa. We have seen the horrific suppression of tribes in the case of some African nations where a different tribe has achieved a position of dominance, and the right of self-determination and the right to human dignity have been very much impinged upon. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, protocol II does not require legislative authority for the Government's ratification, but will be ratified when the Government receives legislative authority to ratify protocol I. Examples of the specific protections extended by protocol I are as follows: the protection of civilian medical units; prohibition on starving civilian populations-that is, a prohibition on attacking, destroying or removing food unless it is used by military forces; and precautionary measures to remove civilians from the vicinity of military objectives. Prohibitions and obligations are qualified in terms of feasibility during armed conflict; that is, care is taken to ensure that the safety of military personnel is not endangered. I would have thought that that really is the point that has been ignored by the Opposition when seeking rather wider and less restrained powers for the military in arguing against these protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> This answers the claim by the Opposition that this Bill endangers the lives and safety of Australian defence forces. In fact, the Opposition's claim is a slur on Australian military personnel, who would, I am sure, reject any suggestion that they would be prepared to kill women and children to enhance their own military objectives or even their own safety. It is regrettable that the Opposition has chosen to oppose this legislation, which seeks to extend humanitarian principles as far as that is possible in military conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension made by protocol II is welcome. As Dr Catley documented during the debate in the other place, there have been 160 wars since the 1949 Geneva Convention, and many were in the category of internal conflict, often in pursuit of the United Nations declaration guaranteeing the self-determination of peoples. As I have indicated, one can find right at this instant many examples of those sorts of conflicts in which there are absolutely horrific impacts on the civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats reject war as a means of conflict resolution, but if it becomes unavoidable then we must continue to develop legal protection for innocent victims. I would interpolate here, returning again to the example of the Middle East war at this time, that we do not believe that, at the time when the multinational force, composed principally of American forces-not a United Nations force-chose war as the means to resolve the Middle East conflict, we had reached that stage at which war was unavoidable. We believe a much more extensive period of sanctions would have been entirely appropriate. It may well be that eventually we would have reached a situation in which war became unavoidable. It may have become unavoidable because, indeed, Saddam Hussein may have begun military conflict by invading Saudi Arabia or attacking the defensive forces which were aligned against him for the purposes of imposing the sanctions. It may have become unavoidable. So we are not, as Democrats, in that sense totally opposed to the use of war under all circumstances. But under these circumstances we believe that we had not reached that stage-not by a very long chalk indeed. So it is in that context that Senator Knowles's definition of article 48 as impractical deserves considerable contempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Article 48 says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clearly the central provision of this legislation. I reiterate, despite Senator Knowles's interjection, that I find that concern over article 48, expressed by Senator Knowles, quite contemptible. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there were other provisions which the Opposition felt it could not support. In effect, the Opposition's position means that it is in favour of the use of weaponry that may cause `superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering'-article 35 (2). The Opposition is in favour of `attacks against dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations'. I interpolate that an attack on a nuclear power station potentially may release far more radiation than would be released in many deliberate nuclear explosions. The amount of radioactivity inside a 1,000 megawatt power station, for example, is such that an attack, with the release of radioactive material in its core, would be absolutely devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in the case of the Chernobyl fire the total inventory of radioactive material was by no means completely released. So there are long term consequences of deliberate attacks on nuclear installations not only for the civilian population present at the time of the conflict but for the civilian population many, many decades-perhaps 100 years-afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 the sixth report on environmental pollution-the so-called Flowers report-in Great Britain, which looked at the consequences of an extension of nuclear power generation, was released. That report contained a line that had nuclear power been in use at the time of the Second World War, many parts of central Europe would still be uninhabitable as a consequence of pollution by caesium-137. As I recall, that report was released some 31 years after the end of the war. So the Opposition is opposed to article 56 (1) which seeks to prevent attacks on dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, even if `they are not direct military targets'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not in favour of provisions which prescribe the measures by which `combatants shall distinguish themselves from the civilian population'- article 44 (3). The Opposition is not supporting the `distinction between military and civilian objectives'-articles 48, 49 (1) and 49 (2). The Opposition is prepared to countenance attacks which may cause `incidental loss of civilian life'-articles 52 and 57. The Opposition is not prepared to concede that nations should be obliged to have legal advisers available `at all times' to advise military commanders of their obligations under the protocol. In other words, the Opposition really is favouring a free-for-all on civilians in the event of war, without adequate protection. </PARA>
<PARA> In adopting these stances the Opposition has confirmed that its views of armed conflict date back to the Middle Ages. Senator MacGibbon was at pains to point this out during the debate yesterday. Of course, if one reflects over the full gamut of human history and goes back to pre-human history, one finds that Homo sapiens descended from a line of gregarious primates who from time immemorial have lived in small groups defending territory by means of armed conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Democrats are saying is that we would hope that after some six million years of human evolution, and at a time when, through our ingenuity-but certainly not through our intelligence-we have devised the most horrific means of inflicting harm and damage on our fellow human beings, we had achieved a degree of intelligence which would cause us to seek means of conflict resolution other than the use of those horrific weapons of war. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator MacGibbon almost proudly pointed out in the debate yesterday, war has been part of human history, in his view, for 500 years. I would remind him that it has been part of human history for perhaps six million years. He seemed to be indicating that it is an inevitable part of the human future. I simply point out that if it is going to be part of the human future, there will be no future for humans. We must, as a matter of urgent priority, seek other means to resolve these international and intertribal conflicts. We believe that the Government deserves credit for this Bill. In conclusion, the Democrats will be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Government's action to ratify the protocols additional to the Geneva Convention which aim to protect the innocent victims of international armed conflicts. I believe that it is important to support the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill during a time when innocent civilians, including women and children, are being killed and injured in the Gulf war. While supporting Australia's part in this war, I am gravely disturbed by reports that civilian targets have been hit. Civilians must be spared in time of war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Protocol I updates and strengthens the `laws of Geneva' that protect the wounded, sick, shipwrecked, prisoners of war and civilians caught up in war. The basic principle of international humanitarian law is that warfare is not unlimited. Countries do not have an open policy on the killing of civilians. This means that in military operations, combatants must always distinguish between the civilian population and the enemy. To spell it out, indiscriminate attacks are those which are not directed at specific military objectives; which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; which employ a method or means of combat, the effects of which cannot be limited as required by the protocols; and which strike military objectives or civilian objectives without distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> If Saddam Hussein, as has been claimed and reported in the popular press, is deliberately placing civilians close to military targets, he is acting contrary to the Hague Convention and there are no words to describe what action should be taken against him. I think at this stage it is worth noting two press reports which contain accusations that have been made against Saddam Hussein in relation to putting civilians within bomb shelters. One headline states, `US bombs hit crowded shelter'. Another states, `US admits bunker strike a mistake'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether one can take note of all press reports or whether one can apportion blame in relation to the striking of that shelter, but I believe that, in the long term, with Australia supporting these protocols, it is important that the whole affair be investigated and those responsible brought to justice when the war in the Gulf is resolved. Unfortunately the Butcher of Bagdad does not play by the rules or support the Geneva Convention. We are talking about a man who deployed innocent civilians to military targets and who paraded, before the media, prisoners of war who had been the victims of merciless torture, both mental and physical. Other tyrants and warmongers may be deterred from acts of aggression against civilians by the knowledge that the very consequences of their actions would received massive condemnation from the United Nations and from the world community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> When studying the history of war throughout the generations, one finds that there has always been massive destruction of innocent civilians. I cite the recent Vietnam war in which this country was involved. Although a minor war when compared with the major conflicts of World War I and World War II, thousands of civilians were killed and more suffered from the effects of bombing and the use of Agent Orange. So too in Cambodia where millions, including an entire generation of illiterate Cambodians, were killed in order to subjugate the rest of the population. Africa has been a bloodbath for decades with documented atrocities in Mozambique and Angola. The action of Russia in Afghanistan was another useless minor war. And there are many more. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have Saddam Hussein's actions against the Kurds where, because of the use of chemical warfare, people sustained horrific burns and disfigurement, with many dying. Our friends, the Americans, had their proxy war in Central America. That was certainly a low intensity situation but nevertheless they encouraged civil war in an effort to get rid of the Sandinista Government. There is no doubt that war, whether major or minor, will continue. Therefore, it is imperative that all sides of the Senate support the ratification of protocol I which at the same time ratifies protocol II. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Iraq where innocent victims of war-for instance, women and children caught in Kuwait through no fault of their own-were used as hostages for the military should not be allowed to happen again. That these people were eventually allowed to go free is a win for diplomacy and confirms that there is an urgent need for the ratification of the protocols so that any similar move in the future may be attacked with more armoury at the ready. Although we cannot hope that all countries will behave in what we consider to be a civilised or humane manner towards civilians during wartime, with measures such as the protocols set in place we can show what nations will accept and what they will not tolerate during acts of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Consideration should be given to the additional fact that the United Nations is also prepared to take action to stamp out acts of aggression against civilians and innocents. The protocols make it extremely difficult for countries that engage in crimes contrary to the Geneva Convention to escape dealing with other nations in relation to those crimes and they will face the consequences. With the ratification of the protocols, crime against innocents, looting, rape, deprivation of liberty, barbaric medical experiments, suicide missions and many other activities should be discouraged by this international agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Bill was put forward by the Government on 2 March 1989, it was withdrawn because it was not supported by all sides of the Senate. It is to be hoped that on this occasion-and it appears from the debate that this is the case-the protocols and Australia's support of them will at last be supported by the entire Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill is one for which a great deal of groundwork has been done, not only within Australia but also overseas. I do not intend to go over all the ground canvassed by other speakers in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly the intentions of this Bill and of the protocols are laudable. However, a number of concerns have been expressed not only during this debate but also over quite a period about the actual application of certain articles of the protocols. These concerns have been canvassed in this debate. They were also canvassed when this legislation was first mooted some time ago. At that stage it was the desire of the Government-a quite legitimate desire-that there be a bipartisan approach to these questions because of their importance. That bipartisan approach has not been able to be achieved because the Opposition and quite a number of other people see a number of problems in the application of certain provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we get it right because the legislation has come before us precisely because we are implementing into domestic law certain of, I suppose, the burdens that are placed on this country because of its ratification. It is therefore essential that we know precisely, and are clear on, what the articles mean. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of interest to note that the Government itself has proposed certain declarations in order to clarify interpretation in areas where there are some elements of doubt. I have a copy of the proposed Australian declarations of understanding on accession to the first additional protocol to the 1949 Geneva Convention. It is clear from that proposed Australian declaration that there are elements of doubt in the first additional protocol at all events, even in the mind of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that I am asking-and no doubt the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) will be able to give a response when he replies to the second reading debate or, indeed, in the Committee of the Whole-is why the Government decided that it would propose a declaration of understanding on accession to the first additional protocol rather than a reservation. The appropriateness of having a declaration as distinct from a reservation is rather unclear. It seems to me, though I am subject to correction, that a reservation would have a more binding effect legally than a declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will realise, this matter has been canvassed on a number of occasions, including in the chapter entitled `Australian Treaty Practice and Procedure' in the second edition of Ryan's International Law in Australia, where the question of reservations and the definitions of a reservation are dealt with. On page 68 of that work it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The distinction between reservations and other devices such as declarations, observations and interpretive statements is a fine one. Although the test is expressed in Art. 2 (2) (d)--</PARA>
<PARA>of the Vienna Convention-</PARA>
<PARA>to be whether or not the device purports to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty, the Convention offers little guidance on how to make an objective determination to that end. Indeed, given the decentralised decision-making process of the international legal system, it may be open to question whether such a determination is possible at all. It has been suggested, for instance, that an interpretive statement is distinguishable from a reservation since it is simply a mechanism by which a State seeks ``to interpret the treaty or part of it in a particular manner thereby indicates its perception of its obligations under the treaty''. Yet if it has the effect, nevertheless, of limiting or modifying the terms of a treaty a statement of this sort may equally be regarded as a reservation within the meaning of the Convention. In the final event, the legal significance of devices other than reservations will depend upon the form and content of the device, the time at which it was made, and the reaction of other parties to it.</PARA>
<PARA>That may indeed be the response that the Minister was going to give, but it seems to me to beg the question as to why a reservation was not made. If there are obligations on Australia and indeed, through this legislation, on Australian citizens-and that is the point-we had better be sure that the use of the declarations device gives a proper legal protection, and a legal protection at least as great as that which would be given by reservations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has gone some of the way in its proposed declarations, but I still feel disappointed that it and the Opposition have not been able to come to a common view about this question. I do not know what future governments may do, and I would be interested to know what the Minister's views are about that. If, for example, a future Government takes the view that the declarations have not covered those possible problems arising from the additional protocol that have been expressed in the debate thus far, what will happen? Will there be an opportunity for that future government to take a different viewpoint and to change the legal position of Australia vis-a-vis the additional protocol? These are questions that are probably more appropriate to be dealt with in the Committee of the Whole, and it is my intention to vote for the second reading of this Bill so as to have the matter go to the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a most important measure, the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990, which will if passed enable the Australian Government on behalf of the Australian people to ratify protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions. Basically, the protocol has evolved through considerations over many decades of how civilian populations in particular might be distinguished from combatants and how military objectives might be distinguished from civilian objects so that we can try to modify the horrendous carnage and effects of engaging in warfare in such a way that some protection might be offered particularly to the civilian populations in those areas where war is being waged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The protocol is designed specifically to apply humanitarian principles to those military conflicts which are waged and have been waged in the past in ways which have quite clearly targeted civilian populations as a measure of terrorising those populations and weakening the will of the government concerned to continue its waging of war given what is happening to the civilian population, with which it is, I guess, primarily concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The exacting work undertaken by many bodies, particularly by the International Committee of the Red Cross, has led to this protocol. Senator Harradine quite rightly spoke of the desirability of having bipartisan support for this measure. It is regrettable that the bipartisan support which might reasonably have been anticipated from the Opposition parties has not been forthcoming, but this measure will pass because of the support of the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine through all stages and Senator Harradine at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, that bipartisan support was reasonably to be expected because Mr Andrew Peacock, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, signed the protocol on behalf of Australia in December 1978, thereby signifying that Australia would respect the provisions of the treaty and would certainly not do anything which would be contrary to their spirit while considering the question of ratification. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Senator Durack wrote to the Secretary-General of the Australian Red Cross Society in March 1988 indicating that the coalition had always had a strong commitment to the ideals of the Geneva Conventions and would be supporting the Bill when it was introduced. There was an expectation of bipartisan support, and it is unfortunate that we as a nation cannot give our wholehearted endorsement to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important legislation and very apt at this time when we are engaged in the multinational force in the Gulf and where the question of the waging of warfare and the way in which it affects the civilian population is constantly before us as a matter of grave concern. It is important to mention that the protocol attempts to make it clear that while the civilian population and individual civilians enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations, it faces the reality of the waging of military operations. It deals with the unfortunate fact that it may be necessary in the attaining of military objectives to wage the conflict in a way that will affect civilian populations. But in that case there has to be a real assessment of the proportionality of the impact on civilian populations to the achieving of the military objective. A very stringent assessment of that balance has to be undertaken, but obviously in warfare great care has to be taken to make sure that the loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects are not excessive in relation to that concrete and direct military advantage which is anticipated. But the real object of this protocol is to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects. I am quite sure that that objective would commend itself to all members of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Several matters have been raised during the debate which perhaps could be dealt with now rather than in the committee stage. One relates to the question raised by Senator Bishop who referred to nuclear power stations in Iraq having been bombed. She asserts that in the light of article 56 of the protocol this would be banned. It is quite clear, according to information available to me, that the nuclear facilities attacked in Iraq were not nuclear electrical generating facilities and therefore did not attract the protection of the protocol. </PARA>

I do not believe that that matter raised by Senator Bishop needs to be further discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon claimed that the Irish Republican Army terrorists responsible for the recent attack on No. 10 Downing Street would, if captured, be able to claim prisoner of war (POW) status under the terms of the protocol. That is not correct. Terrorist organisations are not able to claim the protection of the protocol, such as being regarded as combatants and acquiring POW status if captured. Article 1(4) limits the types of armed conflicts to which the protocol applies. A terrorist organisation is not a party to a conflict coming within the definition in article 1(4). It is clear that terrorist organisations cannot claim the protection of the protocol. The captured members are not POWs, but would be dealt with under the ordinary criminal law for their activities. The whole purpose of the protocol is to outlaw terrorist acts and never to condone them. I believe that Senator MacGibbon's misgivings in that respect are unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most curious matter that needs to be dealt with is the confusion by Senator Bishop and perhaps by other members of the Opposition between reprisals and retaliation and acting in self-defence once attacked. Senator Bishop seemed to suggest that, for example, it would be impossible for a country which had been subjected to attack on its civilian populations to launch a counterattack, an action in self-defence-some retaliatory measure. That is not true. Reprisals are of a different character altogether. Reprisals are those actions which would normally be outlawed by humanitarian international law and by this particular protocol in that they involve the deliberate use of military force against, for example, civilian populations, not to achieve a military objective, but to punish and to cause such suffering that the government waging war might consider desisting from itself engaging in actions which breach the rules of humanitarian international law. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that in accepting the protocol in relation to reprisals this Bill in any way will strip Australia of a properly exercised right of self-defence. It merely prevents that right of self-defence from encompassing the deliberate targeting of civilian populations, which simply adds to the horrors of warfare and is such that it should be outlawed. Surely we have reached a stage in trying to curb the horrors of war where every possibility of limiting the impact on civilian populations should be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> A question that has constantly exercised senators' minds has been the question of interoperability-that is, whether if Australia were to ratify this protocol our acting in conjunction with our allies or the members of coalitions of armed forces put together would make those operations difficult or even impossible and frustrate the complex cooperative and collaborative effort that would need to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Current evidence in the Middle East is that the United States of America is operating quite effectively in a multinational force, the majority of whose members are either parties to or have signed the protocols. Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that the operations of the task force are being carried out in compliance with the rules of the protocols; that is, in attempting to target military objectives only. It would appear that in the current conflict, I am advised, of the 29 members of the multinational task force 21 are parties to Protocol I; 19 are parties Protocol II; and the remaining seven have signed both protocols but are not parties. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see that in the multinational force there is a variety and combination of nations, some of whom have signed, some of whom have not signed, many of whom are parties to the protocol and some of whom are not parties to it. So far as I have been advised, that has not led to any difficulty in the operational compatability as objectives are sought to be achieved and as the various parties are brought into cooperative arrangements to achieve the objectives of the multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that they are the main points which, possibly, have caused misgivings and concerns in the minds of some members of the Opposition and have led them to consider that they cannot support the second reading of this particular Bill. But I would ask them to reconsider their change of heart-which it appears to be-in relation to support of the ratifying of this particular protocol which would be enabled by the passage of this legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate in order to achieve that objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the second reading debate I neglected to respond to Senator Harradine's question, and perhaps it might be useful to do so now. The honourable senator asked for the relevant difference between reservations and declarations in relation to this particular protocol, and why the Government had chosen to go the declaration route rather than make reservations. By the way, the proposed declarations have been circulated to the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the two Independents, although they have not yet been to the Executive Council. That is why, although the Government anticipates that they will be in that form, they have not been incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both declarations and reservations are binding in the sense that a declaration is a public, interpretative statement manifesting a government's understanding of the provisional term-in this case, of the protocol. It does not have to be accepted by other parties and does not purport to resile from a treaty obligation as does a reservation. I think that is the key: that a reservation would indicate that the Government purports to resile from an obligation which would otherwise be imposed on it by the international instrument concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine asked some further questions concerning reservations or declarations. A future government cannot make a new reservation or declaration. It can withdraw a reservation or declaration at a later stage, but it cannot enter into further reservations or declarations in relation to the international instrument concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that this is the effect of international law. It has to be done at the time of ratification in a formal sense, and that is the statement of the nation state at the time. It can withdraw a reservation or declaration but, apparently, it cannot add new reservations or declarations. I presume it is under some international instrument itself that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Am I to understand then that the Government sees its proposed declarations as being the key area for interpretation of the Bill when it comes to consideration by international or domestic courts in respect of the provisions of the additional protocol? In other words, it seems to me that the Bill places obligations on individual Australian citizens. Am I to understand that the Government considers that its proposed declarations will be interpreted by those enforcing the provisions of the protocol as having the standing in law for the protection of those individuals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as declarations are concerned, I am advised that the effect in international law is that there is an indication of Australia, as a nation state, having a particular understanding of the provisions of the protocol, but that would not be a binding understanding as far as the international community was concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that section 15ab of the Acts Interpretation Act allows a domestic court to take any material in forming part of the Act which is capable of assisting the meaning of the proviso into account. As Senator Harradine knows, the court is not obliged to take that into account, but has a discretion to do so. I am advised that that is possible as far as a domestic court is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was hoping for a little better clarification than that. I know what is in the Acts Interpretation Act. It does not really help to say that the courts can have regard to what is contained in the declaration. They may indeed choose to have regard to what is contained in the protocol itself and make their own interpretation of that, given the debate that has taken place in the meetings leading up to the preparation of this protocol. In any international convention the courts would normally have regard to the travaux preparatoire and to the reservations that a particular state may make. That is what I am trying to get at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Would these declarations have the same force in domestic courts as reservations do? I feel it would be desirable for the Government to give us some further elaboration on this, given the fact that, as I understand it, the purpose of the Bill is to make sure that in domestic law the protocols are fixed firmly on the statute book and that they apply and are binding not only on Australia as a whole but also individual citizens of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Parliament has passed section 15ab of the Acts Interpretation Act which does permit courts to take into account the type of material to which we are referring in these declarations, which will be formally notified at the time of ratification of the optional protocol. I believe that the way in which the section is phrased-I am afraid I do not have section 15 in front of me-does make it discretionary as to whether the court has regard to this particular aid to interpretation. Normally it would do so only where it considered there was some ambiguity in the article itself, which would be enforceable by reason of its being a grave breach which is made an offence by this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know that I can add much more than that. I have sought some advice from general counsel in the last few minutes and it was to that effect-that is, as I say, a court could take into account the declarations if it were of the view that the declaration was in regard to one of its articles which spoke of a grave breach which itself then became an offence under the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do I take it that it is the Government's view-and, therefore, if this Bill is adopted, the Parliament's view-that the proposed declarations of understanding on the accession of the first additional protocol to the 1949 Geneva Convention should be regarded as superior aids to the interpretation of this law than any other interpretation of the articles of the protocol?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An Australian court which had to deal with the offences provision of the Act, as it would then be, dealing with grave breaches under the optional protocol to the Geneva Convention, would properly be able to take into account the declaration as an aid to the interpretation of the relevant article. That would be an aid to its understanding, as we would claim-and that is why we speak of declarations rather than reservations-and interpretation of the article. The terms of the article, in a sense, always remain paramount. But the proper understanding or interpretation of them in a case of any perceived ambiguity could be resolved by the court in a way which the declaration suggests is the fair and proper interpretation and understanding of the article.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With an abundance of caution, for the information of Senator Harradine and for the convenience of future generations of parliamentarians and perhaps of courts-despite the fact that the declarations in relation to protocol I have not been to the Executive Council, I think that it would be extremely prudent if I incorporated the proposed declarations in relation to protocol I in the Hansard record. That would make it very clear that these declarations, having been provided to the Opposition, to the Australian Democrats and to the two Independents and, of course, being in the knowledge of the Government, would be in the understanding of this Parliament and certainly this chamber in its passing this particular piece of legislation. I know that it is an unusual procedure but I believe that those who are responsible for the meeting of the Executive Council would understand the necessity in this case. Therefore, Mr Chairman, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the proposed declarations in protocol I.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>It is Australia's understanding that in relation to Article 5, with regard to the issue whether, and in what measure, Protecting Powers may have to exercise any functions within the combat zone (such as may be implied by provisions in-Parts III and IV of the Protocol), the role of the Protecting Power will be of a like character to that specified in the First and Second Conventions and Part II of the Fourth Convention, which apply mainly to the battlefield and its immediate surroundings. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the understanding of the Government of Australia that in relation to Article 44 of Protocol I, the situation described in the second sentence of paragraph 3 can exist only in occupied territory or in armed conflicts covered by paragraph 4 of Article 1. The Government of Australia will interpret the word ``deployment'' in paragraph 3 (b) of the Article as meaning any movement towards a place from which an attack is to be launched. It will interpret the words ``visible to the adversary'' in the same paragraph as including visible with the aid of binoculars, or by infra-red or image intensification devices. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to Articles 51 to 58 inclusive it is the understanding of Australia that military commanders and others responsible for planning, deciding upon, or executing attacks, necessarily have to reach their decisions on the basis of their assessment of the information from all sources, which is available to them at the relevant time. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to paragraph 5 (b) of Article 51 and to paragraph 2 (a) (iii) of Article 57, it is the understanding of Australia that references to the ``military advantage'' are intended to mean the advantage anticipated from the military attack considered as a whole and not only from isolated or particular parts of that attack and that the term ``military advantage'' involves a variety of considerations including the security of attacking forces. It is further the understanding of Australia that the term ``concrete and direct military advantage anticipated'', used in Articles 51 and 57, means a bona fide expectation that the attack will make a relevant and proportional contribution to the objective of the military attack involved. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the understanding of Australia that the first sentence of Article 52 is not intended to, nor does it deal with, the question of incidental or collateral damage resulting from an attack directed against a military objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill, most of which we support, amending a number of Acts administered by the Attorney-General. Part 2 of the Bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act; part 3 amends the Cash Transaction Reports Act; part 5 amends the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act; part 6 amends the Director of Public Prosecutions Act; part 7 amends the Proceeds of Crime Act; part 8 amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act; and part 9 and schedule 2 make amendments to a number of other Commonwealth Acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition is supporting the Bill, although I will be moving amendments at the Committee stage in relation to the Cash Transaction Reports Act. Many of the amendments in the Bill are of a minor or technical nature which we would expect in an omnibus Bill. I will be confining my comments to those amendments relating to the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The amendments to the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act provide for a number of punishable offences under the supplementary protocol to the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation. These offences are: first, to unlawfully and intentionally perform an act of violence against a person at, or to disrupt the services of, an international airport; secondly, to damage the facilities of, or to damage any aircraft not in service located on, such an airport; and, thirdly, to attempt, aid or abet the commission of such an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provide that these offences will carry a penalty of a maximum of 15 years imprisonment for an act of violence against a person, and 10 years for the other offences. Whilst we support these amendments, they are obviously a substantial policy change and go well beyond the usual framework of an omnibus Bill of this nature. I remind the Senate of the words of the Attorney-General that none of the amendments concern major policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. That is obviously not the case in relation to the amendments of the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act which provides penalties for such serious offences as I have just outlined. They are not merely the minor type of technical drafting amendment which is more properly the content of such a Bill. I draw that concern of the Opposition to the attention of the Government because it is something that we have raised before. There seems to be a tendency in recent times to expand these Bills to cover matters of a more substantial nature than was ever the intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act provide for the creation of the new statutory office of the Associate Director of Public Prosecutions. The introduction of a new statutory office, as in the case of the amendments to the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act is also, in our view, a sufficiently substantial matter to warrant legislation other than by way of an omnibus Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of a preliminary remark in relation to the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act, I take the opportunity to reiterate the Opposition's support for the objectives of these two pieces of legislation: the pursuit of the money trail, by tracing the proceeds of crime; and the removal of the incentive for crime by confiscating the ill-gotten gains of illegal activity. They are laudable objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 7 of the Bill deals with amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act. The Bill proposes that the operation of the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime Act be excluded in relation to Australian Capital Territory (ACT) offences. This part of the Bill is to come into effect on the date that the ACT enacts its own proceeds of crime legislation. Therefore, it is a wind-back for that purpose. There have been several cases in recent times in relation to the Proceeds of Crime Act, in which it has received some serious criticism from the judiciary. Examples of such criticism may be found in the 1989 New South Wales Court of Appeal case of Saffron v. the Director of Public Prosecutions; in the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal case, Brauer v. the Director of Public Prosecutions; and in another case, which I understand is presently subject to appeal, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kunz in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The criticisms primarily relate to aspects of the Act which intrude upon civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cash Transaction Reports Act also raises the issue of balancing the interests of the State in investigating and prosecuting criminal activity and the interests of individual liberty. The Privacy Commissioner has commented in relation to this Act that some aspects of it also raise difficult privacy issues. Although the Opposition supports the general thrust of the Act, the shadow Attorney-General in the other place expressed concerns in relation to several matters. The first is the wide definition of `cash dealer' in the Act which gives the Act a very wide ambit of operation. Secondly, the offences, excepting those in section 29, seem to be expressed in absolute terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, rights of review are virtually non-existent, both in relation to decisions and conduct of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency and those of cash dealers. Fourthly, there are severe implications for rights of privacy-for example, cash transaction reports information may be transmitted to non-Commonwealth agencies which are not subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act. Finally, section 16, which relates to the reporting of suspect transactions, has a very wide ambit. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of this Bill amends the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The most significant amendment is to section 16 of the Act to provide for reports of suspect transactions from cash dealers to be provided by the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Customs Service. Its omission from the definition of `relevant authority' in subsection 16.6 of the Act was evidently an oversight. Apparently, the Australian Customs Service has been receiving such information despite not being a relevant authority within the terms of the Act. This omission is another demonstration of the need to take care and get it right in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been concerned for some time about section 16, which applies to any transaction to which a cash dealer is a party and is not restricted to cash transactions. If the dealer has reasonable grounds to suspect that information concerning the transaction may be relevant to criminal offences, the dealer is obliged to provide the Agency with the `reportable details' as specified in schedule 4 of the Act. This effectively forces the dealer-a bank teller, a bookmaker or whatever-to act as an investigator. The general thrust of the Act makes serious inroads into the principle of client confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 (1) (b) (ii) defines a relevant offence as including `an offence against the law of the Commonwealth'. This extremely wide provision will cover all offences from the most serious to the most trivial. This is in sharp contrast to the evident purpose of the legislation, which is to trace the money trail in order to detect serious offences relating to tax evasion, money laundering and organised crime. As I indicated at the outset, I will be taking this opportunity to pursue an Opposition amendment to narrow the ambit of section 16, by specifying the serious offences to which the section relates. This will, therefore, introduce greater certainty into the reporting obligations imposed on cash dealers. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition will support this Bill, although we have serious criticisms of the Government in relation to some aspects, which I mentioned in the last few minutes, particularly with respect to the disturbing practice of including substantial policy changes in an omnibus Bill. The Opposition will be proposing an amendment to the Cash Transaction Reports Act at the committee stage of the Senate's deliberation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that Senator Hill seemed to be having some difficulty with pronouncing the word `omnibus'. I am old enough to recall the times when buses were called omnibuses. I guess that Senator Hill still calls them buses and not omnibuses. As a person with a legal background, he will understand the Latin derivation of the word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Hill has said, this is an omnibus Bill that will make a number of amendments to legislation administered by the Attorney-General's portfolio. The major amendments relate to: obstructing public officers; a variety of amendments arising from the implementation of the fixed term appointment arrangements of the Australian Federal Police; offences for certain acts, such as violence, committed at international airports; the appointment of an Associate Director of Public Prosecutions; evidence of offences collected by the National Crime Authority; and minor amendments to both the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. In our view, these are all tidying up-type amendments to those Acts and we therefore support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The flavour of these amendments is obtained by looking at the amendments, which are covered in the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The way the law currently defines the word `Territory' means that confiscation results in the proceeds of crime passing into Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. The amendment in this case allows the Australian Capital Territory to legislate to confiscate the proceeds of crime and for the proceeds of that confiscation to pass into ACT revenue. That is the type of amendment with which we are dealing. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. We regard the amendments in each case as relatively unexceptional. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with the Opposition amendments. We know from Senator Hill's speech that he intends to move these amendments in the committee stage. I have only just seen the amendments as they were handed out a moment ago. I will make a few brief remarks about them. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly speaking, the Australian Democrats have supported the Government's efforts to implement legislation aimed at pursuing the money trail in the context of criminal activity. At the same time, we have approached this issue and monitored the operation of this sort of legislation in relation to the protection of civil liberties; indeed, there is a considerable and often fine balance to be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats had reservations about both the workability of the Cash Transaction Reports Act and its impact on privacy at the time of its passage, and we are continuing to monitor these aspects. However, although well-intentioned in trying to strike a somewhat different balance between law enforcement and civil liberties, we do not consider that the Opposition's amendments achieve that end and, hence, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting them. We believe there is a danger that such amendments would make the Act almost unworkable by putting a quite unreasonable burden of interpretation on bank tellers. Putting the amendments aside, I simply reiterate that the Australian Democrats support this Bill and the objectives of the legislation which it seeks to amend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government, I welcome the expressions of support for the second reading of the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I will leave the matters relating to the proposed amendments circulated by Senator Hill on behalf of the Opposition parties to the committee stage. The Bill is most important amending, as it does, a number of Acts administered within the Attorney-General's portfolio and other related Acts. I will just usefully mention a few of them in this second reading response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 deal with a fairly minor matter of administration to do with review and appeal processes designed to extend rights of review in a way which will enhance efforts to make the Australian Federal Police (AFP) a more unified work force, I think that that terminology masks what has been a remarkable transformation of the Australian Federal Police over the last few years as the premier law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth. Today, as honourable senators will know, members of the Australian Federal Police-whether they are constables or whether they are members who would be called civilians-are regarded as being, and are, members of the one Australian Federal Police force. </PARA>
<PARA> From my visits to the offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne in recent weeks, I believe that this has made for not only an industrial relations transformation of the Federal Police, but also has made for a much more unified approach by members of the Australian Federal Police to their task, without depending on artificial divisions when they are all seeking to devote their energies and skills to the achievement of common goals. I believe that the commitment of the members of the Australian Federal Police to their task-to the goals set for them by the Government and by the Commissioner-is, in no small way, helped by this move to be a fully unified work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The transformation, for example, whereby members of the Australian Federal Police are employed on a contractual basis of employment rather than with a long term tenure has tended to characterise police forces and has been based on a mixture of civil service, Public Service and quasi-military models-with renewal provisions after a period of, let us say, 10 years has struck outside observers as being quite remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, when he visited Australia late last year, said that this was a revolutionary move in terms of police forces throughout the world which he certainly could not achieve within his own jurisdiction. He commended Australia for leading the way in this particular regard. That will not surprise you, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you will know that the Federal Police have been under the guidance of very considerable ministerial interest during this period of transformation. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, there have been some small oversights in the drafting which meant that the Australian Customs Service was not included as a relevant authority to receive certain information. That has been remedied in a way which will enhance the proper operation of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other provisions in this omnibus legislation. For example, the amendments to the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 make it an offence for a person to unlawfully and intentionally perform an act of violence against a person at, or to disrupt the services of, an international airport, and so on. These provisions give effect to the necessary provisions of the protocol-I think it is-to the Montreal Convention, and are most appropriate and apt at this time of the Gulf conflict when we are very conscious of the need to have a high state of readiness as regards airport facilities around the world, particularly international airports, as we safeguard them and of course those who use the facilities, more particularly, from terrorist activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this particular provision was not originally incorporated in the Bill, with the Gulf conflict and threats of terrorism specifically in mind it indicates how proper and necessary it is to have such offences under Australian law, in dependence, as I say, on the protocol to the Montreal Convention, in order to play our part in the international community to ensure that international air travel is not disrupted by violence, particularly that which is designed to serve a political end. </PARA>
<PARA> There are amendments also to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983-for example, conferring certain powers on the Associate Director but, most interestingly, Senator Hill, dealing with the question of the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to give use/derivative use indemnity in relation to evidence to be given in a broad range of State or Territory proceedings. </PARA>

It is interesting that I had the good fortune to have lunch today with Mr Peter Costello, the shadow Minister for business and consumer affairs, who has just returned from the United States, where he had most interesting discussions with law enforcement personnel, particularly in New York City, about the use of indemnities in order to deal with corporate and securities fraud, and insider trading in particular. As one gives an indemnity to someone lower down the scale, one of course is then in a position to assemble evidence which might be able to be used against somebody closer to the top of the ladder--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill tells me, and I understand, that there is a reference on this matter before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. I can understand that there is a very real question as to whether a person lower down in the criminal hierarchy who can give valuable evidence against somebody further up in the hierarchy ought not to be prosecuted and whether his cooperation in providing evidence be taken into account in the sentencing by the judge or, if he is sentenced, in the later decision by the Executive to reduce that sentence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It can also be said that it would prevent claims being made during the trial that the witness who had been offered an indemnity was giving the evidence as part of a deal which might colour the evidence he was giving. So it is a very complex matter. But I do note that one of the purposes of the amendments to the DPP Act is to give power to the DPP to give a use/derivative use indemnity in relation to evidence to be given in a broader range of State or Territory proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. Basically, this is to allow the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to enact its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminal assets. I am sure that the ACT would be upset at the fact that, in respect of an indictable offence against the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory, any related confiscation proceedings at the moment are taken under the Commonwealth Act and any recoveries are paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth. Quite clearly, that is not satisfactory from the ACT point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The proceeds of crime legislation has been extremely well received in the community, who quite rightly see the stripping of the criminal profits from, particularly, drug traffickers as a very good move. Not only does this penalise the offender personally by stripping that person of considerable assets that he may have accumulated but also, in doing so, it removes the financial base for further criminal activity which could not only allow the person, even from gaol, to further some criminal enterprise, but of course could also be laundered into the white economy and therefore corrupt business, trade and commerce in the community, quite apart from the criminal activity that might be undertaken on the basis of the possession of those assets. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the Government to introduce legislation following up the undertaking of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the last election campaign to make sure that those assets are put into a trust fund, 50 per cent of which would be devoted to further law enforcement efforts and 50 per cent to drug education and rehabilitation projects. Mr Deputy President, I think you would believe in the efficacy of those drug education and rehabilitation projects, or at least would believe that they ought to be supported in a way which the setting up of this trust fund will do. It is certainly rather a nice twist to the sage of criminal greed that the assets which are accumulated by criminals can be used in this way. I think it would receive the commendation of the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 are concerned, suffice it to say that none of the amendments extend the interception powers under the Act, a most important provision, well safeguarded, as this Parliament-the Senate in particular-requires, because we have such an invasion of privacy where telephone interception is undertaken. It is a very necessary device to combat serious criminal activity and has proved to be extremely useful. The minor amendments being undertaken are to do with administrative matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There are amendments to some other Acts; for example, amendments to enhance the efficiency of the National Crime Authority by enabling it to assemble and give evidence directly to the prosecuting authority. I must say-and Senator Hill may be of the same view-that I was a little surprised that that was not the case and that apparently the National Crime Authority has to give its material to the Attorney-General or a law enforcement agency. The intergovernmental committee on the National Crime Authority suggested that it be able to give evidence directly to a prosecuting authority, and that will be able to be undertaken as a result of the passage of this legislation, which I commend to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-During the second reading debate I foreshadowed that I would be moving an amendment to section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. Two other small amendments are incidental to that principal amendment. Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats indicated in the second reading debate that the Democrats would not be supporting our amendments. Therefore, I recognise that they will not be carried. Nevertheless, the Opposition regards the issue as important and, therefore, I move amendments 1, 2 and 3 that have been circulated in the name of the Opposition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>1. Clause 2, page 1, after subclause (1), insert the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1a) Section 20a and paragraph 21 (aa) commence 4 months after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.''. </PARA>
<PARA>2. After clause 20, page 7, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Interpretation</PARA>
<PARA> ``20a. Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in subsection (l) the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> `serious offence' for the purposes of subparagraph 16 (1) (b) (ii) means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a murder, or an offence of a kind equivalent to murder;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a kidnapping, or an offence of a kind equivalent to kidnapping;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a serious narcotics offence, being an offence in relation to a narcotic substance as defined by subsection 4(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) constituted by the production, possession (including possession for supply), supply, importation or export of a narcotic substance; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) involving a quantity of the narcotic substance that is equal to or greater than the trafficable quantity applicable to the narcotic substance;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a money laundering offence, being an offence against section 81 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the receipt, possession (including possession for supply), concealment, disposition of or bringing into Australia any money, or any other property, that may reasonably be suspected of being proceeds of crime, being an offence against section 82 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) an organised fraud offence, being an offence against section 83 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) an offence constituted by aiding, abetting or conspiring to commit an offence of the kind referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f).''. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Clause 21, page 7, before paragraph (a), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(aa) by omitting from subparagraph (1) (b) (ii) `an offence' and substituting `a serious offence';''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said in the second reading debate, the amendments which deal with the Cash Transaction Reports Act are being moved because the Opposition thinks that the obligation within the Act that is placed upon cash dealers to report is unreason- ably wide. As I said, section 16 of that Act provides for the reporting of suspicious transactions by cash dealers where they suspect that they have information relevant to the investigation of an offence under any relevant Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned about the ambit of this section which, it believes, is far too wide. We have moved an amendment so that for the purposes of this section an offence under a Commonwealth law will mean a serious offence of a specified kind. The definition of `serious offence' that we are proposing is taken from the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act, which define, respectively, the type of offences for which telephone interceptions are allowed and for which confiscation of property orders may be made. </PARA>
<PARA> In our opinion, section 16, as it is presently drafted, poses a serious risk to civil liberties. By this amendment we seek to confine its operation to the purpose intended in the enactment of the legislation-that is, the pursuit of the money trail left by organised crime through the reporting of suspicious transactions by cash dealers where they suspect that they have information relevant to the investigation of a serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the substance of our amendment is set out in amendment 2. Basically, a `serious offence' is to be defined as meaning murder, kidnapping, serious narcotic offences, including money laundering, and offences against sections 82 and 83 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, which relate to the possession of money which is suspected of being proceeds of crime and organised fraud offences. Amendment No. 3 is a consequential amendment. Amendment No.1 provides for the commencement date of amendment Nos 2 and 3 to be four months after the date on which this Act receives royal assent. The reason for the delay is so that the Cash Transaction Reports Agency and cash dealers will have time to familiarise themselves with the new requirements. I commend the amendments to the Com- mittee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the aim of the Opposition's amendment is to limit the circumstances in which a cash dealer must make a report of a suspicious transaction under section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The amendment would limit the making of a report to those transactions which give rise to a suspicion of a serious offence, as defined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government rejects this particular amendment because it believes that it would make the suspect transaction reporting provisions quite unworkable. Let me give an example: imagine that a person enters a bank to make a deposit of cash. The teller has a reasonably-based suspicion that the person has been engaged in drug trafficking. At present the suspicion would be sufficient to support a report under section 16. Under the proposed amendment it would be necessary for the teller also to suspect that the quantity of drugs involved was in excess of the trafficable quantity, because trafficking in any quantity less than this would not be a serious offence under the proposed amendment. There may be the question: how is the teller ever likely to be in a position to form a reasonably-based suspicion of the amount of drugs involved in the offence?</PARA>
<PARA> I think when one considers the difficulty that a teller would face, one can see that the Opposition's amendment-which I think is well motivated-would in fact lead to an unworkable situation. It may be also that it would lead to a situation where instead of the reporting of transactions under section 16 (1) (b) (ii), a report would be made under subsection 1 (b) (i)-that is, it would deal with the report relevant to tax evasion, which I suppose would quite properly rely on a presumption that money earned from a drug trafficking offence, for example, would not be declared as income. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be of interest in that regard to note that in the first 12 months of the operation of section 16, the great majority of reports have related to suspected tax evasion. Of the 6,250 reports lodged, 4,587 have related to suspected tax evasion. I believe that an amendment in relation to the offences-and this is what is proposed by the Opposition-would not really deal with the possibility that more reports would be made in that situation in relation to tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill, as we know, is cast in terms of reasonable grounds to suspect rather than reasonable grounds to believe so that the lower threshold will alleviate the need for cash dealers to undertake extensive investigation before being able to pass on information to the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. This whole question of the threshold and what a cash dealer would have to be satisfied about was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This morning I read in my office three or four pages of its report. I do not have it with me at the moment but I can confidently say that that approach was endorsed by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also to be noted, I believe, that, where a cash dealer lodges a report in good faith under section 16, the cash dealer is protected from suit by the customer or any other person. This is dealt with in section 16(5). For the cash dealer to be protected, it is necessary for the cash dealer to believe in good faith that the suspected offence is within the class specified-section 16(1) (b) (ii). By narrowing the class of offences as proposed, this exercise becomes much more difficult, perhaps impossible, for the cash dealer. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also other consequences. I believe that cash dealers, who are persons subject to the mandatory reporting requirements of section 16, would believe that the burden which would be placed on them should this amendment be carried would be very heavy. I believe that much more consultation-for example, with cash dealers-and the reporting back of their particular points of view would be very necessary before the Senate would pass such an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation was first passed by this Parliament, I, on behalf of the Government, indicated that after a period of some three years there ought to be a review of its operation. I gave an assurance that the Government would undertake that review and table a report within three years of the legislation coming into effect. I think that would be a wise course to follow. I believe that the matters raised by Senator Hill could well be the subject of part of that review to see whether the provisions had operated in a way which is workable. Perhaps the review itself could examine the claim that I am making, that the sort of provisions which would be incorporated by the amendment would be unworkable from the point of view of the cash dealers. So for all those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator R. Hill</PARA>
<PARA>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Hill</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to each party leader and independent Senator concerning the notice of motion given by Senator Coates on the last day of sitting. On 16 January I wrote in similar terms to Mr President and the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>This notice makes a most serious and defamatory allegation against my colleague Peter O'Keeffe and me, namely, that we have published statements of a partisan nature, an allegation which impugns our professional integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>Immediately after the notice was given I wrote to Senator Coates expressing surprise that he had not sought to discuss with me his apparent concerns before giving the notice, and inviting him to discuss the matter with me. I have repeated that invitation but it has not been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The only basis of the allegation contained in the notice is a reference to two articles written by Peter O'Keeffe and me in parliamentary journals and a report of my answers to some questions put to me by a journalist concerning the procedures for consideration of bills in committees. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing in these items to justify the allegation of partisanship. A statement with which a Senator may disagree is not for that reason a partisan statement. My article and the press report give a favourable account of the new procedures for referral of bills to committees, but it can hardly be partisan to be supportive of procedures which were unanimously recommended by an all-party Senate committee and which were adopted by the Senate without opposition. Contrary to the assertion in the notice, those items do not contain any ``criticism of certain Senators''. They refer to differences of view among Senators, but offer no critique or evaluation of those different views. The press report contains a great deal of commentary by the journalist in addition to my answers, but I am not responsible for that commentary. The characterisation in the notice of Peter O'Keeffe's article as being ``in praise of a former Senator'' is absurd. That article is a study of the way in which a Senator can use a private Senator's bill to deal with a difficult and sensitive issue. It is no more ``in praise of a former Senator'' than a previous article by Peter O'Keeffe referring to the role of the Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was in praise of Senator Cooney. </PARA>
<PARA>The serious allegation of partisanship is therefore not justified by the items referred to in the notice. </PARA>
<PARA>The articles in question are not different in kind from other articles written by other clerks on parliamentary matters over many years. Such articles frequently contain analysis, critique or evaluation of parliamentary matters, but never partisanship. In fact, articles written by clerks in the past were far more robust in commenting upon proceedings in the Senate than I or my colleagues have ever been. In an article written in 1970 the then Deputy-Clerk, Roy Bullock, referred in the following terms to the practice of the then government backbenchers of clogging the general business section of the Notice Paper with their own items of business:</PARA>
<PARA>``This situation was not good. It denigrated the Senate as an institution, frustrated a vigorous Opposition, and was completely out of keeping with the new order of things under proportional representation, and the need to streamline Parliamentary procedures.''</PARA>
<PARA>Such writings did not lead to any notices of motion in the Senate, or, indeed, to any adverse comment at all. </PARA>
<PARA>If the articles in question are regarded as objectionable, then virtually nothing can be written by any officer. </PARA>
<PARA>As you would be aware, my colleagues and I advise all Senators without regard to their political affiliations. Frequently we give advice which may not suit the political convenience of one or other of the parties in the Senate. Hitherto that very proper situation has not led to any allegation of partisanship. I trust that we are not now coming to a situation in which advice that accords with one party's objectives is regarded as good advice but advice to the contrary is considered partisan. </PARA>
<PARA>If the notice of motion remains on the Notice Paper undebated, as is normal with general business notices of motion, that may be taken as an indication that the allegation is not regarded as important. </PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of any other action in relation to the notice, I ask that this letter be incorporated in Hansard as a refutation of the allegation in the notice. </PARA>
<PARA>I have forwarded copies of this letter to Mr President and the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 seeks appropriations for $234.1m in 1990-91. It comprises two items: firstly, $181.4m for payment by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet the insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board, which were insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act. The Australian Government underwrites the national interest export insurance scheme. The second item is $52.7m for the Department of Defence to meet the equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Force to the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill in effect is an extra Appropriation Bill, which has been introduced in advance of the normal additional Appropriations process. The purpose of the Bill is to cover urgent payments resulting from Australia's involvement in the Gulf conflict. Unforseen or urgent payments of this nature are generally accommodated by the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, but in this instance the amount required would significantly exceed the $170m which is appropriated to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech the Minister said in relation to Iraqi wheat payments:</PARA>
<PARA>Iraq discontinued payments on its wheat debt after the imposition of the UN trade sanctions, and it is now considered unlikely that any payments will be made in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>The $181.4m is to meet the Government's immediate obligation under the national interest insurance provisions between now and the end of May 1991. A sum of $43.97m has already been paid out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance (AMF) in January, pending the passage of this Bill. The Bill covers with a payment of $181.4m, including the $43.97m from the AMF payable to the end of May, assuming that the defaulting continues. An additional payment of $29.7m will be required in June. This will be included in the normal additional Estimates. Further claims totalling $247m in 1991-92 and $34m in 1992-93 at current exchange rates are anticipated. These will be handled in the course of the normal Budget Appropriation processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also approved additional funds of $68.9m in 1990-91 to cover additional Department of Defence expenditure arising from the Gulf conflict. Of this, $52.7m is being sought under this Bill. The remainder-$16.2m for 1990-91-will be sought through the normal Additional Estimates process. The Government says it anticipates a further $27.475m spread over the following two years-$23.6m in 1991-92 and $3.9m in 1992-93. These latter figures, I would assume, must be regarded as very tempting indeed at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The amounts sought are for equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Forces to the Middle East. They in no way represent the total cost of Australia's involvement in the Middle East conflict. Several other departments will incur extra costs, for example, for additional overseas aid, the United Nations relief fund, extra security at domestic airports and at other points in Australia, and so on. The Opposition has strongly supported the Government's actions with regard to the Gulf conflict and it follows therefore that the coalition supports Appropriation Bill (No. 3) now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Other coalition speakers in this debate will cover in more detail matters pertaining to these specific Appropriations contained in this Bill. I wish to confine my remarks to the Government's budgetary position and to the major easing of fiscal policy which has occurred this financial year and which shows no signs of abating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is an Appropriation Bill, so anything is relevant in that sense. I think the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) will find my remarks be relevant to the legislation. I propose to outline this dramatic deterioration in some detail. I have said the coalition supports Appropriation Bill (No. 3). We accept the need for the Appropriations and their urgency. In supporting the Bill I urge the Government to take other measures to offset the still further deterioration of $234m that the Bill makes to the Government's fiscal position. The Senate will recall that in the 1990-91 Budget Speech last August the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Budget will deliver in precise terms, a surplus of $8.107 billion . . . This Commonwealth surplus will ensure that Australia's public sector as a whole is in balance . . . The net public sector borrowing requirement for 1990-91 will therefore be zero as once again the Commonwealth Budget surplus offsets the combined borrowing of all Commonwealth, State and local Government authorities . . . This means that the whole public sector of Australia will borrow no new money and that total Commonwealth debt as a share of the economy will be cut further to be only a third of what it was five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer also said in that speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget . . . builds on the fiscal achievements secured to date and maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA>In his concluding remarks in that Budget Speech last August, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is a Budget that will keep us in the right financial shape as we enter the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Those fine words, that typically arrogant and self-aggrandising rhetoric which is the Treasurer's hallmark, were never true. The Government has never maintained a fiscal policy as a principal weapon in its fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt. The Budget Estimates were never likely to be achieved. Indeed his Estimates and the forecasts on which they were based were almost universally recognised at the outset as optimistic. Since then it has become increasingly obvious that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks we have seen a number of predictions as to the likely Budget outturn. The Minister for Finance started the ball rolling with his comments that he expected the surplus to be about half the original $8.1 billion. He followed that up last Friday by saying that it was `more likely to be less rather than more than half'. The Treasurer in response to the original $4 billion figure put forward by the Minister for Finance would only say, `Yes, the surplus will be down substantially'. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) said last week, `There will be a significant shortfall in the projected 1990-91 surplus'. Again in the Senate today he refused to nominate a likely outcome. A detailed independent report by the merchant bank Schroders Australia Ltd also last week concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth's 1990-91 Budget is likely to come in closer to balance than the Commonwealth's revised $4 billion surplus estimate. A marked fall in employment over the first half of 1991 could see the Budget slip into deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Australian today in an article entitled `The Disappearing Surplus' economics editor Alan Wood wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>We are witnessing a massive deteriorating in the public sector's financial position . . . I suspect that the extent and speed of the collapse . . . is not generally appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the space of just 12 months the Federal Budget will have swung from a surplus of $8 billion to balance. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether the Budget outturn for 1990-91 will come in in surplus, balance or deficit is difficult to predict with any certainty. What is certain, however, is that the statements by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance do not describe sufficiently the extent of the unravelling of the Budget. There is no doubt whatsoever that the final outturn will be only marginally in surplus at best, and it will quite probably finish in deficit. Nor is it correct to claim, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and other senior Ministers have, that the collapse of the Budget arithmetic has been due simply to what they term `a cyclical deterioration resulting from the recession'-a recession, of course, which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said two days before the election in March 1990 we would not have; a recession which the Treasurer said eight months later we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> A not insignificant part of the deterioration has or will result from structural decisions deliberately taken by the Government. They include the purchase of the State Bank of Victoria by the Commonwealth Bank at a cost to the Federal Budget of $413m; tax cuts associated with the wage-tax deal effective on 1 January this year at a cost of $430m in lost revenue-$1 billion in a full year; the decision to make deficiency payments to woolgrowers at a cost of $300m this year; the loss of up to $700m, so said by the Government, after the failed attempt to sell the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline; and the $234m in today's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Combined, those five items alone account for a reduction in the projected surplus of more than $2 billion. I wish to make two points here in relation to these decisions. First, I am not implying that they were all wrong. Some were probably inevitable and several of them the Opposition supported, but they represent an easing in fiscal policy. The second point I want to make in relation to one of them is that it is about time that the Government stopped blaming the coalition for its loss of what it claims to be $700m in revenue on the potential proceeds of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline. We said at the time of defeating the legislation in this House that would have been part of the process of sale last year that the only reason we were blocking that legislation was that the way the Government was going about it involved a deliberate, cold and calculated breach of normal commercial contracts and normal commercial processes, and that, had the Government gone about its attempted sale of the pipeline in a proper, normal commercial manner, we would have supported it. So let me hear no more of the nonsense that it is the Opposition that has caused that deficiency in the Government's budgetary position this year. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of these Budget surplus-reducing decisions, there have been some other major increases in expenditure and decreases in revenue. The half yearly statement of Commonwealth government financial transactions provides some revealing trends, including so-called activity level variations, which show, to cite just a few examples, that Social Security expenditure at 31 December 1990 for the six months was $2.65 billion or 21.1 per cent higher than for the same six months last year. Social Security expenditure will have to fall by some $900m in the second half over the first half to meet budget and, if it remains the same in the second part as in the first, the surplus will be another $900m less. If expenditure rises by the same amount, $1.2 billion, as it did for the corresponding period last year, the blow-out on that item alone will be $2.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Health expenditure in the first six months of this year was 11.8 per cent higher than last year compared with a budgeted figure for the year as a whole of 8.6 per cent. Transport and Communications expenditure is 30.7 per cent higher compared with the 12-month Budget estimate of 14.2 per cent. Expenditure on industry assistance and development is up 29.8 per cent compared with a 12-month estimate of 18.6 per cent. Foreign affairs and overseas aid expenditure is up 22.4 per cent compared with the 12-month estimate of 7.4 per cent; Administrative Services expenditure is up 28.7 per cent over the corresponding period last year; and public debt interest is down 13.8 per cent rather than the budgeted 17.5 per cent reduction, and the fall in public debt interest this year will certainly be much less than even the 13.8 per cent of the first six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Although timing differences can account for some of these increases, they also account for some reductions compared to the Budget, for example, in labour and employment, education and housing. The net effect of these increases, excluding the social security increase of $2.1 billion, would conservatively see expenditure grow by up to an additional $1 billion over budget for the year as a whole. That result is before the further increases for Defence and Social Security take full effect. </PARA>
<PARA> On the revenue side, the signs of meeting budget are equally dim. Sales tax was down 4.1 per cent in the first six months due to a decline in motor vehicle sales and a flat retail turnover on comparable December half figures for 1989, compared with an estimated rise of 5.3 per cent for the full year. Customs duty on imports was down 18.1 per cent versus a full-year estimate of a decline of 6.4 per cent. Company tax revenues increased significantly in the six months to December as a result of changes to payments dates, but that will not be maintained in the second six months. Prescribed payments system revenue was down by a substantial 24.7 per cent compared to a budgeted full year figure of only 3.1 per cent. The reason given for this by the Department of Finance was that the figure was `reflecting depressed building activity'. This activity is not anticipated to pick up quickly in the current half year. </PARA>
<PARA> Net pay as you earn receipts were up by a meagre 1.5 per cent compared with a 12-month Budget estimate of 7.6 per cent, and non-PAYE individual tax was down 13 per cent as opposed to the budgeted increase of 14.8 per cent for the year. Both those figures are unlikely to rise over the coming six months and, due to the tax cuts, would never have met budget anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax revenues are now certain to fall well short of the Budget forecast-a shortfall of $4 billion is probably a conservative estimate. On the basis of what I have already outlined it is not at all unrealistic, indeed the contrary, to say that the Government is staring down the barrel of a 1990-91 Budget deficit of $1 billion compared with the Budget estimate of an $8 billion surplus. This outcome is not a figment of the coalition's imagination. It is broadly in line with the detailed analysis by Schroders Australia Ltd and with the highly respected economics commentator Alan Wood in today's Australian, both of whom I have referred to earlier. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was very much commensurate with the planned recession that we were not to have but we did have, according to the Treasurer. The Budget outcome will not only represent a massive easing in fiscal policy in terms of the Budget result; it will also result in a major increase, not a net balance as budgeted, in the public sector borrowing result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that one can see from those figures the possibility of a positive public sector borrowing requirement of somewhere between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product compared with the nil balance assumed in the Budget. The public sector borrowing requirement has already been relaxed by the $1 billion over budget in borrowing limits for the Australian Wool Corporation and the Government announcement to allow the South Australian Government to borrow an additional $970m over its borrowing limit to bail out the State Bank of South Australia, or more appropriately to bail out the Bannon Government. On top of that, the Victorian budget seems certain to blow out by many hundreds of millions of dollars, although a precise figure is impossible to estimate because the Kirner Government is deliberately refusing to make public the up to date figures on the Government's financial situation. The New South Wales Government also acknowledged recently a deterioration in its budget position compared with its estimates at budget time. </PARA>
<PARA> This return of the public sector in a big way to the ranks of net borrower will mean the issue of new government paper onto the financial markets and therefore a drawing on our national savings. It will put heavy pressure on interest rates; it will cause a major drain on our capital markets, just at a time when capital will be necessary to rebuild and refinance run-down local businesses; and it could result in loss of investor confidence rarely if ever witnessed before in this country. This crisis in public finance will be heightened if the Government's 12 March industry statement further draws heavily on Consolidated Revenue. Last Friday the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, said on this issue:</PARA>
<PARA>It's unlikely they-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the additional borrowings by the public sector to date-</PARA>
<PARA>will have much impact this year-more likely they'd be the subject of future budgets. </PARA>
<PARA>This suggests that next year's Budget will be formed with a much lower surplus, if any-or a much higher deficit-as its base. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Budget and public sector borrowing requirement collapse is not only tragic but ironic when taken in the context of the Treasurer's comments at the Premiers Conference last June, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important for Australia to be able to paint the position always, at least in this immediate period, that the public sector has not got its hand in the savings cookie jar of Australia, that it has it out. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this Government has done. It has put the public sector's hands right back into the cookie jar of the nation's savings. This is a public finance problem of enormous magnitude. The Government must urgently set about addressing the disastrous unravelling of fiscal policy if the resulting consequences are not to prove virtually intractable. </PARA>
<PARA> In making my remarks I want to draw attention to what I believe is a very dangerous public finance position facing Australia. In saying that I in no way am critical of Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which I said at the outset the coalition supports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on Appropriation Bill (No. 3). The second reading speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) contains the following passage:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The amounts in this Bill are being sought in advance of the additional estimates to meet urgent requirements which have arisen as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill outlines the amounts, which are $52.6m in round figures for the Department of Defence and $181.4m for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. The back page of the Bill gives a breakdown of the amounts which were appropriated under the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1990-91 for each of the departments. In the case of the Department of Defence that was a figure of $3,259.7m, so the additional $52.6m for that Department means an additional 1.6 per cent. In the case of the Australian Trade Commission I note that the amount appropriated under the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 199091 was $2.8m, so the additional $181.4m represents a 64-fold or 6,400 per cent increase in the allocation to that Department-to quote the Minister's speech-`to meet the urgent requirements which have arisen as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year'. </PARA>
<PARA> While we have a considerable absolute addition to expenditure on defence relative to the amount originally allocated, which represents only a 1.6 per cent increase, in terms of the non-military expenditure there is an enormous increase in the requirement which, according to the Minister, has been made necessary as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> This points to the fact that non-military costs of war are very considerable. I am reminded, as I suppose is every senator and member, that every time one gets on an aircraft one is required to be at the airport half an hour earlier than one otherwise would be. Every time we board an aircraft that represents 100 person hours of time. We are also reminded of the extra security provisions at airports and the extra cost which that involves. This appears nowhere in the appropriations which are now before us. Undoubtedly engaging in war is a costly business, and many of those costs show up in ways that are not immediately apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have stressed this in the past and we stress it again. When we look at this conflict in the Middle East we find that there has been a great willingness to plough a very large amount of money into a war effort. By comparison there has been a great tardiness by this nation and many others to spend money in ways that would alleviate very considerable human poverty and deprivation in many parts of the world. We are reminded that the Americans, for instance, claimed that they had spent $30 billion on their efforts in the Middle East crisis up to the end of last year and are now expecting to spend half a billion dollars to one billion dollars per day. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the suspension of the sitting, the point I was developing was the enormous financial cost of prosecuting a war. I was pointing out that the major component of the Appropriation Bill which is now before us is the $181.4m going to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. This represents a 64-fold-or, in percentage terms, a 6,400 per cent-increase in the expenditure under that item. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, this has happened as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was mentioning that up to the end of last year it was said that the Americans alone had spent some $30,000m, and that the current costs were running at around one half to one billion dollars a day to prosecute this war. One cannot help but then reflect on the alternative measures which could be undertaken with this money to alleviate world poverty, hunger, disease and a number of other things that afflict a large number of people, particularly in view of the fact that we are allocating this extra funding at a time when the Government has progressively reduced its allocation for foreign aid. That contribution now stands, I understand, at about 0.33 per cent of gross domestic product compared with the United Nations suggested objective of 0.7 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> When we debated this matter in January, I think many of my Democrat colleagues also pointed out that this war was not being prosecuted because of human rights abuses. We catalogued then, and have catalogued since in a number of notices of motion before the Senate, the history of human rights abuses and the history of the denial of action on United Nations resolution after United Nations resolution, in many cases involving gross denial of human liberties and human rights. So, one is forced to the conclusion that in this case we are acting on United Nations resolution 678 precisely because oil is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few figures which I think are relevant here. In the debate in January, Senator Tate and several other speakers made great play of the 300-odd babies who had been taken out of humidicribs and left to die on the floor. I think senators will recall an answer by Senator Tate yesterday in relation to the scale of child poverty and death around the world. Senator Evans said that 40,000 children a year-about 110 children every day-die as a consequence of the lack of quite simple things like clean water, immunisation against easily preventable disease, sufficient food, adequate hygiene and adequate shelter. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, one is left with the impression that this Government, and indeed the governments of the coalition, in prosecuting a very expensive war rather than pursuing sanctions, have not been doing that out of the best interests of human beings but merely because this really is a resource war and the interest is in the ability to retain access to oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a few other figures. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that between 300,000 and two million refugees will flee the Gulf war. It is anticipated that the cost of providing food, shelter and clothing for these refugees will top $175m-roughly the amount of money that we are adding to our estimates under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also estimated that the increased cost of fuel threatens economic recovery in non-oil producing countries throughout the Third World, particularly in Africa. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has estimated that, based on a cost of $25 a barrel, Third World countries this year are facing an average increase in oil costs of 110 per cent, or $450m over the 1990 year. </PARA>
<PARA> From August to November 1990 the oil price in Mozambique increased by 65 per cent; Zimbabwe raised petrol and other fuel prices by between 13 per cent and 65 per cent; fuel imports to Zimbabwe increased from 296.4 million to 423.5 million Zimbabwe dollars; and Sudan announced in late 1990 that the increased cost of its oil import bill was 200 million dollars in its money-approximately $US45m. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, on a number of occasions, drawn attention to the failure of the Australian Government and other governments to give effect to United Nations sanctions. We believe that a great deal more effective efforts could be made in prosecuting this internationally illegal invasion of Kuwait, not by military means but, rather, by the application of sanctions which, I repeat, were working-and according to the Central Intelligence Agency, were working-before the countries, led by the United States of America, decided to settle this matter by military means. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to a matter which is related to the way out of this present predicament. In that debate in January and, indeed, in many public speeches since, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), other Ministers and spokespeople for the Opposition have used the term `new world order'. Clearly, many people are looking forward to a different arrangement once this war is out of the way, particularly in view of the decrease in tensions-although I think even that must be qualified now in relation to what is happening with the Baltic states and some of the other states within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). But assuming that that decreased tension continues, then some different order from what we have had in the past must be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen many of our leaders-and not a few politicians in this place-strut this term `new world order' as a hope for the aftermath of the present Gulf war. Peace and global security are to be the hallmarks of this new order and that has come though clearly in all speeches. But how is this to be arrived at and what are the other characteristics of this new world order? To find out, we need to consider how the old world order got us into this present mess and whether those factors and attitudes are still ascendant in those who would guide us towards this brave new society. </PARA>
<PARA> While defenders of multinational intervention in the Middle East trumpet civil liberty and release of the Kuwaiti people from an unwelcome invader as the cause of this intervention, and while long lists of undoubtedly ghastly crimes against the Kuwaitis are catalogued as substantiation, one is still forced to ask the question: why in Kuwait? The same atrocities, in even greater numbers, have been committed in a dozen other places, in some cases involving disregard for United Nations resolutions, and the nations which have gone to war with Iraq have not lifted a finger. The world is painfully aware of the daily deaths of thousands of children-as I mentioned, 40,000 children every year-from lack of food and clean water, and from a limited number of easily and cheaply preventable diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> The world is aware that the cost of addressing this vast, ongoing progression of human misery is a tiny fraction of the money already spent and still to be spent on the Middle East war. The war and the expense have only just begun. One cannot avoid the conclusion that it is not the human torture, it is not the denial of human freedom, it is not the human suffering and misery, and it is not the invasion of one country by another which has stimulated the response of the predominantly rich industrial countries; it is their heavy dependence on oil and the prospect of losing control of this vital commodity. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmental components of this new world order have not been mentioned. Yet only a few short months ago the newspapers were filled not with the pictures and stories of war but with accounts of environmental damage, of greenhouse warming, ozone depletion and the need for a drastic reappraisal of the profligate consumption of resources, especially energy resources, particularly oil, by the industrialised nations of the world. Growing Third World debt and the increased inability of poor country after poor country to ever repay its burden of debt was also being reported, as was the lower and lower quality of health, education, nutrition and housing being forced on nation after nation by world financial institutions more intent on debt recovery than social justice and human welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not unrelated reasons for the present Gulf war. A solution to these problems must also be part of the new world order, if conflicts similar to the Middle East war are not to be a feature of the world for years to come. One fears, with good evidence, that these other factors are not in the mind of George Bush or Bob Hawke when they talk of a new world order. Having gloated-and we have seen it in this place-at the disintegration of the USSR and widely interpreted this as proof of the perfection of the capitalist system, an indefinite continuation of Western industrial dominance with its profligate and unequal share of resource consumption seems to be their vision of the new world order. Both the US and Australia have shown a particular unwillingness to address the problems of greenhouse. Australia has adopted a policy of 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gasses by the year 2005, provided it does not have adverse economic consequences for the maintenance of the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's document on ecologically sustainable development clearly indicates that it has no intention of changing its disastrous economic and ecological direction. Rather it pays lip service to a popular terminology and merely grafts onto existing practices those environmental protection elements which will not cost the economy a change of direction or purpose. The US has also resisted these international efforts to better manage the global environment in every case in which to do so may be seen in conflict with its continuing ability to exploit resources beyond its immediate control. The international law of the sea, Antarctic mining, more stringent greenhouse and ozone depletion standards are but a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The inter-governmental panel on climate control in May 1990 said that to cause the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to stabilise, it was necessary that the release of this gas into the atmosphere be cut by between 60 and 80 per cent. The new plateau would still be some 50 per cent higher than the level which obtained at the start of the industrial era. But this sought-for reduction is merely a global average. Australia, with 0.3 per cent of world population, uses about 1 1/2 per cent of the world's fossil fuels. Hence our particular interest in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions required in Australia, if this country is not to indefinitely demand an unfair share of this precious resource, is much much higher than the average. It is 92 per cent. Similar reductions are required in the United States and other industrialised countries. Like constraints apply to consumption of other resources. The notion that the consumption of resources can continue to grow in conventional growth oriented economies is not consistent with the establishment of a sustainable relationship between the world's people and the environment on which they depend. The belief that the present level of consumption in industrialised countries can become generalised to all countries, much less even higher levels, is not only without foundation and against all evidence but also extremely dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another element in the old order which has led to the present conflict and which must not be repeated in the new. Nations of many sorts and political persuasions have sought to increase their economic strength and international influence by making and exporting arms to other countries. Arms manufacture has become a component of the economic productivity of many nations inextricably intertwined with every aspect of that economy. The world has been aware for perhaps 20 years of the abysmal human rights record of Saddam Hussein. Yet over most of this time many nations have been prepared to supply arms or the precursors of arms to Iraq. That has been well catalogued in the debates in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The French supplied planes and the nuclear reactor, referred to earlier today, which the Israelis bombed. We may well have supplied the uranium which would have gone into that reactor had the Israelis not bombed the reactor first. The Russians supplied planes, tanks, and other military equipment. The Germans provided the makings of gas. Several European nations, as well as the United States, have supplied the materials which make poison gas, even after Hussein had used this gas against his own Kurdish subjects. Both the USSR and the French provided planes to the Iraqi air force to deliver its gas and other bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate yet again that France is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and was in the process of building the reactor to which I referred a moment ago, thereby supplying the materials and the technology to manufacture nuclear weapons-something to which the Opposition devoted a great deal of attention during the earlier debate. Australia continues to supply uranium to France and other countries and, in our view, has unconvincingly argued that international agreements can guarantee that it would not finish up in Iraqi or other nations' nuclear bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has recently adopted an economic policy of greater dependence on arms exports. This is a deliberate policy, apparently, of the Hawke Government, at the national level, and the Bannon Government in my State of South Australia. It has deliberately adopted a policy of greater dependence upon arms manufacture and export and has set about building up what it euphemistically calls its `defence' industries. A world of increasing inequity-I refer back to one of the other elements that I have mentioned tonight-armed with ever more weapons of greater and greater sophistication is a world of increasing, not decreasing, world instability. It is a recipe for ensuring that the new world order is merely the old world order writ large. </PARA>
<PARA> The new world order must be based on a new economic model-a model not based on infinite growth and stimulated by competition, but on a steady-state sustainable and cooperative model. It must be a global economy that lives within the capacity of the global environment to indefinitely support the extraction of resources and the impacts of pollution which industrial and other human processes place on it. </PARA>

Senator Coulter demonstrated in great depth and extent the shallowness of his argument. How can we ascribe a value to human life? How can we value freedom?

I want to make the comment, initially, that a large part of that expenditure, which is listed in the second reading speech as totalling $68.9m in aggregate over a period of years, of which $52.7m is brought to account in this additional appropriation, has been as a consequence of the lack of equipment in the Australian ships that have been sent to the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal to be learned, from a military point of view, about the operations in the Gulf and lessons from that will be learned for years to come. The really striking lesson for the Australian public, and the lesson is public, is how poorly Australia was prepared to support even the very small contribution we have made to the Gulf. That is the principal lesson. Despite the expenditure of nearly $8 billion a year on defence for a period of about seven or eight years under this Labor Government, we are left with the conclusion that the Australian defence forces are very poorly prepared for any active role in support of the United Nations and, more importantly, they are totally unprepared for any self-defence of Australia, which is the principal reason for their existence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am putting aside completely the level of training of the defence forces because we cannot hold defence forces at a very high level of training where its members are able to go into combat straightaway. That costs an enormous and quite disproportionate amount of money. I am excluding that from my comments here. The simple truth of the matter is that we do not have the range of capabilities within the Australian defence forces, in the three services, that we need. We certainly do not have the materiel support for those in weapons and munitions that we must have, both for an adequate level of training and for any sustainability. The war stocks held by the Australian services are quite minuscule and if we were to get into any situation where we had to use the defence forces, we would find that we were totally dependent on overseas sources for ammunition, missiles and things like that, which we would require in large quantities. As a consequence of that, we simply have no surge capability. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be like that. Our expenditure is very low and I hope that this Government and the next government lift it from the 20 or 30 year record low of about 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to a figure of at least 3 per cent of GDP, which is the barest minimum we can get by with in this country. Even for the 2.4 per cent, we are entitled to something more than we have in the direction of capability at present. </PARA>
<PARA> A few minutes ago I said that the Government made a very limited response to the United Nations force structure in the Gulf. There is no secret that the Government could have, and should have, done more. I am very interested in the role adopted by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in proposing the doctrine of proportionate response. The doctrine of proportionate response is something that is quite novel in international affairs, where the Government is saying that the response that Australia has made to the United Nations resolutions is proportionate to its size and importance in the world. That is the first time in history that a country has ever been involved in military operations where it has gauged its response in terms of its size and status in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to go behind the scenes and ask how this formula arose. Who devised it? There is no precedent to go on. How was it determined that, for a country with 17 million people, four small warships was a proportionate response? It is very interesting and, of course, there are no answers coming from the Government. There are no answers coming-and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, who is sitting at the table will acknowledge this-because the Government is a prisoner of its left wing. The Government cannot do anything other than make a token contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have no importance in influencing events. The Government is a prisoner of its own Left. I will briefly comment on the contribution that could be made by the three services to illustrate the point I am making. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) response is adequate and appropriate because, principally, the removal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait is not a maritime operation. It is worth emphasising that of all the ships in the Royal Australian Navy, out of the 16,000-odd members of the Royal Australian Navy, the total contribution we could make to a hostile situation was only four ships out of the fleet. That is the only number that we could put into a hostile environment, and then only after the expenditure of most of the money that is listed in this Appropriation Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the expenditure of $52.7m that is called up in this Bill went to equip those four ships, first of all, with the Phalanx close-in weapons system; secondly, to put in adequate communications systems so that they could properly operate with the American ships; thirdly, with navigational equipment. There was a bit of minor expenditure for things like chemical warfare kits, but in terms of the sums involved for the other three-the close-in weapons system, the navigation and the communications gear-that was quite minuscule. Those ships are playing a very important role for the United States and they are doing what they are designed for. They are basically designed to be escort ships in a carrier battle group and they fulfil that role very well. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a very different circumstance if Australia were relying on the RAN for its own defence because those ships do not have the ability to stand alone in a hostile situation without the support of a large group of ships around them. That is because this Government, with the abandoning of the Fleet Air Arm, has reduced the Navy to a brown water navy where it simply cannot operate in a hostile air environment unless it is protected by friendly air support. I do not see how we are going to get over that situation in the short term; overcoming that is a very long term problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Air Force does not have any role in the Iraq contribution thanks to the limitations that the Government has put on our contribution. But there is a very good argument to be made for contributing the F111s, the photographic ones, the RF111s, one of the F18 squadrons probably and the P3s if there was a maritime reconnaissance role. The Air Force could have made an effective contribution. If we get back to the point I am emphasising-the inability of the Australian Defence Force to do much in the self-defence of Australia-we find the Air Force is very severely restricted. </PARA>
<PARA> The first restriction comes from the fact that we have no way of knowing what is going on in the air space over Australia. We have only got very limited radar coverage and that is mainly on an arc from Adelaide round to Brisbane, in the south-east corner, which is the area most remote from any incursion into this country. The only response the Government has made to this is to proceed to let the contract last month for Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. That will be an eight to 10 year program before it is operational, if it is ever fully worked up to an operational mode. The present Jindalee station is a test facility. It is a research facility which is well down the path to being operational but it is not completely there yet. </PARA>
<PARA> In a stand alone role for air space surveillance Jindalee has a limited value. Although it is a wide area coverage system, it has some inherent and unavoidable faults with it-deficiencies, to put it more precisely. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Government to embark on Jindalee as the only way of surveying what goes on in the air space around Australia is to be repeating the mistakes that the French made between the First World War and the Second World War. We run the risk of creating an electronic Maginot line and, like the Maginot line, it has got two characteristics. First of all, it costs an enormous amount of money-it will cost about $1 billion to put two stations in, for which there may have been a higher priority in defence expenditure and, secondly, as the Maginot line was outflanked by the Germans going through Belgium and around the end of it, it can be argued that Jindalee could be outflanked by going around it in an electronic sense. Until we know what is going on in the air space, the Australian Defence Force does not have a chance of being able to use those excellent, air-superiority aircraft, the F18s, that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some pride to me that the aircraft that is doing particularly well, along with the F111s, in the Middle East combat is the F18. I remember the time before that contract was signed for the new tactical fighter in 1981 in this Parliament. I was the only person who argued the case for the F18 against the F16. The F16's performance, reliability and operational capability in the broadest sense has been one of the disappointments of the otherwise very successful air war in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have any support in missile stocks, the war stocks that we need for our strike aircraft to be able to use them in a role. The F111s that Australia has are excellent aircraft, they will do everything that the American F111s and the Stealth F117s will do from a weapons delivery point of view. Of course, they do not have the radar invisibility or the low radar signature of the F117s, but they are equipped with the same target acquisition, illumination and guidance system in the Pavetack system that the Americans have. We have very few missiles available for training. We have no war stocks at all-the GBU15 or the AGM130-which are the sort of weapons we need to utilise this capability. We are also very short on any electronic warfare capability. That means that in a hostile environment we do not have the electronic counter measures that we should have. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the deficiencies of this Government's policy that although they put the radar warning system into the F111s quite a few years ago they never proceeded to do the same with electronic counter measures. That is something that must be done. We also need things like the Harm missile, the high speed anti-radiation missile, so that we are able to remove defensive radars. We have the nucleus of great capabilities within the Air Force, but we also have major deficiencies which limit its use. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army has suffered enormously from the Whitlam doctrine of no threat, a 10-year warning time and the low-scale incursions which have been written up so heavily over the years. While we have very high professional capabilities in the officers of the Australian Army and a very high degree of training and readiness in the Third Brigade, the Operational Deployment Force in Townsville, we have an army which has very limited capabilities. It is an army that we cannot commit to the Gulf in any major operational role because it is a light infantry army. It does not have any armour; it does not have any artillery; it has none of the engineering units to the degree needed to support an armoured division or even a brigade. The Army has been reduced to a very low level land warfare capability, the consequence of a doctrine of the low level incursions. The Army has been told repeatedly by this Government that it has to worry about a couple of hundred nomadic guerillas who will come into the country with sacks of rice on their backs and a couple of packs of ammunition. This has been the consequence of the no threat for 10 years and the low level incursions. </PARA>
<PARA> It has had a very disastrous and debilitating effect on the capability of the Australian Army. Army lecturers talk about the essential nature of having mobility, fire power and flexibility. But sadly, as a consequence of this Government's policy, the Australian Army has none of those capabilities to the degree it should. The essential point I am making here is the inappropriateness of the policies that this Government has followed with respect to the defence forces, and the Gulf situation has exposed those very dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the basic causes of all this has been the strategic basis paper. Australian Governments of all political persuasions, since a short while after the Second World War, have called for a strategic basis paper to be prepared roughly every decade, or maybe as short as six or eight years on some occasions. In the strategic basis paper various experts try to define what threats Australia might face in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategic basis paper then leads to a White Paper. The last White Paper entitled the Defence of Australia was published in 1987. The tragedy of those two documents is that they are not accurate. They cannot be accurate with the best will in the world. They are like a Queensland railway timetable; they are a guide to what might happen. They demand a forecasting ability from people who, although they may know a great deal about the subject, simply cannot predict with the degree of accuracy that is required to plan a force structure. The Government then takes the current paper on the Defence of Australia and says to the three Services, `That is how the structure of your three Services will be from now on; go to it'. It is not as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look back at history we see that no strategic basis paper for Australia ever foresaw the communist terrorist incursions into Malaya-as it was then; no strategic basis paper ever foresaw Indonesian confrontation with Sukarno; and no strategic basis paper foresaw Vietnam, let alone Fiji, and least of all Kuwait. The point has to be hammered that while the strategic basis papers and the Defence of Australia document give a reasonable argument of what might happen, they must not be taken as holy writ. The very sad thing is that when one talks to the senior officers in all three Services, one finds that they all accept the Defence of Australia paper as holy writ-something that cannot be challenged or departed from. One cannot live that way; one gets caught out because circumstances are unpredictable. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem with the Defence of Australia paper is that it inevitably has a degree of ambiguity in it. It is capable of interpretation in several different ways. While there is a good case to be made for having strategic basis papers-and I think we would be very foolish not to have them-and for having a White Paper on defence, the basic position that a government must adopt is to attain a level of professional competence in a range of abilities in all three Services; that is, to run a professional service not slanted, as the Australian Army is for example, towards low scale insurgencies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inevitable that geography and circumstance will create a little bias one way or the other; for example, we might do things quite differently in Australia from the way that Switzerland does them because, for one thing, if we lived in Switzerland we would not have a navy. But the basic point must be that there has to be a range of professional skills in all three services so that when the unusual and unexpected arises it can be coped with. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of all of this is that we have to do better. We are not doing very well in the Defence Force at present, despite the expenditure of a considerable amount of money. The Bill before us today shows that $52.7m has to be expended to put three ships in the task force at a time in the Gulf and illustrates the shortcomings of the present capabilities of the Australian Defence Force, which is as a consequence of this Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We had to spend a great amount of that money on equipment that should have been in those ships as part of their normal complement. I have been told for years by the Royal Australian Navy that the moment one of our tier one ships slips away from the dockside at Garden Island and sails it is ready for war. Quite obviously, when this degree of expenditure has to go into the close in weapon systems and the communications systems, then when the test comes, it is not true. Most of the other expenditure that has been involved in the Gulf deployment could arguably be offset against normal training commitments of peacetime steaming and exercise time. Basically, the real increase comes from putting essential equipment into those ships that was not there. I believe we can do better and we must do better. We can get better value for money than we are at present, and that is the point that I wish to make tonight to the Senate in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate is aware, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 seeks a further appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $234.1m for this financial year. The need for this amount, of course, is directly related to the consequences arising from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait six months ago. Under the circumstances, the Australian Democrats do not dispute the urgency which surrounds the passage of this Bill, or the need to make an advance of the Additional Estimates to meet urgent expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A great many countries which took part in the United Nations (UN) sponsored economic and trade sanctions against Iraq did so in the firm belief that in time these sanctions would have eventually forced Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the economic sanctions applied against Iraq to protest the illegal occupation of Kuwait were never really given a chance to run their full course. The irony is that for the first time in the history of the United Nations full and comprehensive sanctions were invoked by the Security Council with wide international support from a majority of nations. </PARA>
<PARA> On the two previous occasions when sanctions were organised by the UN Security Council-that is, against Southern Rhodesia in 1966, and an arms embargo against South Africa in 1977-there was nowhere near the same level of international support or indeed cooperation for the sanctions to succeed. As we saw, the sanctions imposed on Iraq had no parallel in the history of the United Nations. Unlike previous occasions, the sanctions imposed on Iraq were actually being enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have seen in the case of South Africa, sanctions do work but, in order for them to do so, the world must be patient and not rush into war as has happened with Iraq. The current boycott covers virtually all of Iraq's trade. This is three to four times greater coverage than in all previous successful sanctions cases. Beyond that, Iraq-geographically isolated and dependent on oil for 90 per cent of its export revenue-is far more vulnerable to economic coercion than target states in other sanctions cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, of course, has played an active role in supporting the UN sanctions against Iraq. The Democrats have stated many times that we would have preferred to have seen sanctions remain rather than embarking upon this catastrophic and tragic military confrontation. The Bill before us tonight provides for a special payment to be made by the Government to meet those insurance claims resulting from Iraq defaulting on credit sales of the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a matter of history that Iraq discontinued payments on virtually all of its trade with the outside world following the imposition of sanctions in August of last year. We must accept the sad reality that to take the responsible action of joining in the imposition of sanctions against a regime which is guilty of breaching international law, as Iraq is, involves financial loss to those countries like Australia which join in that economic blockade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, of course, are of the strong belief that Australia and other responsible members of the international community should join together in many more cases to impose economic sanctions against those regimes which are guilty of breaching international law and standards, as Iraq has been. In the past, the Democrats have pointed out how other countries are also guilty of illegally invading and occupying their weaker neighbours, but no penalty has been imposed and certainly no economic sanctions were applied. It is little wonder that many countries and groups in our community are now calling into question the double standards that exist when we choose to forcefully punish countries like Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait while at the same time ignoring the illegal invasions and occupations that occur in other parts of the world. In the examples of East Timor, Tibet, Lebanon and Cyprus, no such international effort to apply total and comprehensive sanctions to punish the invader were organised. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, I have only recently received strong representations from the Cypriot community in Australia arguing that to forcefully punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait while ignoring the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 reflects poorly on the selectiveness with which the international community often chooses to act. In both cases an illegal invasion and occupation took place, and in both cases we find that the aggressors were guilty of an incredible number of human rights abuses. What the Democrats are arguing for is an equal application of international action when illegal aggression takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we would like to see economic and trade sanctions also applied against countries such as Turkey until they comply with United Nations Security resolutions-resolutions such as 353 of 1974 and 550 of 1984 concerning Turkey's illegal occupation of the northern half of Cyprus. To ignore this double standard merely underlines the injustice which has been committed against the Cypriot people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also heard much recently, particularly in this chamber, about the way in which Iraqi soldiers committed numerous atrocities against the Kuwaiti people and that this justified the military option being used. It has been argued that human rights abuses should not be tolerated and that the world needs to stand up to these abuses when they take place. I wish this were the case, but it is patently not. If it were, we would be imposing economic sanctions against dozens of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> A mere glance at the recent annual reports from Amnesty International will show that Iraq is not the only ogre in the world today. In fact, I am again reminded of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 where outrageous atrocities were committed against the Cypriot people by the advancing Turkish soldiers. Many of these abuses were not dissimilar in fact to the ones which Iraqi soldiers committed against the Kuwaiti people. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus Turkish soldiers systematically went from village to village throwing babies from balconies while on the pavement below other soldiers waited with bayonets fixed in an apparent contest to see who could get the baby first. Following the Turkish invasion, the Cypriot Government was also obliged to change the laws governing abortion because so many women from the northern part of the island had been raped by soldiers of the invading Turkish army. Again, I understand that any woman between the ages of 12 and 80 was considered fair game by the Turkish soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Amnesty International, Turkey today has one of the worst human rights records of all nations. Since 1980, there have been more than one-quarter of a million prisoners of conscience jailed in Turkish prisons. Torture and ill treatment of prisoners of conscience are absolutely routine. In addition to this, we have the situation where the Turkish Government is guilty of widespread suppression of minorities, in particular the Kurds and the Armenians. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this example of Turkey's human rights record and of its invasion of Cyprus to show that the world often does not act in the same way as it has done in the case of Iraq, and to point out to the Senate that the imposition of sanctions as an option in the past has been applied very selectively. On the one hand, the world imposes sanctions against Iraq in protest at its invasion of Kuwait and for its human rights abuses and, on the other hand, we refuse to countenance the possibility of imposing sanctions against Turkey for its invasion of Cyprus-and it is still there. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other instances such as this one which I could point out; for example, Syria's brutalisation of Lebanon and the outrageous human rights abuses that take place under that regime. The awful irony is that both Turkey and Syria, guilty of the same crimes as Iraq, are now part of the allied military action in the Gulf and stand to be handsomely rewarded when the war is over. We find today that the United States (US) and its allies, including Australia, Japan and Germany, are expected to reward both Turkey and Syria when this war ends. In fact, the rewards have already started to flow and include both financial and economic inducements and contracts for the part that Turkey and Syria have played in siding with the allies during this war. We find this totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last year, during the seventy-fifth anniversary at Gallipoli, the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) agreed to strengthen trade ties with Turkey, when we should instead be looking at ways to apply pressure on Turkey. We should be lobbying the United States and our other friends in Europe to possibly impose the same wide-ranging sanctions against both Turkey and Syria until they both get out of Cyprus and Lebanon respectively-until they both stop committing human rights abuses regularly. In this case the cost may be great to the governments of the world but there is a principle, and future generations will ask us why we acted so selectively. </PARA>
<PARA> One other aspect of this Bill before us arises from the fact that Australia alone seems to be bearing an unfair cost for its part in imposing sanctions against Iraq. I understand that when Iraq invaded Kuwait last year, Iraq was in the process of authorising payments totalling $2.8m to the Australian Wheat Board to cover part of the shipments of wheat already delivered. I am advised that this payment was to be via the United States, but on the same day the payment was to be made the US Administration froze all Iraqi assets in the United States. We would have thought that this freeze on Iraqi assets was intended to stop Iraq having access to funds and not designed to prevent other countries receiving money due to them from Iraq, particularly friends of the United States such as Australia. Why is it then that the United States Treasury has continued to refuse to release that $2.8m owed to the Australian Wheat Board by the Iraqi Government? Why is this money still in the US banking system?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to the Democrats that this contrasts quite dramatically with the speed with which the US Congress approved special supplementary payments to be made to Turkey, Egypt and Israel for their loss of trade due to the war. I note that one recent Australian university study estimated that the American subsidies cost Australian wheat farmers as much as $336m in 1987-88. This is at a time when the Australian Wheat Board estimates $115 a tonne as the price Australian farmers are likely to receive for their wheat this year-the lowest in real terms for 50 years. Now we have the situation where changes in American agricultural policy will force that price even lower. This is where the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has calculated the return to Australian wheat growers would be $115 a tonne, even without the trade war. I raise these matters to demonstrate that the Australian economy is suffering much more because of this war than this Bill implies. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, the Democrats will be supporting this Bill because we see a very clear distinction between the political decision to send troops to war-with which we disagree-and the reality of supporting those troops in their own defence while they are in a war zone. We have always supported sanctions. We urge the Government to again study the possibility of calling for sanctions on other regimes around the world where human rights abuses and invasions have taken place. Saddam Hussein is a vicious bully who must be stopped. He is not the only one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91. This Bill seeks to appropriate from Consolidated Revenue a sum of $234.1m. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in placing those trade sanctions on Iraq that we have heard so much about this evening, is finally doing something about lifting some of the burden which has been placed on Australian trade. The Prime Minister did declare at the time that not one section of Australia would suffer the consequences of the trade sanctions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is only a beginning in the replacement of the trade and the income lost by Australian industries. All trade sanctions-those proposed by the Australian Democrats especially-come at a cost. As I have already said, Australia is only now starting to pay for the loss in trade. Through this Bill, we are starting to pay for the expenses that have been run up in actually sending forces to the Gulf. That comes to approximately $52.659m. Of course, the loss of wheat sales to Iraq is a larger figure than that. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for a payment of $181.4m to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet the insurance claims on the non-payment for wheat sold to Iraq that had been insured under the national interest provision of the Australian Trade Commission Act. This is not before time. We all know from what has been said already in this debate today, and yesterday in the House of Representatives, that the Australian wheatgrowers are suffering badly at present because of depressed prices that are not only the result of depressed pool payments and the non-payment of proceeds from Iraq sales, but also the trade war between the United States and the European Common Market. I will return to this later. </PARA>
<PARA> I was intrigued by Senator Bourne's remarks that we should have stayed with the trade sanctions which would have finally worked. She went on to contradict herself when she said that trade sanctions fall unevenly on people in Australia. I agree with the latter statement but I could not put the two together. I believe that trade sanctions in South Africa have failed. Other people may think differently. However, even after 20 years trade sanctions have not worked. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this Bill appropriates moneys to meet claims by the wheat industry but further payments will be required later on. That is by no means the end of the story. I believe that there will be a further claim of $247m towards the end of June, some more claims in 1991-92 and, finally, a claim of $34m in 1992-93 to help wind up the pools of wheat sold as far back as 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty per cent of the total sales was not insured at all because in practice only 80 per cent of credit sales are insured. Someone has to pick this up. I know who is picking it up at present-the Australian wheat farmer, the businesses that rely on those farmers, all the downstream industries and the suppliers of imports such as chemicals and fertilisers, and rail transport. They are all suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of an uninsured figure of 20 per cent, I have worked out that $123m is missing. I hope that in due course the Prime Minister will come up with something to enable farmers to recover that money. There has been a lot of talk about this gap of about $123m but no-one has come up with an answer yet. Mr Kerin, along with the Prime Minister, was certainly quick to tell us that we would not want the burden of sanctions to fall on one industry alone. So I am waiting for either the Prime Minister or Mr Kerin to come and tell us what they have in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bourne pointed that $A3.5m is frozen in the United States. Prior to the beginning of sanctions, Iraq was in the process of making payments to Australia via its assets in America. As all honourable senators well know, when sanctions were applied Iraq ceased paying any accounts. But this one, which was already in the pipeline, was frozen along with other assets of Iraq in the United States. I put on record my disappointment-and, of course, the industry's disappointment-that a friendly nation like the United States did not let that money flow through. I know that it is only $3.5m, but that figure would represent a reasonable amount per tonne extra that could be paid out into the pool. </PARA>
<PARA> I know from reading different media releases that the United States Government allegedly paid money out of some frozen funds to its own farmers or businessmen, as the case may be, and kept frozen the Australian finances that should have come through. I am very disappointed and I believe that this Government should keep up pressure on the United States Government to let that $3.5m through. As I have said before, it is not a great amount but certainly it would be better in Australian wheatgrowers' accounts than being left frozen in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to what the Australian Wheat Board had to say as late as 21 January 1991. I refer to an article in the Canberra Times of 23 January 1991 which had a rather optimistic outlook on payments that are still to come out of Iraq-an optimistic view that I do not have at present. The article reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board said yesterday that it remained confident that Iraq would honour its wheat debts and remain an important customer for Australian wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq had always honoured its business agreements-</PARA>
<PARA>and I do not deny that-</PARA>
<PARA>with the board in difficult times and depended on Australia as a major long-term supplier, a spokesman said yesterday. It was important that wheatgrowers understood all the factors that had contributed to the disastrous returns they were facing. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the Australian Wheat Board used that as a palliative to lead wheatgrowers into believing that funds would flow through later on at a faster rate. But certainly with the destruction that is going on in Iraq, I think that it will be a long time before that country will again be a big customer or even be able to pay for past sales. I mention that in passing because I normally believe that the Australian Wheat Board truly represents its industry. But I do not quite share its optimistic outlook in this case. Of course, while we hear about the wheat loss that we have suffered and the non-payment for sales that have been made, quite a few forgotten items are not mentioned very often. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the loss of the premium wheat trade, by which we exported approximately $391.5m in 1989-90, we also lost the live-sheep trade to Kuwait and that resulted in a loss of $30.9m. I suppose the end of the live-sheep trade from Australia to the rest of the world may be music to the ears of one party in this place, that is, the Democrats, but if they think that, they may be in for a big disappointment. When trade with South Africa eventually resumes, it will take up quite a bit of the slack that has been lost. A sum of $30.9m has been lost in that trade. That was the amount for 1989-90. We also exported $18.1m worth of cereals in 1989-90 to Kuwait and that also has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the action in the Gulf, our losses do not stop there. The reverse situation applies with imports into this country, that is, the products needed to help grow wheat and other cereals. For example, increased petroleum prices worldwide have pushed up the expenses incurred by farmers and other industries, such as transport, as well as for motorists. A 0.1c jump in prices paid at the petrol bowser represents a $22m growth in farm fuel bills. I will repeat that. A 0.1c rise at the pump means that Australian farmers pay $22m more for fuel in the course of a year. That is a massive figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course fuel costs are a major part of total farm costs and cereal growers are paying at least 12 per cent more for their imports. Excise payments to the Government, based on higher crude oil prices, have increased. For every $US1 increase per barrel in the price of oil, the Federal Government takes another $70m per year. I do not have any pangs of conscience about supporting this Appropriation Bill. The Government has to make up this insurance shortfall because of the windfalls it has had. I know the world price of oil has reduced from the peak of around $US42 a barrel in the early days of the imposition of sanctions. The oil prices receded once the conflict started but they have stabilised at a higher figure than was around at this time last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the windfall to government in one financial year could be around $800m. It has been mooted that it could be $500m in the balance of this financial year. If oil prices averaged $US29.24 a barrel over one financial year, farmers would pay $180m more in fuel costs, resulting in a cut of 12 per cent in farm income. At present the average farm income-I think this figure was estimated a month ago-is only $5,500 or just one-fifth of the average Australian earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to that, increased petroleum prices have lifted the cost of sea, land and air transport around the world. We rely on both sea and air transport to export our products from Australia. In the case of sea transport, no-one can tell me it is the buyer of the freight who pays for its transport. The buyers may pay, but it is actually deducted in the original contract, in which allowance is made for it. The same applies to horticultural produce, a great deal of which is air-lifted out of Australia. This will cause a vast increase in the cost to horticultural producers. For example, virtually all produce from the Kununurra area in Western Australia, which is better known as the Ord River scheme, is air-lifted to the eastern States, to Singapore or to places like that. Increased petroleum prices will have a great bearing on the producers there. I could go on and deal with matters such as insurance premiums on shipping in a world in conflict. I could add various examples, but I do not intend to take up too much more of the time of the Senate this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian farmers are in severe recession and now wheat growers face further problems as a result of the loss of one of their major commodity markets. At a later date, the Government, as I said, could ease the problem by returning to the agricultural sector some of its windfall gains from the increases in fuel prices, in addition to what is provided under this Bill, of course. The Government could really spread the cost of those United Nations sanctions around. As I said earlier, the cost of those sanctions should be spread throughout the community, as the Prime Minister promised in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than helping in monetary terms, the Government could help the wheat industry by taking up the idea of a trade mission to the United States. That was suggested by my leader, Dr Hewson, in the House of Representatives today. He suggested the Government should send a high level trade mission or negotiating party to the United States and to all the governments of countries in the European Community. Perhaps that would bring some sense into the trade war in wheat which is currently going on between those countries. Wheat is not like wool. We will be debating wool in the next few days. We have a massive overproduction of wool in Australia but that does not apply to the wheat industry. The wheat industry does not have a debt around its neck as the wool industry does. In fact, the wool industry will probably finish up with a debt in the order of $3.5 billion by the end of this season. The wheat industry, by contrast, is very efficient but it has been forced down to probably the most basic figure per tonne at which Australian wheat growers could hope to stay in production, and that is roughly $120 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> In a press release today the Prime Minister said that he would consider seriously supporting the coalition's proposal to send a bipartisan delegation to the United States to protest against wheat growing export subsidies. I believe that in that way the Government could, with very little effort at all, put a greater return into the pockets of Australian wheat growers and, as I mentioned earlier, the downstream industries which depend on them and supply them. If the Australian Government could convince overseas governments to stop this ridiculous trade war, which no-one will win in the long run, it will help put this trade back onto an even keel. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australian wheat growers could secure just $30 per tonne, I believe they would be put back into a reasonably good position. Most of them are also woolgrowers. I know from research and decisions I have made in other places that one can expect no profit from wool for at least five years. Hopefully at the end of that time the industry will be restructured and will be back in the position it held previously in Australia. I think it will then contribute to the welfare of Australia as it did in the past. However, wheat could be put into that situation with very little effort if the proposed delegation of the Prime Minister and Dr Hewson can talk some sense into the governments I mentioned. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that what we are doing here tonight is repeating a mistake that has been made over decades in the approach this world has had to a number of the problems it has been faced with. It seems that here we go yet again trying to solve a problem by throwing money at it. I would have thought that our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) would have been chastened recently at the World Council of Churches in relation to the suggestion that throwing money at a problem had any possibility of solving it. That attitude has been demonstrated over recent years to have been a fallacy. It is an old attitude, an attitude which was reflected in Senator MacGibbon's contribution. As a preamble to his speech he expressed the attitude that the theory of greenhouse could not be proven through mathematical modelling. He said that because he was obviously concerned about Senator Coulter's contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a preamble to what I have to say, I would like to address the attitude displayed in Senator MacGibbon's statement. In fact, practical observations have already demonstrated by measured increases in global temperatures both of the atmosphere and of parts of the oceans that something is changing in those atmospheres and oceans. I was fortunate enough recently to visit the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in California, where I saw both direct and tangible evidence of these changes, and a variety of models-the models which were scoffed at and perhaps not even understood by Senator MacGibbon-which I saw demonstrated by eminent leaders in physics and oceanography. These models attempted to evaluate the potential effects of global warming. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with pedestrian thinkers such as Senator MacGibbon is that it is difficult for them to extrapolate, to move from the known to the unknown, and to imagine anything other than that which is self-evident and immediately apparent. Such thinking belongs to the category of `I'll believe it when I see it'. That sort of thinking was also expressed in statements made by a few of Tasmania's civil engineers at a conference held in Hobart in 1988. The conference, Greenhouse 88, had to suffer the contributions of such mental plodders, whose best efforts were statements such as, `When the sea level has risen by one metre I will believe that the greenhouse effect exists'. </PARA>
<PARA> Such thinkers are unable to imagine the dramatic effects which would result from a fractional increase in world ambient temperatures-possibly such things as the potential shifting of the roaring forties, which is of particular relevance to Tasmanians. Other effects might be the redirection or even the complete disintegration of the gulf stream drift-and I mean the other gulf. I refer to potential effects such as the increased salinity of the waters of our Great Barrier Reef; the southward shift of the Melanesian monsoons; and the interruption, exaggeration or even failure of the El Nino effect. That is something with which Senator Panizza should be concerned, because it is that very effect which brings great variations to the otherwise dependable climate upon which our wheat growing industry depends. </PARA>
<PARA> The immense economic, social and environmental consequences of any of these events are things which vary. They are not predictable at the moment but are questionable. These are things which very few people have shown any willingness to consider, and they remain misunderstood and in the category of the unknown. In medieval times, when people did not understand something or did not want to understand it, they saw it as sorcery, mumbo jumbo or the work of the devil and then recoiled in horror. We can no longer afford such childish attitudes. We have a responsibility to explore, to chart if possible and to modify the effects of our actions. But at the moment we are not seriously accepting that responsibility. We are busily engorging ourselves in primitively violent attempts at resolving our problems. We spend huge amounts of energy, make huge physical and social efforts, and make huge investments of intellect and research just to add a technological gloss of sophistication to the primitive arguments we have been conducting over resources for thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter was particularly concerned to show in his speech that, if we were to spend but a fraction of our wasted and entirely misguided military spendings on the resolution of the problems we have due to the unequal distribution of our planet's wealth, the freedoms, liberties, entitlements and heritages that we claim to be fighting for could be more equitably shared anyway. It is my belief and the belief of a number of other people who consider the future of society on our planet that resource wars of a number of types are possible if not likely in the future. They are even more likely now because of the investments we have made in establishing military industries and selling military goods to each other, and in selling those goods across all ideologies and religions and across all traditional rivalries, so that those who in the future are desperate for energy, food or mineral resources will be capable of using military hardware to pursue their claims for a share of the planet's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> But what do we do? We sit here as witnesses to our pathetic inability to devise and use an economic system which can equitably share our resources. We need a new world attitude. We certainly do not need a new world order, but we do need a new world attitude-one which enables us to distribute our resources equitably and to divide the products of our labours, whether they be primary industry products, manufactured items or whatever. All people are entitled to be rewarded for their efforts and, as Senator Panizza would agree, no particular section of our community should have to suffer penalties as a result of community or government decisions made on their behalf. The problem with the present world attitude-and this is a cliche for which I apologise-is that it is bound up with the attitude of `might is right'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I do apologise for that, but it seems that pedestrian thinking generates such cliches, and we are bound in it. I am dismayed that, with the emergence in the Middle East of a problem which had been manifested by an attempt to establish military superiority by the Iraqi regime, we were incapable of recognising that at our very feet, at the very instant that that happened, with the dissolution of the Cold War arrangement of world affairs, we had the opportunity to demonstrate the good purposes to which our technological advancements had brought us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had the opportunity to use the technological superiority which some people would have been pleased to see expressed in air power and the capability of delivering ordnance from one place to another, but that capability was also able to bring to the supervision of the United Nations sanctions something which had not existed before, something which had been lacking in other attempts to enforce sanctions. I refer to worldwide cooperation in communications, information sharing and surveillance. Therefore, the enforcement of sanctions came as close to 100 per cent foolproof as has ever been enforced in history, but we gave it less than five lousy months in which to succeed. We were unable to see the potential to bring about a new world attitude. We certainly need a new world attitude, one in which authority, fairness and good government do not depend on military superiority, financed by unequal resource exploitation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested in hearing Senator Bell's speech which, as Hansard will confirm, was laced with comments about other people being pedestrian, childish, and mental plodders-a term he used once, maybe twice. We may ask ourselves what entitles Senator Bell to use such disparaging comments about other people. Honourable senators may not know that at the conferences held by the Australian Democrats they have what are called RATO courses which entitle Democrats to rise above the ordinary. That seems to entitle people such as Senator Bell to go around casting aspersions on others. However, Senator Bell's speech did not rise above the ordinary, and I am sure that if he attends one of those courses he will fail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some irony in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which is now before us. The Government policy on the Gulf conflict as set out in the resolution passed by this Parliament has received strong bipartisan support from the coalition. There are only two small groups who have opposed our national policy. These comprise the Australian Democrats and the socialist Left of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). These two groups, I regret to say, have in effect formed a coalition to oppose the national policy and our United Nations sanctioned forces in the Gulf. In my view, and I am pleased to say in the view of the vast majority of the Australian people, the Australian Democrats are completely out of touch not only with the national mood, but also with the supporters of their own political Party. </PARA>
<PARA> For the edification of some senators who may not have seen last week's Bulletin, I would refer them to an opinion poll that it took on the attitudes of various voters in political parties to the crisis in the Gulf. Senator Lees and Senator Bell may not be aware of that issue of the Bulletin, but I urge them to obtain it. They will see that in answer to the question, `Do you approve of Australia being part of the United States led forces?', just under two-thirds of those who typified themselves as voting for the Australian Democrats supported that proposition. In other words, it is nonsense for Senator Powell to lecture this Senate to the effect that a majority of the Australian people did not support the resolution that was before this Parliament, and Senator Powell's statement was backed up by her Senate colleagues. Not only was that statement untrue, but not even a majority of Senator Powell's own side supported the position of the Australian Democrats. As this debate continues Senator Bell, Senator Lees and their colleagues may well reflect on that matter. Not only are they out of touch with the national mood of this nation in what can be regarded as some type of national crisis, but they are out of touch with the mood of their own people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one thing for the Australian Democrats to adopt a pacifist position, a policy which in my view effectively amounts to appeasement. It is quite another for sections of the Labor Party, the national Left or socialist Left, to adopt a similar policy. Members of the ALP national Left continue to enjoy the perks of office and at the same time oppose the policies of their own Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates has been rather active in this chamber in opposing the war. He made a speech which clearly showed that he had a very strong pacifist position. I think that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was quite right to point out, and I am happy to support him, that the Labor Party has never been pacifist. Therefore, if Senator Coates is a pacifist, what on earth is he doing in the Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA> It has been a relief in one sense to hear Labor Party members not ask dorothy dixers of Ministers, and we have had many of these questions in the short time I have been in this Parliament. It is interesting that Senator Coates now seems to be able to ask questions which clearly have not been passed out to him by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). Indeed, Senator Coates still enjoys the perks of government; he is the chairman of an important standing committee in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough, in my view, that those in the socialist Left or national Left, or whatever one wants to call them, not only oppose the Government's policy but, even worse, continue actively to campaign against Australia's commitment in the Gulf. It is one thing to say, `I do not accept what Mr Hawke, Mr Keating, Senator Button and Senator Evans are doing' and shut up about it-and I imagine that we can all cope with those matters of conscience-but this is not the case with the national Left. It is not the attitude of Senator Childs or of many people on the Left. They are actively campaigning against the policy of their Government while they continue to enjoy in some senses the perks of office. In my view, there are few more serious decisions that this Parliament has to make than that which commits a nation to war. But having made the decision to commit men and women in our armed forces to war, the public at large, and indeed the men and women of our defence forces, have the right to expect the Government on all occasions vigorously to defend its policy. It is of concern that at times the Government appears to allow the Labor Left to campaign vigorously against the national bipartisan policy on the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> A divided party certainly undermines the Government's capacity to lead public opinion. Last week there was an interesting example of this. Senator Robert Ray was asked to comment on whether he agreed with a statement by Senator Childs-one of the leaders of the national Left-that the allies should hold back from further military operations in Iraq. He was asked a question regarding the attitude of Senator Childs of the ALP national Left. </PARA>
<PARA> It was most noticeable to everybody in this chamber that Senator Ray did not on this occasion actively defend his Government's policy. We certainly saw none of the vigour, none of the determination and, at times, none of the passion which Senator Ray uses in defending his Government's policy-indeed, a bipartisan policy-when he receives questions from Senator Powell and Senator Vallentine. One may ask: so what? Senator Ray is far too smart a man to be trapped into exacerbating Labor Party tensions in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one view to put. But against that view one has to ask: what message does the Government give to the public at large? What message does it give to the members of the socialist Left, burrowing away, trying to undermine Government policy, when Senator Ray says very blithely in this chamber that dissent is a healthy thing? I can tell Senator Collins that I do not argue that dissent is a healthy thing. When a senior Labor Party backbencher attacks the national policy on this most vital issue, one can say that it is appropriate that we should have some dissent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Childs has the perfect right to put forward whatever anti-American and anti-Government views he wishes to express. But when he does do that-and this is the point-the public has a right to expect that a senior Minister will vigorously defend his Government's policy and expose the weaknesses and the contradictions of the socialist Left position. Senator Ray-who, I might say, by and large has been an effective spokesman for Government policy-to my mind, gave a very bad impression on this occasion to the Parliament and certainly gave a very bad impression to the public at large who may well have listened to the radio broadcast. </PARA>

A letter to all Labor Party members was sent out at the end of last month. This letter is entitled, `Labor for Peace in the Middle East'. We do not object to that; we are all for peace. The letter started off as Labor Party letters presumably used to, and I am surprised to find they still do, with `Dear Comrade'. I thought that term might have gone out recently. This is, again, signed by prominent members of the Victorian socialist Left-members of the Labor Party, the party of Senator Collins. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>In response to the deeply held feeling of outrage against the war being waged at the insistence of the United States in the Middle East-and the Hawke Government's rush to commit Australia to the war-a group of Labor Party members have moved to support the growing Peace Movement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what I have said. There is room for more than one view. But what we would like to hear from people like Senator Collins and his senior colleagues, when people in their Party cast aspersions-and, make no mistake, they are casting aspersions against a policy which has committed men and women to war-is a more vigorous defence of their policy. That is the point. No-one is arguing that Labor Party people have not got the right to say that. What we are arguing is that we want to see more activity on behalf of Ministers to ensure that the national bipartisan policy is effectively supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was also a recent report in the Sun-Herald newspaper that an anti-war meeting was held in the office of the Victorian Department of Education. Why the office of the Victorian Department of Education-controlled by the socialist Left, again-is being used to hold anti-war meetings, I really do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins might pick this point up: if this conflict proves more long lasting than is currently expected-and we all hope it ends very soon-the activities of the socialist Left will make it more difficult to maintain the national bipartisan policy. The hypocrisy and double standards of the Left stand exposed in its failure to adequately condemn Iraq's barbaric behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will notice in the resolutions which the parliamentary Left and the national ALP Left regularly bring down that Israel has not been commended in any way for its courageous self-restraint in the face of Iraq's deliberate attempt to inflict maximum civilian casualties and damage through its Scud attacks and threats to unleash poison gas. Some 10,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by the Scud missiles that have landed in Israel. Four people have been killed, hundreds severely injured, the country terrorised and its economy severely damaged by the effects of this war. Israel's precarious strategic environment and genuine security concern should be self-evident, even to its most callous critics. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the prospect of any peace and stability in the Middle East depends on defeating the ruthless Iraqi tyrant, thereby strengthening the more moderate Egyptian-led elements in the Arab world which are giving the forces of moderation and democracy a chance to grow. As I said, there is an aspect of total hypocrisy in respect of the socialist Left in that there is no recognition at all of the restraint that Israel has shown in the wordy resolutions that it regularly releases. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw the Senate's attention to the allegations made by the Prime Minister and others regarding bias in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's reporting of the Gulf crisis. Even before the findings of the ABC were released, this report appeared in the Canberra Times of 11 February 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> A meeting in Canberra of the ALP national Left yesterday called on the Federal Government to begin a renewed international effort to end the Gulf war and-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the point-</PARA>
<PARA>dissociated itself from Mr Hawke's attack last month on the ABC's television coverage of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bruce Childs said delegates felt the ABC was an independent body and that its war coverage had compared favourably with that of other television networks. </PARA>
<PARA>This was before the ABC launched an inquiry into the Prime Minister's allegation of bias by the ABC, which he was perfectly entitled to do. Before the results of that inquiry came out, Senator Childs said that his section of the Labor Party dissociated itself from the accusations of the Prime Minister. There was no study and no evidence. What does it matter that a large section of the Labor Party is actively campaigning against a policy which has committed this Government to war? It is incredible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think I was responding to the interjections made rather than the reverse, as perhaps implied by your ruling. As I was about to mention, the ABC conducted an inquiry into the allegations by the Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, the ABC has tried itself and found itself innocent, despite a few shortcomings. The ABC report found that at times its reporting on the Gulf was excellent. Earlier press reports-and I do not know whether they are correct-suggested that there was no need for the ABC to even assess all of the evidence, to get all the tapes along, to have a close look and to subject itself to a rigorous analysis. There was no need, apparently, to call any of the outside critics who may have wished to put evidence before the ABC. Why not? Large numbers of people have said that they have found trouble with ABC reporting and that we should conduct an inquiry to seek the wider views of people. But that did not occur. It is interesting that people vigorously defended the ABC against the Prime Minister's charge of bias, including a number of pacifist groups as well as the socialist Left and the Australian Democrats. In short, if this investigation proved only one thing it was that the complaints procedure at the ABC needs to be dramatically overhauled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear from Senator Collins's colleague Mr Beazley, who does not quite agree with the approach that has been taken by Senator Collins tonight. Mr Beazley said that there were two possible options open to the Government. I hope there was not a third option which would be to do nothing. Mr Beazley canvassed two possible options. First, he suggested that there should be an outside independent mechanism to assess complaints. I suggest that it would be somewhat similar to having an ABC ombudsman. The second option would be to make the ABC subject to the rulings of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I happen to believe that the appointment of an ABC ombudsman would do much to restore public confidence in the ABC. Possibly there should be a parliamentary inquiry into which of the two options is most appropriate. This mechanism could possibly achieve a bipartisan position-I would not include Senator Childs and his colleagues in that-so that we had a proper, independent complaints procedure established for the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> I received a hint at dinner tonight that Senator Cooney, whose opinions we always respect in this Parliament, may well be reflecting on the ABC and this debate and the allegations of bias. Just to make it very clear, because I am sure that Senator Cooney will make many cogent points, I am not calling for an inquiry into the ABC; I am calling for the Government to look at the possibility of, and hopefully carry through, a policy of establishing an independent complaints mechanism for the ABC. </PARA>

I hope that the Government will ignore its left wing and proceed to establish an independent complaints procedure for the ABC. I would have to say that a failure on this score would convince many people that once again the Government is compromising policy to accommodate the Left.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bias in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has been much discussed in recent times. Senator Kemp, in his usual way, has put the case against it in the most lucid fashion. The allegations, amongst others, are that the ABC has treated Iraq's case too favourably and the allies not favourably enough. War engenders emotions and these make a poor basis for accurate judgment. Where balance lies, what is fair reporting and who should pass comment on the war are questions that different people, different interests, and different groups will answer in different ways. What to one person is a brilliant analysis of a particular issue is a shoddy diatribe to another. When we see bias, we often do so from a biased point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I do know. If Senator Crane listens he will see that we are all affected by bias. If we are not affected by bias, we should not be in this chamber. Senator Crane put a particular case and I hope that he put it well. If Senator Crane is suggesting that he has been elected by the Liberal Party of Australia to come in here and not to present a case that would forward its fortunes, I suggest that he is not doing the fair thing by his Party. By his interjection, I take it that that is what he is suggesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of us have a background, a culture, beliefs, experiences and temperaments that give a particular bent to our view of the world. It is hard to think of anyone without an affinity with a particular way of life, without attitudes to things they encounter in the world around them, and without at least some beliefs to which they adhere. Good judges do hold opinions, do live according to particular philosophies, do practise the tenets of a specific faith, and do possess different attitudes to issues that arise in the community. What makes them good judges is the ability to decide a matter without these things warping their sense of fairness. That is not an easy achievement. However, they do have the help of powerful judicial traditions. They must hear both sides to a dispute and give judgment on the basis of the evidence and arguments that the parties put forward. They must give reasons for their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> People who are not judges do not have these constraints in reaching a conclusion about a matter. Parliamentarians, including members of the Executive, can make pronouncements without going through a judicial process. They do not have to distance themselves from their beliefs, their emotions, and their deeply held attitudes about what goes on in the community. Accordingly, the conclusions that they draw are not guaranteed to be accurate or fair. The risk that parliamentarians and Ministers may run is that they draw conclusions flawed by a bent towards a particular point of view, an attitude or a belief for a political culture. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of considerable concern because they determine what funding, if any, the ABC will receive. The ABC is guaranteed independence by legislation but much pressure can be exerted on that either by a specific threat to trim its budget or by a declaration of how its viability depends on the taxpayers' dollar. It is interesting that, in all of the arguments we have had about the ABC, there has been no suggestion that a challenge has been made to the duty thrown onto the Corporation, by legislation, to maintain its independence. Is it the desire and the proposition of those who now attack the ABC to introduce amendments to the legislation which gives it existence-to put in a clause which says that the ABC will always present the views of the majority, be those the views of the government of the day or the views of the opposition of the day, or that its time be shared out so that the Government gets a certain part, the Opposition gets a certain part and the Australian Democrats get a certain part? Is it suggested that in some way the political masters of this country, whether they be in government or in opposition, control the ABC? Is that the suggestion?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From Senator Bishop's interjection, I understand that she wants to introduce legislation to subject the ABC to the will of the Parliament. If that is her position, that is a reasonable position to take up, and she should introduce legislation to see that that is done. If she does not want to introduce that legislation, what is she complaining about? She is complaining about the perception she has that the ABC is biased. If Senator Bishop gets up and puts forward that view, as Senator Kemp has fairly put it forward, that is her right in a democratic society and she should be listened to. But democracy does not consist of people agreeing to whatever the person or the party in power agrees to; democracy is the ability for all people to say what they want without fear of persecution. In that regard the Democrats and the Left of the Australian Labor Party have been much criticised for opposing the war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought that any war raises questions of doubt. I do not think that any people in this chamber, or others anywhere else, have gone into war with such conviction that they do not have some doubts about a war that brings about civilian deaths, that puts at risk allied soldiers, and that causes all types of disturbances in the Middle East. People may have doubt about that. Some people come down on one side of the argument and some people come down on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely to goodness war is not such an issue that people can come down and decide it one way without giving some respect to the truly held and conscientious beliefs of others. Surely we should be a nation so tolerant that we are able to have discussions in a proper and intellectual way. I think that the arguments that the Democrats, the left wing and Senator Vallentine present have much merit. To say that because we are at war the ability to argue, the right to debate and the entitlement to have a different view should be sacrificed is intolerable in a free and democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall just say something about the ABC and the way in which we treat it. It is one thing for someone without any ability to affect the resources of the ABC to rail against it; it is another for someone with that ability to do so. Members of the Parliament, whether on the front or the back bench, have a right to full debate. That is essential to the free society we enjoy. But we need to use our considerable rights in understanding what, in any particular case, they involve. In exercising our rights we should be careful not to diminish those legitimately held by others. The more distinguished the position we hold, the more considered we should be about the statements that we make about the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this independence of the ABC has been upheld by many a distinguished person. I shall quote one of them, Mr John Howard, who previously led the coalition and who is now shadow Minister for industrial relations. On 5 May 1983 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>More than ever before Australia needs an independent, fearless, professional Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I would have thought that at the very least that is an issue on which this Parliament might be able to achieve a bipartisan attitude. Perhaps that is an issue on which the much sought after consensus between the Government and the Opposition might be achievable. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to maintaining the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's independent news service. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard goes on to develop that theme further. About a year later, on 4 April 1984, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been willing to resort very readily to the cheap intimidation of an organisation which has always valued its independence and which has done a great service-often a discomforting service-to both sides of politics. Let nobody imagine that the Liberal Party has enjoyed some of the criticisms that have been made of it by the ABC. But the fact remains that through the years the ABC has been a worthwhile organisation in Australia. It has shown courage, it has shown independence and, frankly, that is what the Prime Minister cannot really abide. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, six years later, a considerable change of heart on the part of the Opposition which seems to have departed from those great principles that rang so clearly from the mouth of Mr Howard representing, as he then did, the position of the Liberal Party. What is wrong with the principles put forward by Mr Howard in those days? Another former Minister in the coalition Government, Senator Messner, on 17 February 1988 said:</PARA>
<PARA>That is bad news for Australia because everyone in this country knows the very great degree to which Australians depend upon a reliable, independent broadcasting service from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Duffy, a former Minister for Communications comes forth to defend that independence and refers to a period when the coalition was in a mood similar to the mood that it is in now. On 5 May 1983, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the independence of the ABC, I turn at this stage to the record of the people opposite who are now complaining about this issue. Over a period of years there was intimidation of the ABC, continued cuts in its budget and general abuse and denigration of the ABC news and current affairs staff. That criticism came, in particular, from the Country Party, now known as the National Party. That may well be the explanation why a spokesman in this area of communications did not today put forward this matter of public importance against us. Anybody in the Country Party would be embarrassed to talk about anybody on this side of the House in respect of the independence of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the performances. The former member for Gippsland the Honourable Peter Nixon, the then Opposition spokesman, on 17 March 1975, when he was what was somewhat quaintly described as an Opposition front bencher, senior Country Party spokesman on transport and Country Party spokesman on the media, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . ABC Commissioner is either a naive academic or is part of the plot to disseminate socialist propaganda Australia-wide over ABC radio news. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to point out that people become very protective of the ABC's independence or attack it with great enthusiasm depending upon the particular point of view they want adopted at a particular point in time. That seems to me to be evidence of bias on the part of those sorts of people or on the part of that party or on the part of that group rather than a bias on the part of the ABC. I am sure that the ABC is biased, but then the media generally is biased and I suppose everybody in the community, as I have already said, has some sort of bias. The way it is suggested that we get over that is to appoint an ombudsman or some board. Who is going to be the ombudsman? How far are we going to take into account his or her bias? Is that ombudsman going to look not only at the ABC, but at the media generally? Is it proper for us as a Parliament to look simply at the bias of the ABC and not to put that bias, in so far as it exists, in the context of the general bias that exists in the media?</PARA>
<PARA> We have spoken much today about the ABC's approach to the war. There would be agreement across party lines about that. But then what do we say about the bias in the press over the affair at Hoechst in Melbourne last year? What do we say about that? What do we say about the reporting of that event? Are we going to have an ombudsman look at that? What about the way the SPC affair at Shepparton was reported? Are we going to have an ability given to the unions or to the employer in each case so that they can challenge the media? Has anybody come in here and abused, in the way the ABC has been abused, the media for the way it treated those two issues?</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that democracy depends upon the ability of everybody to dissent. It is quite proper that people should criticise that dissent. It is quite proper that the various groups within this Parliament-the Australian Democrats, the National Party of Australia, the Liberals, the Australian Labor Party and the Green Party, represented by Senator Vallentine, should exchange healthy debate across the chamber. But that debate takes on a sinister air when there is a threat loaded into it that somehow that dissent, that debate, those differing opinions are going to be visited with sanctions either by the withdrawing of moneys or the threat, as it was made today, of having people imprisoned because they set up a dissent outside this Parliament. That was seriously put today by the Opposition through one of its members. That has not been denied. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp has asked Ministers make it clear that they dissent from people such as Senator Childs. Where is the overriding of the suggestion put by Senator Bishop today that people in this country who dissent should be gaoled for that dissent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly will. I am glad that I misunderstood Senator Bishop today. I will explain why I misunderstood her. First of all, she asked a question of the President as to whether the cells below this building had been cleared out. She then mentioned the fact that there was a group of dissenters outside the Parliament who had been there for a considerable period of time. I took it-obviously, I was wrong-that there was an inference in all of that that the cells might be available for people and an example of the sorts of people they might be available for was the people who were dissenting outside Parliament. Otherwise, I did not understand what the thrust of it was. If I am wrong about that, I certainly withdraw any imputation against Senator Bishop, for whom I have the greatest respect. I clearly would not have drawn those inferences if they had not been suggested to me in that fashion. But the juxtaposition of the points she was making to the President led me to that belief. In defence of myself, there were other people in the chamber who took the same inference, so it might be a good idea, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for Senator Bishop to clear up that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABC should not be isolated from the rest of the media. If we are going to criticise it and take it to task for its bias, we should take to task the media generally. Let us not be bullies, picking on one institution over which we might have more power than the others. We should try to do something about that, because, after all, it is not the ABC which is the problem, it is the bias. If the bias exists in the ABC and elsewhere then we should courageously take on the whole of the media. </PARA>
<PARA> The next problem is that it is a bit difficult to see who, in this chamber, is going to work out whether the ABC or any other part of the media is biased because, with the exception of Senator Crane, I would say that the rest of us have principles, beliefs, aspirations and attitudes which may give a bent to the sorts of things we do.

I hope that the occasion never arises where Ministers bring undue pressure on backbenchers who want to express views that differ from the Government. If one looks at the way the founding fathers set up the Constitution of this country, it is quite clear from its three chapters that there is the Parliament, the legislature; the Executive, the Ministers; and the judiciary. They are the three arms which are in balance. To exalt one of those arms-that is, the Ministry-above the others and give it a power to condemn and overrule the members of the legislature-as Senator Childs is-is, in my view, a perversion of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> For the proper exercise of democracy and for proper debate in this House, it is absolutely necessary that people have different points of view. I am sure that, at times, there are differing views on the other side of the chamber, though I gather from what has been said tonight that that is very rare. I apologise in advance to Senator Knowles if I offend her, but I suggest that even in the Opposition party room there is from time to time quite heated debate and differences of opinion. If I am wrong in that, I apologise. </PARA>
<PARA> Knowing the intellectual capacity of many of the people on the other side and the way they put their arguments forward vigorously, that could happen. But if it does not happen, I am sorry for suggesting it. There might be the odd difference of opinion even amongst the Australian Democrats. I know that they have their differences. I simply say that that is not a sign of weakness on anybody's part. I would have thought that was a sign of a good and healthy democracy. If honourable senators in this chamber-and this Government-insist that everybody should support the war and that it is somehow wrong or even traitorous to oppose the war, we have a society such as that which exists in Iraq. </PARA>

A member of my staff parked her car adjacent to the Senate entrance to this Parliament on a Sunday and was called later that day in a panic to come and remove her car because people were about to rip the doors off, tear the engine out, and otherwise destroy it as a matter of some urgency because it was a security matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Destruction came to Darwin in mid-morning on February 19, 1942, when war in the Pacific was but ten weeks old. </PARA>
<PARA> Destruction came while the sun shone, with a gentle breeze smudging a few white caps on blue waves rolling in from Beagle Gulf and the Clarence Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> Destruction by an enemy was brought that day for the first time to Australian soil. It came violently though not unexpectedly, with bombs and bullets and cannon shells scything through life as they splintered a fleet and a town and almost a human spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> Destruction and terror were such as to lead to a panic of people. Hundreds fled. </PARA>
<PARA> They left half smoked cigarettes, half finished drinks, unopened mail, unmade beds, incomplete jobs, open doors and caged pets. </PARA>
<PARA> They walked and they ran. They rode on bicycles and they rode in cars, in garbage trucks, ice cream carts, sanitary carts and road graders. Women and children, the aged, the infirm and those able bodied men who could escape detection rode in an evacuee train of cattle trucks and flattops that left them exposed to tropical heat. </PARA>
<PARA> The men who fled were not all civilians. Among them were many subject to a military discipline that was in tatters. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who did not flee included nearly 250 men and women, Australian, British and American, black and white, near-black and near-white whose bodies were at the bottom of the harbour, or soaking in oil-drenched mud on the beaches, or lying shattered in inadequate shelters. </PARA>
<PARA> Darwin that day became Australia's Pearl Harbour, centre of a debacle in the traditional tragedy of war without equal on Australian soil. Appropriately to the analogy, the Japanese task force which wrought this havoc was part of the same force, with identical leaders, which had started the Pacific war. </PARA>
<PARA>Forty-nine years ago is a very important time that we should remember. I am sure that there were many people in Darwin today, both local residents and war veterans of a number of wars since the Second World War, who took the occasion to think about the events of today and today's war in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> We must pay tribute to the men and the women who fought and died during the air raid attacks on Darwin on 19 February 1942. The bombing, regarded as the worst disaster in history on Australian soil, killed 243 people, left 300 wounded and caused major damage to shipping and ground facilities. Here we are, nearly half a decade later, and the people of the Northern Territory, of course, cannot afford to distance themselves from any war. </PARA>
<PARA> Next year will be the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Darwin; it will be an important hallmark occasion. I know that the Northern Territory Government has established a very special committee to look to the future and, in particular, to look at commemorating those events next year. It has proved a controversial project. It has attracted international attention and, hopefully, it will attract international tourists. The fact that many Japanese tourists and, in fact, people who served in the Second World War for Japan may take the occasion to come to Darwin next year, of course, produces conflicts and tensions for those Australian veterans who must accommodate that change and, at the same time, must recognise that 50 years is also an important stage in history. I bring to the Senate's attention tonight the fact that 19 February is an important occasion for Australia. It is certainly a point at which we should be considering carefully what we will do on 19 February next year. </PARA>

<PARA> Why is the Government, given Australia's balance of payment problems and the parlous state of the economy generally, permitting the importation of over 700,000 tyre casings per annum, which are of questionable quality, when Australian manufactured tyres comply with Australian Design Rule No. 23 and are produced to the highest quality and performance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Matters related to the safety of tyres fall within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Land Transport.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that Senator McLean has already received a detailed response from my colleague, Bob Brown on this issue in the Senate on the 19 December 1990. Nevertheless, let me reiterate that response.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the tyres concerned are imported from Japan, Europe and America whose standards for tyres are generally equivalent to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> A large number of commercial vehicle casings are imported by major companies in Australia to meet a shortfall of casings for remoulding in some sectors. In this context, let me add that it is important that non-tariff barriers, which presumably is what Senator McLean is advocating, do not impose unnecessary restrictions on legitimate commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is obviously concerned at ensuring that road safety standards are maintained. If the Honourable Senator has any definitive information on substandard tyres I would urge him to forward it to the Federal Office of Road Safety for investigation.</PARA>

<PARA> Annual audited financial statements have been received from all North West communities except Nyapari, whose accountant has failed to respond to several reminders, but has now returned from holidays and will be contacted again shortly.

<PARA> ``The Community Development Employment Project has not been conducted in accordance with the Rules and Guidelines applying to Organisations in receipt of grant funding, nor with the policy guidelines applicable to the Community Development Employment Project.</PARA>
<PARA> ``We are unable to satisfy ourselves that payments to individuals from the Community Development Employment Project have been made only to persons who were entitled to receive such payment or that payments to individuals who were entitled to receive such payment have been received by such persons''.</PARA>

<PARA> (7) There were no fraud or criminal investigations in relation to any South Australian CDEP communities.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission acknowledges the importance of community development plans. Work has commenced on developing a program. Both the Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are examining options for providing assistance to communities in the preparation of community development plans.</PARA>
<PARA> Under new administrative arrangements for CDEP, communities will have to provide a CDEP works program when making applications for CDEP grant funds. The works program will comprise a list of projects that the community sees as important to its social, cultural, recreational and economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> Communities are being encouraged to develop specific CDEP plans and/or community development plans. The CDEP works program would be an integral part of either of these plans.</PARA>
<PARA>ASSESSMENT CRITERIA</PARA>
<PARA> All CDEP grants are assessed by the Commission on the annual ``Grant Assessment Form'' which is completed by Regional Officers as part of the annual draft estimates documentation.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the annual grant assessment all CDEP projects are to be fully reviewed on a three year cycle commencing in 1991/92. It is envisaged that these reviews will be undertaken by officers from the Commission and the Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA>PRIORITY SETTING</PARA>
<PARA> Under new administrative arrangements priorities for the allocation of CDEP Oncost and Support funds will be determined by Regional Managers in consultation with Regional Councils and CDEP communities and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>INACCURATE PAYMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that some communities do not always submit fortnightly variation schedules. However, while this can cause short term inaccuracies, community entitlements are adjusted when subsequent schedules are received.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will be introducing administrative changes to the CDEP scheme to take effect from 1 April 1991. These changes have been designed to simplify the calculation of communities' entitlements and should reduce the possibility of inaccuracies. This streamlining will assist the monitoring process.</PARA>
<PARA>MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of qualified Aboriginal people has been a problem for DAA/ATSIC and communities alike. Training initiatives have been taken by DAA/ATSIC and the Department of Employment, Education and Training to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> As a part of new administrative arrangements for CDEP, a Training Needs Schedule and a training program to meet these needs for each CDEP is required. Through programs administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (Training for Aboriginals Program) funding is available for communities to engage a consultant, where appropriate, to prepare training needs analyses and/or training schedules for project participants.</PARA>
<PARA>ENTITLEMENTS, ALLOWANCES AND AWARD PAYMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> Since the ANAO audits of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were conducted there has been a significant improvement in the take up rate of the Family Allowance Supplement by CDEP participants. The Department of Social Security is promoting this allowance through its Aboriginal Liaison Officers and Community Agents.</PARA>
<PARA> While ATSIC encourages the payment of wages at award rates, the setting of pay rates is left to the discretion of community councils and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Award coverage for CDEP communities is a complex issue as the nature of the work generally is only part-time. The Commission is currently in the process of contracting a consultant to undertake research into industrial relations issues associated with CDEPs including the question of award coverage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>- Oil is an internationally traded commodity and it would be counterproductive for Australia to attempt to insulate itself from price changes in the international market.</PARA>
<PARA>- Any attempt to artificially hold down the price of Australian crude oil in order to prevent increases being passed on to the consumer would have a number of adverse consequences</PARA>
<PARA> * it would induce Australian producers to increase oil exports rather than supply the domestic market, in order to take advantage of the higher international prices</PARA>
<PARA> * it would reduce the incentive to conserve fuel, leading to increased rates of depletion of a scarce resource</PARA>
<PARA> * it would discourage investment in oil exploration and development in Australia with serious consequences for our ability to supply our future needs.</PARA>
<PARA>- As the Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA), Professor Alan Fels, noted in a press release on 4 October 1990, ``One factor not to be overlooked is that the price of oil has had a history of rises and falls . . . there have been a number of occasions when the price of crude oil has exceeded $US30 per barrel and subsequently it fell. Oil is a commodity the price of which is very sensitive to small changes in the quantity supplied and demanded. Basically, it is price inelastic in the short term. Buyers will pay a high price to secure supplies if there are fears of shortages''.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) Illegal entrants are identified through a system which records details of all persons who have remained in Australia after the expiry of their permission to stay. The priorities for locating and encouraging illegal entrants to leave Australia or deporting those who fail to leave voluntarily were announced by the Government on 5 August 1990. They include the following:-</PARA>
<PARA> - follow up temporary entrants, including visitors and students, who overstay their temporary entry permits;</PARA>
<PARA> - follow up people whose applications to remain are rejected to ensure they actually leave;</PARA>
<PARA> - apprehend illegal entrants who are working;</PARA>
<PARA> - carry out checks of employers and educational institutions;</PARA>
<PARA> - deport illegal entrants who have criminal convictions;</PARA>
<PARA> and</PARA>
<PARA> - investigate organised immigration rackets.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The Migration Act and Regulations provide the legislative framework for the compliance function. Detailed instructions and procedures for applying the legislation are contained in the Procedures Advice Manual. The guidelines (PAM) are publicly available through the Commonwealth Government Bookshop. All staff are required to apply these procedures in a fair, consistent and lawful manner.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) In addition to the training options in administrative law, decision-making, client relations and cultural awareness available to all Departmental staff, specific training is being provided for compliance staff on compliance specific matters. This includes briefing/training on new and revised legislation and procedures as changes are introduced as well as intensive training on the full range of compliance practices and procedures. Additional funds of $425,000 have been provided specifically for this purpose for 1990/91 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) All illegal entrants who are apprehended are given a document entitled Very Important Notice (VIN). This document details the access rights to legal counsel and consular representation, the eligibility requirements for applying for entry permits, and explains the procedures concerning illegal entrants. The document is frequently updated to accurately reflect the changes to the Migration Act and Regulations. For this reason the document is not translated; instead interpreters are used to assist persons to fully understand the Very Important Notice.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) The Procedures Advice Manual defines `work' as an undertaking of activity which might otherwise be available to an Australian permanent resident whether in a paid or unpaid capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) Compliance staff deal only with people who have breached the conditions of their entry permit and those who attempt to circumvent the provisions of the Migration Act and Regulations. People who abide by the conditions of their entry permit are not subject to compliance action nor are those illegal entrants who are able to satisfy requirements for extending their stay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> However, people illegally in Australia are subject to the provisions of the Migration Act and Regulations until such time as they either regularise their status in Australia, or leave. When an illegal entrant approaches the Department directly, procedures require staff to satisfy themselves as to whether or not that person has the right to lodge an application for an entry permit or, if not, whether the person should be arrested, detained, released or allowed to remain in the community pending their departure from Australia. In practice the majority of people who approach the Department are not arrested and detained, but are questioned to enable officers to make decisions on their eligibility to apply to stay or options for their departure from Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government is hopeful that, with the amendments passed by the Parliament, the Agreement will be acceptable to all proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA> Signing of the Agreement by both the resident and the proprietor will secure the rights of both parties and enable them to take action to enforce their rights on their own behalf.</PARA>
