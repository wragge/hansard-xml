<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>

<PARA>Inquiry into Australia's</PARA>
<PARA>Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Legislation</PARA>
<PARA>On 7 November 1990 the Senate resolved that the following matter be referred to the Committee for inquiry and report by 31 March 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> The operation of revised procedures for implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing actions and the need for legislative changes to the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>The key elements of the revised procedures which were introduced into Parliament were the establishment of an Anti-Dumping Authority and the introduction of sunset provisions and statutory time limits. The revised procedures followed the review by Professor Gruen of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the level of public interest and concern the Committee sought an extension of time to report on this reference from 31 March to 21 June 1991 in order to undertake a program of public hearings and inspections around Australia. It was essential that Australian industry represented by industry associations, grower councils and organisations, individual producers and companies had an opportunity to put forward its views to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Today's Australian industry confronts a complex, cumbersome and confusing body of Australian legislation and practice which seeks to promote fair trade. The principal Act concerned with ensuring fair trade is the Customs Act 1901. Other legislation includes the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The complexity and confusion stems from a number of sources. Although all three Acts deal with imports which are unfairly traded in the Australian market, they are administered by two independent bodies which are responsible to separate persons. Part XVB of the Customs Act is administered by the Comptroller-General of Customs while the Anti-Dumping Authority, a statutory body, is responsible to the Minister. Another cause of complexity and confusion is that although the two bodies require evidence of injury to an industry before a positive finding can be made, the nature of the findings differ between them. Findings of the Australian Customs Service can be reversed by the Anti-Dumping Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Added to this is Australia's move towards lower tariffs and the current economic recession. Australian industry's concerns and anxieties were further raised with the Government's recent announcement of phased tariff reductions. The Committee's approach to the inquiry was to draw a clear distinction between tariff protection and anti-dumping protection and to resist replacing one method of protection with another as a substitute for lower tariff levels. The Committee also resisted the approach which ignored our international obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Codes adopted by the GATT. The Committee's Report describes in detail the GATT Agreements, Australian legislation and the practice of the Australian authorities which are designed to conform with these Agreements. The Committee's aim was to ensure that Australia's anti-dumping system operated for the purpose for which it was intended as a mechanism by which Australian companies and primary producers can seek relief from unfairly traded imports which are causing injury to their industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Critical to the Committee's thinking was the complaint by Australian industry that the current anti-dumping system was complex, time consuming, confusing and costly. The evidence of most, if not all, witnesses representing Australian industry emphasised that the legislation discouraged industry from mounting a dumping case. As Mr K. Stubbs, Co-ordinator of the National Industry Associations Anti-Dumping Task Force, stated to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> We are finding that a number of companies just do not have the resources, either internally or financially, to pursue a dumping case. Estimates of the cost of a case vary dramatically from $5,000 to $25,000 to $40,000 depending on the complexity and the number of countries that are investigated. We are finding that there is a lot of interest in mounting a dumping case, but, when the complexities confront these companies, many just do not pursue the issues; and adjustments are made within the organisations concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee examined the legislation and in particular section 269 of the Customs Act and found that it imposed a stricter requirement for a dumping application to be exhaustively documented than that required by the GATT Codes. This has led to an undue burden being placed on an industry's resources to comply with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition there was a widespread perception that the anti-dumping system concealed a broader economic agenda. The National Industry Associations Anti-Dumping Task Force which represents a large number of companies and peak industry bodies perceived the Authority as an arm of the government's industry policy. For the Task Force the Authority was a policy instrument of industry structural adjustment. This perception was supported by the ACTU. As Mr W. Mansfield, Assistant Secretary of the ACTU stated to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is our view that the anti-dumping arrangements and arrangements which are designed to counter the dumping of goods in Australia should not be used as a mechanism by government to seek to restructure industry or to bring about changes in manufacturing industry in this country that would not have otherwise taken place through the normal operation of the market . . . there is that perception amongst industry generally, and it is also held by ourselves, that the Anti-Dumping Authority is really seeking to implement more than simply the principles that underlie the issue of dumping which go to the determination of whether or not goods are being brought into this country at less than the cost of manufacture. Rather, the ADA is seeking to pursue a broader economic agenda which may align itself with notions of what sort of industry we should have in this country, what size that industry ought to be, how efficient it ought to be and issues of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA>This perception stems from the convergence of a variety of industry and trade policies pursued by Government not all of which are consistent with each other. These policies include the need to lower tariffs, the need to restructure manufacturing industry, rationalising government assistance to industry and the need to protect industry against unfair trade practices. The Committee concluded that the industry's perception whether real or otherwise was detrimental to the promotion of an effective and non-discretionary anti-dumping policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian industry also expressed concern about the introduction of sunset provisions. The legislation currently prescribes that anti-dumping and countervailing duties lapse after three years. This provision has created great anxiety within industry because the termination of duties is automatic and final. At the end of this period industry must lodge a new application and re-prove injury. The Committee compared overseas practices in the US, Canada and EC and found that the Australian legislation went beyond what is required under the GATT Codes and the practices of other countries in requiring a complete re-testing before duties are reimposed. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised procedures introduced in 1988 also prescribed statutory maximum time limits as is the case in the US, Canada and New Zealand. A reduction of 40 days in the time taken to reach a preliminary finding, 135 days in lieu of 175 days, was announced by the Prime Minister in his 12 March 1991 Industry Statement. Following these changes only New Zealand has a shorter statutory time period within which a preliminary finding will be made compared to Australia. Australian industry welcomed this reduction although it favoured a 55 day time limit. While the Committee concluded that it was not feasible for the Australian Customs Service to make a preliminary finding at 55 days there was scope for improvement in the administrative processes. Statutory time limits commence from the date a dumping complaint is lodged. The time limits do not reflect the actual time taken to prepare a dumping application which may take up to six to twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA>In its Report the Committee has sought to dispel the complexity and confusion engendered by the legislation. The Committee has approached resolving industry's complaint in a number of ways. The Committee believes that the decision to establish an Anti-Dumping Authority as a separate statutory body to advise the Minister was not the only way to achieve a ``speedy and effective application of necessary measures to promote fair trade'' as recommended in the Gruen Report. This could have been achieved within the Australian Customs Service by establishing a Tribunal to review preliminary findings and appeals against negative findings. The Committee believes that a single body incorporating the specialised skills currently within both organisations should improve the processing and examination of a dumping complaint and reduce the current duplication. This matter should be addressed directly in the Government's review of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was concerned that the injury suffered by a company or producer as a result of dumping or subsidisation should not be exacerbated by the high financial cost of mounting a dumping case. Differences between the Australian legislation and the GATT regarding the grounds for initiating a dumping investigation are examined in the Report. The Committee has made a number of recommendations to simplify the application requirements. The major recommendation is that applicants should only be required to provide information which is reasonably available to them. The Committee also recommended that a formal industry liaison service should be set up within the Australian Service Customs to ensure that dumping complaints are prepared and processed in as short a time as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of sunset provisions has caused great anxiety within industry for the reason that an industry will be required to suffer injury before duties can be reimposed. The re-testing of an industry's application in this way is not required under the GATT Codes. More significant though is the Committee's finding that unlike the approach taken in Canada and the EC, the Australian legislation does not provide for a review prior to the termination of duties. To overcome this anomaly the Committee has recommended that the authorities undertake a review six months prior to the cessation of duties. The Committee has also recommended that the sunset period should be extended from three to five years. Acceptance of the changes to the sunset provisions will give Australian industry greater security and medium term anti-dumping protection at a time when general tariffs will be phased down over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to examining the operation of the revised procedures the Committee has addressed other concerns raised by industry during the inquiry. The more significant concerns related to the assessment of injury to producers of raw agricultural products, the collection and availability of import data and the threat to regional industry. These and other issues are discussed in the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's responses to these matters are too detailed to summarise here. I would urge all Senators to study the Report and its findings and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust the Government will give careful consideration to the Report and to the evidence the Committee received. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to thank my colleagues for their support and for the unanimity of view which the Committee was able to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill 1991 now before us gives effect to quite a number of changes to the Migration Act, some of them small adjustments and other significant alterations to policy. The Opposition is in agreement with much of the Bill. In the committee stage I will be moving the four amendments that were moved by my Opposition colleagues in the other House. That is not to say that we are happy with the Government's handling of Australia's immigration program-quite the contrary. This Government has been guilty of confusion, contradiction and uncertainty in its administration of this area throughout its eight years in office. However, this Bill does not arouse much criticism from the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill can be divided fairly readily into three areas. One is the introduction of new procedures for the handling of persons who arrive in Australia unexpectedly and without documentation, such as those who are sometimes called `boat people'. A significant series of amendments relate to them, including the late amendments which I will refer to at the end of my speech. A second area is some reform of the provisions for merit review. Thirdly, the remainder of the Bill covers other changes intended to improve in various ways the efficiency of the immigration program. In the interests of keeping my remarks brief, I will not run through the various clauses of the Bill with which the Opposition is in agreement. Rather I will refer only to those clauses where we have some criticism or comment to offer. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer firstly to clause 3(d) under `Interpretation' which adds to who can be an authorised officer under the Act. The Bill as originally introduced by the Government into the other place provided for `any person authorised by the Minister in writing for the purposes of this paragraph'. This caused some concern to the Opposition and the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Mr Philip Ruddock, and he sought clarification from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) as to what was intended. As well, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills expressed a concern. Its report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee generally does not approve of provisions which allow powers to be given to `a person', as it is preferable that there are limits on the person to whom such powers can be delegated. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Government has in mind with this provision to allow for staff who might be engaged to deal with data processing arrangements. The Minister was willing to respond to the Opposition's concern by introducing an amendment in the other place that ensures that such authorisations may only proceed by notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and the Opposition welcomes that. </PARA>
<PARA> I next refer to the Government's proposals for character clearances. There are, in some cases, difficulties for people obtaining character clearances because the authorities in their countries of origin cannot, or will not, provide the necessary documentation. Times of war or civil strife may be the cause of this. The Government included in the Bill a clause that would allow a person in prescribed circumstances to make a declaration as to character or conduct. The Opposition was concerned that the clause as it stood could open up new areas for abuse and confusion in this important matter of character checking, and it seemed to us better that the Act should more precisely set out what should happen rather than leaving the detail to be prescribed in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his letter to the shadow Minister, admitted the possibility of confusion and that people may come to the view that character checking may not be done in some circumstances. The Minister then introduced amendments, which were passed in the other place, to insert new clauses so that now all applicants who are not Australian citizens will be required to make declarations about character or conduct. This should prove to be a wiser approach. Again, the Opposition welcomes the Minister's willingness to respond to the Opposition's concern in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant new provisions in the Bill are for processing people who arrive here unexpectedly and without documentation. I use the term `processing people' while slipping into the use of too much bureaucratic language. We in the Opposition are very concerned to observe-and I am sure the Government is too-that those who emigrate to this country or consider doing so are real people with real concerns and real rights in their country of origin. When we talk about processing people, we are saying that we are processing the application for them to migrate to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One Opposition concern about the Bill is the length of time for which people may be held in an unprocessed state. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee also expressed itself on this matter. The Minister's letter to the shadow Minister dealt with this and I think it may be helpful to the Senate if I quote the relevant sections of what the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was concerned about the absence of a specific mechanism in the Act to allow a person to challenge being designated an unprocessed person. However, a decision to designate a person an unprocessed person would be a decision which could be challenged under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 on the basis that an error of law had been made in arriving at that designation. </PARA>
<PARA>That Act would allow for a declaration to be made as to whether a person is an unprocessed person. Proceedings under that Act are relatively easy to initiate and conduct. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>However, apart from relief of a declaratory kind from the Federal Court, it is not intended that there would be a mechanism in the Migration Act which would provide for the release of a person from a processing centre other than in compelling circumstances such as the need for medical treatment. It must be borne in mind that `unprocessed persons' will be persons who have arrived in Australia without permission, seeking to enter Australia in circumstances in which they would become illegal entrants and in which proper immigration, health, customs and quarantine clearance procedures have not been carried out. For the purposes of the Act, these persons have not entered Australia and are potentially prohibited persons. While clearance procedures are being conducted after the persons' arrival, the policy to be expressed in the legislation is that they be restrained from entering the broader Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>Those last words, which I emphasise- `these persons have not entered Australia and are potentially prohibited persons'-are stated in an entirely bipartisan manner, in fact a nonpartisan manner, in this Parliament. We are not taking away one jot or iota from the principle that we have a sovereign government, an elected government, in this country and that government is determining the basis on which anyone will enter the country. The decisions of the Government as expressed by law in the immigration program are to stand. Persons who do not meet the criteria for immigration to this country and who seek to evade, or who have in any way evaded those procedures, remain as not having entered Australia and are potentially prohibited persons. The Opposition is concerned that some courts will still seek to buy into the sovereignty of parliamentary decision. It is a non-partisan principle-certainly it is bipartisan-and we want to reinforce the fact that the government of the day determines the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has strong views about maintaining the integrity of our immigration program and for that reason we will not offer any amendment to this part of the Bill. We would only want to strengthen it. Australia should not in any way send signals overseas, by seeking to accord specific rights to unprocessed persons, that might lead people to believe that those trying to get around our immigration requirements will be rewarded by being allowed to stay here by the use of any legal procedure, particularly those that would appeal to a court, to change their status. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one matter on which I will be moving some amendments when we reach the committee stage-that is, the question of the number of days permitted under the review procedure within which a review of certain decisions may be made at both the first and second tiers of review. The Government proposes in this Bill a substantial increase in the number of days so allowed. The Opposition believes that the new provision increases the number of days too greatly and is not balanced in its effect. I will address the matter in more detail at the committee stage, but I indicate now that this is one portion of the Bill with which the Opposition is not happy. That is the only area where we will be seeking to amend the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stated the Opposition's concern for the integrity of the immigration program. We very much regret that at times over the past eight years the Government has made decisions that undermine that integrity and cause confusion and doubt about the direction of Australia's immigration policies. We recall the erratic nature of decision-making by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) personally. I have in mind in particular his pronouncements about certain Chinese nationals present in this country, a decision apparently made at an emotional time and without proper references. I believe the consequences are only now being grappled with by the Government and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently, Mr Hawke's decision was taken without the knowledge or consent of the Minister and without reference to the Department at the time. The Government displayed a very different approach to certain Cambodian boat people at about the same time. It is little wonder that people observe inconsistency and confusion in the immigration program. The Opposition wants to see a law which is clear, which restores public confidence in immigration, and which gives proper, compassionate flexibility and discretion to the Minister, on advice from the Department, in the way we have argued many times over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the whole principle that claims for Australian residence should be dealt with on an individual case by case basis has sometimes been lost sight of by this Government. The Government needs to show a willingness to provide sufficient resources for the processing of applications on an individual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent statement from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs concerning illegal entrants in Australia was made recently, on 4 June, when he announced that the number of illegal overstayers as at 30 April was significantly down compared with the figure for the same day a year earlier. The whole tone of his press release was rather self-congratulatory, in fact. He told us what a wonderful job he was doing in this regard. Of course, any genuine fall in the number of illegal entrants is to be welcomed, but the matter is put in clearer perspective by the comments of the shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Dundas, when he stated on 4 June:</PARA>
<PARA>The announcement by the Minister for Immigration, Mr Hand, that the number of illegal entrants in Australia has been significantly reduced assumes that the Minister is comparing like with like. On face value, of course, a reduction of 12 per cent in the number of illegals is welcome news. The Minister, however, provides us with a clue that statistics in this area are notoriously unreliable. He admits that the reduction in numbers is, in part, a result of overstayers regularising their status. This correlates with the significant increase in the processing backlog for change of status applications. Until recently, the number of on-shore claimants for change of status on refugee grounds were being processed at the rate of around 500 a year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very small number-500 a year. Mr Ruddock continued:</PARA>
<PARA>However, there are now 14,000 claims in the system and this number is increasing at the rate of 1,000 per month and expected to peak at 20,000 by the end of the year. The total number of people applying for grant of residence status in Australia, in all categories, has increased dramatically since the early 1980s, from around 7,000 in 1980-81 to over 36,000 in 1989-90. It would be interesting to see how the figures in this area have changed in the past 12 months. Added to this are the 20,000 Peoples Republic of China nationals in Australia prior to the Tiananmen Square incident who are eligible-</PARA>
<PARA>by the Government's announcement-</PARA>
<PARA>for four year temporary entry permits. </PARA>
<PARA>Without wishing to reflect on the integrity of the Minister, the statistics would be more meaningful if he could state quite categorically the number of illegals who had in fact left, or been forced to leave, the country, rather than being shifted from one category to another. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, I have not spoken about the other particulars of the Bill to which the Opposition agrees. Those matters are understood, and there has been a great deal of constructive working together between Opposition and Government representatives. Actually, I commend the Minister and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs for the way they have approached this matter. The Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations continues to do very useful work, and it ought to continue in that work. This mode of non-partisan consultation and approach to this important area of migration ought to continue in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> But for my reference to the late additional amendments, I conclude the main part of my speech by urging the Government to take seriously the criticisms of its policy and administration that the Opposition levels. We make our comments because of our very real concern for the fairness and integrity of Australia's immigration program. With the exception of the provisions to which I will be moving amendments, we welcome this Bill, and hope that the changes it makes will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final few minutes I have left, I wish to refer to the amendments that the Government has determined in the past couple of days to meet a particular situation. In many ways, that determination arises from a decision of the Singapore Government to put additional pressures on persons whose status is undefined or is in doubt in Singapore and who could be forced back to Australia. Recent reports that the Singapore Government has introduced new regulations restricting the movement of our international airlines have significant implications which need to be addressed urgently by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The new regulations are said to give the Singapore Government the right to stop an aircraft leaving if its captain refuses to take on board a prohibited immigrant whom his airline has brought to Singapore. Thus, the Singapore Government can now issue an order to any Qantas Airways Ltd captain arriving in Singapore to carry out a prohibited person. The law says that the authorities may take such action or use such force as may be necessary to ensure compliance. They can order that the plane may not move until the immigrant is on board, and if the pilot refuses, he faces up to six months imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently visited the Singapore Parliament and was happy to be welcomed there to see the very rational debate that was occurring in that chamber. The Parliament of Singapore is very aware of, and very committed to, maximising Singapore's own rights in any matter. This law passed in that Parliament has been introduced quite clearly to get Singapore off the hook in relation to Mr Francisco Vasquez, the Cuban immigrant whom Australia deported on criminal grounds and who has chosen to remain in Changi Airport rather than return home to Cuba. This action by the Singapore Government puts Australia's deportation laws at grave risk. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a provision in our law for criminal deportation for those who are found guilty of serious offences committed here in Australia. If we are forced by other countries to accept them back into Australia, our whole system of control is jeopardised. This move will affect not only criminal deportees but all undocumented arrivals, illegal entrants and refugee claimants as well. So, this issue has serious implications in international law and for Australian migration law, and in human rights terms, of course. It must be addressed as a matter of utmost urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> The one page of amendments to be moved by the Government in addressing this situation this week has the effect of safeguarding any person so forced back upon Australia to be out of the reach of litigation that might be commenced, to then have a change of status or seek the courts to intervene to order a change of status. That would be most unfortunate. If other countries force upon this country a person whom we have consciously deported, particularly on criminal grounds-but on any grounds-or if any other country forces to travel to Australia a person who does not meet the completed requirements to be a visitor or migrant to this country, then such an unprocessed person should not be able to be forced upon Australia, and by being in Australia physically have an appeal to the courts to evade the normal migration program. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by accepting the outline of the importance of these amendments proposed by the Government. I refer to just two clauses of the Opposition's immigration policy. The Liberal and National parties assert without qualification that it must be the role of the elected Government, acting on behalf of and with the support of the whole community, to make the final and absolute decisions on who will or will not be granted entry to Australia on a temporary or permanent basis. The first principle set out in our policy states:</PARA>
<PARA>No person other than an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of the Australian community has a basic right to enter Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We are entirely supportive of what the Government is doing by these very late amendments to this Bill. We do not wish to see a culture continue in the Australian courts that makes operative in any way an appeal to the court over such principles as I have just stated. The Opposition commends the Bill and will very briefly move the amendments that I have indicated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill 1991 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 17 April and passed by that House on 3 June. At that point, seven amendments were moved by the Government and agreed to, and four amendments moved by the Opposition were defeated. To quote the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), in his second reading speech, this Bill `reflects the Government's commitment to the continuing process of finetuning the migration legislation.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The term `finetuning' is something of a euphemism. Whilst the Australian Democrats recognise the Government's good intentions in introducing fair and equitable migration legislation, the 1989 amendments to the 1958 Migration Act have required numerous further amendments, as have its original accompanying migration regulations, in order to redress its over-bureaucratic philosophy and many unworkable clauses. At the time of the 1989 amendments, it was described by the Australian Democrats as `legislation designed for bureaucrats by bureaucrats'. Subsequent amendments to the legislation and to the migration regulations have removed their over-bureaucratic tinge and brought them to a position of actually being pertinent to the needs of real people. The Democrats welcome this trend because, after all, that is what migration is all about: the movement from one country to another of real, living and breathing people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats would never want to see the interests of Australia set aside but, equally, we would never want to see the basic humanity of our fellow human beings set aside to fit in with the neat and tidy whims of bureaucrats who may make marvellous neat and tidy plans in their offices which may have little bearing on the realities and the needs of human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the introduction of the new legislation in June 1989, the Australian Democrats brought forward more than 40 amendments introduced by then Senator Jenkins. All were defeated by the combined forces of the Government and the Opposition at that time. Since then, the Senate has passed many amendments brought forward by the Government very similar to those introduced two years ago by the Democrats, and we are about to do so yet again with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The main provision of this Bill is the introduction of a new regime for the immigration processing of undocumented and unexpected arrivals, such as the boat people. Other provisions in the Bill introduce positive changes in the review process, improvements in the streamlining of immigration procedures and some further minor and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer, first, to the main provision that will affect the boat people and others who arrive without papers and due process from their country of exit. The original boat people in significant numbers were, of course, Vietnamese; now they are Cambodians. It is an obvious fact that Australia cannot provide a home for every person in the world who is persecuted, starving and dispossessed. It is equally obvious that basic humanitarian compassion demands that people who have risked drowning, piracy and being lost on the high seas, and who are fortunate enough to find themselves on our shores, cannot be turned back to certain torture, persecution or death. </PARA>
<PARA> Cambodia is painfully short of essential medicines and equipment in its hospitals. There is serious malnutrition amongst its children. Many children die each year from haemorrhagic fever, which causes severe haemorrhaging from all their orifices and causes death because of the lack of antibiotics and medicines to treat them. Desperate to leave this environment, Cambodians risk theft, rape, murder and piracy on the high seas. If they land in the northern parts of Australia-mostly in Western Australia or the Northern Territory-they will now become `unprocessed persons', which is a new expression in the Migration Act. These amendments provide an authorised officer with the power to remove an unprocessed person to a `processing area', which is also a new expression under the Act, where reasonable investigations and inquiries can be made about that person. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that such people be treated sensitively. It is also important that orderly migration procedures be carried out. In the past, these tired, hungry, thirsty, frightened and desperate people were processed on, or close to, their boats. The amendments contained in this Bill make it possible for such people to be transferred in their family groups to more suitable processing areas where they can be examined in humanitarian conditions over a period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that identities and claims for entry into Australia should be thoroughly investigated. It is equally important that this should be done in a non-threatening environment. The investigations must be such that impostors and con people be discovered. However, this cannot be at the expense of decent humanitarian considerations for genuine refugees and asylum seekers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that we debate this Bill this week as it is Refugee Week. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and the establishment of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is a refugee? The United Nations convention defines a refugee as `a person who is outside his or her country of origin and is unable to return home because of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion'. Only a small proportion of people who are of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are refugees in the sense of the convention. Many more have been displaced from their countries by war, famine and civil strife. Although they are not persecuted by the state in which they live, often their own government is unable in a practical sense to protect them against such threats. These people are equally deserving of our humanitarian support. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention and Protocol on Refugees. Our intake of refugees is approximately 10,000 to 12,000 per annum. The Democrats believe that this figure should be raised to about 20,000. It would be untenable for us not to continue to play our role in the acceptance of refugees. A hardening of attitude in countries of destination for refugees, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, means that boat people will continue to arrive in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration lawyer, Adrian Joel, is very critical of government policy in this regard. In the Australian Law News of October last year Mr Joel said:</PARA>
<PARA>My view is that recent policy can be characterised by vacillation which will significantly limit an effective and speedy response to sudden arrivals . . . immigration policy, formulated on the premise of short-term political expediency, is imposed on the department. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to describe the debacle of asylum seekers and others wishing to migrate to Australia who use the overseas student program to suit their ends. Mr Joel states further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . policies stupidly premised on an extraordinary level of naivety prevail. The result of such contradictory, ever-changing policy is that a broad signal has been sent to Asia that Australia is a destination where it is worth `trying your luck' by arriving in a boat . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is also the saga of Chinese students and the confusing changes of policy by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Department of Immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> Refugees and asylum seekers often arrive in a traumatised state because of a history of terror and persecution. I refer to a report entitled Refugee Women-Still at Risk in Australia, which is a study of the first two years of resettlement in the Sydney metropolitan area and is authored by Eileen Pittaway, the Australian National Consultative Committee on Refugee Women, Refugee Council of Australia. From a report that contains many disturbing stories, the story of Mrs Consuelo Salinas stands out. In a report in the Australian of 3 June this year, it was pointed out that every day Mrs Salinas weeps for the years between 1979 and 1990 in El Salvador during which she lost a daughter who was pregnant, her father, five brothers, a sister, an uncle and nephews. She was also raped, tortured and shot. All of this at the hands of government agents. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend that story and this report to colleagues in an attempt to sharpen our picture of the sorts of lives that so many of the people coming to these shores have had and the sorts of suffering that they continue to undergo, even after reaching the haven of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a lot of public disquiet at media reports of 24 Cambodians being transported from Sydney to Darwin in May of this year. These people are still in the state of being regarded as `unprocessed persons'. Technically they are regarded as not having entered Australia. This legislation, by expanding the definition, and therefore the geographical location, of a processing centre, makes the necessary procedures more humane. How does the system work, and precisely where in the system are the Cambodians who arrived recently and were shifted in May?</PARA>
<PARA> On 26 October 1990, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) announced the introduction of the new system for determining claims for refugee status and humanitarian stay in Australia, which came into effect on 10 December last. The primary stage for applications to be assessed allows for quick decisions to be made on refugee status in some cases. Where it is deemed that not enough information has been provided to address concerns of natural justice, the applicant has a further seven days to provide additional material. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage of the process, which follows where there is a negative assessment from the primary stage, or where it has not been possible to make a positive assessment, is in the form of a review. The review panel includes representatives from the Refugee Council, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees can have an observer in attendance. The Australian Democrats applaud this move which will seek to deal with asylum seekers in a more compassionate and humane way. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add here that had either the Government or the Opposition agreed to amendments put forward two years ago by my former colleague, Senator Jenkins, when she pleaded for a more compassionate system for refugee procedures, this could have been addressed long ago. There has been criticism that an internal government committee will be making confidential recommendations to the Minister. It is argued that these matters should be determined openly by the Immigration Review Tribunal. Because of the sensitivity which is often present in claims for refugee status, which can place relatives and friends in the home country in danger, I do not believe that this is a practical proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also deals with issues surrounding entry visas which can also now act as travel-only visas. The Bill deals with circumstances in which permanent residents may become illegal entrants; the requirements for a declaration about character or conduct, or both; the deportation of illegal entrants; and custody of prohibited entrants during the stay of aircraft in Australia. It provides for increased penalties for the carrying of undocumented persons to Australia. The Bill amends the review provisions, giving more generous periods of time for applicants in Australia and overseas. It provides for a review of remuneration to members of the Immigration Review Tribunal. It also makes minor and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, amendments were made in the House of Representatives. I would like to mention some of the comments that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills made on this Bill. The first area of criticism, which was addressed by the Government by way of an amendment in the House of Representatives, related to `the delegation of power to an officer'. The Committee had indicated that it generally does not approve of provisions which allow powers to be given to `a person', as it is preferable that there are limits on the persons to whom such powers can be delegated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this Bill, the Committee noted that proposed new sections would, if enacted, allow an officer to respectively detain `an unprocessed person'-as defined by the Bill-or arrest that person without warrant. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee indicated that this is a significant power and one that should not be open to delegation without any restriction as to the persons or classes of persons to whom it should be delegated. The clause, therefore, was considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. The Minister subsequently moved a Government amendment to require that a person may only be authorised to be an officer by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. This will permit greater public scrutiny of such authorisations than the requirement for merely written approval, as originally proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is that classification as an `unprocessed' person carries with it certain significant consequences, including the liability to be detained or arrested without warrant. However, the Committee noted that there did not appear to be any provision within the legislation to allow a person to challenge his designation as an unprocessed person. The Committee suggested that if this was the case, it appeared that the only recourse for a person who disputes his designation as such would be a writ of habeas corpus or an action in trespass.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister replied, in a letter to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . apart from relief of a declaratory kind from the Federal Court, it is not intended that there be a mechanism in the Migration Act which would provide for the release of a person from a processing centre other than in compelling circumstances such as the need for medical treatment. It must be borne in mind that unprocessed persons will be persons who have arrived in Australia without permission, seeking to enter Australia in circumstances in which they would become illegal entrants and in which proper immigration, health, customs, and quarantine clearance procedures have not been carried out. For the purposes of the Act, these persons have not entered Australia and are potentially prohibited persons. While clearance procedures are being conducted after the persons' arrival, the policy to be expressed in the legislation is that they be restrained from entering the broader Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats appreciate the concern expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and note the Minister's answer. However, I would want to ask the Minister whether this issue can be further scrutinised by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, which now also scrutinises legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a final general point. There has been a lot of debate in recent months on the cost of the immigration program and on the number of migrants who enter Australia each year. Post-World War II, the catchcry was `Populate or Perish'. Migrants were expected to do the dirty, unhealthy jobs that Australians preferred not to do. Australia continues to solicit for migrants on a skills basis, when our unemployment rates are at their present high level. The Australian Democrats believe that this is not appropriate for a `clever country'. </PARA>
<PARA> Former migrants now see their adult children out of work. It would make for better sense, in our view, to spend the money and effort on training and skilling, and re-training and re-skilling, of the population currently in Australia. The Australian Democrats would like to see the skills and, in particular, the business migration programs severely restricted and our continuing migration program emphasising family reunion programs, refugees and special humanitarian categories. </PARA>
<PARA> A further aspect of the debate on immigration policy is the question of population pressures on the environment. Particular emphasis, especially in recent months, has been on those pressures in the context of urban Australia-the continuing sprawl, particularly of our major capital cities. The challenge before us is to establish sustainable population for Australia and to frame our immigration policy within that framework, always giving due consideration, of course, to our humanitarian responsibilities as global citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is supported by the Australian Democrats. It is proof of the positive part played by the Migration Regulations Committee in moving the Government away from a former immigration Minister's policy of trial and error-and there have been some errors since 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of migration legislation, a good idea by a bureaucrat, comfortable behind his desk, which leads to a trial full of errors, can result in devastation to people's lives. I have already referred to the awful traumas experienced by many refugees. All migrants and potential migrants suffer some sort of trauma to a greater or lesser degree. It is not an easy thing to leave the surroundings, culture and language that someone knows to settle in, what are for many, strange surroundings, with an alien culture and an unknown language. The hard, arrogant, overly-bureaucratic and often downright silly direction taken in the 1989 legislation is gradually being moved to a more rational, sensible, sensitive and workable one. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude in this, Refugee Week, with a quote from Mrs Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who recently said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we must realise that the fundamental solution to the problem of refugees is to remove the root cause of their flight. The current situation may not be drastically improved overnight, since we live in a world made by human beings. But the fact is that we are all members of the global community, and it is our duty to make that world a better place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are only two points that really need to be responded to after this morning's debate which is, I think, overwhelmingly supportive of the Bill before the Senate. Senator Powell raised one point that needs a response; that is, whether the amendments can be considered by the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. The Government draws attention to the fact that that Committee already has the capacity within its charter to look at the Act and the Act as amended. It would be up to the Committee to decide whether to pursue any further scrutiny of these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other point I make at this stage, given the fact that it is the last day of the session, and also recognising the support that the Bill has had despite some political points here and there, is in response to the amendments moved by the Opposition. We have circulated some of our amendments and I will address them in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage we have considered the Opposition amendments. We do not support them essentially for two reasons. The first reason is that it should be taken into consideration that the Government's proposed amendment simply provides for a maximum period for the lodgment of an application at each level of review. It is open for the Minister to make regulations prescribing a lesser period. Given that sort of context, and the flexibility that is provided under the Government's approach, we would rather have the flexibility of an extra week. As a consequence we will oppose the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is two-pronged: on the one hand there is already an awareness in the community of the 28 to 70 day concepts. We want to stick to that because to do otherwise, to do as the Opposition would request, would work against the applicants. I do not think anything more needs to be said at this particular stage and we can now move to the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA>At this stage I will not only speak to the Government's amendment on this particular clause, but I will speak also to all the Government amendments. The Government has introduced some amendments to the Bill which will strengthen the operation of section 88 and section 89 custody provisions of the Migration Act. The amendments are not extensive, but they do serve to underline the Government's intention to maintain effective control of Australia's borders under the Migration Act. The explanatory memorandum, which I will circulate in a few seconds, gives full details of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that the courts have been releasing from custody under the Migration Act people who have no legal entitlement to enter Australia. The amendments reinforce the existing custody provisions of the Act to make clear that custody ceases only in the circumstances as set out in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will also authorise migration officers to detain people who were deported from Australia and who have been returned to Australia by the authorities of another country. These persons should be capable of being taken into custody and not released by the courts, unless the courts do so in the circumstances set out in the Migration Act. As the explanatory memorandum notes, the Government believes that it must have the power to determine who can and who cannot enter the broader Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA>MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE STAGE</PARA>
<PARA>SPEECH BY SENATOR BADEN TEAGUE</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition, I move the four amendments circulated in my name. In doing so, I am drawing attention to the amount of time provided within which people who wish to have a review made of a reviewable immigration decision can in fact seek that review. </PARA>
<PARA> The background to this matter is that when the Migration Act was being so substantially revised and brought into its present form, one of the issues that was the subject of discussion between the Government and the Opposition was this matter of the length of time to be provided within which people would be allowed to seek a review of a decision. There are two tiers to the review process, with the second tier being the Immigration Review Tribunal. What Senator Ray put into the Act at the time of that discussion between the Government and Opposition was something of a compromise, and was for a period of 28 days for people within Australia and 70 days for people outside Australia, and those periods were for people to exercise their review rights for both review stages within the time limit. What the Government is now seeking under this bill is to significantly liberalise the provision. It seeks to provide separate times for making applications for the two different levels of review. The Opposition does not object to that. It does seem reasonable to us to separate them out in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not approve of the length of time that will now be given. In effect, the Government is seeking to double the time allowed, with two stages each of 28 days or 70 days. In other words, the total period allowed moves from 28 days to 56 days, or from 70 days to 140 days. The Opposition believes that this is too long. It is our view that such long periods compromise the immigration review process in an unreasonable way. They would allow people not to be expeditious in pursuing their rights. So much of our consideration of migration policy involves judgements about the best balance of the various factors involved, and this matter of the time for seeking review is one where we need to get the balance right between an adequate opportunity to appeal and the need for appeals to be made without undue delay. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our contention that the Government has judged the balance wrongly, and that is why I move these amendments. Our amendments would still be more generous than what is presently in the Act, but would cut back the undue extension of time the Government now wants to provide. Thus, we want to reduce the 28 and 70 days to 21 and 50 respectively at each review stage. In effect, that means in total 42 days for those within Australia and 100 days for those outside the country. This still compares generously with the present Act's provision of 28 days and 70 days. But it will better balance the review process and still require people to press their claims expeditiously. For those reasons, I commend my amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief remarks on behalf of the Opposition in relation to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend the corporations law. Honourable senators would remember that the last time we debated the corporations law-which established the Australian Securities Commission (ASC)-it was to put into effect an agreement between the States and the Commonwealth to set up a new national corporations scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time, we were in a similar predicament to the one we are in today. The legislation was rushed through the House of Representatives. It was one of the most complicated pieces of legislation put through in the history of the Australian Parliament yet it was given a very short time for debate and consideration by professional groups and corporations generally. Honourable senators would remember that at that time I suggested we would see a number of these amending Bills because it was impossible to create a corporations law in such a complex area of legislation in such a short time that did not require serious amendment. This Bill is already before us and another three or four amending Bills will be coming before the Parliament during the balance of this calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year when the corporations law package came before this place there was considerable uncertainty because, unfortunately, in the Western Australian upper House, which is controlled by the Nationals and the Liberal Party, legislative councillors had some very severe and serious concerns about the setting up of the new centralised and national scheme. There was uncertainty among the business community as to what the effect would be. As I suggested to the Senate at that time, the uncertainty and the problems caused, particularly in Western Australia, were a consequence of the Government's legislative program and its inability to communicate that program effectively-particularly in the distant States such as Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for the amendments contained in the Bill before us today are recognised and supported by the Opposition. I will go into the substantive issues shortly, but I want to spend a few moments talking about the transition to the new national scheme, because this is the first opportunity that we have had to debate this matter since its establishment on 1 January. During January and February, it was recognised by all people concerned with the establishment that there would be some teething problems, but the decision to move forward as quickly as possible with grim determination had bipartisan support. The old scheme was obviously tumbling away. It was becoming ineffective and it was a matter of getting the Australian Securities Commission structure set up as quickly as possible and, it is fair to say, solving the teething problems on the run-and there have been many. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, as someone who was involved with the Western Australian opposition group-which was set up to oppose the national scheme law-and who had taken up a number of constituents inquiries in relation to the establishment of the new Australian Securities Commission and become a bit of an ombudsman on the scheme, that the problems we have experienced in the last six months have been solved very quickly and efficiently. It is certainly a credit to the personnel of the Australian Securities Commission in the way they have handled these matters. Indeed, there have been no major problems. There were some queue problems and some teething problems in relation to getting information and so forth. I think that, particularly in Western Australia, that could be blamed on the uncertainty caused in the upper House at that stage. It would have been unfair to have expected the Australian Securities Commission to get off to a very good start in Western Australia with those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the speed with which the Australian Securities Commission and the new laws have been implemented, in the last six months there has been uncertainty in relation to prospectus matters and in relation to the Australian company number provisions and how they should apply. All of these matters are being sorted out. One of the problems I have noticed-and I believe it is one of the concerns of the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Hartnell-is that the corporations law establishes a number of bodies and committees to deal with the various matters under the jurisdiction of the Australian Securities Commission. There is the ASC Advisory Committee, which is already established and functioning, and the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I am a member and which has had a number of meetings and briefings. It is basically trying to come to grips with the new structure and is proceeding very well under the chairmanship of Senator Beahan and the deputy chairmanship of my colleague Senator Austin Lewis. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the Corporations and Securities Panel, which is to comprise not fewer than five members-at least one of whom has to be nominated by a State or Territory Minister. The Australian Securities Commission advises that, to the best of its knowledge, these appointments have yet to be made. It is a matter of some concern that six months down the track the panel is not in place. I certainly urge those responsible to move towards making those appointments as quickly as possible. Another body is the Companies, Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board, which is to have three members-one nominated by the Minister and two selected by the Minister from a panel proposed by the accountancy profession. The Australian Securities Commission advises that no appointments have been finalised yet. I understand from information I have received recently that there are a number of matters that the ASC wanted to refer to that board for disciplinary action but is unable to do so because it is not in existence. Again, I urge those people responsible to move as quickly as possible to make those appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another body is the Australian Accounting Standards Board, which has an unspecified number of members to be appointed by the Minister. Apparently, some appointments have been made, but the advice I received from the Australian Securities Commission yesterday was that the board was, as yet, not fully operational. It must be of some concern that six months down the track-six months into the new national scheme-some very important parts of the structure have yet to be established. Obviously, it is fairly extraordinary to move into a new, vigorous and national corporate regulatory structure while we are rushing legislation through and the Government is not allowing adequate time for the professions and people affected by the law to be consulted. The Bill before us today was not given the three months exposure which was required by the Heads of Agreement, signed in Alice Springs. It was, I admit, given exposure for one month with the consent of the Ministers in the States. Even though it is not an ideal situation and the professions have not had time to analyse this amending Bill, there has been agreement by the Ministers in the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I would say that the success of the Australian Securities Commission and the corporations law in the past six months has been due mostly to the goodwill of all the people involved in establishing this structure-and that includes members of this Parliament, the Chairman and the Board of the ASC, the staff of the ASC, and the professions and the companies that are affected by the law. I also suggest that, to a large extent, it has been based on the grim determination of the Chairman, Tony Hartnell, to ensure that the Australian Securities Commission and the corporations law work and are effective. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I shall run briefly through the substantive issues that the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 covers. It partially fixes some of the jurisdictional problems that were omitted in the initial corporations law. Those changes are welcome. Again, they are matters which to some extent were overlooked in the initial law. The Bill deals with a proposed new section 68a, which provides for certain exemptions in relation to Western Australia. Again, because of time constraints this matter could not be properly dealt with in the initial corporations law which passed through this chamber late last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also addresses some matters in relation to the Australian company number, which has caused concerns for a wide variety of corporations. The Australian company number was to be applied virtually to every public document or to every document that a company has or has to deal with on a day-to-day basis, including receipts, letters, cheques and so forth. This has caused a lot of concern for the many companies in Australia that would have to reprint all those documents. The Government, quite correctly, introduced a moratorium on that application of the company number, initially for six months and, owing to the complexities of the matter, it has now extended that moratorium to cover the first full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have been involved in this issue have had many representations, particularly from real estate associations around Australia. We are aware that they are very concerned that, in doing things like placing classified advertisements, they would be required to place the company number on every single advertisement. I do not need to go into this, because the Australian Securities Commission is well versed in the concerns of the community in that respect. I have been assured that it is taking action to ensure that, when the Australian company number provisions do commence on 1 January, most of these problems will have been solved. To that extent, the moratorium has been a welcome concession and it has allowed time for all of those concerns to be discussed openly and to be addressed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The other substantive issue that is covered in the Bill is the requirement for companies to comply with covenants in deeds and the ability of the Australian Securities Commission to use civil enforcement to enforce trust deeds. That, of course, is a very welcome amendment. There are also requirements for consolidated profit and loss and consolidated balance sheets for economic entities-another welcome amendment. Also, there is the obligation to comply with established accounting standards, and that is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantial change, which I believe Senator Spindler will spend some time on, concerns the insider trading provisions. These provisions were brought forward late last year in an exposure draft, but the final provisions in the Bill are a lot narrower. I do not intend to concentrate on that matter today, because of the time constraints that are upon us all, and, as I said, Senator Spindler will probably deal with that matter in more detail. Suffice to say that the regulators and the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission are not happy with the provisions in the Bill. Of course, there is a very fine balance between onus of proof and proving insider trading practices, and prosecutions are very hard to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. It has the support of the Opposition-as does the whole aim of trying to improve Australia's corporate image, an image that was very badly tarnished during the 1980s. I think it is fair to say that, under the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, there is strong and non-partisan support to ensure that the Australian Securities Commission and the new corporations law are successful and that we achieve all our aims in relation to lifting Australia's image both nationally and internationally in the corporations regulation area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends the Corporations Act 1989 and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. The Bill addresses the following matters: the winding-up of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC); the consolidation of the accounts of companies and subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes; reform of the insider trading regulations; conferral of jurisdiction on Family Courts in relation to civil matters arising under the corporations law; allowing the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to regulate compliance with trust deeds; a statutory moratorium on the requirement for companies to include the Australian company number on business documents and negotiable instruments; and the requirement that retiring directors must notify a change in ownership of a company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, in relation to the Australian company number moratorium, I welcome this proposal, although I must say that, as Senator Campbell noted, we have received numerous submissions on this matter and occasionally I could not entirely resist the faint glimmer of a suspicion that the objective was to delay the effective introduction of the legislation rather than be concerned about real difficulties with this matter. Nevertheless, I share Senator Campbell's view that this legislation is extremely important and that it would not have got off to a constructive and positive start without all parties cooperating, and in that sense I certainly welcome the Government's action in granting a moratorium on this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly speaking, the Bill deals with a number of problems discovered in the original corporations legislation, including some of the jurisdictional questions only partially addressed in the Act. I note that further outstanding matters will have to be dealt with in another Bill, and I urge the Government to proceed with that as expeditiously as possible. I also note that it is proposed to involve the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities in assessing further legislation, and I welcome that. I feel constrained to mention that the initial contact of the Committee with the ASC and its Chairman, Mr Tony Hartnell, was extremely positive. The outline of the corporate aims of the Commission and the resources and personnel that are being marshalled to deal with the challenges ahead fills one with confidence that at long last we have reached a position where companies legislation in Australia will be effective and will raise Australia's image in the business world internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some concerns relating to the provisions in the Bill. While I am not taking any of these concerns to the level of proposing an amendment, I believe that they warrant careful study by the Minister and action in the not too distant future. The consolidation of accounts of companies and subsidiaries will go a long way towards remedying the abuses of the 1980s, whereby the true financial position of a group of companies could be hidden by off balance sheet reporting. This amendment will mean that misleading investors in this way will no longer be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concerns about these provisions were raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which objected to the so-called Henry VIII clauses, which enable some of the legislation to be effected by regulation. The Minister, in his answer to the Committee's concerns, states:</PARA>
<PARA>After due consideration it was considered important to allow this degree of flexibility to prevent technical evasion of the provisions of the legislation and to keep pace with evolving business practices.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Minister's answer is an adequate one to the concerns expressed by the Committee. I also note that these regulations may be disallowed by the Parliament in accordance with the normal procedure, so there is still a safety net which the Senate may use. </PARA>
<PARA> Insider trading has also been a matter of longstanding concern, and an attempt to deal with the problem is made in this Bill. As we know, the Griffiths Committee report on insider trading suggested major legislative and administrative reforms in this area. I believe that we are not yet at a level where we can say that we are satisfied with the legislation as it stands. In the exposure draft the onus of proof on two important matters was reversed and the defendant had to prove that the information he or she handed on or used was not generally available; secondly, that if it were generally available it might have a material effect on the price or value of those securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of the legislation as it stood before the reversal of onus of proof was found to be difficult to cope with by the prosecution, with the result that in most insider cases which so far have come before the court a conviction has not been obtained. I note the views expressed in the media by Mr Tony Hartnell that, unless some solution is found, it will not be possible, and indeed hardly worth while, to instigate successful prosecutions. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to ask the defendant to prove that information is generally available. That would be relatively easy to do, and I do not think it would be too onerous. I suspect, too, that that is a matter the prosecution could easily prove, so it does not get us very much further. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be a little concerned that legislation required the defendant to prove that, if that information were generally available, it would not have a material effect on the price or value of those securities. I am not prepared at this stage, without the support of either the Opposition or the Government, to move an amendment to reverse the onus of proof in this matter. I believe that we may perhaps consider in future tackling this problem from a different angle by establishing a number of criteria based on examples of past activity in this area as to how we judge whether the information could have had, or would have had, a material effect on the price or value of those securities. If we were to attempt to adjust legislation in this direction, I believe that the prosecution and the Australian Securities Commission may well find that it is not necessary to reverse the onus of proof; that the procedures and criteria established for proving these matters may be such that the legal process will bring to justice people who indulge in insider trading which damages our security system, our community and, last but not least, our reputation overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I would like to deal with relates to the provision for the winding up of the NCSC. Another concern was raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, noting that there were no fixed dates for the legislation to come into effect. The answer provided by the Minister to the concerns of that Committee pointed out that the timing depended on the actions of other entities, in particular State governments, and that therefore it was extremely difficult to put in a firm date as to when this legislation could take effect. I believe that the answer is realistic in that it takes account of practical difficulties. I note the Minister's undertaking in his answer to the Committee that he will do everything he can to ensure that the Bill's provisions come into effect in less than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional matter of concern to the Australian Securities Commission relates to use indemnities and derivative use indemnities. I note that this Bill does not deal with those concerns. However, I understand that a joint submission from the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions is now before the Attorney-General and that there is some prospect of getting some action in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by confirming that the Australian Democrats support the Bill, with the concerns expressed, on which we expect the Government to take the necessary expeditious action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some brief remarks on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill and, to save the time of the Senate, I will ask a few questions of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). If I gain a response from the Minister at the end of this debate, I will not need to raise these matters in committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular provision of the Bill in which I am interested relates to the requirement for companies to consolidate their accounts in accordance with the relevant accounting standard and the legislative provisions that seek to enforce that compliance. My concerns relate to the definitions on control and parent entities and the other definitions, which are referred to as being contained in the standard; but there is an additional clause which allows the Attorney-General by regulation to vary those definitions. It is a complicated way of ascertaining exactly what definition applies from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in regard to a number of accounting standards enforced by law a good deal of the material is referred to in the legislation as being definitions which are in the standard from time to time. That is not perceived as too vague in a legislative sense, because accountants who will have to apply the legislation obviously will be aware of accounting standards, the definitions therein and changes to them from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested to find out whether the provision in this Bill that allows the Minister by regulation to make some sort of variation in that respect is found in all other legislative objects that apply other accounting standards. It seems to be a dual capacity for vagueness. The first capacity for vagueness is that people may not know from time to time what the accounting standard definitions are. I think we can accept that on the basis that the people to whom this legislation applies will know what those definitions are. If the Minister has this additional capacity-which I understand he does have-to vary that by regulation, then that is a matter of serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I would appreciate some indication from the Minister as to when the Government decided it would do this. Having made a speech in the last hour of the last day of the last sitting of 1990, I was somewhat surprised to read in the daily newspapers in early January-a time when Government announcements are not usually made-that the Government had finally decided to proceed and apply this accounting standard by law. I am very pleased the Government has chosen to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I was even more surprised, only a couple of days after receiving a completed draft of a private member's Bill to achieve the same purpose, that is, to apply the international accounting standard in relation to consolidation of accounts, when Senator Schacht asked a question in this chamber of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, as to when the Government was going to proceed. It seems to be the quickest action the Government has taken. It announced in January that it was going to do something, and then when we came back in February of this year-if not then, it was in the March sittings-we found that the Government meant it and was going to proceed and legislation would be introduced in this session. </PARA>
<PARA> I know Canberra is a very small place and accidents do happen and that things sometimes come together at the same time. They say that great minds think alike, but I have not always given the accolade of a great mind to the Government. I am hesitant to say that that is the reason why I came to the same conclusion the Government came to at exactly the same time and had a Bill drafted at the same time as the Government. That run of events is quite extraordinary: someone can raise something in December; the Government says in January it will do it; the person has a private member's Bill drafted, the wording of which is complete in February; and then a few days later a senator in this chamber says to the Government, `Well, when are you going to do this?', and the Government announces that it is going to do it very soon. A few weeks after that, I must admit, the Government, finally produced its legislation, which, it is fair to say, is not dissimilar to that which was drafted for me. </PARA>
<PARA> Will the Minister in his response be kind enough to answer the question I have raised in relation to the ministerial capacity to vary the definitions, other than the variable capacity that the Accounting Standards Review Board would have? I think it is the appropriate body to apply the standard. If he would also make some remarks on exactly why it was and when it was that the Government decided to pursue this path, I would be grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia we have had a number of problems with off-balance sheet companies. This Bill seeks in part-and that is the part I am talking about-to address the problem of those companies remaining off-balance sheet. I am particularly pleased to see that the Government has finally seen the error of its tardiness and is doing something about this. The capacity of companies to park very substantial amounts of debt that do not need to be put on their balance sheets has been a problem for shareholders who rely on the annual report to see what the company they have invested in is doing. For shareholders who might want to invest in a company it has been a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It has particularly been a problem for super fund investors, who want to ascertain what to invest the assets of many millions of workers in on behalf of those workers. If the financial statements produced by companies do not give a true and fair view, and there is a clear case for saying that when consolidation is not required they do not always-plenty of examples indicate that they have not-it is a difficult matter for super fund investors particularly, because of the very large amount of workers' money they have, to see exactly what is going on. There is an additional problem for banks and their obligations in relation to their debt levels and asset levels. I am not sure of the extent to which the banks have been able to bypass those prudential requirements as a consequence of the availability of this off-balance sheet mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise two situations in my State that would be good examples of why South Australians might think this is particularly relevant legislation. One is Adsteam, where people were trying to work out for many months just exactly what this entity did contain. What had people invested in, what assets were there and what obligations or liabilities were there? It was a very difficult task. People at the lower salary level of the industrial order are entitled to look at those at the very top level of our industrial scene and wonder why those people are not as careful with the management of the assets entrusted to them by shareholders as the people at the lower salary echelons are with their own money and would be if you and I, Madam Deputy President, lent them $100. It seems an extraordinary situation, and Adsteam is one example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The other example is the State Bank. We know that for some time South Australians were told that there was nothing wrong with the State Bank, everything was okay. We have been told that its problems have only recently developed, primarily as a function of a decrease in property prices and high interest rates. We were originally told about one off-balance sheet company. We finally found out that there was a pyramid of these companies in which the problems of the bank had been, to put it colloquially, parked. It is not worth taking up any more time. I am sure the Minister understands the problems that this part of the Bill is trying to address. I will be grateful if he can give me an answer to the two particular questions I raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address Senator Vanstone's questions before responding to the points made by other speakers during the debate. In respect of the timing of the Government's proposals, the Minister did announce in June last year that this approach would be taken by the Government. To get to the detail of it, Senator Vanstone's Bill was released on 19 April 1991. At that point the Government's Bill had already been drafted; the drafting had been completed. Despite that, Senator Vanstone's Bill was examined by both the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel prior to the finalisation of the Government's Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question about differences between Senator Vanstone's approach in her Bill and the Government's in relation to accounting standards, Senator Vanstone's Bill approached the consolidation of financial statements by expressly saying that the proposed consolidation standard-the Bill refers to it as accounting standard ASRB.1024 consolidated financial statements-has effect by force of the Bill. The Government's Bill does not do that. It is capable of interpretation and enforcement in the absence, for whatever reason, of an accounting standard for consolidation of financial statements. This is not the case with the approach taken by Senator Vanstone. </PARA>
<PARA> The response to the specific question that Senator Vanstone asked about this approach of tackling accounting standards is that there is a very general agreement that the way to tackle the abuses which have occurred in this area is to move away from the formal, technical and, therefore, easily evaded touchstone of subsidiary and focus on the issue of control. There is also very general agreement that any new rules must catch unincorporated entities. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed accounting standard for consolidation of financial statements contains detailed and carefully articulated definitions of the key concepts of control and entity. That standard has been developed by the accounting profession over a period of some years. The exposure draft was, in fact, issued in September 1987. As such, it has had the advantage of a lengthy deliberation and public comment in the process of refining the proposed standard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate to draw on that process of consultation by adopting these definitions. An advantage of this approach is that any further refinements to those definitions that are made by the Australian Accounting Standards Board to meet, for example, evolving Australian business practices, will apply automatically without the need to amend the corporations law. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the amendments provide for regulations to be made, should the need arise, to add to or clarify the scope of definitions used in the standard. At some stage it may be necessary to adjust the scope of the accounting standard to take account of, for example, as I have said before, a change in the way that business is conducted in Australia. This could be done by the amendment of the standard by the Australian Accounting Standards Board or, alternately, by making regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the matter that was raised during debate of the speed with which the new national scheme was established on 1 January, the Government had to take urgent action because the cooperative scheme had fundamental deficiencies and was, by the end of 1990, in a state of near collapse. It was acknowledged by all parties and governments that the new scheme had to be established quickly. This Bill seeks to clarify and resolve some technical difficulties which have been identified in the first six months of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has foreshadowed that further clarification of the fundraising provisions and the Australian company number provisions will be included in a Bill to be exposed shortly for a period of three months in order to receive public comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the urgency of reforms, the ministerial council agreed to limited consultation arrangements. However, the new policy in this Bill, namely the reform of insider trading regulations and the consolidation of accounts, has been called for over a number of years by the responsible sectors of the business community and the professions under the former cooperative scheme. This is the first opportunity the Commonwealth has had to proceed with these much needed reforms under the new national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> All State Ministers on the ministerial council, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and its various subcommittees, have been consulted on the Bill and their comments have been considered and, where appropriate, taken into account in revising the Bill. The ministerial council has voted to approve the Bill under the new national scheme arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Senator Spindler's comments on the reversal of the onus of proof, given the increased resources provided to the ASC for law enforcement and the reported improvements in market surveillance by the Australian Stock Exchange, it was considered that a more cautious approach should be adopted at this time. Thus, the exposure draft provisions have been modified to restore the onus of proof in respect to this element of the offence to the prosecution and now accord with the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The insider trading provisions will, however, continue to be monitored to see whether they are effective in preventing insider trading and restoring investor confidence in the securities market. In particular, the issue of the onus of proof under the new law will be kept under close review. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the concern that Senator Campbell raised regarding the timing of the establishment of bodies under the ASC Act, the Commonwealth had to undertake consultation. The Companies Orders and Liquidators Disciplinary Board was appointed on 24 May this year. The Australian Accounting Standards Board was appointed in February this year and four further members were appointed on 14 May this year. I would like to conclude by thanking honourable senators for their contributions to the debate and their support for the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1991 substantially seeks to amend the Training Guarantee Act which passed through the Parliament last year. I will be brief because there is little in the Bill that needs to be discussed. It is very tempting, of course, to redebate the original issue and go through all the reasons why we opposed and still oppose the original legislation which we regard as being totally inadequate in terms of providing training for those who need it. I am tempted to spend half an hour telling anecdotes that all of us have heard from firms about the administration of the Act and the way it is operating, the hardship that it is imposing and the additional costs that are being inflicted upon so many firms, especially those which have a good training record. But there is little point in spending the time today to do that when we have such a heavy program before us. I shall limit myself to speaking about the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth looking at the explanatory memorandum which discloses what is in the Bill. We are told in the first paragraph that the Bill gives effect to the undertakings made by the Government in relation to outstanding trainers-a matter that has been raised by the Opposition; that it clarifies the intentions of the original legislation; and that it makes provision for recognition of alternative training levy schemes. These are all matters that we were talking about before. The explanatory memorandum states that `the Bill rectifies an earlier anomaly and gives effect to the Government's undertaking'. Again, we are told that `the Bill rectifies an unintentional limitation'. Further on, the explanatory memorandum states that `the provisions relating to the definition of eligible training are altered' and `the Bill makes provision for alternative training', et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum highlights the deficiencies of the original Bill. It highlights the reason why the House of Representatives should not rush through, and not give adequate consideration to, legislation in the way that it does. These matters were raised in the Senate but the Government was not interested in hearing about them at the time. Unfortunately, we were not able to make the amendments then which really ought to have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that we are totally opposed to the concept. Even though we recognise that as the legislation is on the books, it needs to operate much better than it does at present. However, we are supporting these amendments. Many firms which have a very good training record have incurred incredible expense in order to comply with the provisions of this Act. They have to keep a paper record of all the things that they do. This means that either they then have less money to spend on training or incur greater cost in providing their service, whatever it might be. In the end, of course, it is the consumer who always pays. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that this Bill will make some changes to the way in which the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Act is operating, and that people will be able to comply with it more readily. It still does not adequately deal with those companies and firms which have a lot of itinerant workers and it still does not adequately deal with those who have a lot of part time workers. It does provide for exemption for those who have a proven record in training, although even now that is not clearly defined. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a letter from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in which he recognises there may be further changes required to this legislation, and I will seek leave to incorporate that letter shortly. What a pity the Government did not get it right the first time and save so many businesses and firms the cost and the anguish of trying to comply and find out from the Taxation Office what it all means, because they are under self-assessment. They can be caught up with for seven years as if they were criminals if they get it wrong, even with the best motives. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to refer to the private member's Bill-the Training Guarantee (Guidelines) Bill 1991-which I introduced on 17 April 1991 to clear up other anomalies in relation to professions that are small in the States in which they operate-the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, and there may even be some in the other States-which really were disadvantaged by the way the Act was worded originally. I introduced a private member's Bill when previously the Government did not seem to understand what I was talking about. I asked the Government whether it would allow that Bill to be dealt with simultaneously with this Bill. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training was not disposed to do that, and actually quite reasonably pointed out in his letter to me that what I wanted to achieve should be done by the guidelines. I agree with that, except that the Minister would not do it by the guidelines before. Thus I had no choice but to introduce a private member's Bill. In his letter, the Minister, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that, if further changes to the guidelines are necessary, it is more appropriate to make a further guideline, rather than introduce a Bill on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he has to accept that I cannot introduce a guideline; I can only introduce a Bill. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons, I believe there is merit in your proposal to remove the size restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is always nice to hear that there is merit in one's proposal. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>However, it would be more timely to further consider your proposal along with a possible further amendment to the guidelines in the Budget sittings 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>For that reason, I have elected not to proceed today with my private member's Bill because, if we allowed the Minister to bring in his guidelines but the Government took a stubborn approach and it were not passed by the House of Representatives, we still would not have achieved anything other than perhaps a warm inner glow for having the matter pass through this chamber. I know that it would pass this chamber because Senator Bell agreed that what I was proposing was reasonable, he being a Tasmanian senator and encountering the same representations as I was. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not go into the matter further other than to say that we support the Bill but still totally oppose the underlying philosophy. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the letter to me from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, dated 6 June 1991, in which he deals with the Bill that I introduced in April this year, so what he has said is on the public record. In other respects, I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Employment, Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600</PARA>
<PARA>6 JUNE 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Margaret Reid</PARA>
<PARA>Senator for the ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Reid</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 6 May 1991 to Senator the Hon Nick Bolkus, Minister representing me in the Senate, proposing Government support to your Private Senator's Bill which would amend Industry Training Agents' Guidelines No 1 of 1990 under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. Senator Bolkus has passed the matter to me for reply. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry Training Agents Guidelines No 1 of 1991 is about to be tabled for consideration by the Parliament. This instrument will give effect to my undertaking to the Opposition that TAFE colleges and higher education institutions would be included among the categories eligible for registration as an industry training agent. This would be subject to the responsible Minister in the State or Territory concerned giving approval to a TAFE college to apply for registration. Provision is also being made for a number of technical changes to the guidelines, in line with my undertaking to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that, if further changes to the guidelines are necessary, it is more appropriate to make a further guideline, rather than introduce a Bill on the matter. The Act specifically provides for such guidelines to be made by the Minister, as disallowable instruments, subject to any relevant recommendations from the National Training Board (NTB). Further, in view of the already pressing legislative program, it would be a more efficient and effective use of Members' and Senators' time to handle the matter in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand your proposal, the intention is to remove the size limits of certain categories of industry, professional and trade associations which are currently part of the eligibility criteria to be registered as an industry training agent. Instead, you propose that the association concerned would be required to satisfy the criteria that it is generally recognised as representing the interests of the relevant industry, profession or trade. </PARA>
<PARA>The size limits in the guidelines were determined after extensive consultations with State and Territory governments and industry. The States and Territories were concerned that the authority and expertise of the training authorities and the tripartite industry training advisory boards should be maintained by limiting the eligibility to tripartite bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>For its part, industry considered that industry training agents should be appointed if they had sufficient representation and expertise in their particular industries. For similar reasons, professional and trade associations felt that they could provide a particular service to their membership. The NTB took the view that the number of industry training agents should be contained, taking account of industry needs, NTB workload and quality control requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I take your point that smaller associations in Tasmania, Northern Territory and the ACT might not be as readily able to register as their counterparts in larger States. This is because the larger organisations would meet the size criteria under Categories B or D, whereas the smaller organisations would be subject to later consideration under Categories C or E, having regard to the registration outcomes under the other Categories. </PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons, I believe there is merit in your proposal to remove the size restrictions. However, it would be more timely to further consider your proposal along with a possible further amendment to the guidelines in the Budget Sittings 1991. There is insufficient time in the current Sittings to obtain the necessary advice from the NTB about your proposed changes, to consult States and Territories, and to arrange the drafting and tabling of suitable amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>In the meantime, I would encourage applications from smaller organisations as they are not necessarily excluded by the registration of larger organisations, and the NTB must consider all applicants under the guidelines as they presently stand. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank you for your constructive proposal, and assure you that I intend to address it in time for resolution in the Budget Sittings 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. Whilst not sharing opposition to the basic underlying philosophy as just expressed by Senator Reid, we do also acknowledge Senator Reid's persistence in that, if we are to have this, we are to have it right. Like the Australian Democrats, she has insisted that there are many anomalies in the original legislation which could and should be addressed. I am pleased to say it appears that a considerable number of them are being addressed by this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill includes important amendments relating to outstanding trainers and to fees charged by industry training agents-changes which were originally proposed by the Australian Democrats. It also provides for the establishment of alternative industry training schemes, without the risk of a double set of training obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing first with fees charged by registered industry training agents (RITAs), the Democrats are pleased to see that the Government has taken up our suggestions regarding the fees charged by the RITAs. However, that begs the question: if this alteration is good enough now, why was it not good enough in the original legislation? The amendments mean that, instead of a fixed fee of $200 for the issue of a training advisory certificate, the RITAs will be able to charge a maximum fee of $500 on the application for a certificate. That means that the RITAs will not have any pressure placed upon them to actually issue a certificate before they receive the money for the services rendered. In other words, they receive the money for the time spent on it, as soon as the application is made, whether or not a successful certificate is issued. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 54 certificates have been issued by RITAs to this date, although the Tax Office reports that RITAs have effectively filtered a considerable number of other queries without necessarily being asked to issue a certificate. That indicates that their advice is being sought. This amendment provides that that advice can be charged for, and that is a much more equitable position, because the RITAs can and do serve a most useful function. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to undertakings given by the Government with regard to outstanding trainers. The concept of outstanding or exemplary trainers was originally proposed by the Democrats. Its purpose is to recognise the consistently high level of training that is already conducted by some Australian companies. Under clause 8, employers with exemplary training records may be accorded outstanding trainer status. Thus they are exempted from the requirements under the Act for a three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> In his March economic statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that, in order to achieve outstanding trainer status, employers will need to spend at least 5 per cent of payroll on quality structured training. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, also endorse the concept of quality training. Measures must be implemented to ensure that, when talking about training, we are not talking about charlatanism or activities posing as training, such as trips. There must be quality structured training to qualify in this regard. We endorse the amendment that brings about that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is most unfortunate that, with the end of the financial year upon us, we are yet to see the regulations for outstanding trainers. In other words, they will only exist after this provision is passed today-a little late, we believe, especially considering that the concept was raised some months ago. Whilst we have not yet seen the draft regulations, we have faith to expect not only quantity but separate quality tests which are independently audited and verified. Because this sounds so good, it means that the delay is even more regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to alternative training schemes, the current Bill also contains important amendments relating to alternative training schemes. Again, the Democrats lobbied strongly on behalf of some industries for a broad basis for exemption of alternative industry schemes. Many of these have been tried in the past, and some are operating successfully now. The provisions which exempt the building and construction industry, something about which I know a little, include the training provisions which I believe were initiated through very good intentions and, in fact, were established in a very sensible and equitable manner. That building and construction industry now has provision for exemption contained in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Regulations. They had been seen as too industry specific. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of an exclusive exemption for just one industry, the Democrats argued that a general broader basis for setting up alternative schemes needed to be made. In all fairness, any industry should at least have the opportunity to try to devise a more suitable scheme for its own purposes. Apart from the building and construction industry, other industries are interested in trying to develop their own training schemes. Obviously, where we find a more suitable alternative, the concern is not to impose a double set of obligations, especially if the industry has been able to initiate it without the sort of coerciveness that is implicit in this scheme. The coerciveness implied in the scheme is perhaps the fundamental reason for the coalition's objection to its underlying philosophy. It is most unjust to have something else applied over the top of an industry which has initiated its own training scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats recognise that this Bill proposes to make fairly substantial amendments to a piece of legislation which came into force on 1 July 1990. This point was noted by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which expressed concern in its report that persons upon whom this legislation imposes significant obligations will have to refer to at least two separate pieces of legislation, if this Bill is enacted, in order to understand those obligations. That is a considerable problem for the industry. There is an understanding that something has to be done and that there are some rules applying to it, but there is, and there has been for some months, considerable misunderstanding or uncertainty about exactly what those obligations are. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was that a reprint incorporating both pieces of legislation, the principal Act and this amending Bill, will become available if and when this Bill is enacted. That is a most admirable process. On this point, I simply urge the Minister to ensure that any reprint is produced and made available to employers, trainers and others in the community at the earliest opportunity-right at this moment, the end of this month-because there is a great deal of interest in exactly what the obligations of industry are. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be seeking some explanations at the committee stage about some concerns expressed to me by members of the industry. As I have already mentioned, the scheme does have its detractors. I suppose there is some degree of credibility in the argument that it should have been postponed until everything was clarified. We cannot do much about that now. Given the depths of the recession that we are just climbing out of, apparently, it is probably just as well that this training guarantee scheme is already in place because the argument about whether it should be in existence has already been run and won. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that during a recession training is the often first thing that is cut. That is not obvious to all people, but it is contended that that is the wrong decision to make: training is the very last thing that should be cut. At least I think we are doing the right thing by following this requirement through now. When re-emerging from any recession it is important to develop people's skills. The first thing that is needed is a new set of skills to deal with the expansion of industry which will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to look briefly at the operation and effect of the training guarantee scheme in its first year of operation. Under the scheme, employers with payroll tax obligations of $200,000 or more are required to spend one per cent of their payroll on training. In the first quarter after the scheme's introduction, 24 per cent of employers reported spending some money on training. That was an increase from the previous year where 22 per cent of employers reported spending some money on training. These figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics relate to all employers in the category of employers with a payroll of over $200,000-who are therefore subject to the training guarantee scheme-which comprise between 5 and 10 per cent of employers. They employ between 85 and 90 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office reports that, in the first quarter, the proportion of affected employers whose expenditure was under one per cent dropped from 75 per cent to 56 per cent. That is a significant indication that those employers in that category were being pushed towards meeting the sorts of obligations which were put on them by this scheme. According to a report in the Australian of 19 June 1991, a recent survey by Price Waterhouse Urwick Management Consultants found that most public and private sector organisations spend between 5 and 20 per cent of their payroll on training. Most organisations were also found to have either completely unstructured or ad hoc training and they have had to modify existing training programs to comply with the Act. That is the other element that I am sure also entertains you, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA> The other effect of this Act has been to create a structured approach which leads to quality training. Training is one of those aspects of industrial activity which is not solved merely by throwing money at it. In a structured way it is much more successful. Training must be providing, maintaining or improving an area of skill, knowledge or competence for use in employment, present or future, or in carrying on a business, profession, trade or occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible expenditure on work-related training is not restricted to a company's employees. It may also consist of monetary donations to universities and technical and further education colleges or to registered charities that operate training schemes. According to the Australian Taxation Office, affected employers are spending 2 : 1 in-house on internal training rather than shopping it out to colleges or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Assistant Commissioner of the Training Guarantee Branch at the Australian Taxation Office, Mr Chris Hood, also said that qualitative research shows that employers are being extremely fussy about what they will spend their money on externally, which is bad news for the carpetbaggers and good news for quality training. Mr Hood said that, by and large, employers were not interested in trying to get disguised holidays. In one case there was a suggestion that employers should buy into Gold Coast time-share apartments, but Mr Hood said that none were sold. So the carpetbaggers have had a lean time in this area. Again, that is good news for quality trainers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson suggests that time will tell. The indication is there already that quality training is being endorsed and picked up in this regard. The initial indications are that the fears we might have had, and fears which are being addressed by this amending legislation, may not be all that well founded and that, in fact, it is good news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather than industry forfeiting its training money and having to pay a tax straight away, the Democrats suggest another option which allows employers to keep their training money for their own benefit or for the benefit of the industry. That involves industry groups establishing their own training fund to receive donations from employers. Those payments would be eligible training expenditure and tax deductible, and employers could build up credit for training within their own industry. That is slightly different from where the industry groups have established their own training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> We would encourage employers to recognise their obligations, which by and large we believe are theirs, wherever possible. Now that the obligation is there, they should meet the challenge-again, I believe they are-with the improvements that we see before us with this Bill. After a most uncertain beginning, we can have some improvement in this area and at least reach a situation where we can say that the employers of Australia are able to spend money wisely and look forward to the training opportunities that arise in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1991 contains four main amendments relating to alternative training schemes, the treatment of partnerships and unincorporated associations, and the exemption of outstanding trainers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is opposed to this type of legislation. which is yet another example of government interference distorting the marketplace. The Opposition was concerned about this legislation when it was introduced almost a year ago. It saw the legislation as a tax on the employer that would add to operating costs. The Opposition saw it also as legislation that would operate in a very uneven fashion. It was legislation which adopted the mechanism of the sledgehammer in circumstances where alternative mechanisms were more desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will support this amending legislation because the amendments will make the legislation less objectionable than it is currently; it makes bad legislation slightly more bearable. However, the Opposition still has reservations about the training guarantee system, as the legislation is one of those meddling interventionist measures that we should not have. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an urgent need in this country for a more highly skilled and better trained work force. The number of training hours invested per employee indicates that, compared with our overseas competitors, Australia invests the lowest number per new employee on an internationally competitive scale. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deveson report claims that Australia is `now arguably at the back of the pack in skill formation relative to other OECD countries . . . '. Successful countries, such as West Germany and Japan, have long surpassed Australia in the provision of training skills for young people. In a culture which rewards and admires achievement and the attainment of excellence, such as Germany's, there are clear, well-resourced, well-funded and industry recognised training schemes and a great diversity of training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In West Germany today, almost 80 per cent of teenagers, virtually all of those not attending university or college, are undertaking some form of training course. This does not compare particularly favourably with Australia, which has a national average of only 20 per cent of young Australians receiving a vocational education. The only other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country with a worse record than Australia is Greece. The OECD average is about 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the answer does not lie in government interference and more government regulation. These statistics have already shown no improvement since the training guarantee scheme was introduced a year ago, and nothing will change under an interventionist scheme which is the Government's panacea for all of our skilling problems in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports training in Australia, but it must be in the context of open and flexible training. The development of private sector training would have a significant impact on the development of training programs in Australia. The Professor of Adult Education and the Executive Director of Training and Development Services at the University of Technology, Sydney, Professor Rod McDonald, provided some alternative solutions, but they are quite different from the professional trainers, which are so essential to the Government's training guarantee scheme. Professor McDonald says that training is the responsibility of everyone in an organisation. The major trainers are people such as line managers, supervisors and shop floor workers rather than professional full time trainers. He says that what we need is a work force that both is well trained and can train well. All it requires is a little imagination to deliver training when and where it is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The single most important skill for all workers is to learn how to learn. Nothing that they learn will serve them for ever. Workers need to learn to take some responsibility for their own training. The more the worker learns how to train himself or herself, the more that worker can contribute to the company. For example, in major banks a terminal in a branch can deliver a mini-tutorial to a new teller if training assistance is needed. This is something that banks provide but which the workers can use to train themselves. The ICI group has turned routine plant shutdowns into learning opportunities. Other manufacturing industries could follow this example when processing plants have to stop processing for maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> The University of Technology, Sydney and Lend Lease Training have developed a program that develops simple skills such as writing and working in an organisation through to preparing training resources, motivating others and using reflection as an aid to diagnosing their own training needs. </PARA>
<PARA> One kind of training exercise which companies do not need is the two weeks on Dunk Island for staff development of senior managers. Training staff to train itself and to assist in the training of others in the organisation is a cost effective solution, unlike calling in a professional trainer who will not be familiar with the particular needs of an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this highly regulatory Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) does not believe in imaginative and effective training engendered within an organisation. He defines `training' as `structured learning delivered by a qualified trainer resulting in an assessable outcome' and specifies that training programs which are not designed by a person with appropriate qualifications must be approved by such a person in advance of their delivery. Many businesses are already engaged in training. It should be their responsibility to make the decision on what sort of training they give employees, where they give it and for how long. It should be an individual enterprise decision. </PARA>

<PARA> What I would like to have done, if the Government had managed its business properly and the Bills had been in time for us to deal with them in a proper order, was to get properly stuck into the training guarantee scheme. It is an outrageous bungle by the Government. It is no better than the Australian traineeship scheme. Some honourable senators will remember that we had the now Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promising 75,000 traineeships per annum by the time of our bicentennial year. We never got past 14,000 or 15,000 in total, I think. Let us be gracious and say that we got 15,000 per annum. Whenever the Government touches training, it gets it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at some headlines to see what has happened. If I had more time I would go into this more deeply: `Fun in the sun, and it's tax deductible'; in the Australian Financial Review, `Exotic Locations for Training'; in the Canberra Times, `Warning about confusion in advice on training programs tax claims'. That is, the Public Service had not properly got its act together; the Government has not advised it what to advise people about what to do. So there are tax bungles all over the place because of the inadequacy of the planning for this program. </PARA>
<PARA> Another headline reads, `Government trainer out of cruise boat course'. That was nice and embarrassing. I think the relevant Minister had a staffer, or someone in his Department, off on one of these cruise boat training programs. At great embarrassment, presumably at the expense of the taxpayer, he was called back from attendance at that program. There are complaints by the Real Estate Institute of Australia that its matters have not been dealt with because they have not necessarily employees but commissioned sales people. They have a problem with getting up their one per cent since they cannot count training of their commissioned sales people because they are not employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The detail has not been attended to, as was the case with the Australian traineeship scheme. Such things do not sound like a bad idea when the Minister is in Cabinet and wants to get away to do something else in his own portfolio. Everyone says, `Yes, that is a good idea'. It is like motherhood-it sounds good. It all goes down quite well, but the detail has not been attended to. It is just blithering incompetence. Staff training is now a lucrative rort. What a disgrace that something we all agree is important to the development of the nation in order to increase the productivity of the nation-that is, better training of our staff-has been so badly bungled by a government that claims to be competent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the magazine Training Australia: Incorporating Presentation Technology it is said that if I want to buy something in a resort in Queensland and use it as my training facility, I can do so. Just about the total cost will fall into acceptable training expenditure. I will not hold up the Senate on this. I cannot find the particular advertisement at the moment, but perhaps when I finish, if I have found the advertisement, I will wave it at the Minister and he can say what he thinks about a program that allows for a training deduction to be achieved in that way-that is, not much money is spent on training and a lot of money is spent on capital investment. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the Government that says it is looking after the workers and the poor and claims that we are looking after the rich. Yet here we have a training scheme designed so that those companies that can afford it can slip into Mirage resort deals and get a tax break for having done so. It is quite extraordinary. The Minister will have a job answering these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The more technical matter I want to raise relates to penalties and fines and the charging of people. As you would no doubt be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy Chairman, if a company commits an offence under this legislation, there is a set amount, a maximum, of penalty it can go to. That is well and good. It is the same for a small business operator. But what about partnerships? A legal firm such as Corrs may have 120 partners. All of those partners in some way have been a part of the decision to go down a particular training path that may later turn out to be wrong. That would be no surprise, given the extraordinary range of advice being given to people on these matters. In a legal firm with 120 partners every one of them can be individually liable. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevant Minister, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), responds by saying that partnerships are not separate entities in the sense of a company and that if these individual people play a part in the decision they should be individually liable. That has extraordinary consequences for partnerships. Lawyers, for example, do not have a choice about how they conduct their business. They can choose to be sole business practitioners, but they cannot incorporate. A lot of the decisions they make are made as a group; the whole partnership takes responsibility for those decisions. So every one of them can be liable under this legislation. It is just ludicrous. It is a penalty for the way people choose to operate. In the case of legal practitioners, it is a penalty for the way they have to operate.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a reversal of the onus of proof, which in itself on some occasions has been found acceptable by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Why? Because the matters relating to the prosecution are peculiarly within the knowledge of the person alleged to have committed the crime. In this case that will mean that the Director of Public Prosecutions can launch a prosecution against every partner to save the bother of ascertaining whether certain partners are responsible rather than others. The onus is then on the partners themselves to show that they had nothing to do with this. That is just fundamentally wrong. It is very lazy drafting, because someone could not be bothered figuring out how to handle partnerships. I would appreciate an answer from the Minister as to the detail of this matter, otherwise I will have to take it up in the committee stage. </PARA>

Today's Bill, the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill, while addressing some of the anomalies arising from those Acts, in no way improves efficiency. I am still to be swayed from the opinion that training levy schemes are heavy-handed and that they are not effective means of improving training programs. They are merely another tax, another impost, on industry, another overhead that will make industry more and more uncompetitive as we seek to overcome the problems of recessionary conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am surprised that a challenge has not been mounted on constitutional grounds to the validity of this training levy. Perhaps no challenge has been mounted because business believes it to be so unworkable that it is expected to die a natural death. I stand by my statement of last year that this legislation does not fit the norm. It discriminates even within the same group of people. It lays down regulations as to the code of conduct. It has inclusions and exclusions for particular types of activities. The effect of this amendment Bill is to add further to the list of inclusions and exclusions. There will be a grouping entitled `Outstanding Trainers' which will be exempt and there will also be an exemption for particular industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition maintains its opposition to the training guarantee scheme because of its arbitrary nature, both in terms of who has to pay and the threshold figure of $200,000. We said 12 months ago that, as a coalition, as a responsible alternative government, we cannot support a levy which is applied carte blanche, irrespective of what the company does, irrespective of whether it provides any one-to-one training, and irrespective of whether the nature of the business requires it to recruit and employ untrained staff and then to train them. There is a whole range of ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed a pity that this amendment Bill has come up before the end of the financial year. Had it come up in the Budget session we might have been able to get some idea of how companies are coping with the paperwork and the course approval procedure that they now have to engage in. We could then better appreciate the full ramifications of the training guarantee scheme. I certainly hope that we do not have to wait until the initial review after four years, as promised by the Government. We will be lucky if we have any industry left by then, the way industry is going in these recessionary conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps there will be another private member's Bill, and I encourage my colleague Senator Reid, in relation to the training guarantee scheme in the next 12 months. We will then get a chance to assess how these companies are coping. We should also be able to get some indication of whether or not the Government has been able to raise enough revenue to cover even its administrative costs, let alone to sponsor other training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> My main complaint with the training guarantee scheme is its failure to acknowledge one-to-one, on-the-job training as a legitimate training expense. For the bulk of manufacturing processes and industries, the application of this Bill is perhaps a way out. However, we are not here to discuss this scheme but rather the administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that included in the amendments in this Bill is an embellishment of the meaning of the term `eligible training program', which hopefully clarifies the matter for registered industry training agents (RITAs) and users. There was obviously an interpretation problem with the definition, and hopefully this has now been clarified. No doubt registered industry training agents will be pleased to see that this Bill contains a number of amendments that clarify their position in regard to remuneration for training advisory certificates and secrecy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A substantive amendment within the Bill is that which covers the exclusion of outstanding trainers. As was the situation with the original Bill, now the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Act, we are being required to debate legislation without the accompanying regulations. This is not a very satisfactory situation. The qualifying criteria for RITAs, as regulated, were not available last time. I understand that Minister Dawkins has conducted perfunctory consultations with employer groups which resulted in general support for the idea of outstanding trainers, but there has been disagreement on the criteria for selection and exemption. Once the regulations are tabled, no doubt we will discuss the matter further. It will then be interesting to see what the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and other such bodies have to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The other substantive amendment exempts building and construction employees in Western Australia and Tasmania from the training guarantee scheme, as they are soon to be covered by the State industry training levy arrangements which are very similar to the training guarantee scheme. Regulations are required for this amendment also and, while they have not been put forward with the legislation by the Government, they have at last been given to the Tasmanian building and construction industry. That industry was under the impression that they had already been tabled but, of course, they have not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Building and Construction Industry Training Board has raised with me a concern it had in relation to the Bill. Its concern is with proposed new section 4a (2) (e), the effect of which is to allow regulations to address `the charging of fees for applications for approval-in-principle decisions or scheme decisions'. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed regulations which the Tasmanian Building and Construction Industry Training Board has seen make no reference to a fee. However, this does not mean that a fee will not be introduced in the future. The Training Board feels that this is yet another collection mechanism introduced by the Government and is unwarranted. The Board cites section 34(1) of the Act, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Subject to this section, money in the fund may be applied for the purposes of:-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) Reimbursing the Commonwealth for: (among other things)</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The costs of administering this Act during any period; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Costs incurred by the Commonwealth during any period in collecting, compiling, analysing and publishing information about the operations of this Act; . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, the argument is that the Government has a way of covering its administrative costs and should not develop further revenue-raising avenues. I will leave this matter up to the Government to sort out with industry. It will also no doubt be a topic for discussion when the regulations are tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation still does not contain a provision under which employers can apply for exemption where their circumstances justify it. It is usual to have an opting out clause in special circumstances, but there is no such provision in this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In support of my raising this defect, I cite instances such as employers who hire out to other employers temporary staff, such as relief secretaries or locums for professional practices. There is also no provision in the Bill for companies with substituted accounting periods. Companies which extract information on a financial year basis will be inconvenienced when their records are maintained for a different year end. This amendment Bill in no way eases the record retention obligations which still remain quite onerous. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is also another serious anomaly which is a direct consequence of this Act and which I believe the Government should address. Senate Vanstone has already raised this matter and I endorse her comments. Under the Act, commissions and the like received by real estate salesmen and other salesmen not on a retainer are clearly included within the definition of `payroll', and must therefore be included in the calculation of employers' liability for training expenditure. However, the Australian Taxation Office has ruled that employers cannot claim against the levy for time spent by staff on commission attending eligible training programs. Furthermore, if retainers are offset against commissions, employers cannot claim a cost for the time of a salesman attending eligible training. </PARA>
<PARA> The ruling by the Australian Taxation Office contravenes the intent of the legislation. The explanatory memorandum states that the salary or wages can be claimed for all employees whose remuneration is covered under the definition of `payroll'. The sales side of the real estate industry operates almost entirely on a commission basis and, as such, is at a distinct disadvantage as a result of the Australian Taxation Office's interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> The anomaly can be removed in one of two ways: either, firstly, by excluding commissions from the definition of `payroll' in the Act; or, secondly, including them as salary or wages for the purpose of allowing a deduction for attendance at eligible training programs. Of all the criticism that I have tendered against this Bill, I ask the Government to address specifically the last issue that I have raised. I specifically request the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, to oversee the taxation responsibilities on behalf of the Government. I ask that we get an answer to that matter as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to draw the Senate's attention to the comments of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in relation to this Bill. I am, of course, referring to the reversal of the onus of proof implied by clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill, for partnerships and companies defending themselves against the charge of non-compliance with the training guarantee scheme. This matter was also raised by my colleague Senator Vanstone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made a general comment about the imposition of penalties for partnerships. The Committee sought advice from the Minister as to whether the imposition of, say, a fine on the members of a partnership individually would lead to the imposition, in effect, of a fine equivalent to the total of the fine which would be levied on a sole proprietor or a company but multiplied by the number of partners held liable, thereby subjecting the partnership to a greater penalty than that which would be levied on a sole proprietor or company. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee noted that this Bill proposes to make what appears to be substantial amendments to a piece of legislation, most of which came into force only 12 months ago. The Committee expresses concern that persons upon whom this legislation imposes significant obligations will already have to refer to at least two separate pieces of legislation if this Bill is enacted in order to understand those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to congratulate the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on the diligence it displayed in carrying out its task and for picking up on these unintended consequences which, if not altered now, would require further amendment at a future date. </PARA>
<PARA> I still believe that training levies are a mistake. They are an attack on the symptom rather than the cause. It should be the aim of the Government to create a competitive market, because if companies have to compete they will have to recognise that human capital gives them a competitive advantage. We look forward to hearing from the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Vanstone, in the course of her remarks, made a couple of points. She particularly referred to treatment of partnerships under the Training Guarantee (Amendment) Bill. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did draw the attention of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to some concern about the treatment of partnerships, and he responded to that Committee to its satisfaction. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of the Minister's letter to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The question of partnerships is dealt with at the bottom of page 2 of that letter. </PARA>

<PARA>Chairman</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No 6 of 1991 (17 April) concerning some aspects of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1991, which was referred to my office by Mr Argument on 18 April. </PARA>
<PARA>Reversal of onus of proof</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee raises questions concerning reversal of the onus of proof under clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 proposes the insertion of new Sections 11a and 11b into the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 governing the treatment of partnerships and unincorporated associations, respectively. The proposed new Sections include provision for the treatment of offences against the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee draws attention to subclauses 11a (5) and 11b (6) which, respectively, provide that a partner or controlling officer (as the case may be) can raise a defence against an alleged offence if the partner or controlling officer proves certain specified matters. The Committee notes that this may be considered a reversal of the onus of proof, as it is ordinarily incumbent on the prosecution to prove all the elements of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, clause 6 includes provision for an offence committed by a business group to be an offence by each of the individual members. However, as with the partner or controlling officer under clause 5, the onus of proof is place on the person raising the defence. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of subclauses 11a (5) and 11b (6) are a statement of the liability of partners or controlling officers of bodies corporate in accordance with the accepted law in the area of partnership and company law respectively. It is necessary, therefore, to provide a statutory defence for the `innocent' partner or officer in order to rebut the presumption. The matters to be proved in the defence, on the balance of probabilities, will be peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant and extremely difficult for the prosecution to negative. The reversed onus is therefore justified and comes within the principles the Committee applies to these matters. (See the Committee's 10th Report of 1987.)</PARA>
<PARA>Further, since the Act is taxation legislation, the proposed onus of proof provisions are similar to other taxation laws. In fact similar provisions on onus of proof are also found in taxation legislation as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> * Sections 165 and 166 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA> * Sections 102aazg, 221yhzn, and 468 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</PARA>
<PARA> * Sections 12 and 13 of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA>Penalties relating to partnerships and unincorporated associations</PARA>
<PARA>Also your Committee seeks my advice on the effect of proposed new subclauses 11a (3) and 11b (4) in relation to penalties under the Act ranging from imprisonment (for up to 2 years), to fines (of up to $3,000), to the imposition of penalty charges. Subclauses 11a (3) and 11b (4), respectively, provide that partners or members are jointly and severally liable for any amount payable by the partnership or unincorporated association, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee asks whether each partner or controlling officer would be held liable up to a maximum penalty, thus subjecting the partnership or unincorporated association to a greater penalty than would be levied on a sole proprietor or company. </PARA>
<PARA>Where criminal proceedings apply, clearly a penalty by way of imprisonment can only be imposed on an individual according to the nature and seriousness of the criminal act. </PARA>
<PARA>In case of an offence the liability of each of the partners or controlling officers is up to the maximum penalty because each partner or controlling officer may individually commit an offence. For instance, several partners could each be fined a maximum of $3,000 for committing the same offence. Since an offence may be committed individually, it is appropriate that the individual partner or controlling officer be subject to the maximum penalty. The drafting accords with this intention and the jointly and severally liable provisions under subclauses 11a (3) and 11b (4) are not applicable in regard to fines for offences committed by individual partners or controlling officers. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision for each partner or controlling officer to be liable to the maximum penalty for an offence ensures that there is an adequate and appropriate deterrent against offences under the Act. If, for instance, there are many partners involved in an offence, and the courts were only able to fine the partnership a maximum of $3,000 in aggregate, there might be little deterrent. The proposed provisions give the courts the discretion to deal appropriately with each individual according to the seriousness of the offence, with scope to impose the maximum penalty where appropriate. The existence of a number of offenders and the penalties imposed on them would be matters a sentencing court would take into account in determining the appropriate penalty in an individual case. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of subclauses 11a (3) and 11b (4), concerning the joint and several liability of partners or members, respectively, apply to penalty charges imposed under the Act. In other words, where a partnership or unincorporated association incurs a penalty in respect of a liability arising under the Act, the partners or members, as the case may be, are jointly and severally liable for the penalty charges involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed reprint of the Act</PARA>
<PARA>I note the Committee's concerns that the enactment of the Bill could give rise to two separate pieces of legislation (the Act and Amendment Act), and this might pose some difficulties for employers understanding their obligations. Arrangements are being made with Attorney-General's Department to have a reprint available of the Act when the Bill is enacted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone also drew attention, as did one or two other honourable senators, to the question of what was at one stage described as rorts by one of the speakers. The Minister has issued a media statement warning employers about this issue. It is always possible, in any situation where there is potential for a tax benefit or a tax detriment, that people will try to deal imprudently with this sort of issue. But let me say that the Government, through the Minister, will be keeping an eye on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A comment was made about regarding real estate and other commission-based industries. There has been substantial correspondence with the Minister on this and there is no anomaly in the legislation relating to commission. Indeed, if we accepted the industry's request, it would be anomalous and inequitable from the viewpoint of other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Because time is passing, I just want to make one or two general points about the legislation. The burden of the Liberal Party opposition to this legislation is to try to get the best of both worlds, to say, `We believe in more training but we are against this form of encouraging it, and we believe that in the read our lips--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Knowles" NAMEID="TH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a quotation, Senator. It is a quotation from the Opposition spokesman on industry. He says, `Read my lips to see whether we will deliver on any of these things'. What Senator Watson, as I understood him, seemed to be saying was that, if there were a Liberal government in Australia, competitive conditions would be created where training would automatically take place because firms would have to train people in order to survive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a beaut little view, having regard to a static model of the Australian economy which was protected in Senator Watson's day from outside competition. It is not a view which is appropriate to current circumstances in Australian industry. It used to be said that investment capital flowed around the world in search of cheap labour and in search of raw materials. Investment capital floats around the world now, more than anything else, in search of skills. Foreign companies come to see me and I sometimes ask them, `Why do you want to come here into a particular industry?' and they say, `Because of the skills'. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, it cannot be said across the whole range of Australian industry, but it can be said in some industries. Senator Watson, in his more laterally minded condition-which sometimes falls on him by way of accident, perhaps in the darker hours of night-knows that is true. The Government in this country was confronted with a situation where the performance in relation to skills training by industry was just not up to scratch internationally and there was no apparent way in which it could be got up to scratch internationally in a relatively quick and significant way. That was the seed, if you like, of this scheme and of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the dark ages, Senator Watson had some remote industry experience, and he well knows-recalling from the days when he worked in Tasmania's dark satanic mills-that those firms which took the trouble to train people had them pinched all the time by other firms which were too lazy to take on the task. It does Senator Watson no good to wave his arms at me like John the Baptist. That will not make any difference to the argument. The fact of the matter is that this scheme, which was thought about for a long time, was necessary and is embodied in this legislation. That is why it is here. </PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary figures suggest that industry, which in the past did not respond to this need, is now responding and employers have increased their training effort significantly over the last 12 months or so. It is all very well to nitpick. Liberal Party oppositions are always good at looking for potential rorts because that is the environment in which they grew up. When in government they created them all. They are still doing this in a nitpicking way. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It concerns Cambodia. My question is in four parts. Firstly, what is the Australian Government's assessment of the likelihood of a peace settlement in Cambodia occurring, given the apparent failure of the recent Jakarta talks to make any real progress? Secondly, what is the Minister's explanation for the serious leak of Australian diplomatic cables and documents to journalists in Jakarta during the talks regarding Australia's agenda to gain United Nations (UN) Security Council intervention to prevent the Khmer Rouge breaking its word on the transitional arrangements? Thirdly, is the proposed meeting of the Supreme National Council (SNC) on 24 June likely to bring any closer the need for the deployment of Australian forces in a peacekeeping role in Cambodia? Finally, has the Australian Government been urging Japan to take a significant role in a Cambodia settlement, either by taking part in a peacekeeping force, or by providing financial support?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the likelihood of a peace settlement after the Jakarta meeting, the situation is extremely active at the moment in this respect, with many more positive signs in the last 24 hours than I have seen in the last nine months. Those signs are occurring in the context of the 24 June meeting of the SNC to which Senator Teague referred. They seem to flow from the rapprochement that has been achieved at Jakarta between the Phnom Penh people under Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is too early yet for me to speculate publicly in any more detail than that as to how things might work out. I simply make the point that what is happening is occurring squarely within the context of the United Nations peace plan rather than involving some fundamental departure from it. I think there are grounds for quite a lot of optimism that we may be, at last, seeing the beginning of a serious end game in this.</PARA>
<PARA> We have had high expectations in the past; they have been deflated in the past, but a great deal did happen during 1990 after the initial UN peace plan was floated by Australia. A great deal of progress was made and then it came to a halt around September or October last year. The point that I am simply making is that, despite the apparent failure of the Jakarta talks to advance matters as far as the consideration of those settlement terms are concerned, things have been happening since, in the context of this SNC meeting, which do represent some rapid and lively forward movement.</PARA>
<PARA> That answers the honourable senator's third question. As to the second question about the leak of cables in Jakarta, I have been assured, and am confident on the basis of those assurances, the nature of which I cannot reveal, that the source of the leaked material was not the Australian Government but in fact some external source that had access to that material. That represents something of a change, I acknowledge, in terms of a history of leaks in the last few months but, in this particular instance, it is not attributable, I am totally confident, to any official or other Australian Government source.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the role to be played by Japan in the Cambodian peace settlement, we have said for a long time that we believe Japan has a significant role to play. In fact, we co-chair with Japan one of the subgroups of the Paris conference which has to do with post-war, post-settlement rehabilitation and reconstruction, and certainly we would hope that Japan would play a major role in that post-settlement rehabilitation process. As to whether Japan may have some role to play in a peacekeeping context in the course of a worked out UN settlement, again, I think it is premature to speculate about that. Given the state of the domestic debate in Japan, it is probably premature to contemplate that as a reality, if the Cambodian settlement does come to fruition in the reasonably near future. But, as I have indicated in this place on other occasions, as far as the Australian Government is concerned, we believe that it would be quite appropriate for Japan to play a role in the future in UN peacekeeping operations.</PARA>

In that environment, and because of the need for tight fiscal policy, there is no prospect of a reduction in sales tax on cars this financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A treaty of fraternity, cooperation and coordination was concluded last month between the governments of Lebanon and Syria and has now been ratified by the parliaments of each country. The treaty consists of a six-point plan dealing with cooperation and coordination in education, trade, foreign policy, security arrangements and the economy. The security arrangements are expected to include the establishment of a military coordination committee to decide on a timetable for the redeployment of Syrian troops from Beirut into the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon as provided for in the Taif agreement. The treaty has been concluded by a sovereign Lebanese government which has authority to manage its own affairs and which claims that Lebanon will benefit from the treaty. I am aware that some Lebanese Christian representatives and Israel have claimed that the treaty may be a vehicle for increasing Syrian influence in Lebanon. We are presently seeking evidence of how the treaty will work in practice before we would make such a judgment ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we have made it clear over a number of years now, we oppose activity in Lebanon by Syria or any other country which compromises Lebanese sovereignty. In this context, we continue to oppose the presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon which, of course, remain there in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 425. The Lebanese-Syrian treaty comes as significant progress has recently been achieved in implementing the Taif accord generally, particularly in relation to the disarming and disbanding of militias, although I would have to express some caution that there is still some way to go before long term peace and stability are restored to Lebanon. Press reports that the Palestine Liberation Organisation has agreed to withdraw from positions in southern Lebanon and to allow the Lebanese Army to deploy in its place are, if confirmed-and they remain to be confirmed-a welcome development and represent a further extension of the Lebanese Government's authority in that country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade: is it the case that the United States delegates to the Madrid conference on Antarctica have changed their attitude to the maintenance of a minimum 50-year mining ban in Antarctica? If so, in what way has their position changed and what will be the effect of this change on the long term effectiveness of the mining ban-that is, beyond 50 years? Do any other countries appear to be wavering? What is Australia doing to ensure a strong position on a mining ban from the Madrid conference?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5321" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United States has not exactly changed its position on the question of a 50-year mining ban. What has happened is this: at the first Madrid meeting in April, the Antarctic Treaty parties agreed to a comprehensive environment protection regime for Antarctica which would, in effect, prohibit mining there permanently. That followed from the capacity of any existing consultative party, including Australia, to veto the implementation of a future mining regime after 50 years. So, the significance of the original Madrid agreement was that, while it provided for a review conference to be called after 50 years, the outcome of that review conference could be stymied by any country stopping, in effect, mining permanently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was, in a sense, surprising that the United States went along with the particular consensus that was achieved on an ad referendum basis-that is to say, subject to reference back to governments for confirmation-in April, because the United States position up until then had been one of fairly robust enthusiasm for retaining a capacity to engage in mining. That was the position as it stood in April.</PARA>
<PARA> What happened at the current Madrid conference-which was called with the hope and expectation that, having been back to home governments, there would be a more or less automatic endorsement and signature of the original agreement-is that there has been some backsliding in the US position. The current proposal that is now the subject of close attention, as the current conference draws to conclusion, is one that pays some regard to that later US position but in fact modifies it. I think that, rather than going through the complications of describing what the US came back to at this conference and what is now the subject of discussion at the moment as the likely outcome-unless consensus is denied-I should simply state what the current proposal is.</PARA>
<PARA> The current proposal now being hotly debated is as follows: a conference can still be called after 50 years, so that one has to wait 50 years before anything happens. At that conference, if an amendment is to be adopted allowing for mining, it has to be adopted by a majority of the parties at the conference, including three-quarters of the present consultative parties. That is to say, a quarter of the present 26 consultative parties, if they banded together, could still veto the application of a new mining regime in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a further provision, which the United States of America is enthusiastic about, that any party which does not like that situation occurring would have the right to withdraw, on two years notice, from the environment protocol as a whole. It is not a right to withdraw from the mining bit of it; it relates to the environment protocol as a whole, which means that there is a political inhibition on any country choosing to so act, because it would come in for a lot of flak for no longer subjecting itself to an environment regime.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also a requirement in the current proposal that there be an explicit acknowledgment of the sovereign claims of claimant nations. So, on the face of it, it means that any country that did choose to withdraw from the protocol and go ahead and mine in 50-plus years time would nonetheless have to respect the claims of sovereignty of countries with claims in the area. For example, if the United States wanted to mine, in the situation in which it had withdrawn from the protocol, in Australian-claimed territory, it would, on this reading, have to get approval from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the proposal that is now there. The difficulty that Australia and New Zealand are facing is that the overwhelming majority of the parties at this conference are, it seems, now getting behind this particular proposal, which is a modification of the absolute veto proposal that previously existed; but it is a proposal which, nonetheless, would prohibit any mining occurring for at least 57 years and which would involve jumping many hurdles before that happened.</PARA>

That is the position that we are involved in at the moment. It is one that will be resolved within the next 24 hours. I think it is important that the Senate and the public understand the nature of the immense number of hurdles that have to be jumped before one could mine under the proposal as it has now emerged.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5324" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In yesterday's Canberra Times, a Mr Brian Davis, the New South Wales President of the Australian Small Business Association, made allegations, and again in today's Australian, this time by letter, he made allegations, about the Government's campaign to encourage compliance with award-based superannuation. Honourable senators would be well aware of the campaign, because I have answered questions on it for some time. They would know that, on a plain reading of what has been put, many of the allegations are simply hysterical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are four categories of allegation made by Mr Davis, all of which are wrong. The first category goes to credibility, in which he uses phrases such as `the Government stretches the truth', `the Government's letter is intimidating', `the Government's letter is not correct', and that the claims we make as a government are `dishonest and aimed at coercing employers'.</PARA>
<PARA> The second group of allegations he makes is that we have suggested that employers return a card to the Department of Industrial Relations or ring, and that if employers do that they will get a visit by a union official or an inspector and will be inspected and put through the wringer; and that in any case DIR advice is confused and that confusion reigns supreme. Thirdly, he said that we intend or try to intimidate employers under obscure legal guises in order to force them to contribute to union-controlled superannuation schemes. Finally, he says that we have embarked on this information campaign in complete disregard for small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> What should be said about all these allegations is that not only are they sad because of the paranoia they display, but also they are totally wrong and mislead. The letter that we have sent as a government to thousands of employers is aimed at informing them of their obligations and rights and the rights of their employees for award-based superannuation. The letter that has been sent out was approved by the Confederation of Australian Industry and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions as to the accuracy of its text. It was based on an impartial survey commissioned by the Department to find out what problems employers had with superannuation. The letter was designed to answer specifically those problems. The tone of the letter is agreeable; it is not in any sense an intimidating letter.</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation that we are encouraging contributions to union-controlled funds is a fallacy. Anyone who knows anything about award-based superannuation knows that funds generated as a consequence are controlled by both employers and unions for that particular industry. They are not union funds as such, but are jointly managed.</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation that we have shown a complete disregard for small business is wrong. I wrote to the Australian Small Business Association about this campaign before we launched it, inviting the Association to participate and explaining the background of the campaign. It has not favoured the Government with a reply. I can only imagine that our letter is gathering dust somewhere in the archives of that Association.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter we have sent advises employers to contact the Department of Industrial Relations if they want information. This is a service that the Government offers employers, to inform them impartially as to the legal obligations. But it suggests that before they do that they contact their own employer organisation and it encourages them to be affiliated to those organisations so that they can obtain the best information from their own representatives rather than draw on the government service that is provided. It suggests that, if they do not wish to do that, we will provide the information. We see it as a service offering help to small business.</PARA>
<PARA> What would be offensive, I would think, to a small business person who was obeying the law and paying legal entitlement to superannuation is that a competitive small businessman was disobeying the law, not paying legal entitlement and having a subsidy in terms of profit or company turnover because he or she was acting illegally and therefore enjoying a competitive advantage. The reason why employer organisations support this campaign is that there is a level playing field. They, too, recognise the need for all employers to comply with the law, which is why they have endorsed it.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the campaign is going well. There is an estimated superannuation underpayment of $700m. We intend with the social partners, the employers and the unions, to ensure that that is properly paid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable senators would be aware that complaints were received from pensioners about not only being faced with deeming but also the introduction of some regulations under the Cash Transaction Reports Act which, unfortunately, came about at the same time. It meant that pensioners, even if they had been operating bank accounts for 50 years, nonetheless were forced to comply with a points system, which many of them found very difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the complaints I had received, I wrote to the Attorney-General some months ago. He replied favourably to a review, and his Department and mine have been looking at ways and means of sorting out the problem. Amendments to the regulations under that Act are being drafted now, and we hope that new procedures will be in place by 1 July. Under those arrangements, if a DSS form SF104 letter of introduction can be produced, which is available on request to eligible beneficiaries and pensioners, that will be given a weighting of 100 points. That will be sufficient to open a bank account on its own. The new arrangements will mean a great simplification for pensioners and I think will be welcomed by all of them.</PARA>

I refer to the 1985 Andriessen assurance between Mr Andriessen and Mr Kerin that the European Community (EC) would not grant export restitution for beef exports to Australia's traditional markets and which is now under review. As a consequence, we could see 100,000 tonnes of beef dumped in Asia over the next five years, with a 25 per cent loss of income to Australian beef producers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that Senator Boswell is referring to the media reports in the past day or so that EC Agricultural Commissioner MacSharry has recommended ending the Andriessen assurance under which the EC has agreed not to export subsidised beef to Japan and other Asian-Pacific markets. This brief was prepared yesterday; so something may have turned up since, in which case I will amend the answer later, if that is appropriate. As I am advised at the moment, we are unaware of any recent developments in EC Commission policy that would substantiate those reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This issue has been discussed extensively with Commissioner MacSharry, with his colleagues, and indeed with his predecessor, Vice-President Andriessen, by me and successive Trade Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers. We do not believe that the answer to the problems currently facing the EC's chaotically organised beef industry can be found in increasing subsidised exports, and we have constantly made that point.</PARA>
<PARA> We remain reassured by the commitment given by EC President Delors earlier this year which recognised the fundamental trade policy and political importance of the agreement, and stated that the EC would consult with Australia if it were to consider any changes to it. During his visit a couple of weeks ago, Vice-President Andriessen reiterated that commitment. The agreement was reached in 1985 by the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, with Messrs Delors and Andriessen. As Senator Boswell has implied, it does remain essential to the stability and security of the Australian beef industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also aware of reports that other countries opposed to any extension of the use of export subsidies, as we are, do support Australia's position on the Andriessen assurance. It goes without saying that we welcome such support, and the fact of it is a further basis for supposing that the EC would not act unilaterally on this or in any arbitrary way. If I do receive any further information, I will provide it before the end of Question Time.</PARA>

At the time he said that new procedures would be put in place by January 1991. Can the Minister confirm whether pamphlets containing information on DSS clients' legal rights were completed two months ago and were ready to be printed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the South Australian Government determines in relation to the Gillman site is very much its business and not a matter with which the Commonwealth would want to interfere. In relation to the MFP, the nine principles established by governments at an early stage set out that the MFP should be private sector led and private sector financed. That does not mean that if the South Australian Government, for example, wants to provide infrastructure of some kind or another which would make the site a more attractive investment destination, it should not do that. The history of this country is cluttered with the provision of infrastructure by governments-whether it be beef, roads, airports or whatever-which make business investment more attractive.

Whether the Commonwealth would be involved directly with a member on the development corporation remains to be seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson and, I think, Senator Harradine raised this problem with me last year. There were some conflicting messages from the disabled community on the question of the disability reform package. As honourable senators would probably be aware, at the moment people in sheltered workshops qualify for the sheltered employment allowance. That is either paid direct to the workshop and then incorporated in the employee's wage packet or it is paid directly into an individual's bank account or into one of the nominee accounts to which Senator Giles referred. At the moment, about 60 per cent of the employees have that payment going into their wage packet-in other words, going via the sheltered workshop itself. About 40 per cent have the allowance paid into a bank account of their own choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the new reform package, that allowance will be replaced with a disability support pension. Everyone who is to get that new pension will be transferred to it automatically on 1 October. People who enter sheltered workshops after that will be able to claim that same payment.</PARA>
<PARA> There are those in the disabled community who tell me that paying money direct to sheltered workshops is the wrong thing to do. There are others who fairly passionately claim that it is a right that people in sheltered workshops should retain. Over the course of the next couple of months, I will hold some more discussions with sheltered workshops and disabled groups to try to form a definite policy. At the moment, I would lean to the view that those in the disabled community should have the widest choice possible.

Is the Minister aware that the number of helicopters serviceable on any one day has always been unacceptably low, being as low as 10 per cent on some occasions, with great effects on the training program? Is the Minister aware that the committee set up to look at the transfer of the helicopters from the Air Force to the Army, which was chaired by then Commodore Ian MacDougall, now the Chief of the Naval Staff, in recommending against the transfer to Army noted that the cost would be at least $50m for no benefit? Given the Minister's laudable aim to get the maximum value for the defence dollar and the fact that, at the end of the day, Army's requirements are for an airlift capability when it wants that, not the ownership of the asset, when will the Minister take the appropriate action and transfer the maintenance of the Blackhawks to the Air Force and resolve what is now an intractable problem which is costing us tens of millions of dollars and which is running on just the way the minehunter program ran on for years?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would contend there is no analogy between the current Blackhawk situation and the minehunter program. It is true that when any new capital equipment comes into operation there are initial problems. That is especially true of helicopters. The comparisons that we have looked at between the introduction of the Blackhawks here and their introduction in other parts of the world show that over the first 18 months in particular a whole range of maintenance problems have to be dealt with, and it does not compare badly with overseas experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me about Commodore MacDougall's views on the matter. That obviously well and truly predates my entry into the portfolio. But the matter has been looked at. I do not think it is costing us tens of millions of dollars at the moment. The expenditure on these machines is on track but, as I say, the introduction of new capital equipment, especially helicopters, takes a long while to break in. Navy is finding similar problems with the helicopters that it has introduced into service. It takes a long time for them to come up.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator mentioned the figure of 10 per cent. Of course, in a previous press release, Senator, you did not say up to 10 per cent; you said 10 per cent, which was of great concern to those people who run these particular helicopters. Ten per cent may be a correct figure on any given day-and you put it correctly here today.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to move the helicopters from Air Force to Army caused some pain through interservice rivalry and everything else. I do not believe, though, I should encourage that sort of narrow view of service rivalry. I am quite convinced that in the next 12 months the problems with the Blackhawks will be overcome. As I say, according to my advice, there were similar problems overseas, and they were anticipated. I do not believe that if the helicopters were in Air Force or in any other maintenance program, the problems would be any less.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it obviously cannot be part of the bankruptcy law to take away the assets of relatives, friends or employers who make these assets available to bankrupts. However, having said that, I point out that it is extremely necessary also that there be no loopholes in the bankruptcy laws which allow people to disguise the fact that they have transferred assets as I say to, perhaps, relatives or friends and are in fact living off those transferred assets. We have to follow that money trail-the term used by Senator Bolkus, which I think will probably catch on-and trace these assets in the hands of those to whom they have been transferred in a way which is designed to defraud the creditors involved. Indeed, Australia, I believe, does lead the world in legislation to ensure that, where the bankrupt has enjoyed assets and disguised those assets in a trust, a company or a partnership which is effectively the alter ego of the bankrupt, those assets can be followed up by the trustee and, of course, they can be claimed for the bankrupt estate and, therefore, be made available to creditors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Proceeds of crime is an analogous situation, Senator, but not particularly relevant to this discussion. The fact is that, where assets are disposed of in a way which is designed to defraud creditors, there is legislation which provides that the disposition of assets has no effect against the trustee and the assets become available for distribution to creditors. That is how is should be. I have asked the Inspector General in Bankruptcy, Mr Richard Moss, to look particularly at and to review all those cases of some notoriety which have been very evident in the media over the last several weeks and months and to ensure that creditors are not defrauded by bankrupts continuing to live off assets which they have disposed of and transferred to relatives or friends in a way which is designed to disguise the assets that are truly available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday of this week, Senator Short asked me a question about relative growth rates and unemployment through the 1980s, based on some Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures which he got out of the newspapers. At the conclusion of his supplementary question, I invited him to ask me a further question about relative employment growth. Senator Short said, in answer to my invitation, `We will do that later too', and there was great cries of approval from the backbenchers. Rather like Horatio, a poem, those behind cried forward and those in front cried back. I have been waiting breathlessly for the further question all week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to provide an answer to that question. Senator Short asserted that OECD data, which was reported in the newspapers, showed that Australia's average rate of economic growth was the fifth lowest in the 24 member list of OECD countries between 1980 and 1989. I make the point that that period, 1980-1989, included the 1981, 1982, 1983 recession, and the period of the Fraser Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, Senator, come on! Let me make a few further observations about this matter. Bureau of Industry Economics calculations using latest published OECD data sources indicate that Australia came sixteenth out of 24 OECD countries on this basis. But population data is not yet available for the final year of the period to which Senator Short referred, namely 1990, in order to update the calculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question raises a number of issues in relation to the measurement of per capita gross domestic product growth and its use as an indicator of economic performance and productivity. A very important factor to be taken into account in measuring these things is the so-called dependency ratio, that is, what proportion of the population is old, what proportion is young and of school age and, in that sense, dependent on people of working age. An economy with an ageing population or an increasingly large number of school-age people performs less well in those relative figures than an economy where the growth rate reflects the more average age of the population and people involved in the work force. That is the case with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> After adjusting for this factor, Australia's ranking of gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate per person of working age is, in fact, tenth out of the 24 OECD countries. Australia is higher ranked than Italy, France and Germany, for example, for this period. I suggest it is well known that Australia's family migration and refugee programs tend to reduce the current growth rate of GDP per head because older people and currently unproductive children boost that dependency ratio to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA> During Senator Short's question and my answer, Senator Crichton-Browne interjected that the current Government was a peculiar circumstance pertaining to the Australian economy. However true that might be, that interjection had no relevance to the point of Senator Short's question because Senator Crichton-Browne's interjection does not stand analysis. Per capita GDP grew by 0.7 per cent during the period 1976 to 1983 and between 1983 and 1990 it grew by 3 per cent. I said `about double' in my answer. It is over four times. I got that figure wrong and I apologise for that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator Hill asked me a question about the extent to which advice might have been received from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) about various grants made to South African development projects. In the course of that answer, which had a rather spectacularly misplaced beat-up in this morning's press, I did say at one point that I would not be at all surprised if, in that context, there were not some formal recommendations on the books somewhere suggesting as much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The context in question was the longstanding Government policy that has hitherto existed that development assistance moneys would not go directly to political movements. The situation so far as that is concerned is that, having checked the records in some detail, there are simply no papers available anywhere that we can find in which AIDAB has ever recommended or advised the Government in those terms not to give money directly to a political movement.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been Government policy, which periodically has been referred to as such by way of reference in AIDAB documentation, but there has never been advice from the agency as such; it is simply a judgment that the Government itself has made. As to the specific recent grant that was made to the African National Congress (ANC) of $83,000 for computer equipment, library books and so on to establish a department of economic planning, AIDAB did participate, I am now reminded, in the preparation of the recommendations in question.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Helen Ware, the Assistant Director-General of AIDAB responsible for Asia, Africa and training coordination, was one of the four members of the team headed by Professor Ross Garnaut who drew up the consensus based recommendations for assistance to economic planning for a post-apartheid South Africa. As a member of that team, she represented AIDAB's views on assistance to South Africa. So, to the extent then that AIDAB had any input into the particular decision that was made in relation to the ANC-that particular grant of $83,000-AIDAB was, in fact, supportive of it, and it was for the policy reasons that I spelt out yesterday, which justified a departure from the policy which has been applied in the past because of the particular nature of the grant that was involved.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is simply playing with words to suggest that the Government was in breach of some rule. There had been a longstanding Government policy devised by the Government itself, implemented by the Government itself, without advice, recommendation or assistance from anyone else. To the extent that we modified that advice, it was with the active consensus of the AIDAB representative involved. So I hope that clears up that one-but I do not expect to get the same amount of press attention tomorrow.</PARA>

<PARA> The following information is supplied in answer to the Senator's question and supplements the answer I provided in the Senate yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>- Until very recently the South African Government was not prepared to agree to the appointment of an AIDAB officer in Pretoria. Thus the responsibility for monitoring AIDAB funded activities inside South Africa was the responsibility of the Embassy whose staff did not include an AIDAB officer. Following the SAG Agreement to the posting from August 1991 the newly appointed AIDAB officer will be responsible for monitoring the projects inside South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>- Projects and training in Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe have been monitored by AIDAB officers based in Harare and Nairobi missions.</PARA>
<PARA>- Of the 27 activities listed in my reply to Senator Reid on June 19:</PARA>
<PARA> * 5 are implemented by United Nations and Commonwealth agencies with auditing procedures which are already subject to widespread international scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA> * 4 involve scholarships and other activities for which AIDAB has the direct auditing responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> * The remainder are in the first instance the responsibility of Australian NGOS. AIDAB has a standard auditing procedure which applies to NGOS and imposed specific reporting and accountability responsibilities on such organisations. These were spelt out in detail in my answer to Senator Kemp's question without notice of 27 November 1990 (Hansard 4 December 1990).</PARA>
<PARA>- 9 of these activities were examined in the field by AIDAB's SAPSAN review team. Whilst this review process did not constitute a full formal audit process the team were able to visit projects, talk to scholarship holders etc and to satisfy themselves on the ground that funds had been expended for the purposes for which they had been allocated-the review team did not in their detailed report see the need to recommend follow up audits of any of the projects they examined.</PARA>
<PARA>- AIDAB also has a fraud control plan which has been recently revised and has been approved by the Attorney-General's Department. The revised fraud control plan embraces all AIDAB activities of including NGO funding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I dealt with two of the three Bills in this package yesterday. The third, which remains, is the Courts (Mediation and Arbitration) Bill 1991. I will just make a few comments putting down the Opposition's position in relation to that Bill. We are not opposing the Bill, which amends the Family Law Act and the Federal Court Act to facilitate and encourage alternative dispute resolution in those courts. Pursuant to this Bill, the courts concerned can develop mediation and arbitration programs. The precise nature of these programs and the manner in which they are conducted will be prescribed by changes to the court rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Particularly with respect to the Family Court, the introduction of mediation and arbitration proceedings is a much needed and overdue reform. The Opposition takes the view that the less adversarial mediation process is particularly appropriate to the family law jurisdiction as compared to formal litigation which is likely to be both protracted and expensive. The use of arbitration, while not necessarily having the same cost advantages as mediation, is also likely to lead to faster resolution of disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents the third aspect of the coalition's law and justice policy in relation to family law which the Government has most sensibly adopted. The first was the decision in August last year to increase funding for marriage guidance counselling services. The second was the Government's agreement to the coalition's motion to establish an inquiry into certain aspects of the operation and interpretation of the Family Law Act. Now the Government has taken up the coalition's policy that a stronger emphasis should be put on counselling, conciliation and mediation. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum states that the measures introduced by this Bill are considered to be revenue neutral because there will be a relocation of resources. We do, however, take the opportunity to make the point that if mediation and arbitration programs are to be successful it is clear that the courts will need additional resources. It is pointless for the Government to introduce new programs unless they are backed up with the necessary financial and administrative commitment. The Opposition, I mention in passing, would prefer to see greater emphasis on the use of mediation and arbitration programs that are separate from the court system. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to mediation, the amendments allow the Court to make rules to provide for the mediation of disputes. Parties may apply for mediation before litigation has commenced on the application to the Court by a parent, child or party to a marriage. Mediation will also be available after proceedings have commenced with the consent of the parties. Approved mediators are to be listed in regulations. Communications made during mediation will not be admissible. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments, in fact, provide for two types of arbitration. The first is that pursuant to proposed section 19D, the Court may make an order referring any proceedings under part VIII of the Act for arbitration. Part VIII proceedings relate to spouse or maintenance or property disputes. Court annexed arbitration may take place with or without the consent of the parties. Secondly, parties may arrange private arbitration of such disputes. The parties must consent to submit their disputes to an arbitrator. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have some concerns about the drafting of this part of the Bill. Under proposed section 19a, disputes relating to family law matters will be able to be referred to mediation prior to the commencement of any proceedings. This can be done on the application of a parent, a child or a party to a marriage, but there is no requirement that all parties must consent to such a referral. It is often said that, for a mediation to be successfully conducted, the consent of all parties is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue also arises in relation to the arbitration provision and proposed subsection 19d (2) which provides that the Family Court may refer a matter to arbitration with or without the consent of the parties. Yet it may be that a particular party will have a good reason for insisting that their dispute be dealt with by the Court rather than by an arbitrator. The problem is exacerbated by the provision that court ordered arbitrations are subject to full rights of review by way of complete re-hearing. Thus, when one party is unwilling to go to arbitration but is ordered to do so by the Court, the whole dispute becomes unnecessarily prolonged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also has concerns in relation to proposed section 19c which provides that any communications made in the course of the mediation shall be inadmissible in any court proceedings. While we agree that it is desirable for mediation to be confidential there may be some value in the system in use in other jurisdictions where communications are confidential unless the parties and the mediator agree that they should be admissible in subsequent proceedings. This is useful, for example, where a settlement agreement has been reached during mediation and it will be necessary for the terms of that agreement to be disclosed in order for it to be ascertainable and enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 of the Bill adds a reference to approved mediators or arbitrators to the definition of court personnel in section 60 of the Act. Pursuant to the Family Law Amendment Act passed earlier this year, court personnel are obliged to report any suspicions they may have of child abuse. This would presumably include any suspicion arising in the course of mediation or arbitration. However, pursuant to proposed new section 19c, mediators and arbitrators have an obligation of confidentiality. It is unclear which of the obligations would be the overriding one. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to provide for court ordered referral of existing proceedings for mediation or arbitration with the consent of the parties. This is an extension of the present situation in which arbitrators' awards can be registered. Pursuant to the changes introduced by this Bill, the court will be able to refer matters for arbitration, and awards made in court ordered arbitration will be able to be registered and enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> As was pointed out by the shadow Attorney-General during the debate on this Bill in the other place, the effectiveness of mediation and arbitration programs will very much depend on the content of the regulations and the rules of the court, which will need to fill in the many gaps in the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the unsatisfactory nature of some of the Bill's provisions, the Opposition would have considered moving amendments if time permitted. However, taking into account the circumstances of its place in the program, together with the fact that we believe that alternative dispute resolution procedures in family law are long overdue, we will not seek such amendments at this time. However, we will watch with great interest the application of this law in practice . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Control Amendment Bill 1991 amends the Export Control Act 1982 and includes offences in two areas: for falsely stating that necessary conditions have been met for export; and, for inspectors receiving goods or services from establishment owners. It also amends the section under which certificates are issued by the Government which certify the condition of the product as suitable for human consumption, so that these certificates can legally be issued even when importing countries do not require them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Export Control Act sets up a regime for the export inspection of prescribed goods and they include: meat, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy produce and grains. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure that the goods which are to be exported meet the strict requirements set out in the orders made pursuant to the regulations under the Act. These requirements are aimed at ensuring fitness for human consumption, quality, and accurate trade description of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments will also ensure that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) can repay any money overpaid, and allow for section 4B of the Crimes Act to set the monetary penalties where prison terms are provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill indicates that the Government is establishing responsibility for much of its own inspection through quality assurance programs. This is to ensure that the number of inspectors-and therefore the costs-are reduced. While there has been some improvement in a small number of establishments, the change to self-regulation seems to be moving slowly. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will be supported by the Opposition because it recognises that with self-regulation there is a need for exporters to be penalised for making false statements. There is a need for significant penalties so that standards are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does a number of things. It makes it an offence for an inspector to receive goods or services from registered establishment owners. The Bill legalises the issue of health certificates, even in cases where the importing country does not insist on them, which are often used then as an aid to trading to prove that products meet the requirements for domestic consumption. The Bill clarifies the ability to remit fees as well as collect them and removes references to monetary penalties for offences where terms of imprisonment are also provided, allowing the Crimes Act to be used to convert the term of imprisonment into a monetary penalty where the court so requires. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a major need for AQIS to be restructured to provide for its two roles, the quarantine role and the departmental responsibility for export inspection. We believe there is good reason for this. The decision of the Government in the last Federal Budget to move to 100 per cent cost recovery on export inspection has changed all the rules. Of AQIS's total budget of approximately $170m, export inspection amounts to around $132m, which is a large cost factor. The $132m in question is being paid for by producers and exporters, but they receive no accountability whatsoever for that expenditure, which is of particular significance at a time when rural incomes are extremely low. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other place the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) indicated that, to his knowledge, this system is the most expensive in the world. In some countries-as has been the case in Australia-it has been seen to be a public health responsibility, so the exporter paid nothing; or it has been seen to be of assistance to exporters and therefore there is not a requirement for them to pay. What was in the past cannot be allowed to continue into the future, but there is a great necessity to keep costs down. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being said in the industry is that it is necessary to get rid of the middle management and bureaucracy within AQIS so that it concentrates on the real aim of inspection and does it as efficiently as possible. The aim, therefore, should be for abattoirs to employ their own government qualified meat inspectors. I would expect that people already qualified, who work with the Quarantine Service, will become such inspectors. They would then be in a far better position than they are currently and they would get higher salaries than they presently earn in the Department. As a result, the abattoirs and growers will also pay reduced costs, which will undoubtedly result in our being more competitive in overseas markets, a highly desirably outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not mean the end of government inspection, which is required for many of our markets, but it would result in the export inspection section of AQIS consisting of a small group of highly qualified inspectors with the rights and responsibility to visit any abattoir at any time and randomly check both the abattoir and the work of the company inspectors. It is the Opposition's view that it is better to move as much as possible of the inspection service out of the government sector into the company self-regulated sector. This will leave AQIS with the responsibility for the overseas market requirements. It is worth repeating the example used by the honourable member for Murray in the other place, which was of particular interest to Senator Tambling, who would himself have liked to speak on this Bill. The example used by the honourable member for Murray comes from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, and I will quote from it, if I may:</PARA>
<PARA>It reports on the abattoir at Alice Springs, which slaughters 10,000 cattle a year. With a new meat inspection fee from next month, that will cost $67,154, or $6.70 per beast. As the average weight is 190 kilograms, it means an additional cost of three and a half cents per kilogram of carcass weight. </PARA>
<PARA>In the letter to the Cattle Council-</PARA>
<PARA>which was quoted-</PARA>
<PARA>the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association says that two weeks ago the meat inspector told management early in the week that he would be-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is his word, not mine-</PARA>
<PARA>crook on Friday. He presumably had worked it out in advance when he would be crook. An inspector was flown up to Alice Springs from Adelaide, stayed a few days, and then went home as the local inspector was not crook-</PARA>
<PARA>on Friday-</PARA>
<PARA>after all. All the cattlemen know is that they are paying for this. But it does not stop other costs or charges for each working inspector to cover the following: field administration at $5,432, training expenses at $101, Superannuation at 15% of base salary, $4,769, Comcare premiums at 5.4% of base salary, $1,833, leave loading at 1.5% of base salary, $477, regional office administrative expenses, $6,421, and central office administrative expenses, $5,065. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder we are finding it hard to compete in overseas markets. Australian farmers and export companies deserve and need a better and cheaper service, and it is possible. The best way to achieve this objective is to remove control from the present government structure and get it back to the companies with the overall supervision that I have referred to. This will leave the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to provide the necessary inspection for overseas requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a process is certainly not a part of this Bill but those looking at it and listening to it cannot help but be impressed by what it is offering and be thinking that it would be nice if the same standards were applied to products imported into this country. An example I am reminded of arose in the discussion during Question Time today of the gas cylinders. Gas cylinders produced in Australia are each one of them inspected for quality, but imported gas cylinders are only randomly inspected. I believe our inspection services are of a high standard and should be maintained that way, but at a cost which is not prohibitive and an inhibition to our competing in overseas markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear Senator Reid conclude on that remark, because that is the point I wish to take up. The Australian Democrats are supporting this legislation because it seeks to help guarantee the high quality of food exports in this country, something we should jealously guard. We have seen that quality damaged in the past by the export of food containing unacceptable levels of organochlorin pesticides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have also seen, as a consequence of contamination of food elsewhere-I am pointing here particularly to the Chernobyl experience-that Australian food obtained a premium following the radioactive contamination of food in Europe. The food from Australia is recognised as food which, generally speaking, is of a high quality and not subject to heavy contamination with either chemicals or radioactive materials. Indeed, one could also observe that the National Farmers Federation has come out opposing the use of radiation as a food sterilant, on the grounds that associating food with radioactive sterilisation could jeopardise the opportunities which Australia might have to sell food, or to sell it at a certain price. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in picking up the point that Senator Reid concluded on, it seems to me that the inspection services carried out in Australia with respect to exports are far more stringently applied than those applied to imports. Moreover, when imports are found to have levels of various things which are unacceptable in the Australian market, we have seen those imports nonetheless allowed onto the Australian market without Australian consumers being warned as to exactly what it is they are consuming. </PARA>
<PARA> As examples of both those situations, I point again to the situation of the Chernobyl reactor fire which resulted in heavy fallout across Europe of a number of radioactive isotopes-some short and some medium term-such as caesium 137. Following that, and in line with Australia's practice indicated by Senator Reid, shipments of food coming into Australia from those areas were not uniformly tested but only sampled. </PARA>
<PARA> As I recall the figures, and they came from the man who was actually doing the food testing at that time, in approximately the six months after Chernobyl some 18 shipments of food had come in and been tested, of which three had been found to be contaminated. But in total some 90 shipments had come in, and the remainder had not been tested. So by extension of that proportion, one might assume that there were some 15 shipments of food which came onto the Australian market, which were contaminated by radioactivity and which remained undetected because of the method of sampling and yet entered the Australian food chain. I think that is unacceptable when we seek to apply high standards with respect to the inspection of food being exported from this country. Quite clearly, we should be applying the same standards of inspection, the same requirements for food quality, as for imported food. </PARA>
<PARA> The second example in which food was tested relates to the experience early this year with the importation of seaweed from Japan. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service identified samples containing levels of cadmium and arsenic which, in relation to the Australian allowable levels, were quite unacceptable. In fact, they were very, very high indeed. In that particular case the food was nonetheless allowed onto the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> That bears very much on the issue that Senator Kernot raised yesterday in relation to the establishment of a food authority in that she successfully moved, with the support of the Opposition, an amendment which would require that standards for imported food not be reduced below the existing standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that I asked a series of questions on this matter of cadmium and arsenic. Most of the debate and the documents which were tabled centred on the issue of whether the arsenic in that food was organic or inorganic, and whether one should deal with the organic and inorganic arsenic in the same way and by the same standards. No mention was made of the fact that in many of these samples there were high levels of cadmium, which is a cumulative toxic substance which accumulates in the kidneys and which can cause hypertension and other damage. No mention was made at all as to what arguments were put to allow into this country seaweed with levels of cadmium which were above the levels which would be acceptable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I simply make the point that we support this legislation. Food should be adequately and properly inspected. There should be appropriate penalties put in the way of those who would seek to abrogate standards, who would seek, by so doing, to bring Australian food exports into disrepute. But at the same time I make a plea in relation to imports that the same stringent standards that are applied to our exports be applied to our imports. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I point out that, in relation to cadmium and exports, it is well established that some of the Australian soils are now becoming quite cadmium enriched. In the case of sheep, and specifically sheep kidneys from Western Australia, some of those would be above the allowable level in this country. That is something that would not be permitted to be exported under this sort of regime and yet, in the case of the seaweed, we allowed it to be imported, we allowed it to be introduced onto the Australian market without any warning or any identification to potential consumers that this food did not meet the existing Australian standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 seeks to amend five Acts administered within the transport and communications portfolio: the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983, the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments to the first three Acts are either consequential on other legislation or are intended to correct problems which have occurred due to drafting errors. Given the way legislation is presented under this Government to the Parliament, where there is never adequate time to discuss and debate it, it is not surprising that we have to involve ourselves for a considerable amount of time in rehashing legislation which should never have got through in the first place. I am not talking about the politics of the legislation here; I am talking about the technicalities of putting Bills into workable form so that they can become Acts for the Australian community. I do not wish to spend very much time on the matter this afternoon because we have a large number of other Bills to consider. I will abridge the usual practice of talking about the generalities of the Bill in the second reading debate and save most of my comments for the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with the first three Acts and then go to the latter two. The amendment to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 is contained in part VI of the Bill. The final Act to be amended in the Bill in the consequential category is the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act. The proposed amendment is designed to adopt for Australia three sets of amendments, dated December 1987, March 1989 and October 1989, to the annex of the 1987 protocol to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships in 1973. Other proposed amendments will increase the level of the financial penalties provided in the principal Act for various offences. These amendments are supported by the coalition. There are two main amendments which are, firstly, to provide penalties for proven pollution from ships and, secondly, to ensure that notices against the offences can be issued. </PARA>
<PARA> The latter provision is very important because it has been difficult in the past to serve notice on ship owners in some of these cases. Under this amendment, it will be possible to serve notice on a ship's agent and, through the agent, on the owner. That, of course, will not have any effect at all on an overseas ship exercising its right of passage through an international waterway, for example through the Torres Strait, where it is guaranteed free passage. But, if it is calling at an Australian port and it has an agent, there is a vehicle for the notice to be served. Obviously, it is quite important for the Parliament to protect the marine life around the Australian coastline as much as it is possible to do so in a legislative form. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of these amendments contained in the Bill relates to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority comes under scrutiny within this Bill, as there are some provisions in relation to leave and termination. The Maritime Safety Authority has been in the news in the last 12 months because of the Rockin' Robin report which, sadly, reflected unfavourably on the administration of the Department. I do not propose to go into that at this time, but at some time in the future I do propose to take the time of the Senate to go through the report, which I think had inadequacies, and to comment on the very excellent report by Mr Gruzman, in one of the recent Sydney bulletins, on the need to improve the situation. </PARA>

The real point is whether the Department has learnt and improved from the errors it has obviously made in the past. That is what we are going to consider at some future time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill seeks to amend the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. This amendment is to cover a drafting error which affected the legal entitlement, but not the actual entitlement, of superannuation benefits to Australian National Railways Commission employees who were employed by Tasmanian State railways before the transfer of the railways to the Commonwealth in 1975. The Opposition will support this move. </PARA>
<PARA> The major contentious part of the Bill before us relates to part IV, which deals with changes to the Civil Aviation Act and, to a lesser degree, changes to the Federal Airports Corporation Act. I want to hold most of my comments for the committee stage of this Bill, but I make the general observation that this is not the sort of legislation that should come before the Parliament. It is just not the way to write a Bill. It gives enormous powers to the Government. In fact, it gives all the powers that any operator or agent of the Government would want in carrying out his duty and shows very little, or no concern at all, for the individual rights of an Australian citizen. It really is a stand and deliver piece of legislation- `stand and deliver or I am going to kick the door in'. As I said earlier, there is no necessity to write legislation in that way. The Bill ought to be focused far more carefully on the needs of the Government to ensure compliance with the intent and it ought not take such wide-reaching powers unto itself to pursue its legitimate aims. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to remember that people actually implement this legislation. The Civil Aviation Authority, like all other departments, is not immune from having unsuitable people out there in the field and their agents. That is not to say that everyone is unsuitable, but if even one person in 100 or one person in 200 who has an immature personality, or an inadequate personality in some way, has support from legislation which is thoughtlessly put together to give them powers, it can be guaranteed that they will use those powers to the limit of the legislation with great social consequences-consequences that are quite disproportionate, in many cases, to the ends achieved by what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the section that deals with the Civil Aviation Authority there are some points that appear to be redundant, where clauses repeat earlier clauses. I have mentioned the attribution of excessive powers to inspectors under the Civil Aviation Act, and I very much look forward to the Minister's explanations at the committee stage. In light of those explanations, we will have to determine, as Mr Jull foreshadowed in another place when he was speaking to the second reading of this Bill, the need to amend the legislation to guarantee the basic civil rights of Australian citizens under this part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also seek some explanation on documentation in relation to manuals and such matters. I think it is a good proposition that, where responsible authorities overseas have approved the certification of aircraft and/or operating procedures and maintenance procedures, we follow them. As honourable senators will know, for many years I was campaigning for the acceptance of certification from authorities such as the American Federal Aviation Authority and the British Civil Aviation Authority. Where they certified aircraft as being suitable and meeting the standards required for regular public transport use, it was a nonsense for this country to be running duplicate inspection procedures and involving airlines in expenses of many millions of dollars in reinventing the wheel when the certification had been done very exhaustively in the country of manufacture. I am pleased that the Government has accepted that it is no longer necessary to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> An extension of the same principle is to accept that maintenance practices and procedures for aircraft, as laid down by the manufacturer, are acceptable within Australia. The only caveat I would put to that is that there has been a disproportionate impact as a consequence of product liability legislation in the United States of America, particularly in the general aviation sector, so much so that the former giants of the light aircraft field-companies such as Piper and Cessna, which manufactured hundreds if not thousands of aircraft a year-have virtually closed their single engine production lines. I can remember some years ago, in the recent past, Beechcraft being reported as saying that 25 per cent of the price of a new single engine Beechcraft aircraft, somewhere between $200,000 and $250,000 in the United States, was made up of insurance premiums for product liability. That is really a measure of the extraordinary effect of the legal profession in the United States. </PARA>

The American manufacturers Piper, Cessna, Mooney, Beech and other companies, are recommending maintenance procedures which are taken to extremes to cover themselves against any product liability charges. Instead of using `on condition', or letting some component run for five or 10 years, or 1,000 hours or 2,000 hours, they are recommending changes after a very short period, which imposes an enormous cost penalty on an operator of the particular air frame or engine. The manufacturers make no secret of the fact that it is purely to avoid product liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lest the Minister thinks I am exaggerating, I would inform him that there have been numerous actions where a manufacturer, such as Cessna or Piper, having produced an aircraft in 1950 or the early 1960s and then never having seen the aircraft again-it having been sold through maybe 10 or 20 owners and subjected to all sorts of treatment and finally being involved in a fatal accident-has had American courts award damages against it for a product that it last saw go through its factory door maybe 25 or 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> So product liability is a very serious business, and that is what has driven American maintenance procedures-in some cases, not all-to quite uneconomic lengths for a private operator. I hope that the Civil Aviation Authority in Australia will take a reasonable view of maintenance procedures with respect to general aviation aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding of the legislation as I have seen it-and I say that with caution, because every time I open the mail I get a different proposal from the CAA on airspace legislation and maintenance; it is changing the whole time and it is very hard to know where we stand on it-is that it provides for the owner of an aircraft or the operator of a fleet of aircraft to come up with a proposal of its own for approval by the Authority. That would obviate this need. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in respect of the Federal Airports Commission relate to airport security. The Minister mentions a saving of $15m if the amended provisions are implemented, and I hope we do see a saving in those operations. Like the CAA, the unfortunate thing about the FAC is that there is no brake on its expenditure. It decides what it will spend on various occasions and then tries to recover the cost from a very small taxation base. </PARA>
<PARA> While no-one would argue that security is not terribly important at the major capital city airports and the international terminals, in country areas and at secondary airports it is really a very different matter. I think the secondary airports of the capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth have got to be viewed in their own light. There are different environments in Bankstown from those at Parafield or Archerfield, for example.</PARA>
<PARA> I have a letter here from the Federal Airports Corporation, sent to me by an enraged client, which reads: `Circular to all Tenants'. This letter was promulgated in the last month. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the past few months, we have attempted to initiate a 2 man, on base, after hours Mobile Security System. To date, the response has been `lukewarm', but encouraging!!</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how there can be a lukewarm approach that is encouraging. But the next sentence is a very interesting one, because it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Airports Corporation will be persevering with the concept until `Bludgeoned to Death'. </PARA>
<PARA>The FAC is obviously closely in touch with its clients if it is volunteering that it will persevere with it until it is `bludgeoned to death'. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>In the interim, a `Security Forum' is to be held on Tuesday June 25, and the enclosure gives full details. </PARA>
<PARA>There is only a short sentence to end the letter. What is happening there is that the FAC is putting a two-man security force after dark onto an airfield where, apart from the theft of aviation gasoline from fuel tanks, there has been no theft at all and no security problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAC is going to attempt to recover the quite high cost of two people on duty in the hours of darkness in a 365-day year from a very small taxation base. What is even worse, it is going to try to recover that cost from people who have already invested tens of thousands of dollars in building hangars which have to comply with wind strength requirements of up to about 140 or 150 knots in cyclonic conditions, and they are absolutely secure against theft, short of theft committed by someone breaking in with an oxyacetylene torch. </PARA>
<PARA> If some owner invests tens of thousands of dollars in his own security by building a hangar, it is hardly reasonable to then impose a security charge on him to cover people who do not expend such sums of money and want to park their aircraft out on the grass, particularly when the problem itself is really of quite low incidence. It is sad that this reflects one of the unfortunate tendencies within the FAC, and that is to empire build. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much welcome the reduction in staff numbers that is promulgated for the Civil Aviation Authority because, compared with the figures for civil aviation authorities in other countries, the Australian figure is quite disproportionate. What I look forward to with great interest, though, is finding out where those reductions are going to take place-whether they come out of head office and people on salaries of $100,000 and $150,000 a year or out of the surveyors and people who are actually in the line trying to maintain standards. I rather suspect that the surveyors are going to come out of this worse than people in air-conditioned offices. But that is not a matter for the Bill before us today. With those few words, I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Scrutiny of Bills</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 10 of 1991 (5 June) concerning some aspects of the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which was referred to my Office for comment by Mr Argument on 6 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Monitoring warrants</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 12-proposed new section 32ad</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee questioned both the need for the warrants and also why they should be valid for one month. </PARA>
<PARA>The Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force in its second report, when noting the Civil Aviation Authority's responsibility for air navigation safety, voiced its concern over the lack of clearly defined legislative powers residing with the Authority to meet this responsibility. The amendments currently proposed to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 are an attempt to fill this perceived need. </PARA>
<PARA>Compliance with statutory safety requirements ensures that aircraft operators, by adopting required operating and maintenance practice, realise an acceptable level of safety for their aircraft. The Authority's responsibility for maintaining safe air navigation can only be achieved, however, if there is some assurance that these statutory requirements are being complied with by aircraft operators. The Authority, therefore, has an over-riding obligation to see that operators discharge their responsibilities adequately. This duty is discharged through the Authority's surveillance activities and day-to-day interaction with the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In practice, the extent of compliance with the statutory safety requirements by aircraft operators is influenced by the effectiveness of the Authority to monitor and guide the industry through its policies, guidelines and procedures, through education programs and in the power vested with the Authority to take effective remedial action when an operator is found not to be complying with legislative safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The statutory air safety requirements are numerous; a broad sample includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA>* commercial aircraft operators must have an adequate organisation, including trained staff, together with workshop and other equipment and facilities in order to ensure that airframes, engines, propellers, instruments, equipment and accessories are properly maintained at all times when they are in use;</PARA>
<PARA>* an aircraft operator must ensure that provision is made for the proper and periodic instruction of all maintenance personnel and must provide a training and checking organisation to ensure that members of the operator's operating crews maintain their competency. The training programs, the training and checking organisation and the tests and checks provided by the organisation are all subject to the approval of the Authority; and</PARA>
<PARA>* aircraft maintenance can only be undertaken by persons who are licensed by the Authority. Such maintenance can usually only be carried out in premises that have been approved as being adequate for the purpose by the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to ensure compliance with such requirements, the Authority needs to be able to carry out quality assurance audits of aircraft operators, their facilities and authorised maintenance workshops. These audits are absolutely necessary to ensure that statutory requirements are being maintained and that the Australian public thereby continues to enjoy the highest level of aviation safety. </PARA>
<PARA>Normally, aircraft operators co-operate with the auditing process voluntarily. It is essential, however, that the Authority have some mechanism whereby it can carry out an audit when an operator refuses to cooperate and denies the Authority entry to premises. Clearly, if the Authority was not allowed entry, then it would be unable to carry out its statutory function to `conduct safety regulation of civil aviation operations in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the monitoring provisions, and in particular the provisions relating to obtaining a warrant for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the Civil Aviation Act and subordinate legislation, is to enable the Authority to establish that the statutory safety requirements are being met by an aircraft operator and thereby avoiding potential air disasters. </PARA>
<PARA>The duration of one month for the warrant is not considered to be overly long owing to the considerable number of tasks and the time-consuming nature of the work associated with the auditing process. Another relevant factor is that the auditing process periodically has to be carried out at maintenance premises situated in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Abrogation of privilege against self-incrimination</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 12-proposed new section 32aj</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee notes that proposed section 32aj is drafted in a form which it has previously been prepared to accept, but has requested my advice as to the kind of information that might be sought pursuant to this provision. </PARA>
<PARA>The inclusion of such a provision into the Civil Aviation Act was also recommended by the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force in its second report. In reviewing the shortcomings in the investigative powers of the Authority, the Task Force noted that there was no obligation on persons to assist investigators or to answer their questions. The Task Force thus recommended that `subject to the protections suggested regarding self incrimination and inadmissibility of evidence, persons should be required to provide answers to authorized officers who are investigating breaches of air safety requirements'. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed section 32aj provides that a person is obliged to answer an authorised investigator's questions and produce any books, records or documents requested by the investigator. If the person objects to doing so on the grounds of self-incrimination, and the investigator informs him/her of the obligation to answer the questions/produce the material, that person cannot refuse, without reasonable excuse, to answer the questions/produce the material, but the answer/material is essentially not admissible in proceedings against him/her. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a power is appropriate for Authority investigators and is a provision commonly found in other legislation. For example, Bureau of Air Safety Investigation investigators have similar powers provided to them under the Air Navigation Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>The information which would be sought by investigators pursuant to this provision would relate to the maintenance and operation of aircraft. Such data, obtained from, for example, maintenance schedules, work sheets and oral statements from pilots and aircraft personnel, would be used by investigators to establish whether the appropriate maintenance has been carried out on an aircraft, whether maintenance operations were performed in a suitable manner, whether proper checks were carried out on an aircraft at the required times, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>Unequivocal access to all information relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft is an essential part of the surveillance and enforcement function of the Authority. It is, therefore, fundamental to the fulfilment of the Authority's statutory functions that persons be required to answer questions and produce documents relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft. The Authority would, otherwise, be hampered in the performance of its quality assurance audit and investigative roles to the detriment of air navigation safety in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Adoption of extrinsic material by regulation</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 15-proposed new subsection 98(3a)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, whilst acknowledging that this provision will allow Australia to meet its international obligations in relation to the safety of air navigation, expressed concern that it would allow matter to be incorporated into regulations without being subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>The necessity for this amendment stems from recent advice received from the Attorney-General's Department that section 49a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 effectively prevents the Authority from requiring operators to comply with amendments to, amongst other similar technical documents, flight and operation manuals. The Civil Aviation Regulations currently empower the Authority to make necessary alterations to flight manuals, etc. and for persons to comply with such alterations. </PARA>
<PARA>The flight manual is a basic technical, operational document required for all aircraft. It is also one of the Authority's primary regulatory tools and alterations to it are often required directly as the result of the discovery of defects in an aircraft affecting its safe operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The manuals, being technical documents, are administrative rather than legislative in nature. Any alterations required to be made to them are generally changes to mechanical or operational requirements involving a high level of technical complexity. </PARA>
<PARA>Once alterations are made to these documents, the Authority notifies all relevant aircraft operators of the changes. This it generally does either by directly notifying operators and sending them a copy of the alteration or, when a broad class of aircraft is affected, through issuing a Civil Aviation Order setting out the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, alterations to these documents are the means by which the Authority provides the most up-to-the-minute safety requirements for aircraft. The only practical mechanism to maintain Australia's foremost safety standards is via a mechanism which provides that amendments to the manuals have force of law once they are adopted. That is, via the mechanism proposed by new subsection 98(3a). </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority (and previously, my Department) has been requiring aircraft operators and pilots to comply with flight and operation manuals (and subsequent amendments to such manuals) since the commencement of the regulation of air navigation in Australia in the 1920s. This is also standard practice in all leading overseas aviation countries and is well understood and accepted by the aviation industry. As a contracting state to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Australia has an international obligation to provide for such manuals under Annexes 6 and 8 to the Convention. It is essential that there be no legal doubt about the Authority's power in this area. The purpose of this proposed amendment is to put beyond doubt the Authority's power to require aircraft operators to comply with amendments to technical aircraft manuals, such as flight manuals, in order to ensure that Australia continues to meet its international obligations in relation to the safety of air navigation. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust these comments satisfactorily address the Committee's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not need to proceed with my amendment dealing with the issue raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, clause 15, proposed new subsection 98 (3a).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having made those comments about the first few Bills, I want to indicate that the Democrats are not comfortable though with the amendments to the Federal Airports Corporation Act, specifically the provision to rationalise the responsibilities for airport security by making airport operators, including the Federal Airports Corporation, responsible for the counterterrorist presence, overall access control and security of the air side areas of airports. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mean to be a worrywart; I just want to place on the record some of my concerns. It is a little worrying to me, based on observation of similar rationalisations overseas, that we have profit oriented commercial airport operators with a main duty to shareholders. They are now responsible for the safety of the travelling public within one-ninth of the world's airspace. We fear that Australia's safety record does not provide incentive to commercial concerns to offer the highest possible standard of security and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, this is an area where our unblemished record could act as a sort of disincentive in that a commercial operation might be able in the first few years to cut corners or perform to minimum standards without noticeable difference until something serious happens. I think it is true, and the Minister might like to comment on this, that in the United States, maybe not constantly but often, airport operators are fined for not taking adequate security measures. Often, the choice between paying the fine and providing high standards of security is an easy one. It is easier to pay the fine than to pay the increased costs-especially if that country has no history of terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA> An investigation into the Lockerbie tragedy revealed that it may have been prevented if security measures had been adequately maintained and the company had not been cutting corners to save costs. Security is always `adequate' until it is breached or until something serious happens and we have another look at it. Our international marketing edge is that Australia is a safe haven, with its second to none air safety and security record. Tourists are known to shun countries where there is danger. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want Australia to risk losing that image or tourists on the grounds of cost discipline, as pointed out in the Bill's explanatory memorandum. I do not want us to pay a high price in another form for this cost efficiency. When it comes down to the question of security, I ask: what constitutes a minimum standard as outlined in the second reading speech of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in the other place? The standard we have now exists because of the achievement of the whole community. I intend to ask for more details on this in the committee stage. </PARA>

However, I would like to comment on Senator MacGibbon's reference to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and the Rockin Robin incident and to what he referred to as `the excellent report' by Mr Gruzman in the Bulletin about that incident; although he then went on to make what I thought was rather a strange statement. In respect of that `excellent report', he went on to say that whether it was right or wrong was neither here nor there. I do not think he can have it both ways.

<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to take this opportunity to respond to an article (Bulletin, June 11) written by Laurence Gruzman Q.C. concerning the search for the yacht Rockin Robin 8-11 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gruzman's article is a major distortion of the facts. Not only does he misrepresent what happened he also indulges in pure conjecture as to the fate of the missing men in a way which is completely contrary to eye witness accounts. He further asserts that ``nobody is interested and nobody will be interested until the next tragedy occurs'' and also ``we have learned a few things, but in many respects it is unfortunately business as before''. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>All those involved in search and rescue operations care deeply about any loss of life and are committed to improving systems, procedures and equipment. Often, as was the case in this tragic incident aircraft crews put their own lives at risk whilst attempting to save others. </PARA>
<PARA>It is perhaps worth recounting the actual facts of the Rockin Robin incident as detailed in the report of the official investigation and what has been done since. </PARA>
<PARA>The weather conditions on 8 June 1990 at the scene of the distress were very severe. Early in the afternoon the pilot of the RAAF Orion aircraft reported zero forward visibility, cloud base down to 100 metres, with hurricane force winds of 65 knots and wave heights in excess of 14 metres. </PARA>
<PARA>The RAAF aircrew, far from being inaccurate with the drop as Mr Gruzman asserts, displayed considerable skill in deploying the two life-raft Air Sea Rescue Kit in the correct position relative to the target. This was made more difficult by the severe weather conditions, and because the yacht was still sailing across the wind at approximately six knots. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite instructions to remain with the yacht, the crew chose, prematurely, to abandon it and take to one of the life-rafts which had been dropped. Reports and photographs indicate that the yacht was still afloat some two hours after the abandonment and even then apparently not in a sinking condition. </PARA>
<PARA>The multi-unit Air Sea Rescue Kit dropped to the yacht was of a type that has been in service for many years and has proven to be extremely successful both in Australia and world wide. In the extreme weather conditions, the multi-unit kit had a far better chance of success than the single unit kit proposed by Mr Gruzman. </PARA>
<PARA>At 1015 on 8 June, some two hours after the abandonment the French military aircraft overhead, was about to drop a radio and another life-raft to the yacht's crew but was unable to, due to the severity of the weather and sea conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to fully understand what happened on the 8 June it is necessary to be aware of the eye witness accounts provided by the pilots of the various search aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>We know from pilots' reports that the occupied life-raft was observed to overturn on at least two occasions, spilling all four persons into the sea. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the second occasion on which the life-raft overturned one person was seen on the raft trying to right it, the three others were in the sea holding onto the life-raft sides. Aircraft continuously flew above and at 1343 only one person could be seen lying across a badly deflated life-raft reportedly in a sinking condition. This was the last definitive sighting. Taking into consideration the severe weather conditions, the heavy balance of probabilities suggests that the three were unable to regain the liferaft and succumbed in the water. Survival time would not have been long. </PARA>
<PARA>Aircrew observing the tragic scene knew at the time that in the prevailing conditions there was little hope for the person lying across the raft and that they were powerless to assist. It has to be assumed that this liferaft soon deflated to the extent that it no longer could provide adequate support. </PARA>
<PARA>Given all of the above, Mr Gruzman's assertion in the article that the crew lived in the life-raft for a further two weeks can only be described as fanciful. It is highly unlikely that the crew managed to get back into the life-raft. Continuing searches for the life-raft failed to locate it. The search did, however, locate the other unoccupied life-raft, which provided a clear datum for the continuing search. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gruzman's conclusions in the section of the article headed `Why did it happen?' are particularly suspect. His analysis is not supported by the evidence. To suggest that the RAAF, who first located the Rockin Robin in hazardous conditions, were primarily responsible for the loss of the men in dropping a life-raft with no means of communication, no EPIRB, no food, water or signalling equipment is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the loss of the yacht, I directed that the Department of Transport and Communications undertake an investigation into the search and rescue aspects of the incident. </PARA>
<PARA>The comprehensive investigation report highlighted some deficiencies in search and rescue procedures. It concluded, however, that those deficiencies had no effect on the outcome of that particular incident. I tabled the report of the investigation in the Senate on 18 October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>All nine recommendations made in the report have now been implemented. There are new procedures for passing information, several droppable pumps have been purchased and strategically placed round Australia. The Civil Aviation Authority has ordered 200 radio beacons for installation into life-rafts as well as twenty life-rafts with increased stability and which are already fitted with radio beacons. In short, there have been significant changes since this incident occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The incident was tragic, as is any incident involving loss of life. However, I am satisfied that everything possible was done to rescue the four persons from the situation they found themselves in. I am also satisfied there has been significant improvements in systems and procedures, and search and rescue equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gruzman's article is misleading and inaccurate. It contributed little to improving search and rescue operations and it very likely caused further anguish to the relatives of the Rockin Robin crew. I again extend my sympathy to them. </PARA>
<PARA>(Bob Collins)</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like also to touch briefly on some comments Senator MacGibbon made in respect of the amendments empowering civil aviation inspectors in the performance of their duties, which he referred to as stand and deliver legislation. It is not at all. I am quite happy to expand on it again briefly in the committee stage. The wording of this legislation is wording with which I am very familiar. These are standard provisions that occur not just in numerous Acts of parliament-I am happy to give a brief resume-but in the Acts of all State and Territory legislatures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first got this clarified-I must say this was for the protection of the operator, not the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)-in relation to what had to be done so that people would not be able to bang down doors, as has been alleged, I asked whether the standard provision empowering people to look for things and seize them was there, and it was. So this is very familiar legislation indeed. We will find it not in dozens but in scores of Acts of parliaments around Australia; not just in the Federal legislature but in State and Territory legislatures as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon said, in respect of the changes that are being made within the CAA, that `I get a different proposal from CAA every time I open my mail.' I can understand the very legitimate concern of people in the aviation industry, such as Senator MacGibbon, with these changes; but I point out the reason for them. I am sure he would acknowledge that this is correct. I am pleased that this is what is happening because the changes are a result of positive responses the organisation is making to representations it is getting on these proposals from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the air space management proposals, it is a matter of fact that the CAA has agreed, I am pleased to say because of my own concerns about the original proposals, with the changes brought about as a direct result of a very successful input by pilots and pilot organisations around Australia as to the concerns they had about the original proposals. I also thank Senator MacGibbon for the positive statements he made about the difficult changes that are being accomplished currently in the CAA. In response to Senator MacGibbon's inquiry as to where the cuts are coming from, the CAA has prepared a resource document which gives detailed information-it is an inch thick-on precisely where the cuts are coming from. On a confidential basis, because it is a matter that is being currently negotiated, as I am sure Senator MacGibbon is aware, with the staff and the unions, I would be perfectly happy to allow Senator MacGibbon to scrutinise that document so that he can see, down to the last individual, precisely where those cuts are proposed to take place. So he can have access to that document. </PARA>
<PARA> I also thank Senator Kernot for the support she gave to what are positive amendments in respect of pollution control. She raised the question of security and expressed concerns, which I think I can put to rest substantially, about these minimum requirements that are going to be laid down. They will be laid down in the form of regulation and, because of that, they will be subject to the scrutiny of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot said, quite rightly, that security is a worry and a concern for everyone, and overseas there have been some well-publicised breaches of airport security. She did make the point that she was concerned that privately run security is a difficulty because of the fact that companies tend to be more worried about responsibilities to their shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC)-and this has been a matter of deliberate policy of the Government; the Opposition does differ from us to some extent in this area-I would point out what Senator Kernot knows to be the case, and that is that in this case the only shareholder is the Government. Might I say to Senator Kernot that the fact that the senior Minister in this portfolio, Mr Beazley, despite the fact that I am responsible for the FAC, has deliberately retained the area of airport security, is an indication of just how important the Government does take this question. I do not want to delay the Senate any longer, bearing in mind what we have in front of us. I once again thank the two senators who spoke in this debate for the contribution that they made and for their support for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The officers concerned in these investigations have to be duly authorised officers of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). It is, indeed, the Authority that, in the first instance, determines the qualifications of these officers. Of course, for obvious reasons it does not appoint to these positions people who are not suitably qualified. For the advice of Senator MacGibbon, might I say that with the exception of one officer who, of course, is competent in his area, all of the officers that are authorised by the Civil Aviation Authority to carry out these roles are in the main either former officers of either State or Federal police forces or have been fully trained in police procedures in terms of investigation and prosecution.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. That is not the case. I am simply pointing out to Senator MacGibbon that they are investigating breaches of civil aviation regulations and, therefore, they are expert in the aviation field. But they have an additional role and that additional role requires them to act on behalf of the Authority. I have no doubt that Senator MacGibbon would be the first one to support that there is very little point at all in having regulations if there is not some effective way of policing them to ensure that, for the safety of others in the air, operators comply with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These people are expert in the areas that they have to implement. But it is as unnecessary in this legislation to spell out the qualifications of inspectors as it would be in a police Act to spell out the personal qualifications for officers who act as police officers with the same powers. I just said that the Authority looks for people who do have skills in investigation, because those investigations could, of course, lead to subsequent court action and prosecution. People have to be particularly trained in that. But, of course, fundamentally they are people who are expert in ensuring that the CAA's regulations are policed properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from that that the Authority therefore has a list of approved personnel who can be investigators. It may not be a public list but it is within the Authority's own administrative procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will move on to my next question. Why is a fine of only $100 imposed on a member or a former member of the Authority who presents as an inspector when he no longer has the right to do so conferred on him by the Authority? This society takes very strong exception to misrepresentation. If con men get before the courts, they are rather heavily dealt with. The courts take a particularly dim view of someone who presents himself as a policeman but is not a policeman. </PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of a fine of only $100, which in today's devalued currency is really just pin money-a night out on the town or something like that-is quite disproportionate compared with the $3,000 fine which is imposed on ordinary citizens under later clauses of the Bill. This really leads to the assumption that the drafters of this Bill have a them-and-us mentality. Members of the CAA will just be tapped lightly across the wrist if they commit what I think is rather a serious breach of conduct by presenting themselves as an inspector or an investigator when they are not. Yet, under a provision later on in the Bill, if a person refuses to answer a question, he will be down the tube for $3,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frankly, I think Senator MacGibbon's point is well taken.

I am sure that Senator MacGibbon would agree with this suggestion: rather than amend this on the run, as it were, in here now-I would like to refer to other Acts where perhaps similar penalties do apply; perhaps they could also be looked at-could I give Senator MacGibbon an undertaking in committee now that we will examine the level of that penalty, which I do not think is sufficient; that, in consultation with Senator MacGibbon, we will re-examine for potential future amendment an increase in that penalty. </PARA>

We could have provided for one section, allowing an inspector to come into a premises and do what he liked if he had reasonable grounds for thinking an actual offence had taken place. We could have taken what would be a first step, and indeed a step that is exercised and must be exercised more often than the second step, of simply ensuring that an operator, where some concern exists, is complying with the regulation. But, for the protection of the operator, we wanted to lay out very clearly that that first step involved a very specific role, a far less intrusive role, of simply gaining access to monitor whether the operator had in fact committed an offence rather than simply move to assuming that the operator had. The reason they have been deliberately separated is in fact for the protection of the operator in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is because of the very specific difference between the provisions of a monitoring warrant and a warrant relating to an offence. Again, this relates to protection of the operator. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) may have some concern that an operator is not complying. Senator MacGibbon would be well aware of how those concerns can arise quite often, and I am well aware of this through the work done by my office. Sometimes complaints can come from passengers. Sometimes they ring up and describe what happened on a particular flight and raise their concerns. In 99 per cent of the cases that are brought to me, and this occurs regularly, we find out that the concerned passenger might have had a bit of a fright, that something might have happened but they have no real cause for concern. That is how these things come about. That would apply to a particular prescribed premises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the CAA wanted to monitor the operations of an organisation, which would involve some degree of time to do, hopefully in as unobtrusive a way as possible, it is reasonable to require that it relate not just to particular premises but to particular prescribed premises. They must be nailed down exactly. It cannot simply be a general aviation operator. The actual address of the person has to be nailed right down. In the case of an offence being committed, it could well be that it might apply to a general class of operators; in other words, particular premises, where a number of operators might be involved in the matter and where there would be no requirement to actually prescribe each individual address of the operators. Once again, in the case of the monitoring warrants, it is simply an additional built-in protection for the operator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct, and that is why it is spelt out. Can I say, from personal experience in the Northern Territory, that magistrates, and indeed in some cases Supreme Courts, on occasions have been scathing in their criticism of these warrants being executed where officers have not complied with provisions like this. The reason why this has been stated quite specifically is that that is the requirement placed on the officer when applying for the warrant. In other words, the onus is on the operator and he has to actually satisfy the magistrate as to when the intrusion into a person's premises will occur. That has to be stated on the warrant. It is there to provide an additional protection for the operator. If it is a monitoring warrant, for example, relating to a company whose operations are normally conducted during daylight hours and very rarely at night, a magistrate may well say that it is not convenient or reasonable to go in at 2 o'clock in the morning. If that is stated clearly on the warrant but the officers go in outside the hours stipulated that would almost inevitably render any prosecution ineffective. Again, it is a protection for the operator.</PARA></TALK.START>

The answer to Senator MacGibbon's question is, technically, no. Such a requirement would in fact defeat the purpose of the exercise. What is clearly laid out in proper form in the Act is that a prior step must be taken before seeking a warrant. What the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) would do, under proposed new section 32ac, if it wished to monitor the operations of an organisation, would be to approach the operator and ask, by consent, for that operation to be carried out. It would only be where an operator refused to give that consent that the CAA would have to go to the next step of applying for a warrant. Of course, through the absolutely explicit advice to the operator, by that stage the operator would be well aware of what the next step would be if the operator refused to give the CAA access to the operation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator MacGibbon's question, I would point out that these are very standard provisions indeed. The legislative provision calling for reasonable force probably has as much case law attached to it as anything one finds in legislation. It is a very well known provision to which courts routinely apply themselves. The word `reasonable' in that case, I assure Senator MacGibbon, has been tested on many occasions before Australian courts. Indeed, it is the magistrate or judge on each occasion who would determine what reasonable force is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The picture painted by Senator MacGibbon is extreme. I am not suggesting that it could never occur, but it would occur so infrequently that it is not the norm. The other persons who could well be required to attend would in the majority of cases most likely be police officers in whichever jurisdiction the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was operating at that time. I assure Senator MacGibbon that there is a very onerous requirement on officers of the law when executing these warrants to prove that the onus is on them and that whatever they do is reasonable in the circumstances. If they failed to do that, courts here have consistently dealt with those departments that exercise unreasonable behaviour with the standard provisions in a very direct way. What normally happens in such cases, apart from anything else, is that the prosecutions fail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter for the normal provisions of the law. It would depend entirely on the circumstances of each case as to whether a person could sue for damages. All I am saying is that these are absolutely standard provisions which Senator MacGibbon will find in hundreds of Acts of Parliament in the Federal, State and Territory jurisdictions. The requirements as to reasonable force contained in these Acts apply to Acts all over Australia, and there are some peculiar requirements indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall one very well that occurred in Queensland under the Bjelke-Petersen Government relating to cattle inspectors and inspections for artificial insemination. Substantial amounts of money are involved in the property-in other words, in the bull's semen-which is extremely expensive. I recall the provisions of that Act because the wording is quite strange. The words are to the effect that at any time of the day or night in Queensland-the provision still exists-an inspector can knock on the door at two o'clock in the morning and demand production of the animal's semen at the inspector's request. That is what the Act says. I can assure Senator MacGibbon that these are standard provisions. Certainly the provisions of 32ae are very familiar, under which an inspector can `enter the premises, search the premises for the thing, and, if the thing is found, seize it'. I am sure that it would be very disconcerting if a thing were seized at two o'clock in the morning under this Act or any other. These are standard provisions and, if inspectors under all these myriad Acts exercise these powers unreasonably, those matters are dealt with very firmly indeed by the courts. </PARA>

The difficulty for us is that we find we are in a position where we are getting more and more intrusive legislation. I do not doubt that there are hundreds of Acts on the statute book, but we are in a position that every time a piece of legislation comes before the Senate the Minister presenting it says, `There is a precedent here, the Senate agreed to it without comment in this or that Bill, so why cannot you pass the clause in this Bill?'.

They are there to protect the rights of the individuals who fly in aircraft and who share airspace with other individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon is aware that the majority of the industry is honest and competent. The difficulty is that there are sections of the industry that are dishonest and incompetent. Again, in the Northern Territory one very well known case involved a major commuter operator carrying thousands of innocent people, such as myself, in light aircraft every week. That operator was caught out not so long ago in the Northern Territory in having a stack of pre-signed engineering clearances for its aircraft. It was outrageous. It was only through the diligence of the CAA that it was found out. There was a drawerful of pre-signed engineering checks which meant that the aircraft could continue to fly with no maintenance and no checks at all, simply by filling in the blank spaces that a company engineer had been happy enough to put his name to in advance to keep the aircraft in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to strike a balance between the rights of the individuals who operate in those circumstances and the rights of the poor innocents who pay for the seats in the aircraft. I notice Senator Bjelke-Petersen nodding in assent. No doubt she has been in light aircraft as often as I have. It is a fact that the majority of operators are honest, but the legislation is useless if it has no powers to require operators in the industry which often carry fare paying passengers to comply with regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actual 60-day period is a standard provision that would apply. These provisions are not just included by rote because they are standard provisions. They become standard provisions because, by experience, both the courts and the organisations that are required to implement this legislation find that this period is the optimum period necessary both for the purposes of collecting the evidence and conducting successful prosecutions, and balancing the rights of the individuals that own that evidence as to how long it can be kept. The 60 days is a standard provision found in other Acts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Proposed new section 32ah (2) (a) (ii) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>a thing that will afford evidence of the commission of another offence against this Act or the regulations... </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very wide-ranging power granted to the investigator. It virtually enables him to do a fishing expedition to see whether any offence has been committed in the past or might even be committed in the future. Given the fact that the warrant is issued on the basis of a specific purpose, namely that an offence has been committed or is suspected to have been committed, would the Minister justify the inclusion of those very wide powers?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, these are standard provisions and, frankly, sensible provisions that apply in other Acts. If a Civil Aviation Authority operator entered the premises of an aircraft operator that was carrying out a suspect operation-and usually that involves cutting corners on maintenance or flying pilots far beyond their proper hours of safe flying, and so on-and found in the course of that investigation evidence indicating that some other serious offence had been committed and was prevented by the legislation or by any specific provision to take that evidence, naturally the operator would have to cop the penalty for the offence for which the operator entered in the first place but would take the first opportunity to dump whatever else was lying around the place that indicated perhaps other and even more serious offences existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an extremely sensitive industry in terms of safety and these requirements have to be introduced. If there is a problem with a bus or a car that does not involve running head first into another bus or car-that is, a mechanical problem because of failure of maintenance-the usual penalty is that the driver gets stuck between here and a service station and has to get out and walk. It is a bit hard to do that at 10,000 feet. With respect to the private pilots about whom Senator MacGibbon is talking, the difficulty with applying one set of measures to regular public transport commuter services and another set to private pilots is that private pilots share the same airspace as everyone else. If their aircraft are poorly maintained, they fall down on top of someone else with the same catastrophic results as a commercial operator. In other words, the same stringent requirements on maintenance and competence should apply to both private pilots and commercial operators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to argue that case by moving into the motor field where we kill probably 3,000 a year or something-the magnitude beyond what we ever kill in the air. Referring now to proposed new section 32aj, subsection (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . under a warrant under this Part may require anyone on or in the premises to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems quite extraordinary to me that an innocent bystander could literally be on the premises and be required by an investigator to produce evidence which may be used against him. I do not see why there should not be a restriction stating, `may require any relevant person'-the owner, the operator, an employee, or someone who is germane to the investigation-and that it not be as wide as presently provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The other difficulty I have with proposed new section 32aj relates to the fact that people are required to answer questions under pain of a penalty of $3,000. Again, there is no definition of what they are to say. It just says they are required to answer questions. Could they be untruthful, for example? Could they just say, `It is a nice day.'? If they were asked, `Were you here on Tuesday?', could they say, `No, I am here on Wednesday.'? I find it extraordinary that it is so tight in one dimension and so loose in another. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we get to the fact that the evidence cannot be used in criminal proceedings. I can see that there might be a way of getting evidence that leads to further investigations but, by and large, it seems to inhibit the value of asking the questions by providing in the Bill that the evidence cannot be used. When I say that, I am also bound to say that it is part of our legal system that people cannot be forced to incriminate themselves by inquiry without the protection of a lawyer and all that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to tie up this area, what is a criminal offence? Is a criminal offence a breach of a civil aviation order or a civil aviation regulation, or will people be able to be grilled on their compliance with CAOs and CARs and then go to court, where they are interrogated without the right of legal defence, or will that be classified as a criminal activity?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are always entitled to legal defence in our courts. Referring to proposed new section 32aj (2), again, these are standard and sensible requirements. It is not reasonable for an inspector going into premises investigating a breach of an Act and, on finding people there, to have to grill people as he necessarily would have to do to identify who they were before he asked questions. There is a qualifier, and a good one, in proposed new subsection (2):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A person must not, without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with a requirement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If I were standing in the hangar of Arnhem Air Charter in Darwin, waiting to board a chartered aircraft-and I often do stand in the hangar and talk to the mechanics-and an inspector came through the doorway, he would not necessarily know who was who, so he must ask people questions. If that inspector said to me, `Can I ask you to produce your maintenance records?' and I said, `Sorry, but I am simply a passenger, just waiting to get on a plane', the obvious result would be that the inspector would say, `Fine, I am looking for the engineer'. Clearly, under those circumstances, that is a reasonable excuse not to answer questions about maintenance. What I am saying with respect to this and every other issue raised by Senator MacGibbon is that these are reasonable and sensible provisions found in all legislation of a similar nature. The courts are quite comfortable with the provisions that apply in legislation such as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These manuals are in fact vitally important, and they do have the force of law and must be kept in accordance with the regulations requiring their upkeep. For obvious reasons, systems and maintenance manuals are official records that indicate whether or not the operator is complying with the standards required for the safe operation of an aircraft. If an operator cannot be required to comply with the correct keeping of these manuals, the entire system of checking as to whether or not an operator is doing so falls down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the absolute work face, if you like, of the implementation of the proper policing of this Act. Operators are required by force of law to keep these manuals in accordance with the way in which the CAA requires people to keep them, and they will be prosecuted if they do not. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to inform you of the distress caused to myself, my family and the community organisations I represent, by the allegations made by Senator Calvert on the evening of June 5th 1991 in the Senate (Hansard 4440) about the impending closure of the Electrona silicon smelter. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only has my reputation as an active community representative and political candidate concerned with social justice been jeopardised, but our family's sleep has been interrupted by unpleasant telephone calls after midnight. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make it quite clear that I, as a representative of a combined community group of several long-standing residents' associations in the Kingborough area, am in no way pleased that sixty-four people are soon to lose their jobs from the silicon smelter at Electrona. </PARA>
<PARA>In the interests of natural justice we continued to campaign, not to close the smelter down, but to insist upon it operating properly. At the very least the workers were provided with respirators as a result of our representations to the Minister for Mines. </PARA>
<PARA>The impending closure of the Electrona silicon smelter has nothing whatsoever to do with our campaign to have two multinationals and our government keep to their word. It is closing solely because of international silicon markets and because this particular smelter was never viable from the beginning. </PARA>

<PARA> The Senate delegation to Perth consisted of myself, as Chairman of the Committee; Senator Bishop, who was Deputy Chairman; Senator Colston, a former Chairman; Senator Patterson, a member of the Committee and a former Deputy Chairman of the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills; and Senator Cooney, Chairman of the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and Deputy Chairman of the Committee. The delegation was accompanied by the Committee's independent legal adviser, emeritus professor, Douglas Whalan, and the Committee secretary. </PARA>
<PARA> Delegations attended from all States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, New Zealand and Kiribati. The delegation from New South Wales consisted of officials rather than parliamentarians owing to the State election. There was a similar situation at the Canberra conference in 1989 when Tasmanian parliamentarians could not attend owing to a State election. There was also an impressive group of official observers, including 17 Parliamentary Counsel officials from five separate jurisdictions, officials from the Administrative Review Council, the peak Commonwealth advisory body on administrative law, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, private solicitors, academics and State government officials. In all there were 52 delegates and their staff, and 34 observers. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference was opened by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly with an opening address by the Chief Justice of Western Australia. The President of the Legislative Council closed the conference. The Senate delegation took an active part in the proceedings. Both Senator Bishop and I presented papers and Senator Bishop chaired a session and reported on a workshop. Senator Colston chaired the first session of the conference after the opening, which was the important report by delegations on the resolutions of the previous conference. I was told of the excellent impression created by the Deputy President of the Senate attending the conference and chairing this key session. Members of the delegation attended and spoke at all sessions. At the conclusion of the conference two of the five resolutions accepted were proposed by the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> Several themes ran through the conference proceedings. One related to the increasing use of quasi-legislation. There was general concern about legislative instruments authorised by Acts but not made subject to tabling and disallowance. Such instruments are no less legislation than Acts or regulations, although generally referred to as quasi-legislation. The other form of quasi-legislation is the multitude of departmental manuals and policy guidelines which officials treat as binding in their dealings with the public. This type of quasi-legislation was the subject of my paper to the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major theme was the relationship between legislative scrutiny committees and the Executive. In particular, delegates emphasised that committee operations should continue to be non-partisan, avoiding party political controversy. This relationship was dealt with by Senator Bishop in her paper. A third theme was publicity for delegated legislation proposals, with opportunities for public comment and input into the process through which the Executive makes laws. There was much discussion of the regulatory impact statements required in Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> A fourth major theme was that delegated legislation committees cannot operate effectively without the support of a Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Senate is one of the minority of Australian legislatures which has such a committee, and the conference was fortunate to have Senator Cooney and Senator Patterson available to discuss its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The forthcoming Administrative Review Council (ARC) report on rule making was mentioned during a number of sessions. The ARC preliminary proposals have already been released and, if adopted, will address many important deficiencies in delegated legislation. The proposals are that all legislative instruments be restricted to suitable subject matter and be subject to tabling and disallowance, drafted by professional drafters after public consultation and input and included in a single series. This would solve many present problems relating to quasi-legislation and to public access and presentation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary of conference proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA>THE THIRD CONFERENCE OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATED LEGISLATION COMMITTEES</PARA>
<PARA>PERTH, 21-23 MAY</PARA>
<PARA>Summary of Proceedings</PARA>
<PARA>Tuesday, 21 May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Opening of Conference</PARA>
<PARA>Michael Barnett, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker emphasised the value of the parliament to parliament contacts encouraged by conferences such as this one. Previously, governments have been more active than parliaments in setting up structures to make cooperation easier. For this reason, conferences such as the present one are welcome. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliaments are now showing greater interest than ever before in delegated legislation. There is a resurgence of support for parliaments which are more independent of government. The scrutiny by parliament of government law-making is a part of this process. </PARA>
<PARA>The limitations, if any, on the powers of parliament to delegate the power to legislate</PARA>
<PARA>David Malcolm, Chief Justice of Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>The Chief Justice said that parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation asserted the supremacy of parliament over the executive. This upholds the principles upon which Commonwealth and State constitutions are based and contributes substantially to the maintenance of the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA>In Britain it is said that parliament is supreme and omnipotent. If this is so, it seems that parliament may delegate all of its powers to legislate. However, this is not the case at the federal level in Australia. The Parliament of the Commonwealth cannot abdicate its powers of legislation so that a law-making body is set up in substitution for parliament. Nevertheless, parliament may authorise subordinate legislation in the widest and most general terms. </PARA>
<PARA>State parliaments, in contrast to the Commonwealth are supreme within the limits of their constitution. Therefore, it is strongly arguable that a State parliament could delegate the whole of its legislative competence. </PARA>
<PARA>In any event, the delegated power remains subject to the scrutiny of parliament. Delegation can always be terminated or recalled. Experience has shown the necessity for wide criteria for such parliamentary control. </PARA>
<PARA>Report on resolutions from the Second Conference</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mal Colston</PARA>
<PARA>The resolutions were as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> ``That at the Third Conference, all Committees will report, verbally or in writing on:-</PARA>
<PARA> a. the nature, the extent and the implications for Delegated Legislation Committees of the proliferation, within the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, of legislative and quasi-legislative instruments which are either:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) not subject to parliamentary scrutiny and control, or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) whether so subject or not, represent a developing trend in delegated law-making by virtue of their origins, content, presentation or otherwise;</PARA>
<PARA> b. the extent to which the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories have been able to monitor and scrutinise and where necessary improve by amendment provisions in Bills which confer delegated law-making powers; and</PARA>
<PARA> c. the progress of staged repeal of delegated legislation (where this occurs) and the problems this may have produced for scrutiny committees and their responses to it.''</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston called on the delegations. </PARA>
<PARA>There was general agreement that quasi-legislation in the form of legislative instruments not subject to parliamentary scrutiny presented a problem for legislative scrutiny committees. In one jurisdiction there were more legislative instruments outside the scrutiny of the committee than within it. It was necessary that delegated legislation committees have the power to scrutinise such instruments and if necessary to recommend disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA>A committee for the scrutiny of bills should exist as a complement to each delegated legislation committee. Without such a committee scrutiny of delegated legislation was incomplete. In some jurisdictions the same committee carried out both functions. Although at present only a minority of jurisdictions has a scrutiny of bills committee, most are in the process of establishing one or have recommended such establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>Most jurisdictions now have some form of automatic expiry of delegated legislation, ranging from five through seven to 10 years. The concept of such staged repeal was supported. </PARA>
<PARA>Regulatory review: a catalyst for broader legislative reform</PARA>
<PARA>Greg Hogg, an official of the Regulation Review Committee, NSW</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Subordinate Legislation Act 1989 provides for staged repeal of delegated legislation and for mandatory public consultation and a regulatory impact statement (RIS) for the more important statutory rules. The purpose of RIS is to oblige departments to justify new regulations. Departments must actively inform and consult interested groups and take account of their comments. Departments must produce a cost benefit analysis of each proposal. Unfortunately there is no comparative RIS procedure for Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>The first RIS were defective, but are now better, although there is still apparent reluctance to give dollar values for costs and benefits. Some RIS had been rejected for these reasons. Preparation of RIS should not be an additional task for departments, which should have addressed such issues as costs and benefits as part of their routine procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of prorogation on committees</PARA>
<PARA>Hugh Hiscutt, Subordinate Legislation Committee, Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA>Legislative scrutiny could be effected best in parliaments such as the Commonwealth, where prorogations were infrequent. On the other hand, in parliaments such as Western Australia and Tasmania, where prorogations occurred each year, there was a detrimental effect upon such scrutiny. In Tasmania there is a procedure under which the committee could initiate the suspension of regulations while parliament was prorogued. Similarly, there was helpful legislation in NSW and Victoria under which delegated legislation committees can sit while parliament is prorogued. </PARA>
<PARA>Delegated legislation committees should have the power to scrutinise regulations while parliament is prorogued and in suitable cases suspend regulations at any time when parliament is not sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>Henry VIII Clauses</PARA>
<PARA>Ray Barber, Subordinate Legislation Committee, Queensland</PARA>
<PARA>There is strong general disapproval of such provisions, under which Acts may be amended by executive instrument. The reason for this is that parliament must always remain supreme in all aspects of legislation. Henry VIII clauses negate such supremacy, even when there is provision for disallowance. They are only acceptable in exceptional cases where, for example, a schedule of wild life may need to be amended in such a way that would not affect the intention of an Act. While there may be rare, justifiable uses of Henry VIII clauses which are subject to tabling and disallowance, they have no legitimate general application in the legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA>Wednesday, 22 May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Quasi-legislation and departmental decision-making</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Patricia Giles</PARA>
<PARA>An important aspect of quasi-legislation is the mass of departmental manuals, guidelines and orders used by officials when dealing with the public. Legally, the position of such guidelines is ambiguous. In any event, both departmental officers and members of the public often treat them as if they were binding. </PARA>
<PARA>Several Commonwealth Acts provide safeguards against abuse by the executive of departmental guidelines. Under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 it is an improper exercise of power to apply a rule or policy without regard to the merits of each individual case. It also requires officials to provide, on request, a statement of reasons for each decision. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 provides that all such guidelines must be publicised. Many decisions by Ministers and officials are now subject to independent, external, merits review by the AAT. The Ombudsman investigates complaints of maladministration by officials. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee has examined numbers of departmental manuals, which in fact seem to acknowledge the primary position of Acts and delegated legislation in the administration of schemes and programs. Nevertheless, legislative scrutiny committees must remain vigilant to ensure that the position of Parliament is not diluted by such quasi-legislation, and that the rights of the public are protected. </PARA>
<PARA>A regulation by any other name</PARA>
<PARA>Bob Wiese, Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>There is a trend towards a proliferation of delegated legislation and a variety of terminology. This makes the task of delegated legislation committees more difficult. The real concern here is that not all of these instruments are subject to scrutiny. There are no objective criteria to determine which instruments are suitable for tabling and disallowance. For some departments the criteria simply relate to administrative convenience. Recent instruments which are not subject to parliamentary control impose fees and in one case even determine how those fees are to be applied. There should be an independent inquiry to examine the extent to which parliament is deprived of an opportunity to scrutinise the actions of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA>During discussion it was mentioned that the present ARC project on rule making aimed to identify all instruments which were legislative, regardless of terminology, and bring them within parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>The executive and parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bronwyn Bishop</PARA>
<PARA>The relationship with the executive is the core of the operations of the Committee. In this context Ministers are the most important element of the executive. The Commonwealth position, under which there are Cabinet Ministers, Ministers outside the Cabinet, and Parliamentary Secretaries, assists the Committee. The Committee is also assisted by the fact that seven out of the nine Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in the Senate are former members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee receives good cooperation from Ministers, one of whom has indicated that he personally is to be the first point of contact in his office for all matters regarding delegated legislation. Cooperation is helped by the Chairman always being from the government. From time to time the Committee invites departmental officers to brief it on particular instruments. </PARA>
<PARA>The main reason for the cooperation from Ministers is that the Committee acts in a non-partisan fashion and avoids involvement in the policy merits of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary counsel panel and discussion</PARA>
<PARA>Representatives from the Commonwealth, NSW, Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT</PARA>
<PARA>No jurisdiction had formal contact between parliamentary counsel and committees. In some states parliamentary counsel sometimes attend committee meetings. In others there may be irregular meetings but not day to day contact. In others there may be contact between counsel and the committee's legal adviser. However, it is probably beneficial that the parties be at a professional arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA>In all jurisdictions counsel advise departments of committee requirements. Sometimes this is done by a pro forma. Because of the committees, counsel can be more persuasive in dealing with clients. What starts out as a ministerial view will finish as a more rounded parliamentary view. It is good that a legislative scheme that may have been put together in haste can be independently considered by committees. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be useful if departments were to consult counsel on how to reply to queries from committees. This is particularly the case when departments have inexperienced instructing staff and inexperienced drafters. </PARA>
<PARA>The existence of scrutiny committees contributes to a higher standard of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The changing nature of subordinate legislation and the ramifications for security committees-a Victorian perspective</PARA>
<PARA>Ken Jasper, Subordinate Legislation Subcommittee of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>There is a trend to remove a large range of issues from parliamentary debate and deal with them by subordinate legislation. This trend emphasises the importance of scrutiny committees. It also emphasises the need for public justification of regulatory proposals through RIS. </PARA>
<PARA>In the first years after RIS procedures were established, the Committee concentrated simply on supervising compliance with those procedures. Now it scrutinies the quality of each RIS. This form of activity is now more necessary than ever before. There have been instances where major policy changes have been effected by regulation. Unfortunately, there are constraints on the operation of the committee. For example, a regulation must be disallowed by both houses. Also, by control of the notice paper the government can ensure that a disallowance motion is not debated. </PARA>
<PARA>Committees must continue to avoid party political issues, even though interest group comments normally relate to the policy merits of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Workshop Session: Standardisation of regulations</PARA>
<PARA>Patricia Azarias, an official of the Regulation Review Committee, NSW</PARA>
<PARA>There are many costly, complex and anti-competitive regulations in the Commonwealth and States. These might be reduced by either a ``mutual recognition'' or a ``coordination and harmonisation'' approach. Under the former, each jurisdiction recognises the legislation of other jurisdictions. Under the latter, a common standard is imposed on all jurisdictions. It might be useful if the chairs of all delegated legislation committees meet regularly to discuss recognition and uniformity, and if committees circulate copies of their reports which raise these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Discussion did not support either meetings or circulation. The success of legislative scrutiny committees is due to their avoidance of political issues. The concept of uniform legislation was such an issue and therefore outside the purview of committees. NSW delegates pointed out that their position was somewhat different, as their terms of reference exempt regulations which are complementary to, or uniform with, legislation of the Commonwealth or other States. </PARA>
<PARA>Workshop Session: Fee units</PARA>
<PARA>Patricia Azarias, an official of the Regulation Review Committee, NSW</PARA>
<PARA>In NSW there are scores of different fees which are changed every year. There could be advantages in adopting similar provisions to those already existing for pecuniary penalty units. That is, that fees are expressed by a standard fee unit set by the Treasury or by individual departments. Instead of amending each instrument, it would only be necessary to amend the amount of the fee unit. This would have administrative benefits. However, it may be confusing to the public. It may also be difficult to set a common denominator because of the variety of types of fees. </PARA>
<PARA>Most delegates did not support the introduction of fee units. Although units are suitable for penalties they are not suited for fees. There would be no incentive for departments to reduce costs because fee rises would be automatic. Good administration dictates that fees should reflect costs. Fees would get out of line with costs. There would be no accountability by departments, with fee rises without reasons. Any fee increase should be individually justified. </PARA>
<PARA>The impact of delegated legislation on the community and the public profile of review committees</PARA>
<PARA>Judy Edwards, Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the public have full and immediate access to delegated legislation. New information technology should ensure that complete and consolidated instruments are available to the public immediately they are made. This should be a major concern of committees. At present, much delegated legislation is only disseminated through the Gazette. Another problem is unintelligible drafting. There should be a single series of delegated legislation, rather than the present multiplicity of series. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest groups and individuals should be consulted and have their views taken into account before regulations are made. The RIS procedures in several jurisdictions assist this requirement. These procedures oblige departments to publicise proposed legislation. The RIS requirements should not affect the non-partisan operation of committees, as they are concerned only with procedures rather than policy merits. </PARA>
<PARA>Committees have several public profiles. These involve reports to parliament, facilitating access by the public to the RIS process, and educating the public about delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Thursday, 23 May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Fees and taxes-a New Zealand perspective</PARA>
<PARA>David Caygill, Regulations Review Committee, New Zealand</PARA>
<PARA>It is a fundamental constitutional principle that only parliament should impose taxes. Parliament should act as a check on the executive if it intrudes into this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealand committee has recommended that whenever the executive proposes to impose fees or charges, it should estimate the revenue and by how much this exceeds costs and why. Even this does not protect rights and liberties. There must be an incentive to minimise costs through productivity gains. Also, in New Zealand fees have been set high to discourage a particular activity or to cross-subsidise other activities. In some cases it would be appropriate for fees to be set by tender or the market process. A RIS process would be of considerable help. The power to remit fees must not distort the cost recovery process. </PARA>
<PARA>The executive versus the legislature: restoring the balance</PARA>
<PARA>Tom Helm, Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>Scrutiny of delegated legislation reinforces the sovereignty of parliament. This is achieved mostly by persuasion. Committees must have no political bias, but must nevertheless ensure that the executive is answerable to parliament. If necessary, the committee will subpoena officials to appear before it. The committee may then approach ministers and even the premier. The power of the committee to initiate amendment of legislation is valuable. The role of the committee is to educate administrators as well as to correct individual instruments. </PARA>
<PARA>Discussion followed on a number of issues. There should be automatic disallowance of instruments where debate is not brought on a defective instrument. Given advances in information storage and retrieval perhaps the required period for tabling should be shortened from 15 sitting days to 10 or 5. In New Zealand instruments are subject to scrutiny even before tabling. Some legislative instruments were still not subject to tabling and disallowance. Explanatory documents should be improved. Schools and colleges should be given articles and material on the role of committees. Legislative scrutiny is not in conflict with the activities of the executive, but rather facilitates and advances the ideals of efficient government. </PARA>
<PARA>Open forum and final comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate delegation mentioned the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and how our commitments under these charters would affect the operation of committees. It also emphasised that all legislative instruments must be made subject to tabling and disallowance. Access and presentation of delegated legislation must be improved. The present project by the ARC on rule making, which had accepted almost all of the recommendations in a major submission from the committee, would greatly assist the present position with respect to quasi-legislation. The Senate committee was particularly fortunate in having both a complementary scrutiny of bills committee and an independent legal adviser. </PARA>
<PARA>The ACT delegation also emphasised the advantages of a scrutiny of bills function and procedures for automatic disallowance if the motion is not brought on for debate. </PARA>
<PARA>The NSW delegation said that quasi-legislation was the greatest problem facing committees, together with an appropriate hierarchy of legislative content. The ARC project should be of assistance here. </PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealand delegation said that committees would be most successful if they combined a robust attitude to the executive with a strict non-partisan operation. Committees should ensure that public officials explain and clarify their actions in detailed explanatory material. </PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory delegation welcomed moves to ensure appropriate scrutiny of legislation during periods of prorogation. Also, it was preferable to have a government chair of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland delegation emphasised that legislative scrutiny must not be the prerogative of those who are legally qualified. It was important that committees explain what they do to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>The South Australian delegation said that quasi-legislation was an important problem. Committees should have the power to amend legislation. Legislative scrutiny committees will become more important in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian delegation said that legislative scrutiny was well suited to upper houses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Victorian delegation said that quasi-legislation was a problem, with governments trying to avoid scrutiny of legislative instruments. Committees were aware of the importance of delegated legislation but governments were not. Thorough and revealing RIS were important. The lack of a scrutiny of bills committee was regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian delegation said that the new scrutiny of bills committee would assist their operations. Prorogation each year is disruptive. </PARA>
<PARA>The Administrative Review Council representative said that the ARC proposals on rule-making are that all legislative instruments should be drafted to a suitable standard, prepared after a period of public consultation, be subject to scrutiny and disallowance and be accessible to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Formal Close</PARA>
<PARA>Clive Griffiths, President of the Legislative Council, Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>The President said that parliament should monitor and, where necessary, veto laws made by the executive. This has an educative and deterrent effect upon those who devise or administer delegated legislation. Government departments and other agencies will therefore know what parliament will tolerate for inclusion in such legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT OF WORK OF COMMITTEE DURING AUTUMN SITTINGS 1991</PARA>
<PARA>During the present sittings the work of the Committee has involved the scrutiny of the usual large volume of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Delegated legislation must be made under the authority of Parliament expressed through a parent Act. It should not deal with policy issues, which are debated in Parliament during the passage of Bills. Rather its purpose is to provide the administrative details of a scheme or program. However, these details are so important that without them normal public administration would not be possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise every disallowable instrument of delegated legislation to ensure that it complies with its standards of parliamentary proprieties and personal liberties. Instruments of delegated legislation impose duties and grant rights in the same way as an Act of Parliament. The Committee's scrutiny ensures parliamentary supremacy in law-making and that in this respect the executive is responsible to Parliament. Every instrument examined by the Committee is subject to the final sanction of disallowance by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>During the present sittings the Committee considered 764 instruments, which make a total of 1,645 for the 1990-1 year. This was the largest number of instruments ever considered by the Committee in one year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considered each of these instruments under the four principles which are set out in Standing Orders and which comprise its terms of reference. The Chairman writes to the Minister in respect of each instrument in which there is an apparent deficiency, with a request to explain the difficulty. In the present sittings the Committee detected prima facie defects in 116 of the 764 instruments scrutinised. These defects are discussed below under each of the four principles. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle (a)</PARA>
<PARA>Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA>This first principle relates to parliamentary propriety. Therefore, it is concerned not only with technical validity but also with all aspects of drafting, presentation and access. The Committee believes that, as legislative instruments, delegated legislation should be in no way inferior to the standards set by Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the most important aspect of parliamentary propriety is that instruments should be validly made. In several cases the drafting of instruments was such that it was uncertain whether this requirement was satisfied. One instrument was not signed. Another referred to related provisions when others were intended. Another referred incorrectly to provisions in other instruments. An invalid provision in one instrument was referred to in five other instruments in such a way as to taint all five instruments. In another case validity was affected by a failure to comply with certain procedures required before an instrument could be made. In another an instrument was expressed to take effect from a particular year, with a blank in the space for the day and the month. In another there were typographical errors which could have affected validity. </PARA>
<PARA>It is essential that delegated legislation effects any purpose evident on its face or expressly stated in the Explanatory Statement. The drafting of one instrument did not indicate whether it was intended to apply to local as well as State authorities, to statutory authorities and government business enterprises and to external territories. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that certain licences were not required for destinations listed in a Schedule to the instrument, yet there was no Schedule and no provision made for one. In another the Explanatory Statement advised a date of effect different from that in the instrument itself. The drafting of another was so ambiguous that it was not possible to decide whether it effected its purpose. One instrument used the permissive expression ``may'', to the detriment of those affected, when it was clear from the context that the mandatory ``shall'' or ``must'' should have been used. </PARA>
<PARA>Many instruments impose or amend fees and charges and grant or amend allowances. The Committee ensures that the basis for all fees and allowances is explained. It is a breach of personal rights if fees are unreasonably imposed. It is also a breach of parliamentary propriety. In one case the Committee questioned an allowance which was increased by 100% without explanation. In another case an instrument gave a statutory authority power to impose fees without parliamentary oversight. Conversely, the Committee protects Commonwealth revenue. In one case there was an increase in Commonwealth liability from $100,000 to $180,000. In another the Committee questioned a provision which enabled a delegation to anyone in the Department to waive unlimited amounts of fees due to the Commonwealth, such fees in a single case amounting to $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Drafting must comply with appropriate contemporary standards. The Committee questioned such archaic expressions as ``deck boy'' ``diet maid'', ``kitchenman'' and ``kitchenmaid''. The latter two expressions followed each other in an instrument which provided identical salaries for both. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has previously raised the issue of copies of delegated legislation substituted for earlier defective copies. The Committee asks for an explanation of such copies. In most cases this is now provided as a matter of course. However, in one case the explanation included explanations for two defects in the earlier copy but not a third and did not explain the omission in the second copy of a provision included in the first. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee normally raises the possible waste of time and resources when two sets of regulations are made on the same day, on the advice of the same Minister, under the authority of the same parent Act and amending the same principal regulations. The Committee accepts that there may be occasions when this is appropriate, but usually asks for an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA>Explanatory Statements must be provided for every instrument of delegated legislation. This was not done in several cases. However, in each case this was an oversight, rather than legislative policy. Some Explanatory Statements were deficient in quality. One merely stated that the date of revocation earlier effected for another instrument was now changed, with no further explanation. Another stated that the instrument was made by the Minister, when it was made by a delegate. Some Explanatory Statements did not advise that the purpose of the instrument was to implement an undertaking given to the Committee by the Minister to correct a defective instrument. On the other hand, many Explanatory Statements are full and detailed. </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of, and public access to, delegated legislation, should not be less than that of Acts. This is so even though defects in this area may not affect validity. One instrument included a corrigendum stuck on with sticky tape. This corrigendum referred to page numbers, although the pages of the instrument were not numbered. Several instruments cited and spelt other legislation incorrectly. Two other instruments were tabled twice. The same well known Australian town was spelt incorrectly in three separate series of delegated legislation administered through two portfolios. Several instruments were not numbered, with resulting confusion to users. Two separate instruments were given the same number. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle (b)</PARA>
<PARA>Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA>This second principle is also interpreted broadly to safeguard and protect the position of the individual against any possible encroachment by delegated law-makers. </PARA>
<PARA>One aspect of personal rights is that any obligations or duties imposed by legislation must be certain in effect. A number of instruments were deficient in this respect. A condition of one approval was that an applicant had to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the maximum advantage is derived in Australia by suitable licensing and franchising. Another instrument, in separate provisions, used the expressions ``genuine reasons'', ``compelling reasons'' and ``exceptional reasons'', which presumably all had different meanings. Other undefined expressions included ``in the national interest'', ``an appropriate standard'', ``extreme hardship'' and ``irreparable prejudice''. Other instruments were drafted in such a way that obligations were ambiguous. In one case this involved financial benefits for individuals. Even where the legislation provides an independent external right of review such uncertainty breaches personal liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of delegated legislation must not confuse users. The Committee believes that principal instruments should be reprinted at suitable intervals. Some delegated legislation is made in a loose leaf form and some is consolidated each time an amendment is made. These are useful techniques. The Committee raised the question of reprint and renumbering following an amending instrument which included provisions numbered 2ADAAA, 2ADAAB and 2ADAAC. In another case the Explanatory Statement advised that categories of permit had been reduced from 94 to 12. This was literally true, but there were now 94 subcategories under the 12 new categories. </PARA>
<PARA>Delegated legislation must not contain provisions which are harsh, arbitrary or unreasonable. In one case certain individuals were given three days to make an election with important financial consequences, while others were given three weeks. In another case a statutory authority was required to cancel approval of a valuable commercial concession if the holder failed to comply with certain conditions, even though such failure may not be within the control of the holder. In another, public officials were empowered to give directions in respect of certain premises and vehicles, but there was no requirement that such directions be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>Any fees or penalties provided in delegated legislation must be reasonable both in substance and in certainty of procedural arrangements. In one case an extensive schedule of costs payable by the public was increased by 13.39 per cent, with no indication of the new amounts. In another case a parking penalty was $500, the same penalty provided elsewhere in the instrument for malicious damage to priceless national heritage relics. Strict liability offences are now rare, but one instrument provided for such an offence. In another case there were no apparent safeguards for collection from individuals of outstanding debts to the Commonwealth. On the other hand, the Committee also questioned a series of mandatory provisions with no apparent penalties for their breach. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a breach of personal liberties if an instrument provides for powers to be delegated to inappropriate levels of official. The Committee questioned several instruments under which important powers could be delegated to any person at all. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee ensures that provisions which empower public officials to enter private premises are restricted by appropriate safeguards. Two instruments did not provide that such officials have photographic identity cards. Following action by the Committee this protection is now almost universal. The Committee also questioned the confidentiality of the results of drug testing of athletes. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 delegated legislation generally may not operate retrospectively where this would prejudice the rights of, or impose liabilities on, any person apart from the Commonwealth. The Committee questions instruments where there may be such prejudicial operation. In one case, there was retrospective operation of a mandatory technical engineering requirement to 1 January 1983. In other cases the Committee questioned instruments which, while not expressed to operate retrospectively, may have had that effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle (c)</PARA>
<PARA>Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA>This principle is a refinement of one aspect of the Committee's protection of personal rights and liberties. Many instruments grant discretions to various organs of the executive to make decisions with important personal or financial consequences for individuals. In all appropriate cases such discretions should be subject to external, independent, merits review by a body such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the present sittings such discretions have included the cancellation of an export quota and the cancellation of the right to harvest natural resources. In another case, discretions were provided in respect of Commonwealth payments for dispensing pharmaceutical products. In another, a discretion could exclude an individual from a scheme for closures and amalgamations in a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Many discretions are not only to reject or refuse an application, but also to impose conditions upon its grant. The Committee treats the right to grant with conditions as the same as a right to refuse and will insist on review rights where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee ensures appropriate review of discretions to remit, waive or reduce any fees or charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also ensures that any material incorporated into legislation complies with its principles. The Committee did this with incorporated Principles and Codes affecting commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Some instruments made express provision for discretions which are exercised personally by the Minister. In some cases this may be useful. Often the power to exercise a discretion is granted to the Minister, who may then delegate the power. The possibility of delegation, sometimes to junior officials, is usually a compelling argument for external merits review. On the other hand, a Minister is personally answerable in Parliament for his or her decisions. On a related issue, the Committee was concerned about an instrument which granted discretions to State and Territory officials, whose actions would not, or possibly could not, be subject to AAT review. </PARA>
<PARA>Numbers of instruments not only did not provide for review of discretions, but also failed to provide criteria to define and narrow the power being exercised. Every important discretion provided in delegated legislation should include such criteria, as well as appropriate review. </PARA>
<PARA>Some schemes of commercial supervision imposed by delegated legislation provide for review rights of some discretions but not others, with no apparent logical distinction between them. In these cases the Committee usually considers that if review is provided for some discretions in a scheme then it should be provided for all. </PARA>
<PARA>Other discretions may not affect business or commercial operations but instead may impinge directly upon personal rights and liberties. The Committee is particularly vigilant in such cases. Several instruments provided for discretions in respect of elections for certain councils. These related to valid votes, recounts and a decision to void an election. Many discretions were provided in respect of the right of foreigners to enter and remain in Australia. Others were in respect of recognition of professional qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of discretions related to conditions of employment for members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Public Service. Here also the Committee questions instruments which do not appear to provide suitable review rights. In one case discretions were provided for study leave and another for general leave credits. Others were in respect of different allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle (d)</PARA>
<PARA>Does delegated legislation contain matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA>This principle is the least frequently breached of the four. Like the first principle, its purpose is to protect parliamentary propriety. The Committee did not question any instrument on this ground during the present sittings. However, it noted with satisfaction the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991, which provides for the exemption of certain Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation from the operation of the principal Act. This legislation was previously exempted by regulation, a procedure which the Committee considered breached its fourth principle. However, the introduction of this Bill now implements an undertaking given by the Minister that he would introduce an amendment Bill to give Parliament an opportunity to debate the continuation of discriminatory legislation. The Committee will make a separate report on its consideration of the Sex Discrimination Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Future Issues</PARA>
<PARA>The most important event affecting delegated legislation in the next few months is the forthcoming Report by the Administrative Review Council on its project on Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies. The ARC has already published its initial proposals which, if implemented, will have perhaps the most far reaching impact on delegated legislation since the passage of the Acts Interpretation Act in 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee made a major submission to the ARC during the formulation of these proposals. It is pleasing that virtually all of the recommendations of the Committee have been accepted. The proposals appear to address most of the areas in which the system of Commonwealth delegated legislation is at present deficient. The following is a summary of the more significant proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>1. The proposals list in considerable detail the matters which should be covered by Acts rather than by delegated legislation. This should clarify the present uncertain division of content between Acts and delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The proposals list detailed criteria to determine whether an instrument is legislative in character. This is a first step to ensure that all such instruments are subject to tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA>3. All legislative instruments should be drafted to the standard of an Act, subject to tabling and disallowance in Parliament, prepared after a public consultation process and easily accessible. The Committee has previously argued that all of these measures should be adopted, although the public consultation process should not involve the Committee in any consideration of the policy merits of proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Delegated legislation should be promulgated through the Executive Council. At present, only Statutory Rules are so promulgated. The Committee has long expressed its opinion that the Statutory Rules is the most satisfactory of the more than 100 separate series of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Delegated legislation should be drafted by the professional drafters of the Office of Legislative Drafting (OLD) in the Attorney-General's Department. The Committee has previously argued in favour of this step. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Disallowance, or negative resolution, should remain the main mechanism for parliamentary scrutiny but variations of disallowance such as positive resolution and postponed commencement, could also be used. The Committee has no objection to this, as long as either House has the power ultimately to disallow an instrument or to prevent it entering into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The present 15 sitting day period for disallowance should remain. However, if either House resolves, the disallowance power may be revived within six months for a further 15 sitting days. The Committee supports this. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Public consultation should be mandatory before any instrument of delegated legislation is made. The Committee supports this. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Consultation would take the form of a publication of the proposal and an explanatory document which sets out details of the proposal, its goals and objectives and alternative courses of action to achieve the desired goals. The Committee has no objection to this. However, as mentioned earlier, the procedure must not involve the Committee in any way with policy merits. </PARA>
<PARA>10. Parties would then have a period within which they could make submissions about the effect of the instrument. The Committee supports this. </PARA>
<PARA>11. The present Statutory Rules series should be expanded to include all delegated legislation. The Committee has previously argued in favour of this. </PARA>
<PARA>12. Failure to include delegated legislation in the Statutory Rules series would carry the consequence that the instrument could not be used and would be of no effect. The Committee supports this. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, the above ARC proposals, which are in accordance with the views of the Committee, will largely eliminate a number of the most obvious defects in present delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>If the proposals are implemented, all delegated legislation will be restricted to appropriate subject matter, be properly drafted following input from the public, be subject to tabling and disallowance and be located in a single, uniform, definitive series. When the final ARC Report is presented the Committee will make a more detailed statement to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As Deputy Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and leader of the Australian delegation to the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation, I have pleasure in following the Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, Senator Giles, in drawing attention to the work of delegated legislation committees throughout the Commonwealth. In this case, in accordance with the statement I made to the Senate on 7 December 1989, I am tabling the full record of the proceedings of the British Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation which was held in London in November 1989, as provided by the conference secretariat in London. The full text of my statement in December 1989 is included in the annual report of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for 1989-90 tabled in the Senate in May of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate that both Senator Giles and I should be advising the Senate of the productive conferences which have been held on such important but underrated issues. Indeed, it is noteworthy that all who participated in the London conference are still actively involved in the consideration of both primary and delegated legislation under civil liberties criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the conference we held the following positions: I, as leader of the delegation, was Deputy Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, a position I still hold; Senator Patricia Giles was in 1989 a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and is now the Chairman of that Committee; Senator Kay Patterson was a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and she remains a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee; Senator Rosemary Crowley was, and remains, a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The continuing commitment of all senators to the arduous work of the legislative scrutiny committees is thus demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the distinguished Professor Douglas Whalan was then and remains legal adviser to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. In the interim, in the absence on sabbatical leave of Professor Jim Davis, he undertook simultaneously to act as legal adviser to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Anne Lynch was and remains Deputy Clerk of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing for all of us who attended the conference in London that matters raised during that conference have been diligently pursued, as indicated by the statement just made by Senator Giles and the summary she has incorporated in Hansard. As additional proof of this assertion I draw the attention of honourable senators to a debate that occurred in the House of Lords in February 1990 concerning the desirability of establishing a Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Not surprisingly, in light of comments which I reported to the Senate in 1989, the debate was led by Lord Rippon, who was an active participant in the London proceedings. The Lords debate is included as an appendix to the proceedings. The enthusiasm for such a committee in other legislatures was also manifest at the Australian conference. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is depressing to note that, in addition to the positive trends evidenced by the uniform adoption of the concept of a Scrutiny of Bills Committee, themes and trends which caused some disquiet at the London conference continue to bedevil delegated legislation committees at both Commonwealth and State level. For example, much attention during the London conference was paid to quasi-legislation, both as legal instruments and as pseudo-legal manuals, guidelines, or instructions to staff of departments and authorities. Further, there is mounting evidence at Commonwealth level of ineptly drafted but nonetheless binding delegated legislation, well illustrated by examples given in the Delegated Legislation Monitor which is published each sitting week. Recent issues of the Monitor in particular draw attention to the ascendancy of departmentally drafted delegated legislation over the statutory rules series. This is a worrying development which generated significant discussion in both London and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters raised at the London conference that remain of continuing concern are the inaccessibility of delegated legislation, the obscure and often ungrammatical language in which legislation is drafted, and the unprofessional formatting of legislation. The problem of Henry VIII clauses, which is of such concern in British Commonwealth legislatures and those of the Australian States, is, as I was able to indicate at the conference and in my statement of December 1989 to the Senate, a lesser problem at the Federal level in Australia, due in no small measure to the vigilant Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This Committee endeavours to ensure that the temptation by the Executive and/or the bureaucracy to resort to such clauses is at the very least made public, with the attendant shame, or is thwarted by amendment in either House. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem was again addressed at the Perth conference when, after vigorous discussion, I moved the following motion, which was adopted by the plenary session as its resolution:</PARA>
<PARA>While noting that there may be a rare, justifiable use of a Henry VIII clause where such use would be subject to tabling and disallowance, this conference believes that Henry VIII clauses have no legitimate general application in the legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, conferences such as my colleagues and I have been privileged to attend enable discussion of common problems: a refreshing antidote to the relentless and often thankless task of scrutiny which all committees of this nature must endure. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to complete the records of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Senate in relation to the Commonwealth conference on delegated legislation, I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report I have just tabled on behalf of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare deals with the culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory. Honourable senators will be aware that the control of feral animals, particularly the shooting of buffalo and brumbies from helicopters, is perceived by national and international animal welfare groups as cruel and inhumane. Evidence also suggests that international concerns about these matters have the capacity to damage Australia's international image and the potential to affect adversely the tourist industry and export trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Animal Welfare Committee held public hearings in the Northern Territory with Commonwealth and Territory government officials and had informal talks with several people who are involved in the practical aspects of control programs. The Committee also received evidence from animal welfare groups, including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) Australia, Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies (ANZFAS) and other interested organisations, such as the Australian Veterinary Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Before reviewing the main recommendations contained in the report, I would like to make two preliminary observations. Firstly, the Committee's inquiry and its report do not single out the Northern Territory Administration for special attention. As was recognised in evidence, the feral animal problem in the Northern Territory `ranks amongst the worst in the world in terms of numbers and range of species of feral animals'. The focus of the inquiry allowed the Committee to gain a keen appreciation of the problems and issues involved in feral animal control. Secondly, the Committee is aware that the feral animal problem is shared by all States and Territories and is an issue of national importance and urgency. I think the recommendations and conclusions contained within the report reflect this view. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report contains 10 recommendations and 15 major conclusions. Today I wish to review briefly some of them. I am sure that other members of the Committee will address in more detail specific issues raised in the report. The Committee heard evidence on the impact of feral animals and the problems they pose. It was recognised that horses, buffalo and other large feral animals have a significant adverse impact on the environment of the Northern Territory. This manifests itself in the degradation of landscape and the destruction of vulnerable Australian species of flora and fauna. Feral animals also have the potential to exacerbate problems arising from the introduction of exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to native animals, the Committee was told that the impact of feral animals on native mammals in central Australia has been a disaster. Forty-two per cent of all arid zone mammals are threatened and 14 species are extinct. Massive populations of feral animals, including horses, have been responsible for the destruction of critical habitats. There was general agreement in evidence to the Committee that `there is no position in Australian environmental systems for feral animals' and that, ideally, total eradication should be the goal of control programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The most contentious issue raised during the inquiry relates to the methods used to control feral animals and, in particular, the shooting of buffalo and brumbies from helicopters. The Northern Territory Government and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service-a Commonwealth agency that controls feral animals in Kakadu National Park-maintain that shooting from helicopters can be quick, effective and relatively humane. Remoteness and difficult terrain make helicopter shooting the only practical and cost effective method of control. They recognise, however, that to be humane helicopter shooting must be properly planned and conducted by well-trained and competent personnel. RSPCA Australia, ANZFAS and other animal welfare groups are adamantly opposed to the killing of animals from moving platforms and, in particular, helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA> Having observed the rugged and inaccessible terrain that feral animals inhabit in the Northern Territory, the Committee considers that helicopter shooting is often the only practical and humane method of control. However, in order to ensure a professional and responsible approach to this control method, the Committee concludes that procedures associated with helicopter shooting must be improved. To achieve this objective, the Committee report makes recommendations on the training of shooters; accreditation or licensing of shooters; supervision of shooting; strategies for control; and operational matters involving firearms, ammunition and back procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also received evidence on the muster and transport of feral animals to abattoirs and, in particular, the transport of feral horses from Alice Springs to an abattoir at Peterborough. The Committee considers that the prolonged stress and trauma of the wild horses transported in trucks over long distances cannot be condoned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report addresses the feasibility of fertility control as a humane and long term method of feral animal control. A recent review of the role of fertility control in wildlife management by Dr Mary Bomford of the Bureau of Rural Resources was of considerable assistance to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Although encouraging research work on fertility control is being undertaken by scientists such as Dr Tyndale-Biscoe of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the present role of fertility control is extremely limited. Its future role will be dependent upon crucial factors, such as the availability of an appropriate drug, an effective delivery system and appropriate understanding of population dynamics. Nevertheless, the Committee was persuaded by the evidence of animal welfare groups, including the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies, that research in this area should be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the States and Territories are primarily responsible for the control of feral animals, the Committee was told that feral animals pose a national problem and that national coordination and planning is required. The Committee noted existing and proposed mechanisms for co-ordination within the Australian Agricultural Council, the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Commonwealth Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The Committee, however, is concerned that these arrangements appear to be fragmented and do not provide a focus for a concerted and co-ordinated approach to the control of feral animals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the significant threats posed by feral animals, the Committee considers that a national committee or task force should be established to provide a concerted and coordinated approach to the control and elimination of feral animals. I thank the members of the Committee for their assistance and their contribution to this unanimous report of the Committee. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the report be printed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has some reservations about some of the reports for 1989-90 that it examined. For example, the annual report of the Judge Advocate-General lacked a clear statement of his specific powers and responsibilities, which I, and the other Committee members, believe should appear in such a publication. The Committee would expect to see such a statement in his annual report for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that many members of the armed services, not to mention members of the community, senators and members of the House of Representatives, would be interested in having a better understanding of the role and function of the Judge Advocate-General. That was one of the points we made in our report on annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> We also examined the report of the Defence Housing Authority for 1989-90. I similarly draw the attention of the Senate to page 13 of our report where we point out that, in regard to equal opportunity, we commented in a previous report that the Defence Housing Authority had a disproportionately high percentage of women employed in the lower paid positions and none in its senior executive service ranks. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve months ago we identified this problem in respect of the 1988-89 annual report of the Defence Housing Authority. I regret to say that the situation has not altered between June 1989 and June 1990. The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is of the view in this current report on annual reports that the Defence Housing Authority should pursue an appropriate policy of affirmative action within the Government's guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out, in respect of the annual report of the Department of Defence, which we deal with on page 7 of the report on annual reports, that we did in fact have some reservations about that annual report, particularly about the statistical data. It was very difficult to make consistent comparisons based on the data available for different years in respect of the activities of the Department of Defence. The Senate Standing Committee wanted more consistent data made available in these statistical tables so that more realistic comparisons of different financial years could be made to evaluate the performance of the Department of Defence. Having diagnosed that problem with the annual report, we did note that the Australian Capital Territary division of the Royal Institute of Public Administration commended the annual report of the Department of Defence and gave its award for the best annual report examined for 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade looked at the annual reports of government departments and authorities and found that the timeliness of reporting by those bodies still remains a problem and that some agencies are still submitting their annual reports to the relevant Minister late and, in several instances, several months late. When reading reports it is self-evident that the longer the delay in presenting a report, the less useful it is for analysis and evaluation of those government agencies, such as departments and authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, notwithstanding the shortcomings that the Senate Standing Committee has identified in its report which I have mentioned here this afternoon, there is no question that there has been a significant improvement in the content and presentation of the annual reports of government departments, statutory authorities and statutory bodies coming before the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I instance the annual report of the Australia-China Council and the Australian-New Zealand Foundation annual report. The Committee concluded in respect of both of those annual reports that there had been a significant improvement in their content and presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Committee hopes that government companies and government business enterprises will also follow comparable guidelines for their reporting in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an interesting report covering a total of 57 organisations: three departments, 50 statutory authorities and four other bodies. The Committee examined each report to determine whether it complied with the guidelines for annual reports. I emphasise that in the last report on annual reports by this Committee we stated that in subsequent reports under this reference compliance with guidelines would be expected, as would explanation of non-compliance. It was the Committee's stated intention to place more emphasis on qualitative assessment of annual reports or aspects of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is from this basic perspective that the Committee approached its examination of annual reports on this occasion. Examples of excellent reporting, of course, did exist, but I want to comment on unsatisfactory reports. The reports were satisfactory, with the exception of the second report by the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is particularly serious on this occasion because this is the second time we have had to report in this way. When dealing with this particular body it has to be remembered that the enabling legislation of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 was cited only through reference to a single matter, not central to the Commission's operation, and there was very little information about the powers, function and objects of the Commission. Membership of the Commission was dealt with correctly, but no mention was made of the Commission's relationship with the Australian Industrial Registry, the body which provides administrative support to the work of the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report also failed to include any financial or audit information, or any information about where this could be found. As I said, this report was subject to an adverse report by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The report indicates that all statutory authorities should publish a check list showing where the guidelines are met in the report. The Committee noted its disappointment that statutory authorities to date have disregarded this recommendation, and reiterates its desire to see the procedure implemented in the next round of reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to the Committee's report of December last year to highlight the insult that I think is given to the Parliament when the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission does not comply with the reasonable needs of the Parliament to have information. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission made no effort to comply with the reporting guidelines for statutory authorities nor with the guidelines for non-statutory bodies. The reports only contained details on the work of the Commission, lists of membership of the Commission and of matters lodged with the Commission. As a report to Parliament on its operations this is clearly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission did not report on the powers of the responsible Minister, the terms of membership of the Commission, staff or financial statements. After some lengthy discussions and research it was discovered that the Australian Industrial Registry reported some of these matters on the Commission's behalf. The Committee accepts that the Registry was set up to provide administrative support to the Commission, including financial responsibilities, but sees no reason why these details cannot be included in the Commission's report or at least some reference be made as to the relationship between the Commission and the Registry and where the detailed information may be found. </PARA>
<PARA> Given both its own financial responsibilities and those it undertakes on behalf of the Commission, the Registry's report revealed little about the expenditure of $7,764,895 from Consolidated Revenue. Expenditure from the Annual Appropriations requires further elaboration. The full costs of the Commission must be set out as well as a breakdown of the financial arrangements for the Registry. The financial statements in the Annual Report for the Department of Industrial Relations did not provide a breakdown of the Commission's financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In its examination of annual reports the Committee's fundamental requirement is operational and financial information. To the extent that the guidelines are met this requirement should also be met. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an element of defiance in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission presenting an unsatisfactory report to us. All I can say is that the members of the Committee will examine this organisation very closely in the future. The situation is untenable. I do not know whether it reflects an arrogance of the Parliament. Recent industrial decisions tend to make one concerned about the attitude of the Industrial Relations Commission to the Parliament, but that might be drawing a long bow. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the circumstances, it is a matter of concern. There is no doubt that it is on notice that my Committee will, in future, investigate further why the only body that we have come across of this nature is not prepared to give reasonable information so that the Parliament and the people might be able to examine its activities. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>REPORT 310-BUSINESS MIGRATION PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I present the Committee's 310th Report-a report on Australia's Business Migration Program. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first of two reports on the Committee's Inquiry into the Business Migration Program and Control of Visitor Entry. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for this first Report arose after the Inquiry commenced in June 1990. So widespread was community concern about the operation of the Business Migration Program, that the Committee decided it would need to examine the Program before looking at matters relating to the Control of Visitor Entry. </PARA>
<PARA>Major Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA>In its Report, the Committee has recommended that there be major changes to the system of business migration to Australia. It has recommended the abolition of the Accredited Agent Scheme-effectively abolishing the Business Migration Program in its existing form-and the introduction of a skills-based category of business migration within the independent category of migration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has recommended that the primary purpose of this new entry category be the establishment of businesses in Australia and that selection under this category of migration be based on a points system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has further recommended that the determining factor in developing a points test for business skills should be demonstration of a successful business background by the applicant and that the components of the criterion should be the ownership and operation of a successful, bona fide business in the applicant's country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA>Program objectives</PARA>
<PARA>If any Government program is to be successful, it is important that it have clear objectives and some clear measures of success. If a program's objectives are vague or if it does not have good performance measures, it will not be possible to determine if its objectives are being met. This has been an issue for the department responsible for Australia's Business Migration Program-the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The stated objectives of the Business Migration Program are to bring economic benefit to Australia through:</PARA>
<PARA>* employment creation, or retention of employment that would otherwise be lost;</PARA>
<PARA>* the introduction of new and improved technology:</PARA>
<PARA>* export expansion; and</PARA>
<PARA>* import substitution. </PARA>
<PARA>In setting the Program's objectives, the Department made an implicit requirement that a business migrant must establish a business in Australia. However, the Committee considers that this should have been articulated in the Program objectives from the beginning to clarify the expectations placed on business migration applicants. </PARA>
<PARA>Program Monitoring</PARA>
<PARA>The implementation of an effective system of monitoring of program performance is an essential element of the accountability of public sector managers to the Parliament and the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the first four years of the life of the Business Migration Program, the use of surveys by the Department of Immigration has generated insufficient data from which to base conclusive judgements on the achievement of program objectives. A monitoring system introduced in July 1988 is only just now beginning to produce data, however the Committee is unable to get an overview on the achievement of program objectives from this data. </PARA>
<PARA>While the amount of data available from these surveys has provided some useful indicators on the Program, it does not provide conclusive evidence that the objectives are being met. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has concluded that there has not been adequate scrutiny of the Business Migration Program and has recommended that a much improved monitoring scheme be implemented for migrants arriving in Australia with business skills. Compliance with this scheme would be mandatory for migrants coming to Australia under the business skills category of entry and failure to comply will incur a financial penalty. </PARA>
<PARA>Accredited Agent Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>The Business Migration Program has been unique in so far as it has involved the private sector in the vetting of business migrants wishing to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In examining what is known as the Accredited Agent Scheme, the Committee was aware that any administrative scheme involving both the public and private sector would inevitably have teething problems. However, the Committee identified a number of basic flaws in the Accredited Agent Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>First-accredited agents are not responsible to the Commonwealth; they act as agents for their clients;</PARA>
<PARA>Second-the speed with which the Accredited Agent Scheme was introduced, brought a large number of accredited agents, with varying degrees of experience, into the migration consultancy arena. As a result, the Department of Immigration's control over the Scheme has been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Third-the number of accredited agents relative to the small client base has led to agents being under pressure to find suitable cases in order to survive financially. </PARA>
<PARA>And lastly, . . . and perhaps most importantly-the involvement of foreign based sub-agents, who are outside the control of the Department of Immigration, are in a position to exploit the financial vulnerability of accredited agents. </PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion reached by the Committee was that the combination of these factors, together with the lack of any effective monitoring scheme, made the Business Migration Scheme vulnerable to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is of the view that while there is an ongoing role for the private sector in terms of migration consultancy the public of Australia should quite rightly expect that the total responsibility for assessment of applications for migration should remain clearly with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has therefore recommended that the Accredited Agents Scheme be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA>New Business Skills Category</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee does not wish its recommendation that the Accredited Agent Scheme be abolished to be interpreted as a desire to terminate business skills based migration into Australia. The opposite is true, and, as I mentioned earlier, the Committee has recommended that a business skills-based category of migration be created to replace the Business Migration Program. </PARA>
<PARA>The adoption of this recommendation should align the administration of assessment of applications under this category with all other categories of entry, and return the total responsibility of application assessment to the Commonwealth. It should also eliminate the problems identified with the Accredited Agent Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Criminal Involvement in the Program</PARA>
<PARA>Since the inception of the Business Migration Program, allegations have linked the Program with criminal activity concerning the possible movement of financial and other assets derived from criminal sources to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>From the information provided during its Inquiry, the Committee concluded that the screening procedures used by the Department of Immigration to conduct security checks on business migration applicants were as extensive as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee further concluded that the Business Migration Program has not been the subject of large scale assault by organised criminal groups and that there is only a limited number of instances of penetration into Australia by identified criminal figures. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Committee has noted the concern of the New South Wales Police, the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police that the potential exists for exploitation of the Business Migration Program by criminal groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Money Recycling</PARA>
<PARA>Allegations have been made that link the Business Migration Program with `money recycling', that is, the transferring of money brought into Australia under the Business Migration Program back to the business migrant's country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA>A monitoring scheme implemented in November 1989 gave the Commonwealth Immigration Department the authority to check on accounts held by business migrants, however, up until this time the Department had no formal monitoring scheme in place. </PARA>
<PARA>After examination of this matter, the Committee has concluded that money recycling did occur prior to November 1989, but due to the lack of an effective monitoring scheme, the full extent of this recycling cannot be determined. The Committee is of the view that Department's monitoring system is acting as a deterrent to further recycling. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of the Committee's recommendations contained in this Report will undoubtedly bring about significant changes to business migration in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's belief is that this Report will contribute towards the development of a much improved system of migration for those individuals with business skills. The Report should also be of assistance to the Government in its current review of the Business Migration Program. </PARA>
<PARA>It remains for me to thank the other members of the Public Accounts Committee, particularly the members of Sectional Committee D, who worked so diligently on this Inquiry and in the finalisation this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Report to Honourable Senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate does not further press its request for an amendment to each of the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991 to which the House of Representatives has again not made and agrees to the amendment made to each Bill by the House of Representatives in place thereof. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been intensive discussions and negotiations over the past 72 hours. In part, these have centred on the nature of the Government's commitment to facilitate the $200m commercial loan by the Wool Realisation Commission. The Government has now agreed to facilitate that loan by the provision of a grant to the Commission of $22.5m in 1991-92 and 1992-93. This subvention represents the estimated interest component of the loan. This, together with the recognition of the desirability of being able to proceed with the total package as proposed by the Government, has also enabled us to propose that total wool tax in 1991-92 be 12.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that this is seen as a package and, if not accepted by the chamber, the Government will not necessarily feel committed to either of its elements. I am therefore proposing an amendment to each of the Wool Tax Bills which will have the effect, within the present 15 per cent tax rate set down, of enabling a lower wool tax rate to be set by regulation. The amendment brings into play the requirements of subclause 6(h) of the Bill, dealing with the recommendations on the rate from the Realisation Commission and annual general meetings of wool taxpayers, only for regulations to apply from 1 July 1992 onwards-thereby, leaving the Minister free to set the rate for 1991-92. Subject to acceptance of the package of wool legislation in both chambers, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) would then take the necessary steps to have 12.5 per cent set by regulation to apply from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government hopes that the chamber will accept this outcome in the spirit in which it is offered. While there is some risk that if our parameters are not realised it may be necessary to increase the wool tax rate from 1992-93, nevertheless, the Government is hopeful that, given the right conjunction of market circumstances, 12.5 per cent will prove to be adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is totally opposed to the initiatives now put forward by the Government. We are well aware of all of the debate that has taken place. I am sure that many of us watched the debate with some interest in the House of Representatives just a short while ago and the slightly more comprehensive statement in that place by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean)-as opposed to that just given by Senator Cook. I think I heard Senator Archer say, by way of interjection, that we have heard it all before. The debate has been fierce. It is very interesting to establish whether any compromises have been made between any other parties in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have established very clearly that the 10 per cent tax was both sustainable and of major importance to the tragic plight of rural Australia. The 15 per cent rate of tax stays in the legislation. All that has been conceded by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is that there will be an amendment to allow for 12 1/2 per cent to be regulated for the first year only. There has been no commitment to future years. Of course, so much depends on what the Government intends to do with the economy generally. Under pressure, the Government has again back-flipped and changed its arithmetic with regard to the important figures of the loan backup and the loan. We also note the changes made by the House of Representatives with regard to the repayment schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask this question very seriously and I ask it especially of the Australian Democrats who have a key role in determining where they stand on this position: how can we trust the Government? With all of the wheeling and dealing, the changes and the conniving that has gone on, the Government must stand by principle. The Government must stand in representing the major constituencies and the important rural areas. If the Government gets its way with what it has proposed today, we will find that not only is the cash injection questionable and that its entire arithmetic is subject to constant plays and games and negotiations but also it will not be in the interests of the woolgrowers or of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without attaching a lot of histrionics to this debate, I must say that the people who are interested in its outcome are those who are growing wool throughout Australia and those who are involved in the industry in any way. I will speak for just five minutes to give the Australian Democrats' reasons for taking the position which we are forced to take again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons are probably attached to the phrase offered by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy just recently-`the spirit in which it is offered', `it' being a magic figure of 12 1/2 per cent. On first examination that figure would appear to be very close to the Australian Democrats' position of 12 per cent, which was the objective of the amendment that we first moved. The amendment was moved because at that time we wanted to illustrate that that figure had the backing of considerable research by the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Wool Industry Policy Council and had been endorsed by the Australian Wool Council, the representative body of the woolgrowers. Our amendment gave the opportunity to the Government to endorse the future of this industry, to put faith in the future of this industry, and to show that it actually listened to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government refused to budge in that instance and the woolgrowers of Australia unanimously, vociferously and persistently gave us the message that the Government had betrayed them. An offer has been made today in the spirit of what the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy described as a `used car market'-find a magic number, keep throwing it at people and eventually they will accept it. It is not in the spirit of an offer that will inspire the industry or take the industry forward. It is not in the spirit of an offer, a management plan or an arrangement that will create a future for this industry. Because that is not the spirit in which it is being offered-because it is being offered in a spirit of negotiation and begrudging acceptance of a number, a number which is just the limit to which the Government may be able to go down rather than get behind, rather than a number, a plan, a set of activities and a set of management strategies which would carry this industry forward, we cannot support it. We will stay where we are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I gave notice of a motion relating to the disastrous situation on the Forgacs floating dock at Newcastle. Among other ship repair work, Forgacs was handling the refit of HMAS Tobruk. Two unions are involved in the work-the Metal and Engineering Workers Union and the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Both unions signed an agreement not to strike while the dockyard was refitting HMAS Tobruk. This undertaking was broken when Forgacs rejected an accord mark VI pay claim by the unions. Later, Forgacs agreed to pay the metal workers a wage rise of $12 a week, but not the painters and dockers. As a result, the strike continued until Forgacs gave in and extended the increases to all workers. The company had three vessels delayed as a result of this strike and the delays were costing up to $15,000 per vessel per day. That is how it began.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The end of the story is that the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union has been picketing the dockyard for the last week so that no further work could be carried out. The Federal Industrial Relations Commission failed to convince the union members to return to work immediately and, consequently, Commissioner Peterson granted an historic order to exempt Forgacs from clause 15 of the painters and dockers award, the pick-up clause that forces a company to accept labour from a roster operated by the union. The unions disagreed with the company over the interpretation of the ruling and disagreed that the company could draw up a list of those workers on the list who were required to work at the dockyard. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, Commissioner Peterson confirmed his ruling, termination notices were sent to those painters and dockers whom the Forgacs company no longer wished to employ, and permanent jobs were offered to about 28 men. Today the union has still not accepted the ruling by Commissioner Peterson. It has not removed the picket and its members have not returned to work. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to tell the Senate of the latest developments. The Federal Council of the Metal and Engineering Workers Union has directed its members to cross the picket line of the painters and dockers and return to work. This morning the picket line turned away civilian trucks loaded with equipment to support the work at the dockyard. Newcastle Trades Hall issued a directive for the picket to let those trucks in. Two Royal Australian Navy trucks with civilian drivers were then turned away. The Navy took one of its forklift trucks, manned by Army personnel, outside the gates of Forgacs and began to forklift goods and equipment over the fence. A Newcastle television station crew arrived and the picket broke up for a short time. However, the picket line is now back in place because the union is still meeting. That is how the situation stands at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter in the Senate because the actions of one union have contributed to a situation where the Royal Australian Navy is considering taking the multimillion dollar refit of HMAS Tobruk away from the Forgacs dockyard. If that happens, there is little chance that the Navy will again trust a ship repair job to the port of Newcastle. Such a development would be tragic for Forgacs and for Newcastle. But it is also a tragedy for Australia that, with so little progress on waterfront reform, restrictive trade practices and unwarranted strike action are allowed to interrupt work on the wharves and put the Australian economy in peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A politician should never miss the opportunity to speak; actually, I did not anticipate that I would have the chance to contribute to this debate this afternoon. The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) came to my office this morning because he had an issue that concerned him but had no opportunity to raise it in the House of Representatives. He sought my assistance in raising the matter here. Since I had already planned to ask a question about a firm in Echuca, I was not able to help the honourable member and said that I did not think I would be popular if I spoke in the adjournment debate this afternoon. However, I now seize the moment, although the papers are packed in my suitcase for the `end of school term' and I could not find them. But I will put the matter anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The lifts in this building were installed and have been serviced by an Australian company. Recently a contract was let for the servicing of the lifts in this place. The Australian company that had the service contract advertised widely internationally, saying that it was important to maintain the lifts in this building in order to ensure that senators and members arrived at divisions on time. Those of us who have not made it here in time-not the fault of the lifts-know how important it is that the lifts are serviced properly and that we do get here on time for divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The company used that as a selling point for its product, to sell its product overseas-an Australian product. A tender was put out for the service contract for the lifts and another firm, an overseas firm, won that contract because it had offered a lower price. I have been led to believe that part of the contract stated that, on the day the contract was let, the successful company was to start servicing the lifts. I now understand that that is not the case and that the Australian company has continued to service the lifts. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to direct my concerns to the President and ask whether the contract has been breached. If that contract has been breached, will the tender be re-let? Also, was consideration given to the fact that one of the companies was an Australian company. It has been suggested that the successful company cannot provide parts for the lift motors for some 20 weeks? I think that issue needs to be clarified; it is one of great concern, especially for the honourable member for Isaacs. The company is in his electorate and there are 350 people in that firm whose jobs are at risk. I think it behoves this Parliament to ensure that that contract has been dealt with properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer briefly to a matter that I would like to have raised at Question Time but, unfortunately, was unable to do so because of the volume and quality of questions that then came from this side of the chamber. The matter I want to refer to relates to the responses made during the week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). I regret to say that I have not advised him of my intention to raise this matter now, for reasons that may well be understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister defended the Government's unprecedented financial aid to a South African political party, the African National Congress, and to a range of urban black organisations closely associated with the ANC, on the grounds that an opinion poll that he quoted showed that 70 per cent of urban blacks support the ANC. His inference that seemed to stem from that was that the ANC is therefore representative of the black community and is the proper organisation for the Australian Government to support and finance in seeking to assist South African blacks to a fair and reasonable role in their country's future with the destruction of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to criticise the public opinion poll. I understand that the people who undertook the poll are reputable and that the poll results are reasonable. The fact is that the people who were polled are not representative of the black population of South Africa. The people polled were limited to the urban black population, which makes up around 40 per cent of the population of South Africa. The great bulk of black people in South Africa live in non-urban areas and indeed in conditions which roughly equate to the sorts of living conditions that exist in the rest of Africa in non-urban areas, and they are very unattractive. Senator Schacht has been to Africa and knows perfectly well what the standard of living of non-urban black people throughout the whole of that continent is. He knows also that it is particularly bad in white South Africa, which is not a matter that the white South Africans can feel pleased about, but it is simply a matter of fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have every feeling that he may take part in this debate, depending on how long it takes various people to pull the wool over various other people's eyes on another matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I was trying to make was that that public opinion poll does not defend or support the unprecedented decision by Senator Evans and by the Government to assist a political party which happens to be popular among urban blacks. Even Senator Schacht's mathematics would be good enough to recognise that 70 per cent of 40 per cent is only 28 per cent. In other words, all that this public opinion poll showed was that some 28 per cent of South Africa's blacks-that is, 70 per cent of the 40 per cent who live in urban areas-would support the ANC in an election. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that among the non-urban blacks there are a considerable numbers of ANC supporters, but we cannot tell the volume because no poll has been taken. To my knowledge, Senator Evans has no evidence, otherwise he would have presented it to us with the same verve and enthusiasm that he presented this urban blacks poll, as if somehow it was relevant to the total population of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the great bulk of rural blacks appear to support other leaders like Chief Buthelezi, who certainly has enormous popularity among the six million Zulus. There is also the leader of the two million Tswanas, for example, where I understand that the ANC-and I may be corrected-is not a strong political organisation. What is the evidence that the Minister has that the ANC represents the majority of black opinion in South Africa? Certainly it is the most up-front, certainly it has the greatest international standing and status, and this Government has taken the view that the way for the Hawke Government to achieve standing and status among Commonwealth countries and other countries that support the ANC is for itself to support the ANC. In other words, the Hawke Government appears to have another agenda-its own popularity and its own attempts to achieve various other objectives in other international forums rather than the merits of the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, after Senator Evans's curious performance this week, the Senate has the right to know what elements of the Australian aid program to black South Africans is designated to ANC-dominated urban areas as against rural areas. Why is comparable aid not provided to the great majority of blacks who live in non-urban areas-in fact, where 60 per cent of South African blacks live-in conditions that the people who live in these non-urban areas consider so unsatisfactory that hundreds of thousands of them choose to move into urban slums each year? Is it not incredible that apparently the only assistance we are giving is to the urban areas which, judging by people voting with their feet, are less worse than the rural areas? Yet we do not give assistance in any sorts of volumes to non-urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA> What is Senator Evans up to with these large amounts of money which have not gone through the normal process, despite his curious wandering around about it today? And why are these people, who simply happen not to be ANC supporters, not getting our funding? Until Senator Evans answers that question properly, we in the Opposition have every justification to be very suspicious of Senator Evans's motives. </PARA>
<PARA> If need is therefore not the main criteria for such aid-and if need were the criteria, the aid would be going to the rural areas-what is the criteria, other than the political expediency that appears to limit such aid to ANC-dominated urban areas? The Government should come clean on this matter. I get the impression that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) may be ready to proceed with the next matter. I simply urge the Foreign Minister to answer these questions that have remained unresolved as a result of his pathetic performance in the Parliament this week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to talk about a trip hosted by the United Kingdom branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) on which I recently had the honour to represent this Parliament. Each year one or two members of the Federal Parliament join with a number of delegates from a significant number of countries, counties, States and provinces within the Commonwealth of Nations. On this occasion there were 24 delegates from 19 countries. I was the only female, and I found that a little disappointing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also found the level of involvement of women in politics in other countries, including Britain, to be very much the same as here. Everywhere we are still fighting to increase the numbers and participation of women within the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> Caribbean delegates came from the Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Barbados, Bermuda, and Saint Lucia. Delegates from the African countries, including Botswana, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and Sierra Leone, would have been very interested to have heard Senator Baume's contribution today, because one issue that was of great concern to them was the fact that their fellow brothers in South Africa are still being persecuted and are still having problems. We learnt a great number of things from them. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the conference involved a session at which we were able to discuss issues of great concern to everyone. They were issues with which people can identify. One such issue was the one-party state. It was very interesting to learn that Tanzania actually is a one-party state which allows for a participatory role in the preselection of candidates at the grassroots level. It was interesting also to learn that Zambia and another state are moving away from a one-party system back to a true democracy, and I welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from their general economy, delegates from the Caribbean were concerned about the drug issue. Drug barons are able to come into low socioeconomic areas and offer farmers what seem to be huge amounts of money to grow and produce drugs instead of subsistence crops. It was a little difficult for those of us from developed countries to understand why these peasant farmers would in fact choose to go down this path of growing a crop that will only cause a great deal of heartache, sorrow, suffering and trauma in other countries. I guess we were not able to understand fully just how difficult it is to farm in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We met a number of people from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association secretariat and we also had a session at the Commonwealth secretariat. We were addressed by Chief Anyaoku. What he said proved to be very enlightening and certainly indicated to me what a very intelligent and innovative Secretary-General of the secretariat he is. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a lovely man, as Senator Giles says. It was interesting that only three of the delegates were members of upper Houses. One of those was a colleague from New South Wales; the other was from Barbados. From speaking to many of the parliamentarians, including the British, it would appear that it is very rare for members of upper Houses to be democratically elected like we are in the Federal Parliament and in New South Wales. We were asked many questions about how we managed to go about the election process and what were our roles and rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The English wanted to know the difference between the powers that we had and the powers held by members of the House of Lords. As one of the three members of the upper Houses, I was very privileged to be taken by Baroness Strange on a tour through some of the more private areas of the House of Lords. She then took us to tea in the guests dining room in the House of Lords. I shall always remember the beauty and ornateness of the rooms, including the Prince's chamber, the royal chambers and the robing room for the Queen. The workmanship and antiquity associated with the whole of the Westminster Palace is quite mind-boggling. </PARA>
<PARA> We were privileged to be able to spend some time in her company and to learn more about how things worked and the problems experienced by members of the House of Lords, particularly by those members who come down for the sittings and always participate, not those who are there just because of their title. Whilst we were of differing political opinions, we certainly found that we had a lot in common, and I place on record my gratitude for her hospitality. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in terms of hospitality and gratitude, I must thank the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Great Britain, led by the Secretary, Peter Cobb, and the Acting Chair at the time, Sir Anthony Durant, who is a long time friend of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and of Australia. We all look forward to being able to meet one another again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that this trip took place during the New South Wales election period. As a person from New South Wales who was not able to return to New South Wales by 6 p.m. on the polling day, I found it necessary to vote in London. This turned out to be rather an interesting experience. People may not know that the New South Wales Greiner Government is in the process of selling off New South Wales House on The Strand, which is shopfront area. The New South Wales Agent-General is moving to King William Street and therefore his offices will not be easily accessible to the public. Where will people vote when there is a future general election in New South Wales?</PARA>
<PARA> It was assumed that people would vote at Australia House. Of course, this was not correct. What was even worse, I do not think the New South Wales Agent General's office, the Electoral Commission or whoever was conducting the ballot in London, even had the decency to contact Australia House and discuss the possibility of using that venue. Even after several days of discussion-and this was four days after the writs had been issued-I was not able to be told when and where people could vote. It was about five days before they were told precisely where the ballot would be conducted. I thought that was a rather sloppy exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how many people in fact became totally confused and gave up in frustration at not being able to find out where and when they could vote. I have been very critical of the New South Wales Government and the Electoral Commission in this respect. I have raised the issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). It is important that he be aware that there may well be assumptions made by the New South Wales Government that in future Australia House may have to be the venue for the balloting. This is something that the New South Wales Government should have thought of before it actually had the temerity to move from this excellent shopfront area, where people were able to see and observe and be enticed, excited and stimulated to go and find out more about New South Wales and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, now all we have on The Strand-a superb location, as I am sure most honourable senators know, between South Australia House and Western Australia House-are tired, dirty, tacky, old, New South Wales Tourist Commission posters on windows. They are faded, fly-spotted and in a fairly disgraceful state of repair. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not a good image for Australia and it was certainly a shocking image for New South Wales. It annoyed and frustrated me. If it had that effect on me, I wonder what it did to other New South Wales voters who were discouraged-not helped-from exercising their democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the trip was a very exciting and rewarding experience. It is something that I would recommend to anyone to attempt. It has highlighted just how important contact with overseas parliamentarians is to learn about other forms of democracy and governing. I say to those honourable senators who are in the chamber that it was a very great privilege and honour for me to have represented the Australian Parliament in the United Kingdom. </PARA>

Senator Baume complained about the size of the sample vis-a-vis how many urban people had been sampled, how many country people had not been sampled, and so on. I find it extraordinary that in my time in the Senate I have never heard Senator Baume get up and complain about the electoral system in South Africa that disenfranchises some 20 million black people. I would have listened with more interest to his remarks if he had been willing to concede that the real obscenity in South Africa was not that in a particular survey not enough non-urban blacks had been surveyed but that no black has ever had a vote in South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I listened with considerable interest all week to Senator Baume's whingeing and whining about whether the Minister swore at a South African security policeman. Compared with what the South African security police have been doing to the majority of the black population of South Africa for the last 40 years, a bit of swearing in retribution is a very mild rebuke.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made no remarks about Inkatha in this place. When I was in South Africa, I met a representative of Inkatha and had quite a lengthy discussion with that person. I make no bones about the fact that of all the black organisations in South Africa, I believe the ANC clearly overwhelmingly represents the black people. Inkatha does have support. I am not going to argue whether it is 3 per cent, 6 per cent, 15 per cent or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By any objective measurement there is no doubt that the ANC overwhelmingly represents the political aspirations of the black population because it is a very broad based organisation. That was clear from my brief visit to South Africa. It would be clear to any person who has visited South Africa and spent any time there making an assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also quite clear that the white Government of South Africa concedes that the ANC represents most of the black people because it is the body it negotiates with; it is the body it is trying to reach agreement with on constitutional change. If the ANC did not represent the overwhelming views of the black population, it would not be invited by the white Government into negotiations. Senator Baume has allowed his emotion to run away with him in his vitriolic attacks on the ANC. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the issue of the granting of funds. Senator Baume has tied himself in knots because the Australian Government has made a grant of some $60,000 to the ANC to enable it to have a unit which provides decent technical advice on economic matters. Some time ago, the conservatives in this country used to jump up and down about the fact that the ANC was committed to rabid socialism, communist views and nationalising everything in sight. That was one of the attacks the conservatives used against the ANC. The Australian Government has provided a very modest amount of money to a body that is more than a political party-it represents a whole range of views of the broadest cross-section of black people in South Africa-so that it can understand and get technical advice about how to run a mixed economy and the Opposition jumps up and down as though this is a terrible development. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that the conservatives, who several years ago accused the ANC of being a communist front are now accusing us of enabling the ANC to receive technical advice to run a decent mixed economy, and showing political partisanship. I would have thought that even those opposite supported a mixed economy. The National Party of Australia believed, as far as the rural sector is concerned, in utter socialist policies about a subsidy for everybody. By and large, members of the Opposition believe in a mixed economy. I do not see why they would object so much to that sort of advice being made available to the ANC. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, when the Senate comes back in the second half of this year, further progress will have been made towards the ending of apartheid in South Africa and the development of a democratic non-racial constitution, and that some of the petty-mindedness of some members of the Opposition will have disappeared and they will have recognised that people of goodwill in both the ANC and the present national Government of South Africa, including President de Klerk, have achieved the end of the most abysmal and obscene system of government in the modern period. </PARA>
<PARA> This Australian Government has helped to achieve this by providing assistance to the ANC. I do not find anyone from the South African Government criticising this. People are not jumping up and down about this modest piece of assistance provided to the ANC because they know that they are going to have to work with the ANC. They know that the ANC, in one form or another, will be part of the government of South Africa in the near future. When I visited South Africa, there were plenty of people in the white community who were more than willing to say that the best thing one could do for the ANC was to assist it to come to terms with a mixed economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps Senator Baume has joined the list of anarchists who believe that the best result for South Africa is to have an ANC not with the technical capability of running a mixed economy but with the ability to fall into the spiral of a system where the ANC is not able to participate in government in a mature way. I believe that the Government's policy of providing this modest piece of assistance is the correct one and I hope that in the second half of this year when the Senate comes back those opposite will recognise the error of their ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask: what on earth is going on in the Department of Administrative Services (DAS)? Answers to questions that I have asked not only in this chamber but also in an Estimates committee reveal a Minister and a department whose purchasing reforms are too hard to handle. We all followed, particularly those on this side of the chamber, the famous Nashua case with amazement. The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) intervened in the process when he found out that that company would be happy to offer a lower price than it had put in its tender and, effectively, he told the Department to accept the new bid. When the Department resisted, the Minister directed it to do what he wanted. There were some post-offer negotiations and a compromise was found. Three relatively junior officers were sent to re-examine the process which their senior officer had said was satisfactory. Their findings came as no surprise to anyone in this place. They found that there had been some deficiencies in the process, after all. The Department took in the Minister's washing and returned it to him nicely ironed and folded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This incident has not escaped the notice of the business community. I have received a letter from a supplier of office chairs who wants to know why the principles adopted by the Minister in the Nashua case were not applied to his company. This was utterly inevitable. It is a good question and I hope that the Minister can find a convincing answer. The circumstances in this case are set out in a letter that I received recently from Sturdy Components Pty Ltd, a small Australian-owned company in Sydney which has a subsidiary in my State of Queensland. In fact, it is just the kind of company this country needs to encourage if Australia is to get out of its current economic problems.

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600 . </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Parer,</PARA>
<PARA>Sturdy Components, and our Queensland subsidiary, Tube Art, make office chairs. We bid last year for inclusion on the Commonwealth Common User Contract for office chairs. Even though our prices were among the lowest, even though Worksafe Australia passed our samples, even though our chairs have more Australian content than most, we were passed over on a technicality. </PARA>
<PARA>In spite of the Government's support for what they call ``post offer negotiation'', when a technical omission in our samples was noticed, no-one said a word to us. When we found out-too late what the problem was, we fixed it up in a day's work and at a cost of 20c a chair. </PARA>
<PARA>What was this technicality which the Department used to rule out our products? It concerns the housing for the gas spring. The specification said the housing should be solid metal. Our samples were made from extruded metal. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not deny that our sample should have conformed to what the customer wanted. What I do complain of is that no-one saw fit to give us the opportunity to correct the error. </PARA>
<PARA>But there is another question. Why was the specification written the way it was? Our sample met with all British and US Standards in this respect. But the standard used is a German draft-not even in force in Germany! We want to know why this Standard was chosen. It was not for safety reasons, because, as I have said, Worksafe found that our chairs met their requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Why was a draft German Standard used? Who persuaded the Department to adopt that standard? Which of our competitors benefited from that decision? And why was there no ``post offer negotiation'' on this point? These are all questions which Senator Bolkus has not answered. He said recently that he saw no justification for our claim to have been unfairly dealt with. Yet, in the Nashua case, the Minister was prepared to intervene personally, because he was concerned ``that an established and satisfactory supplier to the government can be put off the contract without the Department wanting to satisfy itself that it has not unfairly treated the company.'' He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Indeed, we should be making every effort to satisfy ourselves that Australian suppliers have put forward their best offers.''</PARA>
<PARA>Far from making ``every effort'' in our case, the Department kept completely quiet about the technical omission they had picked up in our samples. Why? A phone call to us, and a chance to submit new samples, would have improved the range of choice for the Commonwealth customers. </PARA>
<PARA>But nothing was done. And, when we have complained to the Minister, nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA>In the last year, however, we have continued to sell chairs to Commonwealth Departments off-contract. This year, we have made over S2m. worth of sales. The reason is simple: value for money. Our Departmental customers prefer our chairs to those ``evaluated''-for a 4 per cent fee by DAS. Our quality is good, we deliver on time and our prices are well below many of those offered from the approved panel of suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Senate recently, you asked a DAS officer whether Departments are obliged to buy on contract. The officer told you that it would be ``somewhat surprising'' for the tender process not to have chosen a ``value for money'' panel of suppliers. However, he added that ``were it able to be demonstrated, then I am sure an exemption could be found to permit that to happen.'' Surely, our $2m. sales are demonstration enough but if the Minister cares to investigate he will find plenty more evidence in his Department's files. </PARA>
<PARA>Our Commonwealth customers are voting with their feet. They are buying chairs from us. They must be doing this because they believe our product truly represents value for money. Naturally, we corrected the minor deficiency that led to the earlier arbitrary and secretive rejection during the ``evaluation'' stage. </PARA>
<PARA>We ask to be put on the contract; but we don't ask that anyone else be taken off. All we want is a fair chance for our product to compete in the market. ln the light of the DAS official's remarks in the Senate, we ask, at the very least, that the Department make it absolutely clear to Departments that, if they can get value for money with our chairs, they are not required to pass us by. </PARA>
<PARA>Above all, we ask that the Senate use its powers to investigate the whole circumstances surrounding the drawing up of specifications, the tender evaluation process and the decisions to award the contract to others whose prices were well above ours, but whose products are not preferred to ours by the actual users. </PARA>
<PARA>Your sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me describe very briefly what this letter alleges. The company makes office chairs. It tendered for the three-year common user contract when it was announced a year ago. The samples it submitted, although passed by Worksafe Australia, were rejected for an obscure technicality by DAS officers. Unlike the Nashua case, however, no-one intervened to give the company a chance to correct a slight omission. There was no Minister waiting to intervene. It was a small omission-certainly nothing as serious as a price revision-and, as the company says, a telephone call and a day's work could have fixed up the problem. There were no post-offer negotiations in this case; in fact, the cost of rectifying the anomaly would have cost the company 20c.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This letter raises serious questions about what is going on with the tendering process these days. Why were the specifications written in the curious way this letter alleges? Who stood to benefit, and did they benefit? What the Department did was use an obscure German standard that is not used even by the Germans. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly do not approve of what the Minister did in the Nashua case, as has been made very clear in this place. But this case was somewhat different. The omission was slight and could have been easily corrected. Why was the opportunity to do so never taken? The Department itself says that post-offer negotiations are a legitimate technique for obtaining value for money. Why did no-one contact this company? This letter raises a wider issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to acknowledge Senator Baume's interjection. I have received complaints from all sorts of people that the Minister and his Department are forcing departments to buy on-contract where a common user contract has been awarded; yet, the special three-person committee of review, in its report on the Nashua case, made it quite clear that there is absolutely no legal compulsion on departments to do so. In the same spirit, evidence before the Estimates committee made it clear that if departments can get value for money off-contract there is nothing to stop them from doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask again: what on earth is going on in the Department of Administrative Services? Surely, it is time for the Parliament to have a long, close look at these cases-and there are certainly more. The Nashua case and the letter that I have just incorporated raise questions that must be answered. Perhaps the appropriate forum is the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or a committee of the Senate. In any case, I inform the Minister that we will continue to ask questions about these anomalies within his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Following receipt of the letter which I have tabled, I subsequently received a further letter. I was somewhat surprised at the readiness with which this company was prepared to come out into the open because, in most cases when companies report to me on problems they are having with a Minister or a department, they tend to take the view `Let's not make waves on this because it may affect future tenders'. I am advised by this company that it could not care less; it has had enough and it wants the matter brought out into the open. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 June, I received another letter from the Managing Director of Sturdy Components in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>You will remember that we were denied access to the common user contract for office chairs on a technicality, even though our product was offered at a more competitive price and is in fact the preferred brand for many Commonwealth departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>I do hope that you will be able to agree that the whole issue of DAS tendering deserves to be examined very closely by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>We feel this all the more now, because we have just had word that our associated company in Brisbane- Tube Art-has been successful in its tender to supply office chairs to the Queensland Government. These chairs will be made to the same high standards we observe in all our products and will of course, meet the specifications the Commonwealth has set for this kind of chair. We will naturally include the minor technical adjustment-</PARA>
<PARA>the one to which I referred earlier which cost 20c-</PARA>
<PARA>on which DAS ruled us out without consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure it will be good news to you as a Senator from Queensland to hear of our latest success. More important from our viewpoint, however, is the fact that this success only serves to lay more emphasis on our discontent with the treatment we have had at Commonwealth level. </PARA>

The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is insulting not only the chamber but also the constituency in the broader community. Let me quickly read a letter that I have just received that, I think, is most important to this issue. It is from the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, Mr Peter Taylor, and is addressed to Mr Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I congratulate you on the stand you have taken over wool tax. The political events that occurred around the wool industry in recent months had caused our farmers to believe that under any government their future livelihood was bleak. You have given them hope that there can be a worthwhile future for those who survive the trying time ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Irrespective of the level of wool tax determined by the Government, your action will dispel the despondency out there in the bush far more than you can imagine. </PARA>
<PARA>It is hard for a woolgrower to keep going when he feels nobody is on his side. I believe you have largely restored our faith that there can be some parties, and individual politicians, who do have the resolve to offer better alternative government in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the farmers in New South Wales I thank you for your effort and determination. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by Peter Taylor. I think that letter is indicative of what we on this side, and I hope the Australian Democrats, are standing for in this important debate. We have gone through all the economics; we have gone through all the other issues. They are quite clear. The Government obviously has something to hide in the actions it has taken today in that it is not prepared to accept the will of the chamber when it was so clear on 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to speak from a blank page, for the information of Senator Walsh. The only figure that has ever been put on that blank page by the Australian Democrats, in moving the Government to some form of compromise to see that it takes into account the very things the wool industry was trying to give it and the very things the wool industry was trying to convince the Government needed to be taken into account, is the figure of 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently in this chamber I accused the Government of not having accepted the responsibility to bring to the industry a package which could work, a package which could be grasped with sufficient enthusiasm by the industry to take it into the next century. I know that the Opposition will not like to hear this, but it is hearing an indication of how to represent a position and stick to it until that position is agreed to. The tactics which were necessary to bring this position about are tactics which could be well taken up by people who purport to represent the rural industry of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the word `pain' the other night. There has been pain felt by those who thought that the Government could not move. There has also been quite an amount of misunderstanding of the figures that were necessary. I have argued in this place many times over the past couple of days that it is not just a matter of figures, and I am pleased to say that the package of Bills which is to be used to administer the wool industry has the endorsement and the understanding of those involved in the wool industry. It is as much because that package will not be compromised that we see a reason for supporting the Government in this move today. </PARA>
<PARA> The package is crucial to the level of confidence that I was seeking. It is something on which I was ready to challenge the Government. When we recently heard that there was a threat to regulate all levels of tax-25 per cent was the threat which offended me first-I was ready to challenge the Government merely to regulate the figure that it thought best. But, of course, I had forgotten that the industry, on the other hand, required the package to operate in the best manner for the next decade. So it is with pleasure that I see that the Government is reminding us of the need to have that package in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I must comment on the annoying strategy that had to be adopted to get this legislation through to this place. If this is the position which is most suitable, I cannot understand why we had the charade that we saw earlier and why we had to subject so many people to inconvenience in respect of travel arrangements or whatever. It certainly was not inconvenient to me but I know that members of both the coalition and the Government were subjected to inconvenience and I really do wonder about the sincerity with which this debate is being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are some, even in our Party, who were unable to understand what the Government was offering at various stages. I had said that I wanted to see the complete answer. I know that Senator Kernot and Senator Spindler in particular were subjected to a great deal of difficulty because they had trusted my judgment when I said that the Government is not offering what we have asked for. Now that I have to say that the Government is offering what we asked for, their question is: why did the Government not offer it before? I am unable to give them an answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, we have the offer, we have the package, we have the explanation, and we have the commitment from the Minister to the very large question I asked, which was: has the Government given a commitment to the industry to make this number work; it is not just a matter of saying, `Oh, well, any number will do.'? We do have a firm number. We have the number of the Democrats, the Vines committee, the Wool Council of Australia and the first ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report-the number which first appeared and was endorsed by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Kerin endorsed the 12 per cent when it was first proposed by the Vines committee. The changes which have occurred in the industry since that period in April are changes which I believe no longer make necessary the second part of the Vines committee report. Those changes are probably worth $500m to the industry. I am unable to calculate that but the Vines committee was able to say that the only way that 12 per cent would work would be if $250m of capital injection were provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the very favourable changes that have occurred, which were listed by Opposition speakers such as Senator Crane and Senator Panizza, have enabled us to reach the situation now where 12 per cent can be sustained without the necessity for $250m to be injected each year for two years. So we have reached that position and we are able now to support the Government in its move towards the Democrats' original position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to stand here and criticise the Australian Democrats' decision. I will let the woolgrowers judge them for what they have done. They held out for far longer than I had ever expected. However, I want to mention the members of the Wool Council of Australia. They are the ones who, today and for a mighty long time, have let the woolgrowers of Australia down. They are not democratically elected and I hope that in time the industry will get around to democratically electing its peak body. All along they gave no indication that they support the growers in terms of 10 per cent. They went for 12 per cent and even fed the Government figures that made it easy to justify 15 per cent.

I rang back every hour, and each time I was told, `We'll get back to you in a quarter of an hour'. That went on until it was time to come in here. So it is more interested in keeping its 400 or 500 people employed than keeping farmers on their places. The Nationals and the Liberals can look any woolgrower in the face from this day onward. That is more than the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia can do. </PARA>

The Leader of the National Party in this place has misinterpreted and misstated what Senator Bell said just 20 minutes ago. Senator Bell said, `Our figure is 12 per cent. We have not got it; therefore we stay where we are, at 10 per cent'. We did not have 12 per cent. Earlier this week in the vote we put up 12 per cent, but we did not get it from the Government or the Opposition.

The consistent position is here before us today. The figure we sought was 12 per cent. We did not get it, so then we had to choose either a hurdle of 15 per cent, which is too high for the industry or, reluctantly, 10 per cent. The Hansard will show that that is what Senator Bell said. That is where we went. Again today he said, `We have not got 12 per cent; we have 12.5 per cent. That is not our 12 per cent. We will not take it; we will stay where we are'. I just repeat the point Senator Bell made before. The way this has happened has not been satisfactory to us or to anybody else in this place. If the Minister knew he was prepared to go to 12 per cent, he could have gone to it days ago, and should have gone to it at least hours ago. But 12 per cent was our figure if the Government was prepared to give it to us. It has been the industry's figure since April, and that is where we have stayed. That is where we are now.

It then moved to 12 1/2 per cent and said it could not go one single point below 12 1/2 per cent. But as soon as the Government was pushed far enough, it caved in, and now we have 12 per cent. If the Australian Democrats had stuck to 10 per cent, the Government would have accepted 10 per cent. It knows our figures are correct and it would have accepted 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said to Senator Bell, I think he has done more for the Democrats than any other member has done in the past. He has stuck at this longer than anyone else has. I hope the woolgrowers accept that and understand that he has wonderful potential. But eventually he caved in. I do not really blame him. Senator Bell was in the room with Senator Cook and we know how Senator Cook can bully and intimidate. Then Senator Bell was in the room with Mr Crean, and we all know Mr Crean's tactics. This lot has been taught from birth how to deal with someone who is not going their way. Their bullying, intimidation and vitriol--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. That is what is being voted for in this chamber. We are not voting for it. For Senator Powell to stand up and say that the Australian Democrats have not shifted their position is blatantly wrong. I want to say something about the Government's performance on this matter. Over the last week it has been playing darts or poker, or dice, with the wool industry. It started off with 15 per cent, then it made an offer of 14 per cent, then 13 per cent was talked about, and then it became 12 1/2 per cent. That is not how government is run. That is not how industry is run. We on this side of the chamber have consistently asked the Government to put its figures on the table so they can be examined and scrutinised. Where are they? The Government will not put them on the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our figures are on the table and I would like somebody to show us where they are wrong. It has not been demonstrated to us that they are wrong. I think it is very important to note that particular fact. We have seen the wool industry being played with politically and we have seen the Australian Democrats being conned in terms of what we are voting for in this place today. I just want to emphasise that it is not a 12 per cent tax rate, it is 15 per cent with a promise of 12 per cent at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make a point with regard to the Vines inquiry. We keep on getting the Vines inquiry thrown up at us. The Vines report was a good document on the day and it gave a lot of information to this industry, but it is out of date today. There are so many things that have changed. The wool industry is a dynamic industry; it is operating in a dynamic market. I want to emphasise, as I did last night, that it is appalling to me that the Government cannot show the same confidence in the wool industry as is being indicated through the futures market. The figures which I tabled last night indicate very clearly how the world is looking at our wool industry today, and the sorts of prices that people are prepared to pay for wool into the next 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I will close my comments by repeating that not only am I disappointed with the position that the Democrats have adopted, but also it is substantially different from the position they were at the other night. They are not going to pull the wool over our eyes on this side of the chamber, nor are they going to pull the wool over the eyes of the woolgrowers of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the long hours, days, weeks and months of this debate on the wool tax, woolgrowers have indicated that they want a 10 per cent levy only. The representative groups of woolgrowers have indicated that. My colleagues thought that the Australian Democrats would go along with them. They did hold for a while, but I predicted yesterday that they would cave in, like they do, not because I do not think that Senator Bell is genuine-maybe he is-but because I knew that Senator Powell is only in it for the cheap political points. She is very anti-farmer and antirural. The Democrats do it all the time-they go around pretending that they want to support rural industries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to this debate on the Wool Tax (Nos. 1 to 5) Amendment Bills, and I am concerned about the unusual situation that we have got into. A statement was made to the chamber by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) which indicated that there would be an undertaking by the Government that there would be a rate of 12 per cent tax for the next year in lieu of the 15 per cent contained in the legislation, but that 15 per cent will be in the legislation when it is passed by the Parliament. I would like to make the point that the Government still has not convinced the Senate-and I mean the majority of the Senate-that the 15 per cent rate is required in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A vast range of factors have been alluded to in the debate by Senator Tambling and other Opposition senators, Senator Bell on behalf of the Democrats and Senator Boswell. There has been a range of factors, all of which are very changeable. The Government itself has admitted that the 12 per cent rate, given the current circumstances, is too high. I will give an example. The wool sales yesterday and today in Launceston cleared the floor. That is one of the factors which suggest that there should be an even lower rate than the Vines suggestion. What I am proposing to the Committee is that, if the Government is now saying 12 per cent, then we should have that not only as an assurance from the Minister, but also as part of the motion, and that it should be 12 per cent in lieu of 15 per cent in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am inclined to move an amendment to the motion to that effect. The motion would read:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Senate does not further press its request for an amendment to each of the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991 to which the House of Representatives has again not made, and agrees to the amendment made to each bill by the House of Representatives in place thereof provided that a ceiling rate of tax of 12% is fixed by regulation in lieu of the 15% contained in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That situation surely must commend itself to the whole of the Senate. I say `ceiling' because as factors are developing now, we may have a situation where that ceiling is too high and we may have to come down, or the Government may see its way clear to reducing that to 10 per cent, 8 per cent or whatever. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the motion add ``provided that a ceiling rate of tax of 12% is fixed by regulation in lieu of the 15% contained in the legislation.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the issues that have been raised by Senator Harradine regarding the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991, let me say that I can understand the tenet of what he is trying to achieve and the principles he is trying to get at. Unfortunately, we have the situation where Senator Harradine has had to adopt the traditional role that has been taken by the Australian Democrats, that is, to keep the bastards honest. Therefore, one can understand the expression that Senator Harradine is making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I cannot support the amendment that Senator Harradine is putting forward because that still means that the level of tax would be 12 per cent. We have argued and will continue to argue that the ceiling figure should be 10 per cent and the Democrats know that full well. They have done this conniving deal with the Government. They have not even got the original deal that they said they were going to do of putting in a ceiling figure of 12 per cent. They have walked right away from that. They have let the Government leave the 15 per cent rate in the Bill and give a commitment that it will regulate for 12 per cent in the first year, but no commitment whatsoever for the second, the third or whatever years after that. The Democrats have been conned. They have been sold down the river and Senator Harradine is, in some way, trying to patch up the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I respect Senator Harradine for what he is doing, but I indicate that the fundamental issue is: what is in the interests of the woolgrowers? What is in the interests of the thousands of farmers and small towns? The Democrats have shown that they are again prepared to be chameleons in this Parliament and agents of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

What the Government is doing through the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills is attempting to pull a sham-to bring in a sham wool tax and, unfortunately, the Australian Democrats have connived with the Government in this conspiracy. Contrary to what Senator Bell and Senator Powell have argued, what we are seeing is not the Democrats getting what they originally wanted. If the Democrats were getting what they originally wanted, the Government would have come into this chamber and said, `We are going to amend the Bill to 12 per cent'. But the Government has not said it is going to do that. The Government has said, `We will make you a promise to regulate the tax to 12 per cent'. There is a grave difference between 12 per cent by legislation and 12 per cent by regulation. The point that we on this side of the chamber make is that the Government cannot be trusted, and we are gravely disappointed that the Democrats did not hold the line.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to reply to many of the views expressed in this debate on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills. However, in view of what has now occurred with the intervention of Senator Harradine with an amendment, and in view of the speech just delivered and some of the others, an explanation is required and, probably, encouragement to those speakers to become more familiar with the precise terms of the legislation before the chamber. If they had been so familiar, they would not have made the observations that they did make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills, as drafted now, give the Minister power to set a rate below 15 per cent for the year 1991-92 only. After that, a consultative mechanism checks in which provides a way for industry opinion to be gauged and advice offered to the Minister about the appropriate level of rate. That means that the Wool Council of Australia and the Wool Research and Development Corporation will be required to consult; annual general meetings of woolgrowers will make recommendations to the Minister; and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission also must consult with the Wool Council in recommending a tax rate. So there is a process as to how any other rates should be set which involves extensive consultation with the industry and enables the industry's view to be articulated properly in advice to the Minister so that the Minister can then set the rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of that, I think it would be inappropriate to proceed with an amendment-even if it had standing, and I am advised that, in the form in which it is put, it has not-in the form in which Senator Harradine has moved. I think that a clear explanation, which I hope I have just given, answers those honourable senators opposite who have raised this question and, in particular, the last speaker, Senator O'Chee, who seems to have a defective understanding of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the reason I moved my amendment was not that I have shifted in my conviction that the rate should be no higher than 10 per cent but my recognition of the fact that the rate is going to be fixed by regulation at 12 per cent. I understand what the Minister is saying about the question of consultation because it is in the legislation. My amendment says `a ceiling of 12 per cent'. The ceiling in the legislation at present is 15 per cent. What is the difference between having a ceiling per an undertaking by the Minister and a ceiling in the legislation, whether or not consultation takes place? In view of the fact that it is obvious that my amendment is not going to hit the deck, I will seek the leave of the chamber to withdraw it. But I put it forward, I must say, on the basis that we were faced with a difficult situation. I will now be voting against the motion moved by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to recognise that in taking the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 1991 back to the Committee of the Whole, the Australian Democrats have shown by their vote that they are not prepared to stand by their commitment to the rural constituency which they have been so actively canvassing. They have failed to recognise and meet the thousands of representations that must have been made to them in recent days and weeks on this important matter. It is important to ensure that there is stability in this important industry. However, the depreciation of any support by the Democrats shows them for exactly what they are-sheer chameleons who are to the extreme left wing of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having been provoked by Senator Tambling in this debate on the wool legislation, I feel the need to reply. I remind the Senate of the positions taken by coalition senators. First, we had 15 per cent and they said, `Sorry, folks, we can't do anything about it'. Then we had 8 per cent plus a slaughter scheme. Then they said, `We might go to 12 if anyone will believe us'. Then we had 10 per cent and they said, `We are not going to go anywhere'. What has been achieved? The position of the Democrats has been 12 per cent every month, 12 per cent every time, and what have we got now? We have 12 per cent. Fait accompli.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again take the opportunity to quickly put on the record the coalition's stance with regard to the shameful dealing that has taken place here tonight. I refer to the way the Government has dealt with this Bill and the ad hoc and totally changing mood of the Australian Democrats. The Democrats have sold out on this issue, they have sold their soul. The legislative package that has been put through was not in the terms that the Democrats said that they would support, even in their own initial proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me also remind the Senate that the Democrats tax policies, which will hit country people and small businesses, include increased excise on petrol and diesel fuel, a levy on all domestic road freight movements, the change in pay as you earn deduction procedures which would impose a further burden on employers, an increase in company taxes for companies grossing over $100,000, the taxing of trusts as companies and the reintroduction of death duties for properties worth more than $300,000. They will introduce a federal land tax, continue and even strengthen the capital gains tax, tax agricultural chemicals to discourage their use, abolish the live sheep export trade and increase tariffs on goods coming into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise what Alan Wood said in the Australian:</PARA>
<PARA>Not only is a vote for the Democrats a wasted vote, it is also a dangerous vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very important at this point to make it quite clear that the 10 per cent figure to which we were driven by the failure of the Government to support our 12 per cent earlier was never deliverable to the wool industry. We, through our actions in the Senate, made it necessary for the Government to operate under the old legislation where the figure was 25 per cent but with the discretion in the hands of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who was never going to give the industry 10 per cent. Ten per cent was never deliverable. Leaving aside the thuggery-and I agree with Senator O'Chee that it was thuggery to threaten 25 per cent-we have to face the fact that the Minister had the discretion to go anywhere up to 25 per cent. He was not going to 10 per cent. He has gone to 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Many program areas of the Department have given varying degrees of consideration to employing some form of direct marketing.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Direct marketing should achieve better targeting of information and provide greater access to the department's programs and services. Direct marketing also provides information which is used to design better information campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Direct mail, telephone canvassing and advertisements requiring a response are the main forms of direct marketing.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Funds for direct marketing are provided as part of both general running costs and program specific appropriations and are not separately identifiable as a budget item in Budget expenditure terms. Procedures for separately reporting expenditure on direct marketing would add to the complexity of the Department's financial management systems. This would be difficult to justify given the emphasis under the current financial reforms on outcomes rather than inputs and the fact that there is no requirement to report separately on marketing related expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Department maintains a number of mailing lists which are used to send relevant information to interested groups, companies, individuals and organisations (many of which are recipients of Commonwealth funding). These lists are updated and amended periodically.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Material relevant to the portfolio has been distributed through mailing lists held by the Department over the financial year. Examples include:</PARA>
<PARA> * `New Times for Older Australians' is a newsletter for older people which covers a variety of issues of concern to older people. It is prepared four times a year and distributed through a variety of mailing lists including nursing homes, hostels, hospitals, Department of Social Security offices, Home and Community Care providers, Geriatric Assessment Teams, Migrant Resource Centres and Senior Citizens Centres;</PARA>
<PARA> * an `Employer Information Kit-Child Care for the l990s, Meeting the Need Together' was distributed in November 1990 to agencies on a mailing list developed by Child Care Division. The mailing list included companies with more than 500 employees, child care consultancies and peak organisations with an interest in child care;</PARA>
<PARA> * an information package was sent to all University careers centres and student organisations in March outlining career opportunities for graduates in the Department. Packages contained a brochure on the Department's functions and a pamphlet on graduate opportunities;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Improvements to the fee relief system introduced in community based centres on 1 October 1990 and extended to commercial and employer sponsored child care centres on 1 January 1990, were estimated to increase the number of places in employer and commercial centres by 28 000 over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA> The increase is estimated for the sector and no estimates have been made of what proportion might be located at the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Commercial Long Day Child Care in November 1988 indicated that there were some 23 000 full time child care places provided by commercial operators. It was estimated that in March 1990, there would be a further 5 000 full time places available through new services and through shorter hours services extending their hours of operation to offer full time care.</PARA>
<PARA> All child care services participating in the fee relief scheme agree to take part in the annual Child Care Census. The first census of commercial and employer provided care is planned to take place in August 1991. The information collected in this census will give a clearer picture of the number and type of new services which have commenced operation since March 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services is aware of six companies which have, since March 1990, commenced providing a total of six long day services and one vacation care service for the use of children of their employees. These companies are listed below. It should be noted that only those companies which contact the Department for advice and/or access to fee relief are known. Other companies may set up service provision independently.</PARA>

<PARA>* Date of opening: January 1991</PARA>
<PARA>* Number of places: 30 places for 4-11 yr olds</PARA>
<PARA>* located on-site</PARA>
<PARA> Smaller employers who wish to provide child care facilities for their employees are able to enter into joint arrangements with child care centres. To provide an incentive to employers considering this option, changes were made recently to the Fringe Benefits Tax Act to exempt from fringe benefits tax the amount of the contribution made to reserve places in an eligible child care facility. An example of the above is IBM, an information technology firm based in Baulkham Hills, Sydney, which has reserved 10 places for 8 years in a 40 place long day care community based service located close to their headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA> Forward-looking employers are increasingly recognising the importance of child care to a more flexible, productive workforce at the enterprise level. Government is keen to support employer sponsored child care to further its social justice and labour market objectives and to address the issues of supply and affordability of child care services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has produced some key resources to promote interest in employer sponsored child care, including an employer information kit and a booklet ``Tax Concessions for Employer Sponsored Child Care''. In addition, the Department of Employment, Education and Training has recently released a study on employer attitudes to the provision of child care services, ``Corporate Child Care: Management's View''.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is currently developing two publications for distribution to employers within the next few months covering child care service options available to employers and Australian examples of employer sponsored child care. It is anticipated that these resources will further boost employer provision of child care services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As stated in the 1991 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Forestry Operations in the Eden Management Area by the Forestry Commission of New South Wales (FCNSW), the timber resource loss arising from the October 1990 Commonwealth/NSW agreement on the South East Forests is approximately:</PARA>
<PARA> - 10 per cent for sawlog; and</PARA>
<PARA> - 5 per cent for pulpwood.</PARA>
<PARA> As the sawlog loss and pulpwood loss are calculated from different bases, it is inappropriate to combine the resource loss of these two products into one aggregate figure.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Initial estimates provided by the NSW Government in October 1990 indicated that the reservation system agreed between the Commonwealth and New South Wales would result in an 11.5 per cent sawlog removal. While estimates have subsequently been revised a number of times, the FCNSW 1991 EIS provides the most recent figure.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The figures on resource loss provided on page 60 of the FCNSW EIS quite clearly separate sawlog and pulpwood. In my media statement of 8 October 1990, my reference to timber resource loss was in relation to the sawlog industry which is the key factor affecting the sawlog driven industry of the South East Forests.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Whilst the Commonwealth has been involved in consideration of resource data for the purpose of export licensing and examination of reservation proposals, it is the responsibility of the State Government to manage detailed resource data and to decide on public access to it. The NSWFC EIS for Forestry Operations in the Eden Management Area, which contains the above data, is available to the public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) There is no clearly defined defence industry sector in Australia for which the information sought is available. While Defence work represents a substantial share of business for some producers, most suppliers of Defence goods and services provide for a number of markets. Defence procurement is believed to account for about 1% of the value of manufacturing industry's output.</PARA>
<PARA>The estimated value of Australian defence industry output expressed on an annual basis from 1983-84 to the present can only be approximated from Department of Defence outlays. The main elements of Department of Defence outlays on defence related materiel are shown in the following table.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) There are a number of practical difficulties associated with estimating defence related exports. While the Department of Defence keeps records of permits issued for defence related and dual use exports, year on year comparisons are complicated as the coverage for dual use items has changed with COCOM guidelines through the years. Prior to May 1989, the controls were limited to the 13 COCOM-proscribed countries (Warsaw Pact plus China, Vietnam and North Korea). Since then, the export controls cover exports to all destinations. For dual use exports under the COCOM regime, the interpretation of future series of annual permit values will be complicated further by the November 1990 agreement to free up trade for a wide range of dual use goods among COCOM members. Formal application for permits is no longer required across this range of products for COCOM destinations.</PARA>
<PARA>As for realised exports, there is no formal requirement for industry to report back on actual exports made in relation to permits granted. For defence related exports, some information on actual exports has been collected over the past two years.</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, it is not feasible to provide a meaningful estimate of the percentage of the value of Australian defence industry output.</PARA>
<PARA>The following two tables provide the values of approved export applications.</PARA>

<PARA>(c) Statistics on actual exports were not kept in the Department of Defence for these years.</PARA>

<PARA>The coasters have not been funded by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The Australian Council of Education Centres, a national body which represents education centres across Australia, recently funded the production and distribution of these coasters promoting education centres. Education centres are incorporated bodies which generate income from a range of sources. An acknowlegement of the Commonwealth's contribution to individual education centres appeared on these coasters. The Commonwealth does not fund the Australian Council of Education Centres.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. However, I reiterate the answer to a Question without Notice I gave to the Senate on 17 October 1990 that Australia and Japan are both alliance partners of the United States and have in common a strong commitment to ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. It is important that we understand each other's strategic perceptions of the changing strategic environment and resultant policies. With this in mind, we have sought to expand the range of defence contacts between Australia and Japan to encompass ongoing dialogue on strategic and international security issues of interest to both of us.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5423" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Printing costs for the booklet were $59,340. Other production costs are not readily identifiable.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The guide is produced to correspond with changes in rates and conditions, often arising from legislation amendment. In 1990/91 two editions were published; September 1990 March 1991 and March-June 1991 .</PARA>
<PARA> (3) &amp;(4) Distribution costs for the guide cannot be specifically identified as the booklet is distributed usually as part of a package which includes the booklet, a large wallchart and a pocket rate card. The guide is distributed to people on the Department's mailing list and in bulk to Department of Social Security Offices for distribution over the counter or by individual mailings. Full year costs are estimated at $180,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) September 1990 edition: 591,000 copies (six months' supply); March 1991 edition: 381,000 copies (three months' supply).</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Mailing costs for the Department's rates information products in Tasmania are based on weight and not envelope size. A4 envelopes were used because the majority of people on the mailing list receive multiple copies of the publications and it was considered more efficient to use a single size envelope in the bulk despatch process.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Department conducts periodic reviews to ensure the currency of its mailing list. This includes questionnaires to addressees. In Tasmania, this process was completed last in October 1990. Also, the list is amended as organisations and individuals advise the Department of changes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) While the Department takes great care to ensure its mailing list is as accurate as possible, not all listed organisations or individuals notify the Department of changes. Where mail is returned the mailing list is amended accordingly.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5423" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Air Traffic Control procedures in use at Townsville Airport, common both to the RAAF and CAA, are detailed in the Manual of Air Traffic Services. This manual is used by military and civilian air traffic controllers throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At Townsville, civil and military aircraft operate with equal priority and are sequenced accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The aircraft involved in the alleged incident at Townsville were not on a RAAF training flight. In fact they were a pair of RNZAF A4 Skyhawk aircraft in transit from Darwin. The fact that they arrived at Townsville at about the same time as a scheduled airline flight was a coincidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The pilot in command of the Australian Airlines flight elected to carry out a missed approach, which is a published standard procedure, when advised that the runway was not clear for a landing. The height to initiate the missed approach is 600 feet.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) A missed approach is a procedure which is trained for and entails no risk to the aircraft and passengers. An aircraft can abort a landing sequence at any point including just after touch-down without risk.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The military aircraft involved in this incident were not on a training flight. There was no risk to the safety of the Australian Airlines flight. This flight suffered a delay to its arrival because of a combination of adverse weather and the last minute unserviceability of ground navigation equipment which also caused the RNZAF A4 aircraft to be delayed in their landing.</PARA>
<PARA> The common air traffic procedures which are applied to both military and civil aircraft at Townsville ensure that the mix of civil and military aircraft operating there do so in a safe and expeditious manner. Delays to operations are, at times, unavoidable and may be caused equally by both civil and military aircraft. Changes to existing procedures are not required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 May 1991, (Hansard, page 3375) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the Commissioner of Taxation is denying primary producers the right to change the basis of valuation of livestock in these recessed conditions from cost to market price under a section 33 discretion of the Income Tax Assessment Act? This refusal is based on the grounds that a general fluctuation in livestock prices, where the market movement is one occasioned by widely prevailing economic circumstances, is not sufficient to warrant a change in the manner in which taxation on livestock is assessed. Is not such a decision uncaring, unreasonable and destructive? Will not such decisions cause unwanted financial hardship to primary producers caused by a collapse in sheep livestock market prices?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has, wherever possible, adopted a sympathetic approach in exercising his discretion under section 33 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, the Commissioner as a matter of public duty must take into account all considerations relevant to the intent of that section in order to exercise his discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> Until 1936, a primary producer's election to adopt either cost or market value for stock on hand was irrevocable. This was changed with the enactment of section 33. Section 33 provides that a taxpayer shall not, except without the leave of the Commissioner, adopt a basis of valuation of his live stock taken into account at the end of the year of income different from the basis on which the valuation of his livestock was made when it was last taken into account at the end of a previous year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the amendment stated that the election to change may be made, for instance, where a partnership is created and the various members desire a common basis for bringing the value of the livestock of the partnership to account.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner takes the view that the enactment of section 33 was made to apply in very narrow circumstances, such as where there was a change in the business arrangements, and that it was not enacted so as to allow primary producers to change the basis of valuation of stock on hand because of mere price fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA>If a primary producer was able to change the basis of valuation because of changes in seasonal or economic conditions the Commissioner could be placed in the situation of never being able to arrive at the true profit of the primary producer. This state of affairs could be maintained on an indefinite basis, due to the rise or fall in prices in the rural sector. A consistent method of valuation is needed for the Commissioner to make a proper assessment of a taxpayer's income.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, few primary producers if any, would be able to ascertain accurately the cost price of their live-stock after having adopted market value for one or more years. This would be a particular problem in relation to live stock acquired by natural increase in the year following acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA> Primary producers are entitled to average their incomes over five years and can also participate in the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme. It is these provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act which have been designed to compensate farmers for the fluctuations in their incomes. Few other taxpayers have these or similar entitlements.</PARA>
