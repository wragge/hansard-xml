<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>* That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA>* That the right to life to all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA>* That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA>* That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA>* That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA>* That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA>And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Arms Trade</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned petitioners draw to the attention of the Senate the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which armed conflict such as the Gulf War can occur.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should demand that the Australian Government:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations: government and private.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and arms-related technology.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) cancel the AIDEX 91 arms bazaar.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA> The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate condemns the Labor Government's failure in the 1991-92 Budget to address the education reforms Australia needs and notes in particular that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) students will have to pay more to finance Mr Dawkin's and Mr Baldwins' failure to deal with the structural problems in higher education;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Labor Government programs impose excessive regulation, centralisation and bureaucratic controls in higher education, in TAFE and in schools;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) genuine autonomy should be returned to education institutions, autonomy which this Government denies, but which should once more allow education institutions more control over their own enrolment procedures, over their revenue, over a deregulated fee structure to reflect individual courses, over salaries, and over price flexibility to allow for greater competition;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) thousands of Australian students seeking enrolment in higher education are continuing to be turned away and are barred from the access currently afforded to overseas students-30 000 Australian students are unable to gain admission;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Labor Government policies continue to hinder the free establishment of responsible non-government schools, thus denying to thousands of Australian families their own choice of preferred school enrolment for their children;</PARA>

<PARA> (g) the Hawke-Kerin Budget reveals the lack of any strategy by the Government to cope with the increasing pressures being imposed on education and training and that, without such a strategy, more dollars will not lead Australia closer to being the `clever country'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening when we were debating the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, I made the point that while we have no objection to this legislation-it is something that is necessary to better manage the importation and exportation of our wildlife-nonetheless it is a minuscule step in the right direction in relation to the protection of our wildlife. There are far more serious matters to be dealt with which go well beyond this sort of legislation and which the Government, despite promises to address it, has consistently failed to address over a long period-questions of biodiversity and questions of the protection of endangered species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday I drew attention to the well-documented fact that Australia has the worst record in the world for the extinction of species. That relates only to those large and obvious species which are in the public consciousness and about which we know a great deal. This legislation totally ignores the loss of vast ecosystems which almost certainly correlate with the damage to soil structure, the loss of soil and the deterioration in the quality of the soil throughout much of Australia. The vast changes in the ecosystems across much of Australia which have occurred in last 200 years have undoubtedly resulted in very substantial change and the loss of many species about which we know very little. Further, one could reflect on the paltry amount of money that is being put into the biological survey program. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in a speech some months ago, one very well-known expert on wildlife in Australia commented to me that at the present rate of work on the biological survey it will be the year 3000 before we have a thorough understanding of the species of plants and animals we have in Australia, their interrelationships, and their total ecological needs for long term protection and management. The Budget before us does nothing to address this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Just before I sat down last night I was making the point that the Australian Democrats therefore call on the Government to consider seriously-in consultation with the community, conservation, industry, farm, fishing and forestry groups-a 200-year Australian conservation plan which contains aims, objectives, goals and action plans and which contains funding targets for at least the first 10 years of this plan. It is only if we take that longer term view that we will really seriously address this very threatening problem-threatening in terms of not understanding the life support system without which continuation of human existence in Australia may well be jeopardised. I have already drawn attention to the well established fact that very often species will finally disappear years or decades after the conditions which have led to their slow demise have been set in train. Those processes are very often ill understood and irreversible. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are calling for this 200-year Australian conservation plan. If it is good enough for the Government to build this Parliament House to last 200 years, surely it is good enough for that Parliament to prepare a plan to ensure that our environmental heritage is protected for that same length of time; otherwise it is not difficult to imagine standing outside this building in 200 years time and finding that it is indeed the only thing left. </PARA>
<PARA> This conservation plan can be implemented through a coordinated strategy of environmental management programs which we have entitled the natural biodiversity program, for want of a better title. It should include both survey research and pro-active measures to identify, protect and repair the habitats that are needed to sustain species. This program has been detailed in the Democrat's alternative budgets, both last year and this year, and I direct honourable senators' attention to that program. It describes the need to integrate the management of all extinction threatening processes. That does not mean looking just at the species which this legislation before us does; it also means looking at the habitat, ecology, the total interrelationships of species and, as several other honourable senators have said-I think Senator Calvert mentioned it last night-protecting endangered species and controlling feral animals. </PARA>
<PARA> We support this legislation. We feel it is a small step in the right direction, but it is only a minuscule step. It does not go nearly far enough in terms of addressing the very serious problems of protecting Australia's endangered species both now and into the more distant future. Without a more serious attempt to address that problem, our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very depopulated and a very poor environment. It will be one in which the rich biological diversity of animal and plant species which populated this country 200 years ago, some of them unique, will be very much diminished and the quality of life of our children and grandchildren will be the poorer for that. </PARA>
<PARA> We make this plea that the Government address these other issues with much more alacrity than it has with this Bill which has been around for quite some time. The paucity of environmental legislation that comes before this chamber indicates the very low priority that this Government gives to environmental management and environmental matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In summing up the debate on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991, without wasting the time of the chamber by reiterating the comments made by speakers in the second reading debate last night and this morning, I thank those people who have participated in the debate. I note that both Senator Calvert and Senator Coulter have made very lengthy and considered contributions, and that is not to denigrate those who spoke more succinctly. I thank all contributors to the debate for their support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the extent that people have damned the Bill with faint praise by saying that it is a small step in the right direction but that it does not go far enough, I do not think at any stage it was considered that the Bill was one of the great leaps forward legislatively. As everybody has said, the Bill was merely a further step in the right direction. No one piece of legislation will deal with all of the questions that have been raised by honourable senators in this debate-the concerns that people have raised about the loss of global and biological diversity, the concerns about endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does a number of intelligent things, each one a further step in the right direction, each a part of a network of things which Australia and other countries are doing to enhance the biological diversity of the globe and to make our small contribution to it. As honourable senators who are interested in wildlife protection would undoubtedly be aware-and that would include all of those who participated in this debate-there was a doubling of the Budget allocation for the endangered species program last night. </PARA>
<PARA> None of these things, by themselves, will resolve the complex matters that people have raised in this debate, some of them ranging 200 years into the future and others dealing with issues of great immediacy. Each of them, I am sure, is welcomed by all honourable senators. Each of them, combined with the activities of the international agencies and other governments, makes our commitment and concern for the environment and the species that combine to make up our global environment more apparent and effective. Whilst this legislation is a small step, it is, I am sure, a welcome one. I thank honourable senators for their support. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition, as I said in the second reading debate, supports the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first amendment that I have has been circulated and it simply relates to the commencement date. I mentioned this argument yesterday in the second reading debate. We have been concerned that the Copyright Amendment Bill is silent as to its commencement date. Under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, the Bill would commence 28 days after the day on which it receives the royal assent. The Opposition's amendment seeks to extend the commencement date so that it commences three months after the day of the royal assent. That is in order to allow authors, publishers, distributors and booksellers to make appropriate industry adjustments in light of changes to be brought about by the Bill; the making of regulations for the purposes of clause 2(b) of the Bill prescribing countries from which books may be imported; and regulations to be made-and this is an optimistic argument-for purposes of our proposed new part 4 to prescribe the relevant reasonable time for different copyright articles. In other words, it is really to allow a greater period in which to implement the practical matters which follow from passage of this piece of legislation. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

We believe that book publishers, booksellers and other affected interests have had ample opportunity to consider and adjust to the proposed amendments which were first announced by the then Attorney-General in December 1989 and introduced into Parliament in October 1990. Further, a draft of the Bill was circulated for comment in 1990 and intensive consultations took place prior to the House of Representatives debate in May 1991. It is my understanding that important sectors of the book industry-publishers, booksellers and so on-have already adjusted their business practices as if the changes to the law were already in effect.

<PARA>As I said, this amendment extends the Bill to include a new part which will extend the operation of the Bill to other copyright articles in line with the report of the CLRC. We recognise that the Government has indicated that it intends to propose further legislation in relation to other copyright articles. However, we on this side of the chamber are anxious to accelerate the process of reform bearing in mind, as I mentioned yesterday, that it has already taken eight years to reach this stage of proposed legislation simply limited to books. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mentioned yesterday that the extension does not include computer software, in view of the current inquiry of the Prices Surveillance Authority in this area. All the exemptions in this new part, which include the Government's exemptions plus exemptions for computer software and textbooks, are to be subject to a two-year sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, I move amendment No. 13 to include a new Part IVa in the Bill which would cover the importation of works and subject matter other than works, and allow for a more liberal regime, thus providing greater access to Australian consumers at more competitive prices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take up the interjection of Senator Spindler that they are consequential. Firstly, amendments 3 and 4 run in parallel, the first being in relation to infringement by importation for sale or hire and the second being in relation to infringement by sale and other dealings. I agree that paragraph (a) of each amendment is consequential and therefore should not be pressed. But the constructive knowledge provisions in paragraph (b) in each stand alone. Therefore, they should be pressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They follow from the fact-and, as I recall, this was also a recommendation of the Copyright Law Review Committee-that the offence itself includes language that makes it clear that one can be guilty when one has a constructive knowledge; in other words, adopting the language we have put in this amendment, where a person knew or ought reasonably to have known, as opposed to where a person has within his knowledge, or `where, to his knowledge', to pick up the exact language within the Act. It takes that language out of the offence provisions and brings it back into the substantive provisions of the Bill, in accordance with the recommendation that was made by the Copyright Law Review Committee. It is, therefore, to reflect the fact that constructive knowledge is specified in section 132 of the Act dealing with criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that the amendment is logically sound, that it has the support of the Copyright Law Review Committee and that there was no argument to the contrary put before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I trust that this Committee of the Whole might find that it is able to support the second part, paragraph (b), of both amendments 3 and 4.

The evidence put before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was that there was inconvenience within the industry and from the point of view of consumers in having to provide an order in written form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed to hear that the Australian Democrats are supporting this amendment. The Government does not support the amendment. The idea that there should be written and signed orders is designed to overcome any possible abuse that might arise if, for example, a bookseller accused of illegitimate importation of copies could assert that the copies he or she had in stock or had sold were to satisfy telephone orders. It is simply a matter of trying to provide a regime which would not tempt perhaps a bookseller to engage in illegitimate importation and try to satisfy an inquiry by saying, `Well, I had a telephone order'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we also have to take into account that in the modern world a fax order could be placed, or the order could be confirmed by fax. That is now the normal way of dealing with matters. That would certainly satisfy the requirement of the provision. Perhaps the Democrats might reconsider their point of view. As to the fax requirement, I do not think there is any great difficulty with people communicating, and it would prevent that little possibility of abuse creeping into the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The use of telephone orders was raised at the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last Monday week. I found some sympathy with the view that telephone orders should be able to be used. I can understand the concern of someone saying `How do you verify it three weeks or three months later when there is a dispute?' if they say `I did ring up' and someone else says `No, you did not', and there is nothing on the record about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note the Minister's comments about faxes. Can the Minister assure us that what is written in the Bill clearly, in definition, covers the use of a fax? A fax is a telephonic transmission; it is not a letter. Most people in business these days have a fax. Once the telephone order is made, I do not think it is an unreasonable proposition to then tell somebody that their order is noted verbally but they have several days in which to provide written communication of their order, even to fax it. I do accept the view that, if there is no follow-up paperwork in any form, when two people disagree later on the facts are very hard to prove; there is no evidence at all other than one person's word against somebody else's. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Democrats' interest in this matter, I wonder whether that amendment can be reworded to make it clear that faxes are acceptable and that a telephone order has to be followed up with some written communication, even if it is by way of a fax. I do not think that is an unnecessary inhibition. The evidence given to us last Monday week was that if a written order is signed by the customer one has to get a signed written order back. In these modern days, that situation can be used by the original publishers of the book as an unnecessary delaying tactic if they choose not to respond or acknowledge receipt of the written order within the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole operation of the copyright Act should be on the basis of immediacy wherever possible, within reason. After hearing the evidence in the Committee, I have some sympathy for the telephone order, but I do believe it has to be followed up with some written evidence so that there can be no dispute. If there is a dispute at a later date, the facts can actually be verified. I ask the Minister to consider that. </PARA>

<PARA> I hear what Senator Spindler says. What the Opposition is concerned about is that, if an order is specifically required to be followed up by a letter or fax, it is getting close to returning to the piece of legislation the mischief that we are seeking to remove from it and, that is, requiring a specific, formal method other than telephoning. I remind Senator Spindler of the fact that, without defining it further, we do state in the amendment that it must be a specific, verifiable order but we leave it flexible. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Minister's argument that in some way we might be opening a floodgate for fraud, I remind him that, at the moment, we are talking about single copies purchased by a single purchaser for private, non-commercial use. We are going to seek to extend that slightly to cover certain library situations but, basically, we are not looking at a major part of the book selling operation. Therefore, we do not want to be proposing amendments that in some way will facilitate fraud. This is a very limited exemption to simply make life easier for the trade. </PARA>

<PARA>6. Clause 5, page 3, after proposed subsection 44a(3), insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(3a) The copyright in a published work (whether first published before, on or after the commencing day) is not infringed by a person who, without the licence of the owner of the copyright, imports a number of copies of a non-infringing book equal to the number of copies of a specific verifiable order for that book from a library.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 6 is the library provision that was subject to considerable debate in the Standing Committee. Pursuant to this amendment, booksellers will be able to import a specific number of books without infringing copyright in order to fill the order of a library for that number of books. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, the reason for this amendment is that, as the law stands, Australian booksellers must treat libraries as any other customer and can only import a single copy of a book for them from a supplier who is not the Australian copyright holder. Libraries have, therefore, formed the practice of ordering directly from large overseas suppliers. The Opposition's amendment allows libraries to order books from Australian booksellers rather than going offshore and, therefore, provides a much needed boost for our local trade in the current difficult economic climate it is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA> The case was put strongly by the industry that Australian booksellers are, in fact, losing for no justifiable reason, because libraries have been avoiding the legislation and dealing directly with the overseas suppliers. We simply want to give Australian industry a fair opportunity to earn its share of the profit out of this particular business. Therefore, this amendment moved by the Opposition provides for greater flexibility in relation to purchases or orders made by libraries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have one concern about this amendment, that is, that `library' is not very clearly defined. We are concerned that this could create a loophole and invite organisations or booksellers to establish a library for the sole purpose of making use of that exemption. Hence, the Australian Democrats proposed amendment to the Opposition's amendment which seeks to insert before `library' the word `public', and after `library' the words `and the libraries of public educational institutions'. If that is acceptable to the Opposition, the Democrats will support the amended amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the hearing last Monday week, I was somewhat astonished to hear that the present copyright legislation acts to the detriment of Australian booksellers when selling books to public libraries, and encourages our public libraries to buy books direct from multinational book publishing companies from overseas. I would have thought that this is obviously an unintended consequence of the original copyright legislation. I cannot, under any circumstance, imagine that legislation was drafted to prohibit independent Australian booksellers from being able to competitively tender and sell Australian books-whether they are imported books or books published locally-to Australian public libraries, libraries in universities and other educational institutions and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I found that the evidence given was persuasive that there should be some amendment to allow Australian booksellers to import books and sell them so that they get a cut of the business. Obviously, the business is very profitable and I was not surprised that international book publishers were not very keen on changing it because it gives them an improved ability to supply the market at the expense of indigenous booksellers. I think it is an unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats overcomes a clear loophole that would have existed. In view of the evidence given last week, which I found persuasive, and in view of this suggestion by the Democrats, which I think covers the loophole that could have existed, as a member of the Government I find it very difficult to justify why Australian booksellers should be penalised vis-a-vis international publishers having access to a bigger share of the market of Australian public libraries and libraries in our educational institutions. I think the mixture of both the Opposition's amendment and the Democrats' suggestion, based on the evidence given last week, have a lot of merit. </PARA>

I thank Senator Schacht very much for that intervention-he has been extremely helpful at the committee stage! The Government does not support this particular Opposition amendment. I have not read the full transcript of the evidence offered at the Committee last week, but my understanding is that there is not a great deal of information available as to the extent to which the provisions affect the supply of books to libraries.

<PARA> We are talking about these institutions gathering the written cultural or educational text that they then make available to borrowers. We believe that they ought to be able to go overseas very readily in order to enable that to be done. On the question of what should qualify as a library, I have not had a lot of time to look at the Democrat amendments because they have just been circulated. However, section 49(9) of the Copyright Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA> In this section, `library'' does not include a library that is conducted for the profit, direct or indirect, of an individual or individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>I should have thought that was a sufficient definition for the purposes of the Opposition amendment. I take it that the Opposition amendment picks up that definition if nothing more is done. Is that right?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the Minister takes advice, I say to Senator Spindler that we do not want to allow a loophole in the form that he is concerned about. We do not want somebody to be able to use this opportunity to purchase books for a commercial library for reselling or whatever. I was concerned about his definition, however, in that it is narrower than he might want to be the case. For example, libraries in Catholic schools do not do it for reselling and are not wealthy, but they may not fall within the definition of `public'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why I would suggest to him that the language that the Minister refers to in section 49(9) is better. If he were prepared to move that, after the word `library' in my amendment, we insert the words `not being a library that is conducted for the profit, direct or indirect, of an individual or individuals', he might achieve his objective. It might ensure that there is no ambiguity left, as there may be, because I do not know that this provision necessarily picks up section 49, and therefore would better achieve the Minister's objective as well. Can I respectfully suggest that to Senator Spindler as a way of resolving this dilemma, consistent with the sentiment being expressed around the chamber?</PARA>

<PARA>7. Clause 5, page 3, proposed subsection 44A(7), at end of definition of `book', add the following word and paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``or (d) a book, the primary purpose of the publication of which is for use by students of an educational institution as a book required for a course of study at that institution.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the textbook exemption. The argument that we put briefly yesterday that I would expand upon-and some might argue that this amendment is a little inconsistent with the trend that we are advocating in this industry -is that we have become convinced of the need, and thus moved in the other place as well, for an amendment in this form because of our concern for adverse consequences in the supply of textbooks to Australian students. In other words, we believe that this should be treated as an exceptional case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary, in our view, because of the system of marketing of textbooks which is dependent upon teaching calendars. It is unlikely that there will be any demand in Australia at all for most books within 30 days. The 30-day rule is the key; 30 days of the first publication overseas. Normally, textbooks are obtained and read by academics and, if appropriate, will be recommended as a prescribed text for the following academic year. At that point, which is often six to nine months after the overseas publication, a bookseller will place an order. In other words, it is often six to nine months before the Australian rights holder can know whether a textbook first published overseas will be required in an Australian educational institution. The amendment will also allow time for the preparation of Australian adaptations of foreign published textbooks. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, as the Prices Surveillance Authority pointed out in its report, its critical comments relating to price and availability of books did not generally apply in relation to price and availability of textbooks. The PSA representatives put that argument to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to this amendment a new paragraph (d) is added to subsection 44a(7) to provide that a book does not include a book the primary purpose of which is for use by students of an educational institution as a book required for a course of study at that institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition would not include publications such as English literature or literature in any other language or publications aimed at members of professions which are also of assistance in teaching courses because these are clearly not publications whose primary purpose is for use as a student text. Such books and professional publications are not marketed in the same way as textbooks; that is, approved by academics at various institutions, before the decision to import marketable quantities for the following academic year is made, and sold principally through campus book sellers. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose test is used in a number of Commonwealth and State statutes. Thus, we have been persuaded that there should be an exemption to the 30-day rule for textbooks simply because of the nature of the purchasing practices in relation to them. They would be unduly prejudiced, we believe at the moment, by falling within the more liberal regime that applies after passage of the 30-day rule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a hearing of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last Monday week I found one of the most difficult areas to make a clear cut judgment, from the evidence put by the various witnesses, related to what one should do with textbooks. I certainly have some suspicion that the evidence put by the Association of American Publishers showed obviously that it had a vested interest in being able to improve its ability to provide the Australian market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is of considerable concern in these sorts of hearings that people argue great matters of principle when we know that the bottom line is really about bucks, dollars, incomes, greed and self-interest. Despite all the protestations from various witnesses about principle, cultural heritage and so on, when we got to the bottom line everyone was arguing about who got what percentage of the dollar, and it is a billion dollar plus market in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I have a couple of concerns about the textbook matter and they might be taken as remarks sympathetic to the Opposition amendment. I want to come to some suggestions about the Government and the Democrats not supporting the amendment and what that may mean. First of all, I was concerned to have it put to us at the hearing that the book publishers should make judgments on behalf of what they think consumers of textbooks in Australia want. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, it was shown to us that there are several styles of textbook with the same content. There are the very well produced American textbooks which are published in America mostly with paperback covers but of good quality, well bound, well printed and on good paper. We also saw textbooks printed in Asia on extremely low quality paper, very poorly bound and of poor colours. Clearly, after a minimum amount of use, they would start to fall apart, but they are sold very cheaply. Quite frankly, I could not understand a word in some of these textbooks. They dealt with high level mathematics and so on, as we would expect of these textbooks. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that this is a matter for any particular book publisher or even a government to make a decision to say to consumers, and that is students, et cetera, of textbooks that they may have access to only one quality style textbook, and that is a high quality textbook produced in America. Why cannot students, if they want to have a textbook to use for only a limited period, buy the much cheaper version? Even if it does fall apart after a minimum amount of use that may be long enough for their need. Therefore it is much more important for them to spend a lot less money on a book they need for only a short term than to buy a book from America. </PARA>
<PARA> As one witness said, American textbooks are sold to people on the basis that they will keep them for their working life, after graduating from college or university. I find it hard to accept that Australian consumers should not have the choice between top quality publications or lower quality publications. Even though the content is the same, the quality of the printing is quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I have some concern that we are trying to dictate to consumers in Australia in this specialised market what sort of quality they should have. I am also concerned that the existing clause will be used by the existing publishers to ensure that the market is maintained for them, that there is limited competition and that they can set the price. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw scales in the evidence of how prices of textbooks of high quality and sold in Australia from America are much lower than in America. That evidence was persuasive. The books already sold in Australia are much cheaper. There were examples of the other way round. It seems quite idiosyncratic that one book in America which may be worth $200 is worth only $50 in Australia, or vice versa. It seems that that very much reflects the notions of the people who control the market. I am always suspicious that people who control the market can set the price without competition, remembering that most of the people who consume these books are students and, by definition, not exactly well off. I think students should have the choice of the cheaper quality, not content, books. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that, therefore, we may still have a situation that despite these changes the international publishers of textbooks will still be able to set the price and control that price even if some competition is allowed. I am also concerned at the ability of these books to be Australianised, which was another issue that came up. It is said that, if a book is published in America in particular and it is clearly a good textbook, when it comes to Australia 12 to 18 months later, after having been widely prescribed, the publisher will make an effort to Australianise the book by using Australian examples within the material. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said to us that if we remove this amendment and allow open competition in line with the position of the Opposition that would be the end of the Australianisation of books. I found no proof that that would occur. If the market is big enough in Australia, any publisher commercially will Australianise the books. It will encourage sales because more and more academics, professors and tutors will set a book if it is Australianised rather than if it is left in its American, British, European or whatever style. So that evidence was not persuasive to me. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point on this amendment is that I found it very difficult to make a clear-cut judgment on the evidence. My natural instinct is that we should always err on the side of openness and competition. If the amended clause as proposed by the Government goes through, I am concerned that the Government has said it is three years before a review of this Bill will be conducted. That is far too long and it is far too long in relation to this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Within 12 months we will be able to get a good grip on how this clause is operating. Though it is not actually in the Bill, as I understand it, the commitment for review should not be left for three years. The review should begin in some sections, and particularly in this section, within 12 months. Overall, the review of the whole Bill should begin no later than in 18 months to two years time rather than the three years proposed. I raise that point with the Minister. I hope the Government can take that matter on board, particularly as, in my view, at the moment judgment on the evidence regarding this clause-the argument between competition, access to books and so on-is not clear-cut for either side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that this is a matter which requires some deliberation and judgment. It is not perhaps absolutely clear-cut.

It is a question of availability and price. Both those matters have been emphasised, particularly in second reading contributions. It is not simply a question of price but also accessibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to the Government that educational texts on cultural heritage and the knowledge of various disciplines that is available to overseas students ought to be very readily available to Australian readers of such texts.

<PARA> I understand that Senator Schacht has nevertheless expressed misgivings about how this might work out and the real advantages and detriment that will be revealed even in a fairly short time.

As far as both those Ministers need to be consulted, I will certainly do so with a view to trying to bring forward the review. I will particularly emphasise the points Senator Schacht made about the way in which the review could be staged, which was to pick up some of these matters more quickly than others. Nevertheless, perhaps the review should be conducted at the outer within two years rather than three. Perhaps some phases of the review could be undertaken sooner than that. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment deals with the 30-day requirement and introduces the so-called slip rule, which enables the person or organisation concerned to bring to the tribunal a special case where the 30 days could not be adhered to due to circumstances or events entirely beyond that person's control: for example, a strike on the waterfront or other delays in obtaining the copies to be published. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have given consideration to this amendment. We accept that it is certainly arguable. The issue was put before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. On balance, we believe that it is an unnecessary reform. Thirty days, in this time of rapid air transport, is sufficient time to bring in books from overseas. On the one hand, therefore, we doubt that it is necessary and, on the other hand, we are concerned that it would simply become a de facto extension of the provisions as they are included. We do not like de facto extensions. We would prefer a more liberal regime than the one the Government is giving us, but we do not want to achieve that objective through a de facto mechanism. So, on balance, we have decided against supporting this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The period of 30 days, we believe, is the longest that consumers in Australia should be asked to wait for new overseas titles to appear in bookshops in Australia. I believe that the proposed slip rule would raise several practical problems. It is not clear who would have a right to put a case before the relevant tribunal to consider the extension. The problem is only likely to occur infrequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Hill has well pointed out the easy ability to get books into Australia given the modern forms of transport. If experience shows that 30 days is a tight period within which to be certain of effecting delivery for publication in Australia, an overseas publisher who values the Australian market for a particular book will, no doubt, take action in advance of overseas publication to ensure that Australian publication is accomplished in time. The Government does not support the slip rule. </PARA>

<PARA> `(4) Subject to this section, the copyright in a work in respect of which an application under subsection (l) is pending or an order is made is not infringed by a person who, without the licence of the owner of the copyright, imports a copy (in this subsection called the `imported copy') of a hardback or paperback version of a non-infringing book into Australia for a purpose mentioned in paragraph 37(a), (b) or (c) if:</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to provide the opportunity for Australian publishers to produce a substantial revision or modification of an overseas publication, sometimes called an adaptation. We believe that the 30-day cut-off period does not give our local industry sufficient time to take the steps necessary to enable it to bring out a substantially revised or modified version of an overseas publication. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment covers the situation where the owner of the copyright of a new overseas title, who has made contractual arrangements to publish an adaptation of the work for Australia, can satisfy the Copyright Tribunal that the intention is genuine and that the proposed adaptation amounts to, or constitutes, a substantial adaptation of the work for Australian consumption. During the period that the adaptation is being dealt with, the original work will be freely available on the Australian market-our amendment takes care of that. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government certainly opposes this amendment and I hope that the Opposition will consider the matter further. The whole purpose of this legislation is to try to ensure that Australian readers have access to the world body of published written material. I believe it is absolutely intolerable that we are here in the Senate contemplating a situation where an overseas publisher can say, `I am going to adapt the book for the Australian market-those people down under' and because of that signal of an intention to modify the book in some way for the Australian market, Australians are prevented from getting hold of a very important text which they want to get hold of in numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Committee meeting an example was given of a publication called The Chronicles of the 20th Century which is, I believe, a United Kingdom publication. Obviously, it is a very comprehensive attempt to portray the history of this century so far. If it were suggested that Australians should wait for an adaptation-a modification-of The Chronicles of the 20th Century to have, perhaps, a chapter or two included highlighting Australian history in the twentieth century, then we would be prevented from getting hold of that important text in the bookshops in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not it is an important publication is beside the point, I suppose. The spirit and purpose of this legislation are to make overseas books more readily available in Australia so that people have access to that great mass of publications overseas without the constraints of somebody else saying, `You are not going to get hold of it until we give you an edition which we think you down under should read'. It is absolutely incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite sure that Australian adaptations-if they are made-will be able to compete with the original book. I can give an example of this. I notice a former distinguished secretary to the Attorney-General's Department in the gallery. He will know of the famous text book on contracts by Cheshire and Fifoot. Pat Higgins, who was a senior lecturer at the University of Tasmania when I was a student, produced an Australian edition. That edition competed very successfully with the original Cheshire and Fifoot and I have no doubt that it must have outsold it many times over in Australian university bookshops. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite confident that a well-made Australian adaptation will be able to compete with an overseas publication. People will make their own judgments-and ought to be able to make their own judgments-as to whether they buy the overseas book or the Australian adaptation. I think it is intolerable that somebody else should dictate to Australians that they shall not read a particular publication until it comes out in a version suitable for Australian eyes. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot believe that the Opposition, on further consideration of the matter, will not wish to modify its original indication of some agreement with this particular proposition. I know it was not said with great enthusiasm and I do not think it would involve any humiliation or loss of face if the Opposition were to allow this original spirit and purpose of the legislation to be carried through in this area. I can assure the Opposition that Australian readers would be forever grateful if it were able to support us in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the motives and the good intentions of what Senator Spindler is trying to do on behalf of the Australian Democrats to encourage publishing in Australia of adaptations. However, from my observations of this industry, the evidence before it is that this is a device that will not be used, in Senator Spindler's terms, to encourage, through goodwill, Australian publishing; it will be used as a device to control the importation of books that ordinary Australians, in my view, should have access to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I argue very strongly to Senator Spindler that although his motives are absolutely pure-we cannot argue against encouraging the Australian publishing industry-the effect of this amendment would be to give the multinational publishing companies a control over the Australian market. They could put up some book, of which we had examples given by the Minister, and say, `You cannot import that book because we have employed an Australian author who will come up with three extra chapters'. For example, the author could be giving the Australian version of what happened in the Napoleonic Wars or something. This would be a device to control for a long time the importation of books, which would be cheaper and more efficiently provided to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA> In this area and in other areas, we have to stop falling back on devices supposedly to support Australian industry when, in fact, foreign owned companies will use those devices to protect their interests, their markets, and to make larger profits at the expense of the Australian public. The devices will be used to restrict Australians' access to books which in cultural terms, in a democracy, they have every right to have access to. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken several times in the committee stage today. I have made remarks that may, at some stage, have been more encouraging to the Opposition than to the Government. I say to Senator Hill that, if he votes for this amendment, he will vote contrary to everything else he has been putting up in all of his other amendments to this Bill and to what he has spoken about in the second reading debate. If Senator Hill votes for this, he will abrogate everything else he has argued for and voted for during the rest of the committee stage. </PARA>

But, if Senator Hill votes for this, he is actually doing a 180-degree turn on the whole principle that he has been arguing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that at the hearing of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last Monday we did not get down to dealing with the amendments before us. If we had, it would have saved a lot of trouble today in the chamber; we could either have saved a lot of the time here or not had the hearing last week and done something else. This is one of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly support the Minister in imploring the Opposition not to support the amendment. Even though Senator Spindler's remarks are well-intentioned, I do not believe that the people he is dealing with have the same good intentions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In leading for the Opposition on the Crimes (Aviation) Bill 1991, I make the opening statement that the Opposition supports the legislation before the Senate this morning. The purpose of this Bill, which applies to all aircraft in Australia, is to consolidate the provisions of four existing Acts which form the current aviation crimes legislation package. The aim of the Bill before us today is to simplify the legislation and to remove any uncertainty in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, the Opposition will be supporting the passage of this Bill. The four Acts to be consolidated are the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970, the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 and the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963. With the passage of this legislation these four Acts will, of course, be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972 implements the Hague Convention. The Hague Convention is the convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft and was ratified by Australia on 9 September 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970 implements the Commonwealth's obligations under the Tokyo Convention. The Tokyo Convention relates to offences and certain other acts committed on aircraft. Australia acceded to it on 22 June 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 implements the Montreal Convention and its protocols. The Montreal Convention is the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation and it was ratified by this country on 12 July 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The major public law conventions presently in force between ICAO-the International Civil Aviation Organisation-member states are the three that I have already mentioned: the Tokyo Convention, the Hague Convention and the Montreal Convention. They all deal with the subject of crime relating to aircraft and have generally been adopted because they respond to three basic requirements: firstly, the elimination of jurisdictional uncertainties in respect of crimes occurring on board aircraft in-flight; secondly, the securing of effective national laws against hijacking and other acts endangering civil aviation; and, thirdly, the definition of the powers of aircraft commanders to deal effectively with inflight disturbances. Given the mass transit of people which occurs around the world these days, especially in international traffic, some degree of disturbance is sadly an inevitable part of travel. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time Australia became a party to the conventions that I have outlined, Australian law in the area of crimes on aircraft was already well developed. The conventions implemented by the first three Acts consolidated in this Bill are contained in the schedules to the Act. The fourth Act to be consolidated applies strictly within Australia and is known as the Aircraft Act-the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, which was the earliest Australian enactment to deal specifically with the problem of crimes occurring in aircraft. I note in passing that the conventions overlap to some degree, as do the Acts which implement them and the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963 is, as I have said, domestically oriented. It governs behaviour on board certain aircraft and prescribes offences in relation to aircraft. One of the difficulties we have is that aviation came along after the Constitution was drawn up. So there is no specific reference giving powers to the Commonwealth in relation to aviation. Broadly, the only way the Commonwealth can legislate in respect of aviation, and it has a genuine interest in controlling aviation in so far as one of the characteristics of aviation is its flexibility and range of operations-therefore it is quite national in character-is with the full cooperation of the States. By and large, the States have cooperated very well. The legislation that I referred to in the earlier part of this speech has always been matched by complementary legislation being put down by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> In general, the legislative powers of the Commonwealth cannot extend to flights made within State boundaries, except to the extent authorised in section 51(i.), (xxix.) and (xxxix.) of the Constitution. Basically, the law is contained in the fourth Act to be consolidated-the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. As I said before, most of the States have enacted complementary legislation. I will digress for a moment and make a personal observation on the legislation. I have a private concern that the legislation could have been written in a more direct way with respect to offences against aircraft themselves. Clause 25(1) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who commits an unlawful act of the kind mentioned in subsection 10(1) is guilty of an offence if any of the following applies:</PARA>
<PARA>The important part of that clause is `of the kind mentioned'. `Of the kind mentioned' relates to an earlier clause in the Bill-clause 10(1) (a) (ii)-which states:</PARA>
<PARA>destroys an aircraft in service, or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;</PARA>
<PARA>My comment on that is that the Commonwealth has taken unto itself, through the Civil Aviation Authority and its predecessors, very stringent powers in relation to maintenance and what can be done to aircraft. No un authorised people can touch an aeroplane, other than to clean it or, maybe, to change the spark plugs if they know what they are doing. Any dismantling of an aeroplane, any maintenance activity, has to be signed out by an authorised person. Any components put onto that aircraft must have release notes, certificates of authenticity of some sort, attesting to their origins and their quality. In short, the Commonwealth has taken very stringent powers over what can be done to an aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it was reasonable in this legislation to have had just a blanket proposition that anyone who interferes with an aircraft with malicious intent is guilty of a crime. While intent is always hard to establish, it is certainly part of our legal system. For example, premeditated murder is a much more serious crime than accidental death which carries the charge of manslaughter. Given the powers that the Commonwealth has had before in relation to the maintenance of aircraft, this provision could have been spelt out more simply, rather than as it appears in the Act that `it is likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight'. I assume, though, that the courts would take a pretty liberal interpretation of what is likely to endanger the flight of an aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the Bill: the Tokyo Convention adds little to the Crimes (Aircraft) Act while the Hague Convention has slightly more impact, but in a rather restricted sphere. The Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act makes some further amendments to the Crimes (Aircraft) Act particularly in relation to hijacking. The Crimes (Aircraft) Act contains two principal parts. The first of these, Part II, is concerned with the criminal character and consequences of any act done on board an aircraft in flight and the second, Part III, deals with acts specifically affecting the safety of the aircraft and passengers. Both these parts apply to aircraft engaged in flights in relation to which the Commonwealth's jurisdiction is constitutionally authorised. Two broad bases of jurisdiction are adopted: firstly, in relation to Australian registered aircraft and, secondly, in relation to foreign aircraft on their way to and from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Act, the Crimes (Aircraft) Act, was being debated in Australia at the same time as the ICAO-sponsored Tokyo Convention was agreed upon. The need to have precisely formulated legislation on the books was in response to the increased incidence of hijacking world wide. The Minister for Civil Aviation at the time was Senator the Honourable Sir Shane Paltridge. In his second reading speech, he referred to the Tokyo Convention with its emphasis on the jurisdiction of the State in which the aircraft was registered. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's first hijacking incident occurred on 19 July 1960 when a passenger on board a Trans-Australia Airlines Electra flying between Brisbane and Sydney threatened to blow up the aircraft unless he was flown to Singapore. He was subsequently overwhelmed on the aircraft and served 10 years imprisonment after being convicted. The interesting thing about it is that there was quite a protracted legal trial before his conviction. That led to the setting up of the legislation. That first conviction for hijacking under Queensland law was quashed by the Supreme Court of Queensland owing to uncertainty as to whether the offence occurred before or after the aircraft left the State of Queensland. Following this incident, the Federal Government introduced provisions into the Air Navigation Regulations. However, those measures were seen purely as an interim measure pending the introduction of legislation which was the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Aviation) Bill 1991, which we are discussing, contains five parts and five schedules. Part 1 deals with definitions and interpretation. It defines terms such as the meaning in relation to this legislation of the oft-used word threatened. It defines hijacking and all the other parts of the Bill. This legislation and the provisions of the Tokyo Convention are not limited to Australian territory or citizens, but ensure that the Commonwealth, in accordance with its international obligations, may prosecute an offender within its jurisdiction no matter where the offence occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 deals with offences and covers in division 1 hijacking and other acts of violence aboard aircraft. Hijacking is outlined in subsections (1) and (2) as punishable on conviction by imprisonment for life. Acts of violence against passengers and crew are also made punishable. Division 2 relates to other offences on board aircraft engaged in certain flights. It applies to aircraft the criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory, which is Commonwealth territory, and so on through the various divisions of part 2 of the Bill. Part 3 covers the provisions giving effect to the Tokyo Convention, which forms schedule 4 of the Bill, and parts 4 and 5 of the Bill are really the administrative and procedural measures for the application of this Bill. Part 4 covers restoring control of the aircraft and dealing with offenders, and part 5 is mainly of an administrative nature. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, the Bill before the Senate today brings together necessary legislation in relation to crimes and offences against aircraft and passengers in the one Act and simplifies and dispels in some areas the uncertainty about the application of existing law. We wish this Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in welcoming the Crimes (Aviation) Bill into the Senate and in supporting its passage through this chamber. I say that because it seeks to address a major problem in the world today, which is the rise of international terrorism. Terrorism has posed for some time now a major threat to established governments and to the legal systems that attempt to punish crime. There is a very simple reason why this is so. Terrorists frequently plan their crimes so that those crimes are transnational-that is, a portion of the crime is committed in one state and a portion in another state or the crime is committed, for example, in the case of an aircraft, when the aircraft is outside the boundaries of any particular state and may be flying over the high seas. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to punish terrorists and to deter acts of terrorism unless every nation in the world is willing to take a tough stand against terrorism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to draw some attention to the provisions of division 3 aircraft, as they are defined in clause 3 of the Bill, and the offences contained in clauses 16 through to 24 inclusive. The definition of a division 3 aircraft is such that it covers a foreign aircraft when its flight commenced in Australia or when the aircraft was intended to fly to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 12 of the Bill, which has to be read in conjunction with that definition, gives jurisdiction over people who commit offences on those aircraft, even if the people in question are not Australian citizens. Basically, this Bill seeks to extend territoriality, albeit to a limited extent, so that more nations are in a position to try to punish terrorists for the crimes that they commit against innocent passengers aboard aircraft. This is very important because there are many acts of terrorism that go unpunished.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last three years alone, some 12 Australian citizens have been the victims of political unrest overseas-12 Australians killed in politically motivated violence. In May this year alone, we saw the death in Peru of Sister Irene McCormack and we saw the killing in Lebanon of another Australian citizen, Mr Ali Chahine. We can do nothing but condemn the evil nature of these acts and the evil people who perpetrate these acts, because these acts of terrorism are committed with one intent, and that is to inspire fear in innocent people; for political purposes, they turn ordinary innocent people into scapegoats and political pawns. I do not care what nationality people belong to or where they are-in this day and age, people have a right to travel free from fear and intimidation and free from the threat of murder, kidnapping or maiming. Unfortunately, terrorists do not see it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I wish to urge the widest possible interpretation of the provisions contained in this Bill, if unfortunately they ever have to be interpreted by an Australian court, because we cannot allow terrorists to escape on technicalities. We cannot allow them to take advantage of loopholes in laws between one country and another, because while we do that-while any nation in the world does that-we give a green light to terrorists, and we give a green light to the use of fear and repression against innocent people for political ends. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect I draw the Senate's attention to the seventh report of the Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind, which was prepared under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly. In particular, I draw the Senate's attention to the consideration in that report of what constitutes a crime against humanity. For some time a crime against humanity was only considered to be a particularly despicable act that was perpetrated in the course of a war. But as international events change, as the circumstances in our world change, we find more and more politically motivated acts designed to target individuals from particular races or religions or political groups. I do not believe that this is the sort of world we wish to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I believe that it is necessary for all nations to give the widest scope to the definition of crimes against humanity and to adopt laws that will let any nation punish people who commit these crimes against humanity. I note that at paragraph 35 of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1943 the United Nations Commission then proposed to term such breaches `crimes against humanity', considering that they represented breaches of a particular kind which, even though committed during the War, had original characteristics which set them apart, in certain aspects, from war crimes. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, as far back as 1943 we recognised that there were certain offences which should not just be war crimes but, much more than that, should be considered crimes against all of humanity. Once the international order accepts that basic premise, there is a consequent obligation upon every nation to recognise that crimes against humanity can also occur outside war. Terrorism is clearly one such crime. Of course, the question is: what motives make an ordinary offence such as murder more than just murder but make it a crime against humanity? This is deserving of consideration. It is a matter that has not clearly been decided yet, but I think we ought to turn our minds to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 65 states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Only crimes which either by their magnitude and savagery or by their large number or by the fact that a similar pattern was applied at different times and places endangered the international community or shocked the conscience of mankind warranted intervention by states other than that on whose territory the crimes had been committed, or whose subjects had become their victims. </PARA>
<PARA>That says that there are certain crimes so heinous, so despicable, that every nation should have a right to put the perpetrators on trial and, if they are found guilty, to punish them. It is almost a recognition of an international duty to put those people on trial. I will come back to that matter later because there is an important distinction to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there is a recognition that there are some acts that are so evil, so violent, that any nation should have a right to put the people responsible on trial and to punish them. That leapfrogs many of the ordinary tests of jurisdiction which have existed previously in international law, because in 1935 the Harvard Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with respect to Crime recognised the existence at that time of six different principles, one of which was rejected when the draft was prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> That sixth principle of jurisdiction which was rejected in 1935 is called the `passive personality principle'. That principle says that any nation has a right to try a crime--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Button" NAMEID="4F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be a bit erudite for Senator Button but I cannot help that. It said that any nation had a right to put on trial a person who committed a crime against its citizens. At that time the United States and the United Kingdom opposed that passive personality principle and so it was not accepted. In the intervening period, however, we have seen the United States and the United Kingdom become the most strident advocates of tougher measures to fight terrorism and of the passive personality principle. In the United States this has been embodied in what is called the `Anti-terrorism Act'. In the United Kingdom it was recognised in 1946 in DPP v. Joyce, in which a sort of extraterritoriality based upon the passive personality principle was accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the big stumbling block that existed in 1935 has now been moved out of the way. The way is open for international efforts to bring about a strict order to fight terrorism and a new reality in international relations that will say, `We will punish terrorists. No matter where you are, no matter where you run, we will hunt you down and we will try you to the full extent of the law'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is something that I believe we in Australia have a responsibility to do. Many Australian citizens travel overseas regularly. Many of them go, for example, to Latin America or South East Asia, or to Holland-I will turn to Holland shortly-where they can become the victims of terrorism--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Patterson" NAMEID="LI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator Patterson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Holland they were shot down by the IRA.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend and colleague Senator Patterson says, they can be shot down by the IRA. My concern is that there were two Australians who died at the hands of IRA terrorists in Roermond last year who never had justice done because of a loophole, a technicality in the law, because one country was not willing to do the right thing to fight against terrorism and was willing to go soft on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The courts took particularly lenient interpretations of the law that allowed four admitted IRA terrorists to walk free. Even if they were not going to be convicted of the murder charge, they should have been convicted on a charge of belonging to an organisation for the purposes of committing a crime. But they walked free-because we had one nation that was not willing to do its bit to uphold the safety of people overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I say that we can no longer entrust the safety of Australians abroad to a foreign court. We have to recognise that we have an obligation to protect our innocents abroad and we have to give warning to terrorists, no matter where they are, that if they attack an Australian, they will be hunted down to the full extent of the law, that they will not be allowed to take advantage of loopholes in the laws of other countries, and that we will not tolerate these sorts of despicable acts being done to our citizens. That is why I believe the provisions contained in the definition of Division 3 aircraft in this Bill and the provisions of sections 16 to 24 are particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important matter when we consider aircraft is the international crime of piracy. Piracy was recognised in international law as a crime as far back as at least the eighteenth century. By that I mean that, as far back as the 1700s, international law recognised the right of every nation to put pirates on trial and to punish them for the acts they committed on the high seas. Of course, in the eighteenth century there were no aircraft, and crimes such as hijacking did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> If I have a criticism of this Bill and if I have a criticism of the international conventions to which it gives effect, it is that it does not go far enough, because pirates are not only punishable by any nation in the world whether or not its citizens were the victims, but moreover, international law recognises a duty upon states to try to punish pirates. As far as I am concerned, there is very little difference between sinking a ship and killing the people on it and blowing up an aircraft and killing the people on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a pirate and a terrorist both commit their crimes with the single intention of spreading fear to achieve a political end. That is why I believe that, ultimately, the international law must evolve to a stage where terrorists are treated in the same way as pirates. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a problem for some period of time with an exception to piracy, which was the case of insurgents. This matter was considered by the Supreme Court of the United States in a case called United States v. The Ambrose Light. The justices considered what was an insurgent and whether it was appropriate for insurgency to be an exception to the rule of piracy. They said in the judgment of that case that an insurgent, `had not obtained any previous recognition of belligerent rights either from their own government or from the political or executive department of any other nation'. So they were saying that, at that time, a nation could attack a ship containing innocent people for the purposes of prosecuting a war but that an insurgent who was not recognised as a nation could not do so. The court, however, rejected that and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that in blockading ports which all nations are entitled to enter, they attack the rights of all mankind, and menace with destruction the lives and property of all who resist their unlawful acts; that such acts are therefore piratical, and entitle the ships and the tribunals of every nation whose interests are attacked or menaced, to suppress, at their discretion, such unauthorised warfare by the seizure and confiscation of the vessels engaged in it. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, also gives those nations a right to put the particular pirates on trial. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then we have seen the development of the concept of war crimes and the development of a concept of crimes against humanity, so that not even a nation involved in a war is allowed to do these acts. Therefore, there is very little reason why insurgents or terrorists-call them what you will-should be given that immunity as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I am glad that this Bill has been introduced. I have great pleasure in supporting it. I hope, however, that it signals an intent on the part of the Australian Government to punish acts of terrorism most stringently and that our courts will give the widest possible scope to their interpretation of the offences contained in this Bill, because we cannot allow terrorism to flourish any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to discussion of this Bill relates to some more technical aspects of it. Suffice it for me to say that I agree with what my colleagues have said, particularly Senator MacGibbon in his introduction and steerage of this Bill through the Senate on behalf of the Liberal and National parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettably, there has not really been sufficient time for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and its Secretary to discuss this matter fully with the Government. At the meeting of that Committee this morning, it did appear that there were some unintended consequences of what a couple of sections of the Bill actually mean. I rise to put these on notice and, if appropriate, to seek a response from the Government so that the matter may be cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that this is a consolidation of previous Acts and that, accordingly, it is drafted, one hopes, in a way that encompasses what was-and hopefully what was was correct-but it is being put in a simpler form. It did appear to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that there were some particular problems. Those problems relate to clauses 39 and 40. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to clause 39, which says that where a person is brought before a magistrate under this Act and a warrant has not been issued- that is, if a person has been arrested without a warrant-then the magistrate must, if satisfied that more time is reasonably required for deciding whether criminal or extradition proceedings should be started, remand the person, either in custody or on bail, for a period of not more than seven days. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act goes on to provide that if a person is remanded and within seven days the prosecuting authorities have not yet made up their minds, then that person can be remanded in custody for a further seven days-and so it appears it can go on ad infinitum, so that every seven days one could come back and keep in custody a person who had been arrested without warrant. That is what section 39 appears to say. </PARA>
<PARA> However, section 40 then goes on to say that where a person remanded in custody under section 39 is still held in custody at the end of the prescribed period, which we will come to later, then that person may apply to the Supreme Court for an order that he or she be released. Where, on application by a person, the Supreme Court is satisfied that the Attorney-General has been given reasonable notice, the Court must, unless reasonable cause is shown for delaying that person's release, order that the person be released. But a person could be in this seven day, seven day, seven day retention in custody without warrant until the end of the prescribed period. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 40(3) defines `prescribed period' in relation to a person as meaning two months after the date of the order under section 39 under which the person is held in custody. The order under section 39 appears to refer to the remand but, as I have mentioned, the remand can go on before a magistrate for seven days, seven days, seven days, ad infinitum. </PARA>
<PARA> However, section 40, which is meant to give the person a chance to go before the Supreme Court and get released, says he can only do that two months after the date on which the order is made. But the order can keep on being made, so it is not a finite period. Maybe the prescribed period should be amended to say it is two months from the date of the original order under section 39. That may be worth having a look at. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one particular problem: it appears that a person who has been arrested on warrant can be kept in custody indefinitely on the order of a magistrate, who keeps extending it for seven days after seven days after seven days. The relief that is apparently there to allow someone to apply to the Supreme Court after two months, does not appear to ever start because the starting date for the two months does not seem to be finite. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect is that the `prescribed period' is defined also, if the person has applied for a writ of habeas corpus, as two months after the day on which the application, or the appeal relating to it, is finally determined. One would think that if he has applied for habeas corpus and has been successful, he is out of gaol anyhow. Does this suggest that this legislation, by implication in a very offhand way, is to overcome or to militate against the benefits given to us by habeas corpus, which of course have been with us since the very early days of Western civilisation?</PARA>
<PARA> If that is intended, it should be expressed in a more appropriate way rather than in an offhand way at the edge of this sort of Bill. The only other interpretation there could possibly be is that if a writ for habeas corpus is made but is unsuccessful, then the two months starts from that day. But again, one would think that if the writ for habeas corpus has been unsuccessful, then it is unlikely that the application to the Supreme Court to be released under section 40(1) would be successful, because without going into the intricacies of habeas corpus and what section 40(1) means, it would seem they are the same thing. In both instances they are an application by a person to the Supreme Court to be released from custody, after having been held in custody by order of a magistrate on this seven day, seven day, seven day period. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether that is right or wrong, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was unclear. It certainly seemed, from our reading of it at the Committee meeting this morning, that that is an interpretation. If that is the interpretation, it seems unfair, and, I would suggest, unintended, and it should be looked at. There may, however, be some explanation by the Minister or the Department to suggest that the interpretation that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has put on it is not correct. </PARA>

I now have a copy of that amendment and I understand it is to be given to honourable senators shortly. The first Government amendment is necessary to ensure that there is a complete consolidation of provisions in the four statutes comprising the existing Crimes (Aircraft) Act. Senator Macdonald touched on this point in his remarks. One of those provisions, section 26 of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, empowers an aircraft commander or a person authorised by the Minister for Aviation to search the aircraft and any person, luggage or freight on board the aircraft or about to be put on the aircraft, if that aircraft commander suspects that an offence is being or might be committed. This search power, which is an important part of the security network ensuring aviation safety, was overlooked in the development of the Bill currently before the Senate. Of course, this search power is essential. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which relates to the Soviet Union, is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is the Australian Government prepared to show the same level of support for democratically elected representatives, such as Boris Yeltsin, as is being demonstrated by the governments of the United States and Britain? What has the Australian Government done in support of courageous individuals and republics such as the Baltic states in their opposition to the dictatorship?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="790" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have made it perfectly clear, publicly and privately, that we do very strongly support Mr Yeltsin as the freely elected President of Russia and the most credible voice in the Soviet Union in opposition to the new regime. We strongly support his declared goal of the restoration of Mr Gorbachev as President of the Soviet Union. I put that very firmly on the record lest there be any possible cause for doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of other kinds of support, there are obvious limitations on our capacity as a nation to influence the situation. As for various economic assistance measures which were in place or about to be put into place, we have made clear that we regard ourselves as having no option but to put those on hold for the moment, in line with our other Western partners and like-minded countries. We will, of course, be keeping the situation under close review in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> The measures in question have comprised not only the provision of credit facilities, which are on hold on the basis that was described by Senator Button in his very detailed press release yesterday, but also the Australian program of training for the Soviet Union. A new program announced in yesterday's Budget-$4.5m over three years, intended to provide advanced postgraduate training in business skills for Soviet managers-premised as it was on support from the Soviet Government for the market reform process, which must now be regarded as very much in doubt, is clearly on hold until the situation clarifies and hopefully improves.</PARA>
<PARA> The remaining demonstration of overt support for the Soviet Union that we had made in recent times was our commitment to subscribe some $45m over five years to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have made known our view-we may not have yet; I have instructed this to be done-that the Soviet Union at present, in our judgment, does not meet the test of political conditionality which is associated with support from the EBRD. I do not think there will be much difficulty in persuading the EBRD to that effect, but we have made it perfectly clear that we do not want any money being spent by the EBRD in the present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, we have followed up our representations to the Soviet charge yesterday with specific contact now achieved in Moscow with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Again, the Australian position has now been placed on record. I do not know what Senator Hill wants us to do beyond all those various measures, but I think that represents a realistic response by Australia in a situation that manifestly we all deplore.</PARA>

<TITLE>Superannuation</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="791" SPEAKER="Foreman Sen D.J." NAMEID="GG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is it a fact that the Government has decided to legislate for a prescribed level of superannuation support which employers should provide for their employees? Can the Minister advise the Senate as to the social and economic significance of this decision for all Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="791" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a fact, as announced in the Budget yesterday by the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, that the Government will legislate for a 5 per cent superannuation provision from 1 July next year, with a 3 per cent provision for employers with payroll bills of below $500,000. Senator Foreman asks me about the significance of this decision by the Government. It should be said at the start that this is one of the greatest social advances by this Government or any other government in the history of the federation of Australia. Indeed, the people who complain about this are the people who have complained about every significant social reform in this community. They are direct line descendants of those who complained about taking children out of the mines and of doing all the other significant and social reforms which we now look back on as major achievements for ordinary people in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should also say that the Government is faced with a political and economic imperative. The population of this country is greying. We are getting older and before much longer more people will be retired. Provision for retirement with dignity is a necessity that has to be faced up to. It is a necessity that we have faced up to and will not walk away from because it is our responsibility to plan now and make prudent provision now to ensure that people, when they come to retirement later, can do so with dignity. There may be some who wish to run away from it, but the Government does not. We have faced it in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The criticism of this measure suggests or implies that it will apply immediately but, of course, it will not. It will apply, by legislation, on 1 July next year. Therefore, the stable recovery of the economy, which this Budget has provided for and which will not overheat the economy, can proceed in its early phases without this being an impost on business and, as the recovery quickens and picks up next year, this provision can be met.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, there is an assumption that no-one seems to be paying superannuation now and that a 5 per cent surcharge is to be levied on everyone. That, of course, is not true. Most employers have an award requirement to pay at least 3 per cent superannuation. Therefore, when the impost comes, it will be only an impost of an extra 2 per cent and, indeed, is a year off. It is even less than that for small business and maybe will be no impost at all. Small business for this purpose has been defined as companies with about 24 employees which, by any definition of small business, is middle to medium size in an economy like Australia's.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make two other points in conclusion. It has been said that this is bad for business. There is no estimate available from Treasury as to what superannuation funds will be worth by the turn of the century under our scheme, but private sector estimates, based on a 9 per cent outcome, are that, by the year 2000, the total holdings of superannuation funds in Australia will be between $300 billion and $600 billion. That is money held by Australian working people in their superannuation funds for investment in Australian industry. This must be a significant pool of investment because, while on the one hand it is a cost, on the other hand it is also a benefit. These funds need to be invested to maintain their value and what better source or what better target for investment than the economy of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I make is that we have set a target of 9 per cent by the end of this century. That is a target which, as we travel towards it, could be 12 per cent with employee contributions or some consideration on tax. It is a target of 9 per cent, but it is a target related, importantly, to the wage outcome performance every year. As we perform through accords in achieving moderate wage outcomes, thus we will perform in putting in place the cornerstones of this significant social advance. But if the wages target were to blow out, obviously that would be a consideration as to how quickly we would move to the target on superannuation. This is a major social advance. It should be recognised as that. It is also a significant investment boon to the economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Treasurer will be aware that the Budget Papers show that total public borrowings are expected to blow out to $17 billion, or 4.3 per cent of GDP, this year. Is the Minister aware that this wantonly irresponsible plundering of the nation's already depleted savings pool represents the largest collapse in public savings ever recorded? Does the Minister agree that there can be no sustained lift in employment until national savings are substantially increased?

I have not heard any comments of the kind contained in Senator Short's question. Certainly I agree with the figures. Senator Short described them as `wantonly irresponsible'. Looking back over the history of this country, I cannot agree with the assumption that there can be no sustainable lift in employment with that level of public borrowings because there have been very high levels of public borrowings accompanied by increases in employment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer by noting the recent comments by Minister Dawkins that the trend in Europe has been for governments to be re-elected despite high levels of unemployment. Given that the Government yesterday budgeted for a million unemployed throughout 1991-92, is the level of unemployment irrelevant to this Labor Government as long as it can get re-elected? How high does unemployment have to get before the Government changes its commitment to free market ideology and intervenes in the economy to boost investment and job opportunities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has asked me this question in numerous guises over two or three years. First of all, I repeat some of the things I have said in the past. Of course the Government deeply regrets the current level of unemployment. It is higher than any of us would wish. In saying that I remind Senator Spindler again that it was the Government's view in 1990-91 that spending growth was unsustainably high and we would have been in much greater difficulty if we had not taken steps to slow demand in the economy. That contributed significantly to unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not. Those opposite are the experts on this. Wages policy contributed to unemployment in 1982-83 because they had no wages policy. Those opposite are the experts on that. Let me say, Senator Spindler, for the purpose of helping the kinder, as they call them in Germany, understand the answer, that Government policy in 1990-91 was a contributing factor to higher levels of unemployment. In terms of sustainable employment in the future, we have greatly reduced inflation and reduced the current account deficit, which is the basis for sustainable growth and the creation of new jobs in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that Senator Spindler is concerned about a transition period to recovery. I will make one or two comments about that. If one looks at the Budget, the key measures, together with the package announced in the March 1991 economic statement, provide for an increase in expenditure on labour market programs from $399m to $598m, which is an increase of 50 per cent. An expansion of the job skill program to provide training and work experience for 9,000 long term unemployed people was announced in March. A further $15m was made available for the training program and skills program. About $420m has been allocated to TAFE, including $40m in 1991-92 for extra TAFE places. One hundred and eighty million dollars has been allocated to entry level and skills training, including $12m for measures to keep apprentices and trainees in employment.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures are not put as any solution to the problem of significant unemployment, but they are designed to strengthen the skills base of job seekers and workers, thereby hastening their return to employment and ensuring that skill shortages do not emerge during the recovery period. For those in extreme financial crisis, the Government in the Budget has allocated an additional amount of money for emergency relief over the next two financial years. The Government has also reduced waiting periods for rent assistance for the unemployed. All those measures contrast with the policies of the Opposition as enunciated by its present leader.</PARA>
<PARA> The present Leader of the Opposition has said that clearly most of the long term unemployed will be expected to accept jobs that they would otherwise find unacceptable or live by their own means. The programs enunciated in this Budget and in the March statement do not require people to live by their own means, whatever that phrase means in the minds of those opposite. I could go on and say a few words about other proposed economic policies of the Opposition, which would only enhance in the present circumstances the difficult situation which the unemployed face.</PARA>

I am grateful that the Minister has stated that the measures he has rattled off are no solution to the present level of unemployment. I would have been much more impressed if he had suggested that the Government was going to reconsider public investment, since private investment is shown to be collapsing in the Government's own Budget Papers. I also refer to some comments by the present Treasurer, Mr Kerin, who seemed to indicate that at some stage-at least before he was pulled into line-he was prepared to take a more interventionist line.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It relates to the coup d'etat and the state of emergency in the Soviet Union. I refer to reports overnight of widespread civil disobedience in the USSR in reaction to the coup, some accounts of violence, and even suggestions of desertion in the Soviet military. Can the Minister give an updated assessment of the situation in the Soviet Union, including the Government's present judgment of the likelihood of the coup being sustained?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are both positive and negative elements in the reports that we are receiving and it is very difficult at this stage to balance them out in any very credible way. On the negative side, we remain very deeply concerned at reports-some unconfirmed-that Soviet armed forces are using force in various parts of the Soviet Union. We now have reports-I think this has been in the media-of four civilian deaths now in Moscow resulting from clashes with the military. Moreover, the military has moved large reinforcements into Moscow and it appears to be using tanks against barricades around the Russian Parliament. The most recent reports in that respect are that those tanks stopped some 500 metres short of the Parliament building with a massive crowd intervening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been further unconfirmed reports in the last hour or so-in fact, rather flimsy ones-that there may be some withdrawal of troops and equipment from the centre of Moscow, but it is simply too early to make a judgment about the veracity of those reports. There was also shooting this morning in the vicinity of the Parliament building.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, there are some quite disturbing reports coming from the Baltic states following the seizure by Soviet forces of strategic targets, including broadcasting stations. The military has been threatening to assault the parliaments of both Lithuania and Latvia, although we have not had confirmation that that has actually happened. Moreover, very recently there has been a further assault in Estonia on the radio and television station in Tallinn and an occupation of that. In Latvia, troops have delivered an ultimatum to the defenders around the Parliament to disarm. On the reports available to us, Soviet troops have in fact arrested Latvia's Prime Minister, Mr Ivans Godmanis.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are the negatives. On the more positive side, it is still unclear that this bid for power will succeed. As I said yesterday, we should not rush to the judgment that the coup is irreversible. Overnight there has been considerable turmoil in the membership of the so-called State of Emergency Committee. Three of its members have resigned or, for some other reason, relinquished their positions. One of them, Prime Minister Pavlov, seems on reports available to us to have been genuinely ill with some kind of heart attack. But as to Defence Minister Yazov and KGB chief Kryuchkov, although stated also to have been ill, such illness as they have had seems to be more of the diplomatic variety, and possibly based on their concerns about whether massive force should be used to consolidate the coup.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also obvious that the coup is encountering very clear opposition in other ways. President Yeltsin's call for strikes, anti-coup demonstrations and general resistance has been heeded in many parts of the Russian federation, with over 100,000 people rallying in Moscow last night our time and up to 200,000 in Leningrad.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of Soviet military units have gone over to supporting the populace. Just who and where they are is a little unclear in terms of a tally at the moment, but there are significant movements of that kind occurring. Moreover, the leaderships of the Soviet Union's two key republics after the Russian federation, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, have assured President Yeltsin of their support.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to give any balanced judgment, as I said, as to what is likely to happen. The most important thing right now is that the Soviet authorities not step over the precipice and attempt to use force against the populace. If that occurs, needless to say it will have the most profoundly negative implications for Australia's relations with the Soviet Union, as it will for the USSR's relations with all civilised countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp, who flops out of the right wing think tank in Melbourne and comes up here full of new ideas, says that it has done a lot for employment. Senator Kemp should get together with some of his brighter colleagues and work out what unemployment in this country is currently about. It is not about wages policy. This is the loopy view that emanates from sections of this Opposition day after day with noisy interjections and no analysis, as with everything else Opposition members say. That is what happens here. A few weeks ago it was good enough for Senator Kemp to come here to argue that interest rates were responsible for unemployment. He was more right then than he is today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coming back to Senator Vanstone's question, let me say that it is very difficult to measure productivity movements, but in the case of an economy coming out of a recession productivity figures always improve, because there is an increase in use of capacity and a variety of other factors, such as increased production, which contribute to productivity figures. All one can say with a degree of certainty is that as this economy comes out of the recession there will be significant increases in productivity, as happened when the economy came out of the Liberal Government's recession. That will happen again on this occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. As I understand the Minister's answer, what he is saying is that, because we are now in a recession, he expects productivity growth to be better in the forthcoming year than it has been in any of the last six years, when it has not exceeded one per cent. I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate whether he did mean to give that as an answer. Secondly, the Minister said that he cannot say what the wages outcome will be. Despite the fact that the Government estimate is a 4.5 per cent growth in 1991-92, Senator Button says that he cannot really say what the wages outcome will be. I suppose it is a bit like the Treasurer saying, `Your guess is as good as mine'. Then, at the end of Senator Button's answer-I hope he will forgive me for being confused--</PARA></TALK.START>

I will give Senator Vanstone a prepared answer about that which will answer her later question. Wages outcomes are, of course, always more difficult to determine when one has a less centralised system. Under the centralised system which has operated largely during the life of this Government, wages outcomes have been very predictable and have been met. But the Opposition wants a totally decentralised system. There is no such thing as estimating wage outcomes under a totally decentralised system such as the Opposition wants.

In the light of the Budget delivered by the Treasurer yesterday, can the Minister inform the Senate what steps the Federal Government is now taking to further ensure that legal aid and legal advice continue to be made available to those most in need, particularly in rural areas?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="798" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Reynolds takes a particular interest in this matter as she moves in the outback areas of north Queensland and, indeed, in the major provincial towns north of Brisbane, particularly around Townsville. She has taken a major interest in the recent establishment of the community legal centre in Townsville. In this Budget the Government has tried to provide more resources for community legal centres and legal aid commissions around Australia to ensure that persons have access to legal advice, despite the fact that they do not have sufficient financial resources to purchase that advice from private practitioners in the normal way. The Commonwealth Government has almost doubled the money available for community legal centres, as stated in the Budget delivered last night. This is in recognition of the very valuable service-and I see Senator Vanstone is nodding in approval-provided by those centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The centres are invariably well situated in those areas, quite often in the inner city, where the income level of households is low and where the advice that is sought is very appropriate to the sorts of problems facing the inhabitants of those areas, tenancy law being just one example. There are many other examples.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the community legal centres which attract the voluntary service of legal practitioners-in a study given to me a few months ago it has been estimated that about $2m worth of such advice is given free of charge by lawyers attracted to serve in these community legal centres on a voluntary basis-ought to be encouraged. We will be taking steps to ensure that this extra money not only reinforces some of the existing centres but is provided to set up new centres in provincial and rural areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also a fact that the Government has provided an extra $8.4m in one-off funds for legal aid commissions over the next three years in order to enable those commissions to deal with the increase in demand that they have faced, and in particular to deal with the costs of significant criminal cases where tremendous resources are required in order to provide a defence for those who are charged, for example, in relation to conspiracy to import drugs. Very long and complex trials of many defendants can drain a legal aid commission of much money that can be better made available for the many cases that come through its doors seeking aid.</PARA>
<PARA> Altogether, the total Commonwealth allocation for legal aid in this year's Budget is $126m. I believe that, with a matching response from the States, either out of their own treasuries or out of Westpac moneys, we can ensure that legal aid is provided to those who have a real need in our community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government deliberately involved the Prices Surveillance Authority in the reform process in the maritime area to ensure that the productivity gains that result from that program are passed on to the users. The answer to the second part of Senator Colston's question is yes, the major Queensland port of Brisbane is included in this reference.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald's would be the first to be organised, if I had a say in it. The Authority found that the tugboat industry is inherently monopolistic, with only a single operator providing towage in many ports. The inquiry concluded that port users may not receive the full benefits of the Government's reforms unless the competition is increased and the charges subjected to surveillance. The Government agreed with that view. The Authority recommended that it place the prices of towage services in major ports under formal surveillance and that it monitor charges in some smaller ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Towage charges, in fact, represent a very significant part of the total cost of getting a ship in and out of port-about 10 per cent. The Minister assisting the Treasurer announced last week a formal declaration under the Prices Surveillance Act of towage operators in six major shipping ports-Sydney, Melbourne, Fremantle, Brisbane, Newcastle and Adelaide-and the monitoring of prices in smaller ports. The declaration requires that the towage companies concerned notify the Authority and obtain endorsement for the proposed increases in their charges.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will review the impact on towage charges of major crew reductions on tugs and reduction in the number of tug crews, brought about by the Government's maritime reform program. I notice that not only did the shipping industry and user groups welcome this reference but also one of the major towing companies in Australia has welcomed this scrutiny.</PARA>

Does the Minister agree that the move will result in a more effective payments regime with consequent benefits for pension recipients? In view of his comment in the letter that `If a government can contract to the private sector for computing of payment of pensions there is nothing in the whole area of administration that cannot be outsourced', why would even dramatically greater efficiencies not be derived from contracting out social security payments?

I have to concede to the Senate that I have not won every argument; there have been times-it does happen-when I have been defeated.

I suggest to him, too, having read his press releases of late, that he please understand that relief for community welfare agencies is not handled by my portfolio but by the portfolio of my colleague Brian Howe. He should please also note that the increases which occurred last year and this year are far greater than those which he has acknowledged in his press releases.

More importantly, does he acknowledge, the decision having been taken by the Government and those services being contracted out in Veterans' Affairs, that there is no logical reason why the same could not be done in his own Department? Finally, why did the Minister leave it so long to write to the Prime Minister? Is it because he could no longer expect any special favours, even early morning golf invitations from the present incumbent, or has he been too preoccupied with his duties as campaign manager for the former Treasurer?</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: given Westpac's involvement in the foreign currency loans fiasco, if it is found guilty, does its board positions on Channel 9 and Channel 10 leave it open to fit and proper questions, as happened to Alan Bond recently? Does the Minister believe that Westpac's dual board positions on Channel 9 and Channel 10 are consistent with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's responsibility to ensure that banks do not unduly control media programming, even though they have special exemptions as bank lenders?

As I recall it, a very well documented report which was prepared, I think, by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on levels of subsidies on agricultural products was published in Europe.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. It concerns the $3.50 patient co-payment under Medicare. Given that this charge is to reduce patient demand and indirectly to address doctor over-servicing, can the Minister say what impact the introduction of the co-payment will have and how the Government intends to measure it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a national health strategy paper prepared by Professor Richardson which showed that co-payments could have an impact on demand and, in the absence of measures to deal with supply, doctors would generate more services to reduce the impact. That seems to be a straightforward and evident proposition. The Government will consult with the profession to address both the supply side and the quality of care and time. These measures are consistent with the findings of the national health strategy. I know that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Brian Howe, intends to engage in that consultation to get this comprehensive approach to the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Research has also indicated that there is no link between health status and the number of GP consultations attended. Health is much more than the absence of disease; it is also affected by a range of financial, environmental, housing and community service factors. Accordingly, public health should be seen in the wider context of health and community services and facilities. Rather than lowering the level of public health, the major reforms affecting the provision of primary health care services from 1 July 1992 have the potential to substantially improve health care at lower overall costs. This requires patients to assess their situation wisely to determine whether or not a GP consultation is warranted. By choosing a doctor who direct bills, non-card holder patients can limit their out-of-pocket costs to no more than $3.50 per visit. Of course, most financially disadvantaged persons should be protected by the exemption provisions for card holders and pensioners, while substantially improved Medicare safety net arrangements come into effect for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last six years, Medicare has succeeded in containing the community's health care costs but this trend cannot continue indefinitely without significant damage to the quality of care available to the public. The Government therefore proposes changes to current benefits arrangements, which take effect from 1 July 1992, to encourage higher quality of care in general practice. As I say, these changes will be discussed with representative medical professional organisations over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the discussions will be to enable both the profession and the Government to pursue their legitimate roles, while ensuring that there is a greater synthesis between the two. It is the responsibility of the profession to set and supervise standards. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that financing mechanisms permit access to necessary medical services while constraining costs to ensure the long term sustainability of Medicare and assisting the profession to provide high quality care.</PARA>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Commission records details of the fee charged and whether the service was bulkbilled or patient billed for every Medicare claim. It informs the patient when the threshold is reached and the patient is eligible for 100 per cent rebates. This data will be used to monitor the effect on patient out-of-pocket costs and whether there is a move away from bulkbilling. In addition, Medicare claims provide comprehensive data on utilisation patterns. These data will be used to examine the effects of the changes on service use overall and, for example, by region or by age group.</PARA>

<TITLE>Physiotherapists: X-Rays:</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="803" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Patterson asked me about physiotherapists and the ordering of X-Ray services. I seek leave to incorporate a response in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1 May 1991, the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services (diagnostic radiology, CT scanning, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear scanning) has been dependent upon the service being provided by a medical practitioner at the written request of another practitioner who has no financial interest in the provision of those services. With a few exceptions, the requesting practitioner must be a medical practitioner. For X-rays of the head, the requesting practitioner may be a dental practitioner and for X-rays of the spine, the requesting practitioner may be a chiropractor.</PARA>
<PARA>With certain exceptions, the new written request requirement for imaging services applies to all services which are classified as ``R-type'' [requested/referred] services. Services not subject to the request requirement are classified as ``NR-type'' [unrequested/unreferred] services. For some services there is one ``(R)'' item and a corresponding ``(NR)'' item. The Schedule fees for ` `(NR)'' services are approximately 75% of those for the corresponding ``(R)'' services.</PARA>
<PARA>The X-ray services which are classified as ``NR-type'' services are mostly those relating to examinations of the extremities, e.g. X-rays of the arms and legs. These items are not subject to the written request requirement and, as such, have no restrictions on the payment of benefits related to who orders them.</PARA>
<PARA>If the medical practitioner who renders an ``NR-type'' service is prepared to accept responsibility for the medical necessity of that service, Medicare benefits would be payable.</PARA>
<PARA>Concerning the non-payment of Medicare benefits for ``R-type'' services (e.g. X-rays of the spine) ordered by physiotherapists, the new benefits arrangements for imaging services place referrals for these procedures on the same footing as referrals for other specialist services. This means that they are required to be rendered subject to a formal referral process and, generally, at the request of a medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Physiotherapy Association (APA) has raised a range of issues about the impact of this legislation on physiotherapists. It also lodged a submission seeking to have the legislation amended.</PARA>
<PARA>I recently met with representatives of the Association and gave them an undertaking that I would seek, at the earliest opportunity and within certain parameters, an amendment to the legislation which would make provision for the requesting of ``R-type'' X-rays by physiotherapists. The parameters which were accepted by the Association's representatives were that physiotherapists would be restricted to the requesting of the same ``R-type'' X-rays as chiropractors, viz. X-rays of the spine and pelvic area.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope to be able to introduce the requisite legislative amendments during this Session of Parliament.</PARA>

Advice received from the Attorney-General's Department indicates such re-examination not to be necessary.

<PARA>Dear Senator MacGibbon</PARA>
<PARA>You will recall that on 21 June 1991, during debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, I gave an undertaking to re-examine the level of penalty associated with the breach of subsection 32AB(2) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 32AB deals with the issuing of identity cards for Civil Aviation Authority investigators. Specifically, subsection 32AB(2) provides that a person who ceases to be an investigator must return his or her card as soon as is practicable, and subsection 32AB(3) provides that if this is not done (without reasonable excuse) then that person is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $100.</PARA>
<PARA>During the Committee stage, you expressed the opinion that the $100 fine was not a sufficient deterrent to prevent ex-investigators, who had not returned their identity cards, from using their cards to pass themselves off as investigators. I gave an undertaking that together we would reexamine the level of the penalty at some later stage and, if necessary, work towards a future amendment to increase it to an appropriate level.</PARA>
<PARA>Advice has been obtained by my Department from the Attorney-General's Department that a person who fails to return his or her identity card and uses it to personate a Civil Aviation Authority investigator would breach section 75 of the Crimes Act 1914. Section 75 of the Crimes Act essentially provides that any person who personates any Commonwealth officer or falsely represents himself to be a Commonwealth officer is guilty of an offence and is subject to a penalty of 2 years imprisonment and or a fine of $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General's Department has also confirmed that subsection 32AB(3) of the Civil Aviation Act provides merely for the failure to return an identity card and advises that, given section 75 of the Crimes Act, there is no need to increase the penalty associated with this provision.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that these comments satisfactorily address your concerns.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-When I was absent from the chamber on Tuesday, 13 August, Senator Coulter made what could be described as a speech in which he referred to the subject of the Industry Commission inquiry into motor vehicles. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is about time that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, as the Minister responsible, began to properly discharge his duty in directing the Industry Commission to carry out its function properly under its Act and so far Senator Button has failed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The IC has one commissioner appointed to its commissioners and it has totally inadequate staff . . . Again, I point to the Minister responsible, Senator Button, who is not properly discharging his responsibility as the Minister and not seeing that the IC is properly discharging its responsibility under its Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to point out two things to Senator Coulter. The Industry Commission is established by its own statute; it is an independent authority. It is not susceptible to the direction of any Minister in terms of its inquiry. If it were subject to any directions in relation to matters of staffing and things like that, it would be subject to the direction of the Treasurer not to me as the Minister for Industry. That has been the case for four years. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>As with previous statements, I presume we should treat this as an interim expression of the position but it does, I must say, raise a number of questions that will have to be addressed in due course. Mr President, as you have put to us, this matter has now been resolved in accordance with the original offer. If I am to interpret that as the original offer, which the Department of Finance said was beyond your capacity to make, that raises questions, and no doubt you will answer them in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue, of course, is a concern on this side of the chamber that the picket has only just been suspended. We draw to your attention again that it is an illegal industrial action. The view on this side of the chamber is that action should have been taken about that well before today. In particular, Ministers responsible for Commonwealth functions, such as Senator Bolkus, should not have allowed their drivers, their employees, to observe an illegal barrier in the way that they have done. Although it is important when it is a matter of hindering the Parliament, it is equally important if an illegal picket is put around any other function of Australian enterprise or government. It is very much a matter of regret on this side of the chamber that the Government and, with great respect, to some extent you, Mr President, and Mr Speaker, were not prepared to stand up to that illegality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a good idea to tell people because about two million people are dependent on the Murray-Darling basin's resources for their livelihoods. It just so happens that I live in the Murray-Darling basin, and it is a great area of Australia in which to live. Around 1.8 million people live in the basin. It is sustained by its agricultural, forestry, service and mining industries. About 0.4 million people live outside the basin, but are supported by the resources from within it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Water is exported from this catchment to supply most of the developed area of South Australia. I am quite sure that those South Australians in the chamber at the moment would want to receive good water and we want to send good water down to them. We want to make sure that it is not taking a lot of our soil, which is definitely the lifeblood of our country for it grows our crops and produces our grasses which produce beef, wool and all the other things that come from agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> There are about 1.6 million hectares of land irrigated in Australia in total and 1.2 million hectares are located within this basin. The land produces about 90 per cent of Australia's irrigated field crops-wheat, coarse grains, sorghum, oilseeds, rice and cotton-about 80 per cent of its pasture and lucerne, 70 per cent of its fruit, and 25 per cent of its vegetables. The basin actually supports about one-half of the total number of sheep in Australia, one-half of Australia's cropland, one-quarter of its dairy farms, and onequarter of its cattle. The annual value of primary and secondary production in the basin is about $10,000m which, together with associated value added components of the economy, accounts for something like 30 to 40 per cent of the total production from Australia's natural resource-based industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this report is well set out. But one of the things that concern me about bodies such as the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and other such bodies is the top heaviness of the operations and whether money is sometimes wasted there. I think that is something which needs to be looked at in the future. I believe that the Commission does a good job and the report highlights the importance of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things about the water supply in South Australia which must be of concern to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is the algal blooms. Last year the algal blooms caused big problems for water storage and water quality. It is something that will have to be looked at in the future because of the quality of water that is needed for the people of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I commend this report to the Senate. I believe that all of us who live in the big Murray-Darling catchment or in other catchments have to be ever-mindful of the need to look after the resources in that area. That is where land care, total catchment management or whatever it happens to be has to be conducted on a sustainable basis with a view to the future. Whilst always trying to maximise our use of this resource in our own lifetimes, we must make sure that we do not leave it in a worse state for future generations. </PARA>

That does not seem to me to be a very effective way of reporting. Timeliness is an important factor in effective reporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among the reasons I am concerned about it is the fact that, once again, we have a letter from the president, the chief executive officer, or whoever writes these letters covering such governmental bodies, to the then Minister, Mr Kerin, who was at that stage the Chairman of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. This letter from the President, Mr Fitzpatrick, covering the report has no date on it. We get a view of when the report was done, however, because we have accounts that were apparently signed and prepared by Mr Fitzpatrick, the President, and Mr Blackmore, the Chief Executive, on 20 January 1991. We also have the Auditor-General's report, which is dated 7 February 1991. Yet we have no explanation-we are not given the courtesy of an explanation-as to why it has taken from the beginning of this year, when the audited report was finalised, until August for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to report to this Parliament as it is obliged to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether it has taken a long time to get the State Ministers to agree to the content of the report. I would assume not, because I would not imagine that the audited accounts would have been prepared in the first place without their approval.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering the annual report of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission for 1990. The report states that more than 2 million people or about one-eighth of the people of Australia are dependent on the Murray-Darling Basin for their livelihood. I commend the map on page 6 of this report to honourable senators for careful examination. The map shows that this basin extends over most of Victoria and New South Wales, the southern part of Queensland and much of the south-eastern corner of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Its size is not the most important feature. It is the most fertile part of Australia. It consists of 75 per cent of the irrigated lands. It produces 90 per cent of Australia's irrigated field crops. It produces 80 per cent of Australia's pasture and lucerne. It produces 70 per cent of Australia's fruit, and 25 per cent of our vegetables. It is not only the salad bowl of Australia, but it provides at least half of every meal that we eat. It supports 50 per cent of Australia's sheep, 50 per cent of our crop land, 25 per cent of our dairy farms and 25 per cent of our cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual value of primary and secondary production in the Murray-Darling Basin is about $10 billion, which accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of Australia's primary production. I urge honourable senators to take a careful look at the map on page 6 because this region, which is so crucial to Australia, may be dying. Deserts are advancing at an incredible rate into the farmlands of the world. Australia is already largely desert. It is the driest continent in the world and has fragile soils and major salinity problems. The Murray-Darling Basin is under imminent threat from the ever-encroaching desert. It has been predicted that the Murray-Darling Basin could become desert within 90 years if something is not done. The Murray-Darling desert will become a reality if we do not act immediately and change our land management practices. </PARA>
<PARA> What has caused these problems? The basin sits on an ancient seabed, which still contains large deposits of salt. Extensive land clearing and the irrigation of large sections of the basin have raised the watertable, and large areas of arable land have become saline. If this process is not stopped, large areas of the Murray-Darling Basin will become wastelands. The only way that the deserts will be held at bay is if there are massive changes in land use practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Murray-Darling Basin Commission was created in 1988. This 1990 annual report is its second report and begins by identifying three areas of concern for the management of the basin. They are, first, inappropriate land management. There has been extensive clearing and extensive irrigation, and this has adversely affected the land and water in the basin. Secondly, water quality is poor and this is exacerbated by salinity and nutrients. Thirdly, there is growing degradation of the natural environment, including rivers. On page 8 of its report the Commission spells out these problems:</PARA>
<PARA>Pressing salinity and waterlogging problems are developing in the Basin. These are a major threat to irrigated land and streams, lakes and wetlands. Some 720,000 hectares of irrigated land have watertables that have risen to near the land surface and this is expected to increase to 1,300,000 hectares in the next 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report urgently to the Senate. A number of programs have been developed to check further problems and to reverse the degradation, but there is increasing urgency for more to be done-for the planting of trees and natural vegetation; for a switch to more dryland farming; for soil conservation; and for incentives for farmers and horticulturists to take urgent action on their own farms. Above all, there is an urgent need for the Government to commit money and resources into measures that will save billions of dollars in lost rural production in the long run and head off the greatest threat that faces the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the 1990-91 annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I would like to remind those in the chamber today that it was only yesterday in this Parliament that the Australian people received a document of doom and gloom, and I refer to the Budget. By the Government's own admission, its predictions for our economic growth have been tragically wrong. The Government's ability to manage our economy has shown to be non-existent. The Budget introduced yesterday was framed on an unemployment level of 10.8 per cent and a massive 1.3 million Australians who are now either unemployed or underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> These are indeed very difficult times for the man and woman on the street. They are even more difficult times for those who are trying to raise a family or for those who are trying to find work. It is fitting therefore that, whilst the rest of the country struggles, I use some of the time available to me to speak to this report to highlight the blatant waste of taxpayers' funds which is being perpetrated by this Government whilst the overwhelming majority of Australians in these difficult times have been asked to tighten their belt or go without. That is certainly not evident in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In particular, I refer to the use of consultants-a use which, in this Department alone, cost the Australian taxpayer almost $2m this last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> So what have been the areas that have required the use of taxpayers' funds? I am sure that many taxpayers would be very interested to know that $500,000 has been spent on a study of the living and work standards across our country. Why half a million dollars should need to be spent on such an exercise is certainly beyond comprehension. There surely can be very few-except obviously those associated with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-who are unaware of the very clear fact that living and work standards are decreasing rapidly. I suggest that, rather than wasting half a million dollars on a study which could have been completed by a very brief reading of the major suburban newspapers on any day of the week, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would have been better off allocating $500,000 towards assisting those Australian families who are currently living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes it clear that poverty is not something with which our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is familiar. Whilst tonight thousands of Australians will be going to bed without a roof over their head, substituting instead any temporary shelter which they can find, the Prime Minister has seen fit to spend $97,000 on advice on architectural engineering and building matters in relation to the Lodge and Kirribilli House. I suggest that comes on top of quite a few million dollars spent renovating the places over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has spent the equivalent of what many people would spend on providing a roof over their head on simply getting advice on how he can renovate his. This is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money and, once again, it demonstrates the lack of real concern by this Government and the Prime Minister. I note on page 219 of the report that $152,000 has been spent on maintaining a multicultural Australia and immigration studies database. For the life of me, I cannot see why this work could not have been done by one of the many government bureaucracies dealing with such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not just big ticket items about which I believe the taxpayer has every right to be concerned about in this report. There are many smaller items too. For example, $10,000 has been spent on research and written material for a publication on multicultural aspects of the food and wine industry; and $5,500 has been spent simply to develop a multicultural poster. Spending $5,500 to develop a poster is a disgraceful priority in my book. An amount of $53,000 has been spent by the Office of the Status of Women to investigate the subject of women and ecologically sustainable development. Personally, I must admit that I have a great deal of difficulty in seeing how the two issues are in the slightest way related. Secondly, why should Australian taxpayers have to spend $53,000 of their money trying to find out why they are? Nor should Australian taxpayers have to pay $4,000 so that the Office of the Status of Women can employee a consultant to evaluate its own newsletter. If the officers from the Department could not have completed that exercise themselves, one wonders what they were there for in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I stress that this report shows how the Government clearly has its priorities wrong. It is time that the Government became more concerned with the real issues facing the Australian community, rather than the many fanciful whims which are referred to in this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to say a few words about the annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and to endorse very strongly the words of my friend and colleague Senator Calvert. Many of the points that he made are very important and I will just supplement his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The use of consultants coincides with significant increases in the actual staff of the Department. For example, in 1990-91, the year to which the annual report relates, there was an 11 per cent increase in the staff of the Department, excluding the growth in the number of consultants. From the Budget Papers yesterday we learned that there will be another 4 1/2 per cent increase in the staff that will be employed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> Those staff figures for the year reflect also, at least to some extent, the increase in the actual cost of running the Department. In 1990-91 the cost of running the Prime Minister's Department was $63.8m, an increase of 30.6 per cent on the preceding year. That is an extraordinary increase in the cost of departmental administration in one year. The 1991-92 Budget Papers which were released yesterday show that at a time when we are in the midst of the deepest, most protracted recession in the last 60 years in Australia-due to the mismanagement of this Government and its economic policies -when more than one million people are unemployed, there will be another 13.3 per cent increase in the cost of the administration of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, taking the figure to no less than $72.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, in the context of the financial integrity of the Department, to note that the Auditor-General has given a qualification in his audit of the Department. His note appears on page 279 of the report and says that certain fixed assets at Admiralty House, Sydney, have been excluded from the Statement of Supplementary Information provided by the Department. The Auditor-General's note goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The financial statement guidelines made by the Minister for Finance require that the value of certain fixed assets be included in the Statement of Supplementary Information including the assets of the type excluded by the department. The value of the excluded assets could not be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly requires an explanation by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I just make the point that this report-and I welcome the promptness of its availability to the Parliament-is nothing more than a taxpayer funded indulgence of yet another super ego trip by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). There are no fewer than 15 action shots of the Prime Minister in this document. The summary of the Department's highlights for the year at the start of the report is almost exclusively that the Prime Minister did this or the Prime Minister did that-virtually nothing about the highlights of the Department itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, even in looking at the situation with regard to the Prime Minister, there seem to me to be two very important highlights in the year relating to the Prime Minister that are excluded from this report-inadvertent, I guess-and I hope that next year there will not be similar exclusions. For example, there is no mention under the monthly highlights for June 1991 that the Prime Minister survived a leadership challenge, nor is there any mention that at the end of year the Prime Minister presided over the worst collapse in the Australian economy in 60 years. I hope that deficiency is rectified next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and particularly on the 12 pages covering the Office of the Status of Women. I was interested in the comments of my colleague Senator Calvert about the Office of the Status of Women. He referred particularly to the consultant's report on the newsletter. I would have thought there was no need for a consultant's report at all, because the purpose of the newsletter appears to be entirely one of pushing the Government as being deeply caring about women. All it is doing is pushing the Government for vote winning purposes. I do not think it is failing in that exercise, although I question whether that should be the purpose of the newsletter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report mentions the national working party on portrayal of women in the media. What it fails to say is that the Government has not picked up the problems being faced by women in the area of 0055 telephone numbers. It seems to be more concerned about the portrayal of women as bimbos selling soap powder than the portrayal of women in pornography. The National Committee on Violence Against Women is also referred to in the report. Once again, the head of the Office of the Status of Women is a member of that Committee, as she is of the working party on the portrayal of women in the media. I would have thought that issues of major concern to mainstream women such as pornography would have been dealt with by one or the other of those committees, but they have not been. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that the same Office of the Status of Women appears to have been responsible for the Women's Budget Statement which has just appeared in the Parliament. It is 414 pages long, and nothing but a propaganda exercise. It is full of puffery and fudging. It draws in programs from all the departments, many of them with no special relevance to women. Occasional programs for women are tucked in here and there within a mass of paper. I compare that with the same document produced for the Budget last year, which managed to get by with 240 pages. That in itself was too large. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) managed to put out a Budget document yesterday on health reform implications. They were all contained within 12 pages, and I wonder why the women's budget, if there needs to be one at all, cannot be contained within such a space because all we need in a Budget document are the initiatives for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should take the scissors to this so-called women's budget, bring it down to size and save the trees, which are needed. Then we might see something about women and sustainable development. What the Government did not put in the Women's Budget Statement is the fact that the Government has slashed the budget of the Women's Bureau in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which over the years has done some first rate work in research on women and employment. I point out that it was implemented by a Liberal government back in the late 1960s. Needless to say, it has been of good practical purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> From the puffery in the Women's Budget Statement we would have no idea that approximately six people have been left to do lines and lines of work, although the key words are `they will focus on'. Clearly, that is all they will be able to do. I would say that they will only be able to read the newspapers; they will have no time to do anything meaningful with the number of people left to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proper that we in the Parliament should get a report on the expenditure of the previous year, but the proper place is in the annual report. In the case of the Office of the Status of Women that responsibility is properly within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The other initiatives that may be of some special interest to women should properly be covered in the annual reports of the departments-not put into this 400-page blockbuster about how marvellous the Government is. Many of the programs covered in there have no special relevance or importance to women. They are put in that document to increase its size. The Budget document should be restricted to the initiatives for the coming year. </PARA>

<PARA> Unfortunately, in the development of the Crimes (Aviation) Bill, this search power, which is an important part of the security network ensuring aviation safety, was overlooked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald indicated this morning in debate on the Bill that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, after examining the Bill, had queried the application of the definition of `prescribed period' as contained in clause 40. Senator Button indicated that the Government accepts that an amendment to the clause is desirable so as to clarify its application, and an amendment has been circulated. The amendment in the Government's name amends the definition of `prescribed period' contained in paragraph (a) of clause 40 so as to make it clear that in any case where more than one order for the remand of a person is made by a magistrate under clause 39, the period at the end of which that person may apply to be released from custody will be calculated from the date of the first order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald also raised the issue of the effect on the law of the definition of `prescribed period' relating to habeas corpus as contained in paragraph (b) of clause 40. That clause does not affect the substantive law on habeas corpus. The provision re-enacts section 13 of the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973. Its purpose is to set the maximum period for which a person may be remanded under an order pursuant to clause 39. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 40, page 19, paragraph (3) (a), line 22, after ``custody'', insert ``or, if there is more than one such order, the date of the first such order''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the amendment proposed by the Government to clause 40(3) (a) would satisfy the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. However, I believe-and I have spoken with others about this-that the amendment still does not make the legislation as good as the piece of legislation that it is trying to amend and improve. Clause 40(3) (a), as amended, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . or, if there is more than one such order, the date of the first such order. </PARA>
<PARA>As I pointed out to the Minister's staff over the lunch break, that is referring to the order under which the person is held in custody. The person is held in custody under the order then current, so there is not a first, second or third order. It is the period under which the person is then being held in custody. If he has been there seven days and is remanded for another seven days, it is that second seven days order under which he is being held; not the first one. So the amendment which says, `or, if there is more than one such order, the date of the first such order' is irrelevant, in my submission, because there can be only one such order under which he is currently being held. Maybe the Minister's speech as to the interpretation provisions will be sufficient to clarify that, but the clause just does not seem to me to be getting to where the Government wants it to be. It is not tidy, in my view. I simply make the suggestion to the Government, in case it may be interested in trying to improve the wording of the clause. </PARA>
<PARA> There is reference in this Bill to the order in clause 39 under which a person is held in custody. If one refers to clause 39, one finds that the only order that is mentioned is that where a magistrate, not being satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for holding a person, may order that the person be released. That is the only reference to `order'. I would have thought it would have been better to refer to the remand, which is in fact what is intended in clause 39(c). It is the remand which the amendment intends to deal with. This clause leaves the way open for confusion and legal argument at some later date. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that it is the intention of the legislation to allow two months from a certain action so that, as the Minister has just said, no-one can be incarcerated for more than two months without having the opportunity to apply to the Supreme Court. If we read the current description of `prescribed period', we find:</PARA>
<PARA>Where a person remanded in custody under section 39 is still held in that custody at the end of the prescribed period, the person may apply to the Supreme Court . . . </PARA>
<PARA>`Prescribed period' is then defined in relation to a certain matter. In relation to habeas corpus, the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>``prescribed period'', in relation to a person, means 2 months after:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> if the person has applied for a writ of habeas corpus-the day on which that application, or any appeal relating to it, is finally determined;</PARA>
<PARA>whichever is the later. </PARA>
<PARA>The scenario could be that a person is taken into custody today; in 10 days time he applies for habeas corpus; he gets a decision the next day, on day 11 or 12, that he has missed out on that application; he appeals and the appeal is not heard for three months. Then his right to apply under clause 40 is not a period of two months, but 15 days, plus the three months for the appeal period which is when the matter is finally determined. Then it goes for another two months. So if one dares to apply for habeas corpus and then dares to appeal and misses out, instead of being in custody for only two months, one could be in custody for a considerable period. I am confident that that is not what is intended. I would have thought that the provision would say at the end, `whichever is earlier' rather than, `whichever is later'. I raise that point in case the Minister wants to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as I understand it, the purpose of newly re-drafted clauses 39 and 40 is to incorporate provisions similar to those that were in the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act, the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act and the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act. The old legislation- the three Acts are all practically identical-took 13 lines to state very clearly what that provision was all about. The new, amended, improved, clearer-to-understand version takes 18 lines to say the same thing. It says it in a very convoluted way and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had great concern about it. I would like to point the draftsman to a comparison of the old provisions with the new ones. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters that I have been talking about-which, I admit, are very technical, legal and some might even say pedantic-are much more clearly stated in the old legislation. With regard to the point I made about whether it should be `order' or `remand', if one goes to the old Act it states quite simply:</PARA>
<PARA>Where a person remanded under subsection 2 of section 13-</PARA>
<PARA>that would, in effect, be clause 39 (1) (c)-</PARA>
<PARA>is in custody at the expiration of two months after the date of the order of remand by virtue of which his period on remand commenced . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That wording overcomes all of the problems that I have raised and that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has, and I suggest that that is the wording which should be used. The rest of the section goes on more or less to say what is said in the new, revised, short and supposedly clearer version but in fewer words. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern I raise about habeas corpus and the fact that it may be up to four or five months before there can be an application for release under subsection 40(1), is the same in the old legislation as it is in the new. Again, I suggest that the Minister look at the old legislation but even if he were inclined to adopt the old clause-which, as I say, is much clearer-it should be whichever is the earlier event rather than whichever is the later event. That is all very technical and some might say pedantic but I raise these points for two reasons: first, in the hope that it may make things clearer and, secondly, to raise the matter that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was concerned about-which the Government accepts and has tried to correct by the amendment, but which I do not think it has corrected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald has certainly indicated some dissatisfaction with the drafting of these particular amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But in reviewing the history of the matter, one would be able to point to an order that related to the first seven-day period, and I think that is what that is referring to. Senator Macdonald also raised the question of whether the term `remand' rather than `order' might have been better, given the link to 39(1) where the term `order' is used in relation to release from custody. In clause 40, `order' is linked to the idea of custody and, therefore, that is quite a clear provision. For example, 40 (3) (a) says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>When one reads the totality of that particular paragraph, it makes very good sense. As to the question of habeas corpus, I dealt with that in my original remarks. This is virtually a transcription of the present section which has not given cause for alarm. Whilst taking Senator Macdonald's point that a different draftsman could have tackled this matter somewhat differently, I believe that the chamber can accept these clauses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is not opposing the Crimes Amendment Bill 1991, which amends the Crimes Act 1914 in order to give the Australian Federal Police an express power to search aircraft, vehicles and vessels without a warrant in emergencies. Such a power already exists in relation to some Commonwealth legislation, which confers emergency search powers upon various officials including the police. However, there is no such specific power in relation to the vast majority of Commonwealth offences. It has hitherto been considered that the Federal police could rely on the emergency search powers conferred in State and Territory legislation, and applied by section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A decision in the Adelaide Central District Criminal Court in April last year threw this into doubt. The case, R v. Barritt, is an unreported decision of Mr Justice Greaves. It indicates that State law cannot be applied in that way because section 10 of the Crimes Act covers the field. However, section 10 provides only for searches authorised by warrant. The question at issue in the case of Barritt was whether the search of a car by the AFP was lawful. His Honour said that section 10(1) of the Crimes Act:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . must be strictly construed in so far as the power of search provided therein by the Commonwealth Parliament is expressly subjected to certain conditions precedent, those conditions with the protection they afford to the individual must be strictly enforced . . . I see my way clear to reject the proposition that those conditions can be circumvented in a particular State by the operation of section 9(1) (c) of the Australian Federal Police Act just because the local legislature has decided to grant greater powers of search to its local police force for the enforcement of the law of that State. Such a local dispensation with the protection afforded by the conditions of section 10(1) of its Crimes Act would require clear expression or implication by the Commonwealth Parliament and this has not occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>He was of the view that the police officer in this case had no power to search the car without a warrant. The argument thus is that State law cannot be applied, as has been assumed in the past, because section 10 of the Crimes Act covers the field. The requirements of section 10 cannot be excluded by a combination of section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act and section 69 of the Summary Offences Act. Therefore, the Federal police have no power to search without a warrant in relation to the majority of Commonwealth offences.</PARA>
<PARA> Under this Bill, the AFP will have a limited power to make emergency searches of conveyances defined to include aircraft, vehicles and vessels. The new section 10a provides that the power to search without a warrant in emergencies applies when the police reasonably suspect that a thing relevant to an indictable offence is in or on a conveyance, and it is necessary to stop and search the conveyance in order to prevent the thing from being concealed, lost or destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 10a (1) (c) explicitly provides that the power must only be exercised where the circumstances are sufficiently serious and urgent to justify a search without a warrant. Subsection 10a (2) provides for the power to stop, detain and search the conveyance, and to seize the thing relevant to a indictable offence if it is found during the search. Other things relevant to an indictable offence or a summary offence found during the search may also be seized, if the police reasonably suspect that it is necessary in order to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 10b specifies limitations on the exercise of a power under section 10a. The conveyance must be searched in a public place, and must not be detained for any longer than is reasonable and necessary to search it. The police may use such force as is necessary, but must not damage the conveyance or any receptacle in or on it by forcing open a part of the conveyance or receptacle, unless the person in charge of the conveyance or receptacle has been given a reasonable opportunity to open that part themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new section 10c expressly provides that the power to conduct emergency searches without warrant set out in sections 10a and 10b is not intended to limit or exclude the operation of a Territory law relating to the searching of conveyances in connection with offences against the law of a Territory. A thing seized under this Bill may be kept by the police for 60 days, unless it is required in evidence or the police are authorised by law to retain the thing or destroy or dispose of it. The police may also apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for permission to keep the thing for a further period. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not opposing the Bill because we believe that it is reasonable; the safeguards in it are adequate; the powers given by it are explicit; and it can therefore be useful in playing a vital role in the detection of crimes particularly relating to the trafficking of drugs while not on the other hand being unduly intrusive into the normal rights and privacies of individuals. We are therefore prepared to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Crimes Amendment Bill 1991. The Bill seeks to amend the Crimes Act to empower police to search aircraft, vehicles and vessels in emergency situations without a warrant. Commonwealth legislation currently confers such emergency search powers on a wide range of officials including police. However, no such powers are conferred on police in relation to the vast majority of Commonwealth offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The emergency search power which is provided in this Bill is limited. It will only apply in a public place or in some other place to which members of the public have ready access. The amendments will enable a constable to stop, detain and search a conveyance and to seize any item found in the search which it can be reasonably suspected has been used in the commission of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats do not oppose the Bill. However, even at this stage there is a question I should like to direct to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). I refer to the provision whereby police may retain an item for up to 60 days without a court order or authorisation; in other words, they require a court order or authorisation under some other law to release an item or to keep it beyond the 60-day limit. If the person concerned wishes to make application to have the item released in less than 60 days, is that possible either under this legislation or under other provisions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable senators from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats who have indicated their support for what I believe is a very important amendment to the Crimes Act. It provides police officers with powers to search aircraft, vehicles or vessels in emergency situations. There has been sufficient discussion on why this was required. However, there is always concern in the community. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as chairman of the caucus legal committee, have always been extremely vigilant about the question of vesting emergency search powers in police or indeed in any other Commonwealth officers. It is because of your concern that I restricted some of the requests for search powers that have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in this case we are asked to agree to giving the Australian Federal Police powers, which they have always been able to exercise, to search aircraft, vehicles or vessels in emergency situations where it is impossible to get a warrant, at least in a timely way, to ensure that possible evidence was not destroyed and, therefore, a prosecution of criminal offenders could not be mounted with success. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the search power will only apply to a vehicle, vessel or an aircraft in a public area or places to which members of the public have access. The police officer must have reasonable grounds for his or her suspicion that an item relevant to an indictable offence is in or on the conveyance and that it is necessary to carry out the search in order to prevent what might be evidence from being concealed, lost or destroyed. Also, there has to be an urgency about the matter such as would not give the police officer time to obtain the authority of a search warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> This is particularly important in relation to the work of the Australian Federal Police in combating major criminal activity right across Australia. One may particularly think of the investigation of drug offences. Quite clearly, in order to distribute and market those drugs which are forbidden to be circulated in our community under pain of law, it is important to ensure that if a movement of drugs is taking place, for example, by car along a street in Sydney and the police do not have time to get a search warrant, they be able to carry out a search of that vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> But this amendment will prove to be extremely useful not only in relation to drug trafficking. One can think of other various indictable offences where this could be very useful. For example, the Federal Police have a particular responsibility through their international obligation to ensure the physical safety of internationally protected persons, as one can imagine especially here in Canberra, the national capital, where we have so many diplomatic missions. There are also international obligations relating to hijacking and in relation to the protection of Commonwealth premises. It may be quite plausible that there could be circumstances where there would be a need to stop and search a vehicle for firearms or explosives in order to protect the community against some politically motivated violence in relation to those matters which I have described. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that one could have a situation in relation to corporate or computer crime where documents could be moved from one place to another in a vehicle. Once again, it would be essential to carry out a search of the vehicle to ensure that those documents, which might provide evidence of a major corporate crime, were not destroyed or in some way concealed and therefore not available as evidence. So in these ways I believe that there is full justification for the Crimes Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> During the second reading debate, Senator Spindler referred to a case where a person may want to make application to have seized material released in less than 60 days. He asked whether a procedure is available under another law to enable this. I am advised that there is no specified procedure, but there is nothing to stop the police from releasing it in less than 60 days where it is no longer necessary to be held for evidence. If there is any further questioning on that, no doubt I can try to answer it as long as I get a legibly written note. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is a very important Bill. It will help the Australian Federal Police fulfil the obligations which it has to the Australian community and provides for a single regime relating to emergency search of vehicles, aircraft and vessels right across all of the State and Territory jurisdictions of Australia. I think that that is a considerable advance and it is well worth doing, quite apart from achieving the substantive change which I have commended to the chamber. I wish the Bill a successful second reading and a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill presents an opportunity to remind those honourable senators in this chamber who might need reminding-I think that is very few-and those who might be either listening now or reading Hansard later of the good work that this chamber does, as opposed to that in the House of Representatives, and how long it can take for a single good idea to come to fruition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter was referred to the relevant Senate committee, as I understand it, in November 1985. That was the first occasion on which the Senate resolved that the operation and administration of the freedom of information legislation should be looked at and that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was the relevant Committee to undertake that task. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not spoken to the members of the Senate who were members of the Committee at that time, but I am sure that between November 1985 and the election in June 1987 they did a considerable amount of work. Of course, the dissolution of Parliament in 1987 meant that the Committee and the reference basically disappeared. Not long after the Parliament resumed in September 1987 the Senate appointed the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and again referred to it the review of the operation of the Act. It did not take long from that date in 1987, only till December 1987, for a report recommending a very large number of changes-nearly 200, I think-to be made both in the sense of legislative amendments and in the sense of administrative changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 someone had the idea that this Act should be looked at. But we had to wait until December 1987, with some intervening elections, before a number of the contributions of honourable senators for the improvement of freedom of information could be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably worth mentioning that those honourable senators include the now Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, who is in the chamber; Senator Bolkus; Senator Robert Hill, from my State; Senator Richard Alston; Senator Cooney, who of course is now Chairman of the Committee; Senator Alan Missen, who, sadly, died a number of years ago; Senator Puplick; and Senator Margaret Reynolds. Prior to that the members of the Committee included Senator Stone, Senator Schacht, Senator Powell and Senator Giles-the others have already been mentioned. There was some overlapping between the two committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee produced a very substantive report with, I think, 34 or 35 pages of recommendations. That is not to say that length alone is any indicator of value, but it is an indicator of the time and effort taken. Some 126 recommendations were made; that is where we got to between 1985 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, very early in June 1989-about 18 months later-the Government finally responded to the Committee's report and indicated that it approved of a very substantial number of the recommendations, but not all of them. The Government did not accept five or six of the recommendations out of the 100 or so but we really could not expect to win them all. The Committee, no doubt, was happy to achieve what it achieved. That was in June 1989, as I said, some 18 months after the report was tabled in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time, the Minister-I am sorry, I cannot remember who it was-indicated that there was an expectation that legislation would be available in that year; that the Government would not only respond in 1989 but in the Budget session of 1989 something would be done about it. If there is an element of regret in improving the Freedom of Information Act it is that it has taken so long. The Government, as I said, tabled its report in June 1989 and indicated at the time that it thought something could be done-at least in that year. But it has taken up until now-1991-to get something done. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know who it was who first moved the motion that the operation of the Act be looked at-they are probably long gone and possibly even deceased because they did that in 1985. I mention that not because I think we all need a history lesson but because it is pleasant every now and then to realise that although what one is doing may not be appreciated-one may feel as though one is getting nowhere-in the end there is a distinct possibility that something will be done with the work that each of us is putting into the Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wanted to go through the explanatory memorandum and highlight each occasion where the explanation on a particular clause is that it implements a Senate committee recommendation, I do not think, apart from the first page in the outline, that there is a page that does not have at least two or three highlights indicating that just about everything this Bill does is either a direct implementation of a Senate committee recommendation or a consequential amendment flowing from it. As I understand it, we will have the second reading of this Bill today and handle the committee stage at another time. Therefore, it is probably appropriate to say that any remarks with respect to particular clauses will be left until that later date. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to refer to a couple of things this Bill does. It primarily seeks to streamline and simplify the freedom of information procedures-and none of us could argue sensibly that that would be a bad thing-for making a request for access to documents; to provide that a person's right of access is not affected by his or her reasons for seeking access; to allow companies as well as private individuals to have access under the Act to documents that were in existence five years prior to the commencement of the Act; to provide that agency employees be required to use internal agency procedures; and to seek access to personal records before seeking access under the Act. We might query widening the scope of refusal of requests for access to documents where the processing of requests would involve a substantial or unreasonable diversion of agency resources. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who have an interest in freedom of information matters, one can understand a natural tendency to say, `Hold on. That is just going to be used by the bureaucracy as a means of not providing the information sought, to make a claim that it will unreasonably divert the agency's resources'. That is a natural inclination. But we can say in response that there are remedies for doubting an agency's claim, if there is that doubt. We can additionally say that, just because we support the principle of freedom of information, it does not follow that we support any person seeking whatever range of information he or she might be interested in at the expense of everyone else. There has to be some sensible limitation on what is sought. </PARA>

<PARA> The interpretation provisions in the Act which exempt documents from public disclosure have been clarified. In relation to personal information there is now an opportunity to make an amendment or annotation to one's file in specified circumstances. There is a provision that relates to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The AAT has powers to review a decision by an agency or Minister and makes its own fresh decisions about access. Provisions allowing review by the AAT of decisions made by government agencies on requests for access to documents are clarified, and new guidelines have been inserted to better define the circumstances in which such a review will be available. They are the main matters that I care to mention today. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but not least, I remind the Senate of the whole point that I have tried to make in speaking to this Bill-that is, that someone in 1985 thought something should be done and here we are in 1991 finally seeing the results of all the work that has been put in, and the delays that have taken place, in the meantime. The person concerned probably does not realise the contribution he or she made in setting this work in train. All those who contributed to this task are to be congratulated. It is not often enough that after legislation is passed a proper review of its operation is undertaken, and it is not often enough that, as a consequence of that review, some legislative and administrative change is implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 contains some 100 changes to the freedom of information legislation. As Senator Vanstone has said, most of these are the result of recommendations by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Being a member of that Committee, I have a great deal of confidence in its work. It is tempting to say, `Well, if it has been recommended by the Committee, there probably is not a lot wrong with it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I believe that freedom of information is an extremely important area in the fabric of our society. It was a great advance on the basis of civil liberties as well as people's participation in the government process, and I believe that it should not be treated cavalierly. The somewhat unseemly haste with which this Bill was dumped on the Senate, together with a batch of other legal Bills, leads me to the request, which I have made to the Government, that we confine ourselves today to the second reading debate and do not proceed to the committee stage. We wish to subject a number of questions to some further scrutiny and take some advice before we proceed to the next stage. There may well be amendments arising out of some of our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention one or two of our concerns. In clause 10, for instance, we find the provision that, before an agency employee may make a freedom of information request, he or she is required to use internal agency procedures to obtain the required information. It is quite possible that such a person would find himself or herself in a situation within that agency where even the very request for certain information might cause difficulties. As I said before, I would like to investigate this matter a little further to see what, if any, amendments should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 implements once again a recommendation of the Senate Committee that an agency should not refuse access to a document on the ground that the document is misleading, but that an agency should be able to delete material from documents on the ground that the material is irrelevant. I find that somewhat extraordinary. Who decides what is irrelevant and to what extent the applicant can get redress when someone else decides that certain material can simply be excluded because the recipient of the request considers it irrelevant?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I briefly advert to clause 15, a matter to which Senator Vanstone also adverted. It concerns the permission that is given an agency to refuse a request on the basis that it would involve a substantial and unreasonable diversion of the agency's resources. I consider that an extremely dangerous clause, because once again we have a decision by the agency rather than the person requiring information, who is without any obvious recourse. A request could be refused entirely within the purview of the agency from whom information is sought. There are a number of other areas of concern. However, I will not detain the Senate at this stage, but will leave them for discussion at the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 is one of a number of measures that this Parliament has brought in over the last couple of decades to enable citizens to have more knowledge of what goes on in government. Such legislation has been brought in by governments of both political persuasions. The Act itself was brought in under Mr Fraser and I think it is worth while reading out its objectives, as they are very noble objectives indeed. The Act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The object of this Act is to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to access to information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth by-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is a means whereby a person who is governed by the Federal Parliament can get a look at the mechanisms by which he or she is governed and, if necessary, do something about it. The Act continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) creating a general right of access to information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities, limited only by exceptions and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by departments and public authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>So the objective is to make government more open and more transparent and, therefore, make it better, thus enabling the citizen to have a greater say over the processes that affect his or her life. Therefore, it is a great piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it has to be looked at together with other legislation, such as that which brought in the Ombudsman, set up the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and which gave the Federal Court the power to see whether the processes that government is meant to undertake-that is, government through the Minister or through public servants-are properly undertaken. So it is a great piece of legislation amongst plenty of other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 arises out of a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This inquiry began under Senator Tate-now the very eminent Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, who I see is in the chamber and who will speak after me. He was raised to the Ministry in the course of that inquiry which, ultimately, ended in a report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is very distinguished. Senator Vanstone was a member of the Committee in those days. Unfortunately, we did not have Senator Michael Baume on the Committee, but he is always welcome. That Committee made 126 recommendations. The Government has taken up many of those in this legislation and the Minister will speak about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this area, there is always a need to examine and re-examine legislation such as this when it is put forward. Legislation such as this operates beneficially to the community, but some problems always arise and no doubt matters will arise out of the present amendments which the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee will want to look at later. I mention some issues which may give rise to some problems later. In my next few remarks, I owe much to Peter Bayne from the Australian National University. The Minister, who will be speaking after me, will also acknowledge the great work that Peter Bayne has done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Some things are or may become matters of concern. A new definition has been brought in by this legislation as to what is constituted by personal information. A decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 1988 in the case of the Department of Social Security v. Dyrenfurth stated that personal information did not include information about how a selection within the Australian Public Service was made for the purposes of promotion. In other words, this decision said that the Act, in referring to personal information, did not mean information dealing with the way promotions were made or the way that a particular Minister or a person in the Public Service went about promoting somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA> With the new definition that has been brought in, the guidelines have been expanded and it may well be that the effect of Dyrenfurth's case has been overcome so that what will now happen is that a public servant will be able to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the process by which he or she was selected or not selected looked at. Indeed, under part V of the Act, a person may be able to have the documents corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, that may seem to be a good thing. But, in my view, it would be of some concern if the AAT were used to settle or to continue what was, in effect, an industrial dispute. Just as I am concerned that sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act are used out of context to deal with industrial relations, I would be concerned if the new definition that has been given to the phrase `personal information' were to so affect the operation of part V as to enable it to be used to have what was, in effect, an industrial dispute decided by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Even though it may be to the benefit of the employee, I think, to be consistent, all matters dealing with employment should be dealt with in the proper context of an industrial relations commission or an industrial relations court. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that that will not happen, but the definition now given to the phrase is certainly capable of leading to that result. Personal information previously talked about matters that were much more confined than that. The new definition of personal information may also make the matters that can be exempt under the Act wider than they were previously. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one further matter that I wish to raise. The Federal Court in Corrs Parvey Whiting and Byrne v. the Collector of Customs spoke about section 45 (1) of the Act and gave a meaning to the term `breach of confidence', which meant that the exemption was much wider under that Act than was intended. I think that has been cured under the new legislation, but in a way that may make the matter a little more uncertain to people reading it. It may make them resort to lawyers to find out what it means. I think it is a good thing that people resort to lawyers, but it would also be a good thing if the legislation were made a bit clearer. Generally this is a great reform. I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, on originally chairing the Committee that initiated these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable senators-Senator Vanstone for the Opposition, Senator Spindler for the Australian Democrats and Senator Barney Cooney from my own Party-who have indicated their support for the Freedom of Information Bill. I also commend them for their very real interest in the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and for taking a particular interest in ensuring that there is widespread support in this chamber for the objectives of the FOI Act in general and for the amendments which are before the chamber this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in carrying out its review of the operation of the Act undertook a monumental task. I recall many of the hearings and, although the report was made after I was elevated to the Ministry, I remember seeing the final conclusions and recommendations of that report as a major vindication of the original decision to implement this sort of legislation against a tremendous body of inertia, and even hostility, in the Commonwealth bureaucracy, not least led by-and I am sure he would not mind my saying this-the former Secretary to the Treasury and former senator, John Stone, who was most vehement in his protests at the impact which this legislation would have on the conduct of government business. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the provisions in this Bill are aimed at trying to simplify the process by which requests are dealt with by government agencies. The procedures are streamlined and the steps which agencies must follow in imposing charges for access are being simplified. I believe that, in so far as there is a necessity to ensure that business, State and Territory governments and private individuals do not have matters disclosed that might offend their interests as described in the Bill, the process for consultation with them needed clarification and simplification. That also is being undertaken. In regard to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, provisions dealing with that matter are also being clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> There are questions to do with resources and the need for a provision that ensures that a particular agency is not over-burdened by having unreasonably to divert resources to answer an FOI request. If substantial and unreasonable diversion of resources is required, the Bill certainly acknowledges that can create a problem. In terms of this amendment it requires that very proper and extensive consultation take place with the applicant to help narrow the requests to manageable proportions. I think that is the quid pro quo for this sort of legislation, and a quite proper one. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also provisions dealing with the question of the sort of information that might be subject to a prohibition on public disclosure. Obviously this Parliament, as we have seen in relation to committees of the Parliament, has a particular role when it determines that there should be a privacy provision in a Bill. It is concerned to see that it be properly related to this other legislation, namely, the freedom of information legislation. There is no doubt that this is a matter of great concern to the chamber. In many respects-whether as members of committees or as senators with an interest in freedom of information matters, or as senators voting for legislation which contains secrecy provisions-we need to try to get a coordinated and principled approach to the way in which all these matters can be interrelated. I believe that this set of amendments attempts in the schedule of the Bill to deal with those matters according to a set of reasonable criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that on the whole the Senate Committee recommendations which have been accepted by the Government are important improvements in this regime. I recognise the work of others outside this chamber in the committee process, such as Mr Peter Bayne, who has already been acknowledged by Senator Cooney and who has made a valuable contribution to reflection on the FOI Act. This is an important piece of amending legislation and I commend the second reading to the chamber. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an unruly government discomforted by its lack of business. From the Opposition's point of view, there is to be a free vote on the Bill. The Senate (Quorum) Bill arises from the report of the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures which was presented to the Senate on 1 December 1988. It was this Bill, in fact, that led to the introduction of changes to Senate procedures to facilitate the reference of Bills to committees. I am pleased to say that proceeded much further than the debate on whether the Senate should change its quorum. I might say in passing that I think it is working well. In fact, it has now reached the stage where its operation is going to be the subject of an evaluation by the Procedure Committee. So there we have an ongoing process that came out of that 1988 report. But the Committee made recommendations on the quorum for the Senate and that has been the subject of debate from time to time since 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under section 22 of the Constitution, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of senators is necessary to constitute a quorum until the Parliament otherwise provides. The report of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures recommended that the quorum of the Senate be changed from one-third of the senators to one-quarter-that is, the current requirement of 26 senators should be reduced to 19. The purpose of this Bill is to implement that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> This would have the evident advantage for the Government that some or all of the Ministers in the Senate would be excused from the responsibility of assisting to form the quorum. I am reminded that Senator Ray in his second reading speech pointed out that Ministers have substantial demands on their time and that they should be able to carry out their activities without frequent and unnecessary disruptions. That makes sense to me.In fact, somebody said a little earlier in the afternoon when we became aware that this Bill might come on that, as we are now closer to government than ever before, we should refocus on this quorum Bill and perhaps approach it from the perspective of Senator Ray rather than the perspective of Opposition senators.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, a well-known former Opposition Senator, Senator Puplick, who spoke in the debate back in December 1989-he was then acting in the capacity of Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate-argued that the necessity of attending a quorum is a discipline imposed on the Government to ensure that it does not bring about a situation in which the Opposition is forced to call quorums in order to make political points. That discipline ought to be imposed on Ministers regardless of which political party they are drawn from. Odgers notes that, although it is often maintained that it is the responsibility of the Government to maintain a quorum, it is, in fact, the responsibility of the Senate-something that I have been reminded of from time to time. Sometimes late at night in difficult quorum situations that argument has come forth. The House of Representatives quorum has been reduced from one-third to one-fifth. </PARA>
<PARA> A perusal of Parliaments of the World, a comparative reference compendium prepared by the International Centre for Parliamentary Documentation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, reveals that most parliaments require a quorum of at least half the membership. Of 82 countries surveyed, four countries require a quorum of two-thirds of the membership; 48 require a quorum of half the membership or more; and 11 require one-third of the membership. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look very briefly at a couple of examples. In the United States the quorum for the Senate is an absolute majority of members; in Austria the quorum for the Federal Council is one-third of the membership; in Belgium a quorum for the Senate is a majority of the membership; in Brazil the quorum for the Federal Senate varies according to the type of Bill, but is usually an absolute majority of members; in France the quorum of both the Senate and the National Assembly is an absolute majority of members; and in the Netherlands the quorum of both the First and Second chambers is an absolute majority of members. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems therefore that, if we look to precedent, precedent tends to favour a quorum of at least the number that we presently have, if not more. I readily concede that this is a judgment that is not necessarily easy to make. There is no precise figure; there is not a black and white test that need be passed. On the one hand, there are the arguments-good arguments-put by Senator Ray and similar arguments put by former Senator Hamer and, on the other hand, as I mentioned, there is the argument put by my former colleague Senator Puplick. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, I have to say that I have not been persuaded that there is a need to reduce the quorum. I do not think that it is unduly onerous. I say that not being one that particularly thinks of it in terms of a discipline imposed upon the Government, but rather as a discipline imposed upon the Senate as a whole and upon the Senate as an institution. I do not think it is unreasonable that one-third of senators should be on call and be prepared to meet the bells on the call of a quorum. I therefore do not see that there would be any substantive advantage gained by the reform that our committee, and the committee of which I am now a member, recommends. Therefore on balance I have decided, as one senator, that I will vote against this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill has already referred to the antiquity of this piece of legislation and to the frequency with which we have been threatened with this debate. I had to scramble to the bottom of a recently reorganised drawer to find a permanently installed folder with which I had rushed into this chamber many times to acquaint myself. I really cannot believe that we are actually debating the Senate (Quorum) Bill 1989 [1990]. We last felt it was coming very close on 7 September 1990. I will refer to an action I had prepared at that stage in a minute. As Senator Hill has said, the purpose of this Bill is to reduce the quorum of the Senate from one-third of its members to one-quarter-that is, to 19 rather than the 26 which is currently required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government put forward a number of arguments for this move, including a reference to the work of honourable senators in the committee system. Since the Minister's second reading speech, which put down that reason, we have involved ourselves in yet another dimension of Senate committee work which is taking the time of honourable senators. In most cases that is very productive work. It is true that the Senate does have a fine tradition of very effective and very important committee work. We must bear that in mind when we are addressing the question of a quorum in this chamber. I accept that that is one of the dimensions of what we are being asked to consider in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill referred to the work of Ministers and to the Government's view that to have a smaller quorum would be of advantage to that particular group of senators-those who are Ministers. There are, indeed, many calls on their time and, of course, there are other calls on the time of all honourable senators. When introducing this legislation, the Minister's second reading speech referred to the increasing volume of correspondence that all honourable senators get and the representations, the delegations, the visits and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point it is interesting to reflect on what members of the general public feel about attendance in the chamber. The people who have come to the public gallery today are seeing a remarkably full Senate chamber for this hour on a Wednesday afternoon. The attendance here at this time is very high, particularly for this type of legislation. Normally, a routine piece of legislation at this hour on a Wednesday afternoon, might see only four or five people in the chamber, if that. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have a considerable number of vitally interested senators in the chamber. The fact that before we began this debate the bells rang indicating that a quorum was required might have something to do with it. Some people may have considered that they needed a rest before they went back to their offices in the long, distant, corridors of this massive building. It is important simply to make the point that if honourable senators are not in this chamber, it does not mean that they are not doing productive work representing their constituents-whether it is by handling correspondence, by promoting the work they are doing, by meeting delegations or whatever. The work of a parliamentarian goes far beyond this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the following statement in the Minister's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Attendance in the Senate and participation in its deliberations will still remain the most important role that senators perform. </PARA>
<PARA>When I read that sentence, my first response was that I wished that were the case for every individual senator. Senator Hill has made the point that this particular piece of legislation will be dealt with by a conscience vote by members of the Opposition. This is rare in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well-known that we in the Australian Democrats believe that there ought to be more ability for all parliamentarians to exercise their own consciences on a range of legislation-debates would be more relevant, more interesting and of a great deal more significance-rather than the practice which is most often the case where party lines are adhered to, often quite reluctantly, by people on both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons why, from time to time, there are more or fewer people in the chamber. Some were listed by the Minister in his second reading speech-he talked about the level of importance, the controversy and the nature of the debate. Another reason that has not been mentioned is that often the lateness of the hour and the lack of alternative entertainment can draw people into this chamber. Mr Acting Deputy President, I can remember sitting in your position in the old place and wishing that people would find their entertainment elsewhere in the later hours of the evening. It is important that we are here in this chamber as often as we can be to carry out our duties, when it is not necessary for us to be elsewhere to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that this proposition is to reduce the quorum of the Senate to one-quarter. The House of Representatives quorum has been reduced from one-third to one-fifth. Even with the passage of this legislation, the proportion of honourable senators required for a quorum will still be higher than that in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude with a couple of remarks about the use of the quorum. It is somewhat ironic that the first comment I was going to make has already been demonstrated this afternoon. A problem with quorums concerns their use, and I do have a few concerns in that regard. As we all know, and as we have seen this afternoon, a quorum is often used to call speakers in when they are not here at their allotted time because the Whips have not managed to get them here for one reason or another. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe they are also used from time to time to disconcert speakers-to put them off their stride-and that is an unfortunate misuse of the quorum. Sometimes a quorum is used because a speaker might be rather indignant that the relevant Minister is not in the chamber to hear the deep and meaningful remarks that are being made about a piece of legislation, and a quorum is called in order to bring the Minister into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Quorums are sometimes used simply to interrupt speakers when what they are saying is annoying those present or when those views are disagreed with. I have to say that-not in this parliamentary session thus far, but in the past-I can remember many experiences where that has happened to Democrat colleagues and particularly to Senator Vallentine. I want to put on record that I believe that to be a misuse of the quorum. People may not want to hear alternative views but they will hear them for as long as I and my colleagues, Senator Vallentine and others are here. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is that this is a mischievous use of a quorum-very much so because, while the quorum is being filled, the clock continues to run against the speaker, whose time can be used up. Regrettably, there have been many occasions in the past when a speaker's due time has not been available to that speaker because of the use of a quorum. Therefore, while supporting this legislation, I advise that tomorrow morning I will give notice of my intention on the next day of sitting to move the following amendment to the Standing Orders:</PARA>
<PARA>That Standing Order 189 be amended by adding the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>``(5) When the speech of a Senator is interrupted by attention being drawn to the absence of a quorum, the time allowed for the Senator's speech shall not be reduced by any time which elapses after the speech is interrupted and before it is resumed.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Tomorrow I will take the opportunity that this legislation presents to put before the Senate the proposition that that somewhat mischievous use of a quorum should no longer be available to us, and that the freedom of speech-which is held so dear by all in this chamber-is not lost to any speaker simply because what is being said might not be accepted by, agreed with or pleasant for others present in the chamber. I will be seriously putting before the Senate the proposition that when a quorum is called a speaker's time is not eaten up. However, I do support this piece of legislation. I think it is appropriate to the effective running of the chamber-picking up Senator Hill's point-on behalf of all of us as senators, not necessarily only for a government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Senate (Quorum) Bill 1989 [1990] which, I understand, has also been called the Robert Ray heart protection Bill-to save him the problem of having to come from the Cabinet room into this chamber. This Bill stems from a report of the Select Committee on Legislative Procedures which was presented to the Senate on 1 December 1988-a long time ago. The Bill, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, seeks to reduce the Senate quorum from one-third to one-quarter of honourable senators. In effect, this would reduce the number of honourable senators required for a quorum from 26 to 19 and would effectively exempt almost all Government Ministers from attending quorum calls. I notice that Senator Robert Ray is nodding in agreement with that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, the Constitution currently provides for one-third of senators to constitute a quorum, and this can only be changed by legislation, which is now before the chamber. As Senator Hill said in his remarks, the Government clearly does not have a great deal of interest in this Bill. In fact, it is before the chamber because the Government has run out of other business. Even on the odd occasion when the Bill has been on the Notice Paper, it normally has such a low priority that invariably it never gets debated. I guess that this is what makes this day particularly special. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the Government, I have a complete lack of enthusiasm for this Bill. However, unlike the Government, my enthusiasm is lacking so much that I will be voting against the change which I believe, in contrast to Senator Powell's remarks, would be to the detriment of Senate procedures. The issue of quorum numbers was extensively canvassed in this chamber when the report of the Select Committee was presented in December 1989. Senator Ray suggested that there were two reasons for altering the numbers required for a quorum. We can summarise these two reasons as the vegetable argument and the geographical argument. First, let us look at the vegetable argument. In Senator Ray's matchless words, the argument ran as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>When the [Procedures] Committee was moving the turkey around the plate between the Opposition side and the Government side it found the Government side a little deficient . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Does Senator Ray remember those words? He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and added a few vegetables-the quorum proposal-just to balance up the overall approach so that no side could be seen to be having a win. </PARA>
<PARA>This, in my view, is a poor argument. The quorum proposal does not stand up in its own right, but is merely a so-called face-saving proposal on behalf of the Government; it is the vegetables being moved around the plate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Faulkner raises the issue of vegetables because it applies so often to the rather mindless comments he makes in this chamber. The second argument relates to geography. According to Senator Ray, Ministers have a three-minute walk to and from the chamber. This can be very disruptive to their timetable, according to Senator Ray. I have problems with this argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the first place, it is important to note that we are not setting up rules for particular governments but for all governments regardless of their political complexion. To use Senator Ray's metaphor, the additional vegetables which may have been used to garnish the Labor dish will equally be on the dish for any other government, including a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> My experience, as a relatively new senator, is that Senate procedures are so heavily weighed in favour of the Government that we should be very cautious in further disadvantaging an Opposition. The calling of quorums is one of the few tactics available to an Opposition to draw attention to perceived shortcomings in the Government's own behaviour or in the behaviour of certain speakers in the chamber. This is an effective tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> My views therefore differ from some of the arguments that Senator Powell put forward. She mentioned, for example, what happened to Senator Vallentine. I think it is an effective use of the quorum when someone gets up very late at night, at 11.30 p.m.-and Senator Jones I am sure would agree with this-and then proceeds to read a speech at great speed for the full time which is allotted, that is, half an hour. I think it is appropriate in those cases where someone has not been prepared to attend the chamber to make contributions to other debates but feels that he or she may come in very late at night and read a speech which, I suspect, has been prepared for him or her. I differ from Senator Powell on this issue. I think it is an appropriate tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, when a senator is being particularly offensive in a speech, a quorum is one of the weapons in the armoury. Senator Faulkner could use it to call in more people. Senator Powell interprets each of those in a very negative light. They can be interpreted in that way, but they can also have advantages. I am sorry that she did not mention those in her contribution. It is worth mentioning that quorum calls have been used with great circumspection since I came to this chamber, anyway. They are comparatively rarely used and, when they are used, from what I have seen for the most part they have some merit. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray used the change in the geography of the chambers and the Cabinet room in the new Parliament House as the second leg to his argument. The three-minute walk hardly seems a sufficient change in geography to alter a longstanding Senate practice. Indeed, the extra exercise, minimal though it may well be, would be to the benefit of Ministers' health. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray's Bill would exempt most Ministers from answering a quorum bell. They would not suffer the inconvenience of a three-minute walk. I agree with the comment of the former Senator Puplick, which was referred to by Senator Hill, when he addressed this matter. He said that discipline ought to be imposed on Ministers. Even Senator Ray was not entirely convinced by his vegetable argument or by the geographical argument. He therefore gave us another pearl. He may remember this. He seemed to argue that discipline would be even tighter with fewer honourable senators being required to answer the quorums because Ministers would be excluded. I recall that Senator Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA>I will tell those opposite how to punish them-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Ministers-</PARA>
<PARA>by exempting them from coming in and telling the back bench to come. </PARA>
<PARA>That would apparently impose an even tighter discipline on Ministers. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The backbenchers will exert discipline over Ministers much quicker than if the Ministers have to turn up. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray would therefore have us believe that this Bill is the best of all possible worlds, that there would be no costs imposed by agreeing to the Bill and that it would address the concern of many people that we should have a tighter discipline in this chamber from time to time. I say to Senator Ray, `Nice try, but it doesn't convince me'. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does this Bill have no intellectual foundation but it also exacerbates one of the problems of modern parliamentary practice. On this occasion I endorse the comments from Senator Powell about the very poor attendance in this chamber. Those of us who came in here this morning and looked across to the Labor side just after prayers would have counted three people. One of my overriding impressions as a comparatively new boy in this chamber is the appalling performance of most Labor Party people in attending this chamber. That reason, and that reason alone, would be sufficient justification in my case to oppose a Bill which would occasionally encourage Labor Party people to come into this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the reasons I have stated, when the vote is called on this Bill, I shall be joining with my colleagues Senator Hill and, I suspect, Senator Crichton-Browne and I shall be opposing this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to retrace the historic relevance of a quorum. However, its intrinsic virtue is to provide that at any one time there are a minimum number of people required to contemplate deliberations in the chamber. That is not a unreasonable proposition. As with any meeting procedures, from time to time we can suspend what is proper and what is necessary and we will get by with a short cut. However, proper processes have their place, and once we dilute basic standards we will quickly find that the process will begin to collapse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My essential objection to this Bill-besides the fact that it reduces the figure required for a quorum to an absurd number-is that it breaks the nexus between the Executive and the Parliament. If we are to say that one-quarter of all senators is an adequate number, why not make it one-tenth? Why not make it the same as that required for a division-that is, two? If there is no intrinsic virtue in having a responsible and respectable number of senators in the chamber, there is no argument beyond having only one or two senators present. But my objection is that this Bill does break the nexus between the Executive and the Parliament. I say this as somebody who has been looking forward for some time to attaining government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell is coming up next time. This Bill would mean ultimately that the Senate is maintained by the back bench of the Government and nobody else. The Opposition is not required to maintain it; the Executive is not required to maintain it. It is simply the back bench of the Government that would keep the Parliament functioning. In my mind, the breaking of that nexus really destroys the integrity of the chamber. The Executive and the Ministers are part of the Parliament and they ought to carry out their responsibilities, as should everybody else. Otherwise, as Senator Robert Ray knows, none of the Ministers will be required to attend the chamber for a quorum. Of course, that is the purpose of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill touched upon the circumstances which apply in parliaments in many other countries. With modest exceptions, at least one-third of a parliament's membership is required for a quorum. I think the United States Senate requires possibly an absolute majority-but certainly more than half. I do not suggest that we ought to be looking to other people's decisions to enable us to arrive at our own decision. I raise that point because I noticed that Senator Ray in his second reading speech referred to the fact that the figure required for a quorum in the House of Representatives has been reduced to one-fifth of the total number of members of Parliament. I suppose Senator Ray makes mention of that fact as some sort of supporting argument in his second reading speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am totally opposed to the Senate (Quorum) Bill 1989. I am totally opposed to meddling with the quorum of the Senate. The principle that must be retained in this chamber is that the Executive, the Ministers, are responsible to the Parliament and are to attend the Parliament, especially when there is a call for a quorum, at Question Time and when there is a division. If we were to allow a deterioration of this principle, which the Senate has held for 90 years, we would be taking away the sense of responsibility and accountability of Government Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say this with Senator Ray and his colleagues presently occupying the front bench on the Government side of the Senate chamber. I am very confident that there will be a change in the seating of the Senate whenever there is an election. That is very clear from the conduct of debate, the confidence here on this side of the chamber compared with the quietness and dispirited approaches on the Government benches. It is already evident from the way the public understands what is going on in this country, reflected in various public opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA> I want my own colleagues-even myself, should I be invited to serve in that capacity-to be responsible to this Parliament and to ensure that for the rest of the decade, indeed into the new century, senators in this chamber are responsible, accountable and responsive to the business of this chamber. As I see it, only two reasons have been put forward for lowering the number of senators required for a quorum from 26 to 19. The principal reason is that this would no longer lead to an inconvenience on Government Ministers' time; they could conduct their interviews and other business in their own rooms here in Parliament House without the distraction from time to time of having to attend this chamber to answer a quorum call. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is that the figure required for the House of Representatives quorum has recently been reduced from one-third to one-fifth. That is no precedent for the Senate chamber to follow. Rather, we should understand-much more clearly than appears to be understood in the House of Representatives-that the Executive is responsible to the elected Parliament and it is to be responsive at the time of a quorum call. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of my speaking, frankly, is to alert all those honourable senators who are listening in their rooms-and I would ask their staff to alert them-that there will be a division in this chamber in a matter of a few minutes in which there is a free vote. Honourable senators will have to make up their own minds as to whether or not there ought to be a change to the quorum requirement that has held for 90 years in this place. It is actually spelt out in the Australian Constitution when it defines the Senate and then defines a quorum in attendance at the Senate as being one-third of the members. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that my colleagues in the Opposition will oppose this measure, that they will oppose any dilution of the quorum requirements of the Senate, but I appeal to all those honourable senators from the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Independents to take full weight of this debate. I appeal to them to note that the overwhelming majority of speakers have opposed this legislation and have not wanted to toady to the convenience of the Ministers of the present Government by making it possible for them to avoid the discipline of being responsive to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say one more thing: whenever the Senate is sitting there is the possibility of a division at any time. There may be a procedural motion; there may even be a vote of no confidence in a ruling from the President; and, of course, there may be a vote on a Bill. For those divisions, there is no question that Ministers of the Government-indeed, all senators-must be in a position to attend the chamber. As it is clear that a division can occur at any time, so a quorum call can occur at any time. I believe that there should be a continuing responsibility for Government Ministers, along with other honourable senators, to respond to the quorum call. </PARA>
<PARA> I am totally opposed to this legislation. I notice that it was first proposed on 1 December 1988. It has been a long time coming. Even in the present Ministry I think there is now great diffidence. We will hear from Senator Ray in a moment, but I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to come into the chamber to vote against this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are quite hopeless. When we were in government Labor Party senators used to attend because they were attacking us in government, but since they have been in government the Labor Party attendance has been absolutely appalling. The Labor Party is continually having meetings throughout every day of the sitting. Today I have been attempting to contact one of the Labor Party senators, who is a member of a committee I serve on. I have tried all day to contact that person but he has not been available in his office. At one stage I was told that his Whip did not know where he was, that the Whip's clerk did not know where he was, and that his secretary did not know where he was because he had so many meetings on. I tried to contact him not less than 15 minutes ago and was told that he has at least three meetings to attend between 5 o'clock and 6.30 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters can chortle away but this was one of the arguments put by Senator Crichton-Browne and by some of Senator Walters's other colleagues. I accept that argument, because it is a philosophy of life that people feel safe and sound with. What I do object to is Senator Kemp and others half telling the reasons and distorting them. Senator Kemp is learning to do that very well in this chamber. It will not earn him any credit because if he is not careful he will end up being another Senator Michael Baume. Senator Kemp asks how I dared say in my earlier contribution that this was part of an arrangement. It was. When Senator Teague says that he is not in favour of toadying to Ministers, he should understand that many Ministers went a long way to improve the procedures of this chamber through a lot of extra time and effort on their behalf and on behalf of their staff. There was a bit of argy-bargy as to how the procedures of this place would be affected and that was reflected-and I will come back to this-in the vote on the matter on principle when it was taken on 5 December 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made no real assertion that because the House of Representatives changed it must necessarily occur here. What I have stressed is that the House of Representatives changed its quorum requirement to one-fifth of its members, which is a very significant drop from one-third. What we are proposing here is one-quarter. What has always been should not always continue. The founding fathers recognised that, and if they had not recognised it they would not have nominated a one-third quorum, subject to change by the Parliament. They recognised that they had probably picked an arbitrary figure. It must be remembered that in 1901 one-third of the Senate was 12 senators because we had 36 senators when this place was established. We now have 76 senators. The nature and tasks of MPs have changed in that time; so have the nature and tasks of the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said by Senator Kemp that the real reason is geography and that I do not want to walk for three minutes. That really is a puerile suggestion. There is only one former Minister on the Opposition benches now, so those opposite do not know the experience-but they will one day-of having people come from all around Australia to meet with one for an hour. It certainly happened to me on two occasions when I was immigration Minister, and we had four quorum calls in that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to the use of quorums. But that is terribly disruptive of government. With the Senate now sitting here for 23 weeks a year, it is not possible to schedule all my appointments with visiting CDFs, defence Ministers, ambassadors, et cetera away from this place and away from sitting times. One simply has to have those meetings here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I admit that it is grossly embarrassing when one has a visiting defence Minister with all his staff in one's office and a red bell rings-if it is a division we cop it-and one has to come down here for a quorum three or four times in an hour. I also put on the record that I do not believe the calling of quorums in this chamber has been abused in the last year or two; I make no such assertion. But what is magic about one-third compared with one-quarter? There is absolutely nothing magic about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp summarised my argument and made the `sizest' comment that I cannot be bothered walking for 3 minutes. He should grow up and approach these things in a little more rational way than that. It is simply a matter of how often this country embarrasses visitors by Ministers having to get up in the middle of a conversation three or four times in an hour when these things occur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say it is rarely used. I said it is rarely abused, which is a separate matter again. One does not know that a quorum is being called to get a speaker here when one is in the middle of a meeting. One has to come, irrespective of what one is doing. When we were in the old House-and I am sure Senator Kemp went there a few times as a visitor-the Ministers' offices were about a maximum of a minute from the chamber. So one-third as a quorum was suitable. Cabinet Ministers just came out and then went back quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, when Donald Grimes, John Button and co. were in Government in the old House, it took 20 seconds to get to the chamber. Now it averages about 3 minutes. We do not complain about the Cabinet room. From the Cabinet room is the quickest walk that we ever have. It is out the back door and we are here in 20 seconds. Honourable senators will have noticed that, when quorums are called and Cabinet is sitting, we are the first here; we beat everyone in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right. If Senator Kemp is being very careful with it, I will not pursue the matter. As long as it was not implied that people have to turn up for prayers. That is up to the individual. When we last considered this, it was interesting to see, in terms of a free vote, what motivated people. Former Senator Chaney supported us. Senator Lewis supported us, but has had a rethink. Senator Patterson, former Senator Hamer, Senator Reid, Senator Short, Senator Tambling and Senator Watson voted on the merits of the argument on that occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But we all know that, on this occasion, no matter how inspiring the oratory is-probably people are not listening out there-honourable senators will come in and vote by peer group pressure rather than anything else. I was asked by way of interjection whether the Labor Party has a policy on this. No, we do not on Standing Orders. We do not have a binding vote on Standing Orders. If Opposition senators want to continually accuse us of doing so, maybe we will look at it and have one, but we do not. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember when former Senator Ryan and Senator Gareth Evans voted with some of the others about the reading of speeches. In light of the fact that they read more speeches in the chamber than anyone else, it incensed me that they would do that, but they did, and I might add that not everyone had their education. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not trying to put or say that this legislation is a matter of high principle. It is a matter of practicality. It is a matter of reform of procedures in this chamber. It is essentially to exempt Ministers from quorums. The question is often asked: how does one then discipline Ministers when they play up? If Ministers play up and then force backbenchers alone to come into this chamber when quorums are called, the ministry will be disciplined more quickly than anyone else by the same back bench, and that is a reality.

On any one day three or four people are away sick or overseas, especially in September-October. That is when the European parliamentary trip, the IPU and sometimes the CPA occur. So then we can be down to 18 or 17. Therefore, it is not quite so simple that we can say that these others are exempted. If this Bill is carried, it will not be that all the Ministers are exempted but Cabinet Ministers will be. Non-Cabinet Ministers would still have to attend quorums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a matter I feel passionately about. I believe it would improve performance of government if it was adopted. If it is not, it is not the end of the world. If we had more people opposite who had been put in the same position, we would probably get a little more sympathy towards the particular problems that the geography of this building creates. It is a different geography from that in the previous building.

<PARA>INSURANCE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The former Treasurer foreshadowed in announcements on 6 November 1990, 21 January 1991 and 11 February 1991 that the Government would be implementing a range of measures to provide financial support to policy holders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Limited and Regal Life Insurance Limited, and to increase the general level of prudential protection provided to life and general insurance policy holders. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, together with five other companion Bills, gives legislative effect to the measures outlined in those announcements. The five companion Bills are:</PARA>
<PARA> * The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> * The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> * The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> * The Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991; and</PARA>
<PARA> * The General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, this package of Bills will:</PARA>
<PARA> * Improve the financial and prudential standards which must be satisfied by life and general insurance companies;</PARA>
<PARA> * Provide a mechanism for the prior screening of changes to the ownership and control of life and general insurance companies;</PARA>
<PARA> * Put in place levy arrangements which will ensure that an appropriate degree of protection is provided to policy holders of Occidental Life and Regal Life; and</PARA>
<PARA> * Allow for the recovery of costs arising from additional resources provided to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, for the purpose of improved industry supervision, through an increase in the life and general insurance supervisory levies. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures have been developed in liaison with senior representatives of the life and general insurance industry associations. In this respect, I would like to place on record the Government's appreciation for the constructive comments and advice received from the industry associations and underwriters during this process. This co-operation demonstrates the industries' understanding of the need for soundly based and well directed supervisory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 effects a number of amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the existing supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is introducing these measures to overcome a number of deficiencies in the two Acts which became evident during the investigation into the affairs of Occidental Life and Regal Life at the end of last year, and as a result of other developments in the life and general insurance industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures in some cases represent a bringing forward of proposals from the current review of the Life Insurance Act 1945. This review, which involves a number of detailed and complex technical issues relating to the solvency standards to be observed by life offices and the controls which should apply in relation to new and innovative life products, is expected to result in further amendments to the Life Insurance Act in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is structured in three parts. </PARA>
<PARA> Part I provides necessary formal short title and commencement provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II amends the Insurance Act 1973 to:</PARA>
<PARA> * Increase the minimum capital and solvency requirements for authorised general insurers and introduce an additional solvency requirement based on the level of a company's outstanding claims provisions (phasing-in provisions are to apply to existing authorised companies);</PARA>
<PARA> * Give the Commissioner, rather than the Treasurer, the discretion to exempt companies carrying on limited forms of insurance on a very small scale from such provisions of the Act as may be determined;</PARA>
<PARA> * Effect a number of minor amendments to the description of accounts and statements required to be lodged with the Commissioner;</PARA>
<PARA> * Permit the Commissioner to direct an authorised insurance company to have an actuary, who is not an officer of the company, carry out a review of its outstanding claims provisions and for the Commissioner to receive a copy of the actuary's report;</PARA>
<PARA> * Enhance the provisions dealing with investigations, appointment of inspectors and the giving of directions to authorised insurance companies;</PARA>
<PARA> * Provide measures to disqualify a person who has been bankrupt, or convicted of an offence relating to insurance or dishonest conduct, from appointment as a director or to a senior management position; and</PARA>
<PARA> * Enable the public disclosure of information additional to that which is already available from statutory returns lodged with the Commissioner by general insurers. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III amends the Life Insurance Act 1945 to:</PARA>
<PARA> * Increase the minimum paid-up capital requirement applying to registered life offices which have a share capital, and to require all registered life offices to maintain an excess of non-statutory fund assets over non-statutory fund liabilities (phasing-in provisions are to apply to existing registered life offices);</PARA>
<PARA> * Increase the frequency of actuarial investigations to be made into the financial condition of a registered life office by an appointed actuary (the increase will bring the requirement into line with current practice);</PARA>
<PARA> * Reduce certain periods specified in the Act for the lodging of annual statutory returns by registered life offices;</PARA>
<PARA> * Enhance the provisions dealing with investigations, appointment of inspectors and giving of directions to registered life insurance offices; and</PARA>
<PARA> * Provide measures to disqualify a person who has been bankrupt, or convicted of an offence relating to insurance or dishonest conduct, from appointment as a director, to a senior management position, or to the position of appointed actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address some of the more significant provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Minimum Capital and Solvency Requirements</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that the minimum paid-up share capital requirement for a company seeking authorisation to conduct general insurance business be increased from $500,000 to $2 million, and that the minimum amount by which the company's assets are to exceed its liabilities be increased, from $1 million to $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for similar amendments to the minimum capital and solvency requirements which must be maintained at all times by authorised general insurers. The effect of the new solvency arrangements, which apply to all business of Australian incorporated companies and to the Australian business of overseas incorporated companies, will be that the value by which an authorised insurer's assets must exceed its liabilities will, subject to transitional provisions, be the greatest of:</PARA>
<PARA> - $2 million (increased from $1 million);</PARA>
<PARA> - 20 per cent of its premium income in its last preceding financial year (the existing requirement is unchanged); or</PARA>
<PARA> - 15 per cent of its outstanding claims provision as at the end of its last preceding financial year (this is a new requirement). </PARA>
<PARA> The minimum capital and solvency requirements of the insurance Act have remained unchanged since 1984. The increase in the minimum monetary amounts is therefore a measure to bring the requirements up to date and more into line with present conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed additional solvency requirement, equal to 15 per cent of outstanding claims provision, will ensure that the minimum required solvency margin better reflects the circumstances of insurers with large outstanding claims provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The present solvency margin, which has regard to the level of a company's premium income, has proved to be deficient in cases where companies with very large outstanding claims provisions suffer a decline in premium income. The Bill ensures that an appropriate degree of protection is provided to policy holders in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Life Insurance Act 1945 currently provides that, where a company seeking registration has a share capital, it must have a minimum $2 million paid-up capital and share premium account balance. No similar obligation is placed on non-share capital companies (mutual companies) seeking registration and there is no requirement for branches of overseas insurers to maintain funds in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for an increase from $2 million to $10 million in the minimum capital requirement imposed under the Act. This will apply to all companies with a share capital on a continuing basis. It also imposes a requirement on companies without share capital to maintain assets of $10 million, and for foreign companies to maintain assets of $10 million in Australia. These assets must be held outside the statutory funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the existing requirements which deal with the solvency of individual statutory funds, registered life offices will now be required to maintain an excess of $5 million of assets over liabilities, to be held outside of the statutory funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement to also hold funds outside the statutory funds will ensure that proprietors maintain a financial commitment to the effective operation of the life office and that additional support is ultimately available to the statutory funds should this prove to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Investigation Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> During the investigation into the affairs of Occidental Life and Regal Life, it was found that the existing provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1945 relating to investigations and the issue of directions restricted the ability of the Commissioner to act to protect the interests of policy holders in a timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Commissioner was not able to issue directions concerning the business of the company until after his investigation had been completed. There was no scope, as is the case with the Insurance Act 1973, for the issue of interim directions in circumstances where it has become clear that these are justified but the overall investigation is not yet completed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an issue which is of considerable concern to the Government, as it is possible for circumstances to prevail where the position of policy holders could be severely compromised by the inability of the Commissioner to respond in a timely fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the Government is moving to ensure greater consistency between the provisions of the two Acts relating to the conduct of investigations and the issue of directions. The amendments proposed in the Bill draw upon the stronger features of the relevant provisions in each of the Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore amends the Life Insurance Act 1945 to provide that the Commissioner may issue directions during the course of an investigation, and prevent a life office dealing with certain of its assets. The Insurance Act 1973 is amended to provide that the Commissioner, rather than the Treasurer, can appoint an inspector to undertake an investigation into the affairs of an insurer, and give directions to a company pursuant to such an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>Disqualification of Certain Persons</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had concerns for some time that the safeguards in the insurance supervisory system are not sufficient to exclude from key positions in insurance companies, people who have been convicted of dishonest conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore provides that an insurance company will be prohibited from appointing to certain positions a person who has been found guilty of an offence in respect of insurance or dishonest conduct. It also provides a similar prohibition in respect of persons who are, or have been, bankrupt or insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA> The positions to which this disqualification will relate are Director or Principal Executive Officer of an Australian company, and local executive officer of a foreign company. The provision will also apply to the appointed actuary under the Life Insurance Act 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions have been included in the Bill to provide a defence against prosecution where the defendant company shows that it did not know or suspect that an appointee was disqualified. </PARA>
<PARA>Actuarial Investigations</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces new provisions into the Insurance Act 1973 which enable the Commissioner to direct an authorised insurer to have an actuary carry out a review of its outstanding claims provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding claims provision is almost invariably the largest liability of a general insurance company. Significant delays can occur, even in respect of well managed companies, in the reporting and settlement of claims, particularly in the liability classes of insurance business, including workers' compensation and public liability business. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding claims provision of a general insurance company is determined on the basis of a process involving statistical and actuarial estimation. The proposed measure will enable the Commissioner to have the company's estimations independently verified where this is considered to be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes provisions to bring the Life Insurance Act into line with current practice by requiring an investigation into the financial condition of registered life offices to be carried out annually by the company's appointed actuary rather than at five-yearly intervals. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Implications</PARA>
<PARA> The measures contained in this Bill to increase the prudential protection available to insurance policy holders, together with those contained in the Companion Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional resources needed to give effect to these measures have been estimated at $510,000 in 1990-91, $785,000 in 1991-92 and $410,000 in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional costs will be fully recovered through the life insurance and general insurance supervisory levies. It is for this purpose that the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 are included in the package of Bills before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>LIFE INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS' PROTECTION LEVIES BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991 and its companion Bill (the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991) introduce measures to enable a levy to be imposed on life insurers to assist policy holders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Limited and Regal Life Insurance Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills form part of a package of six cognate Bills dealing with insurance matters. Taken together, the six Bills introduce measures to provide:</PARA>
<PARA> * Financial assistance to the policy holders of Occidental Life and Regal Life;</PARA>
<PARA> * Machinery for screening changes in ownership and control of both life and general insurance companies; and,</PARA>
<PARA> * A range of other improvements which will generally strengthen existing insurance supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will be aware, a judicial manager was appointed to take control of the business of Occidental Life and Regal Life on 7 November 1990. This followed the attempted sale of the two companies in September last year and the subsequent revelation that $65 million of statutory fund moneys of the companies had been misused. Under the Life Insurance Act, all policy holders' funds must be held in statutory funds which may only be applied to meet liabilities and expenses applicable to those funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Investigations by the judicial manager have indicated that there is a potential significant shortfall in the major statutory funds of the two companies and that the amount of the shortfall is dependent on the outcome of various legal and other proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of the significant implications of these events for affected policy holders and on the life insurance industry generally, the industry devoted a considerable amount of time and effort in attempting to develop voluntary support arrangements to provide assistance to the policy holders involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the goodwill and assistance shown by the industry, it was found that significant legal and technical difficulties stood in the way of an effective industry approach. </PARA>
<PARA> This led to the Government announcing on 21 January 1991 that it would introduce legislation to provide for one-off levy arrangements similar to those which were proposed under the industry voluntary support arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the associated Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill give effect to the announced arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing these arrangements, the Government had particular regard to the importance of the life insurance industry to the Australian economy as a repository of long term personal and retirement savings. It also had regard to the special and unusual circumstances involving the unauthorised dealing in statutory funds moneys which led to the potential for serious loss on the part of policy holders, and the need to carefully balance the interests of those policy holders and the interests of policy holders generally. </PARA>
<PARA> A key component of the Bill is that it will permit the making of regulations to impose one or more levies on the Australian proportion of the value of the statutory fund assets of a life insurance company for purposes of ensuring that up to 90 per cent of policy holders' claims against Occidental Life and Regal Life are satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the Government's announcement of 11 February 1991 concerning the proposed levy arrangements, the Bill also contains provisions which will limit the total amount of levy collected under the legislation to $65 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions in the Bill, and in the companion collection Bill, provide for safeguards which prevent the levy arrangements from applying unless the insurance and superannuation commissioner is satisfied that the financial position of Occidental Life or Regal Life, particularly in relation to availability of assets, is such as to warrant resort to the levy process. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Bills have been developed in consultation with the senior representatives of the life insurance industry. In addition, a committee of senior industry representatives has been established to assist the insurance and superannuation Commissioner in the implementation of the levy arrangements. It is envisaged that the Commissioner, and this Committee, will be working closely with the judicial manager (or liquidator) of Occidental Life and Regal Life in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills complement court and other actions which have been set in train by the judicial manager in an endeavour to recover statutory fund moneys due to the two companies. It is also relevant that investigations to ensure the prosecution of persons who may be guilty of offences relating to the circumstances of the two companies are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding this outline of the Bill, I should emphasise that it is the clear intention of the Government to do all it reasonably can to prevent the kind of problems that have emerged as a result of the attempted sale of Occidental Life and Regal Life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Government attaches considerable importance to the other measures, such as those dealing with prior screening of changes of ownership and control of insurers and improved capital standards and prudential requirements, being brought forward in this package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991 to the Senate and present the related Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>LIFE INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS' PROTECTION LEVIES COLLECTION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991 and its companion Bill (the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991) introduce measures to enable a levy to be imposed on life insurers to provide an appropriate level of protection for the policy holders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Limited and Regal Life Insurance Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills form part of a package of six cognate Bills which also deal with a range of other insurance matters, including minimum capital standards and other prudential requirements and machinery for screening changes in ownership and control of both life and general insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech on the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991 the background and other considerations were outlined which have led to the development of the levy arrangements provided for in these two Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill is concerned with establishing the detailed machinery relating to the collection and application of levies imposed for the purpose of providing financial assistance to policy holders of Occidental Life and Regal Life. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions in part 3 of the Bill, a special trust account, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Fund, is established to receive levy moneys paid by life offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides in part 4:</PARA>
<PARA> * For the grant of financial assistance from the fund, on request from the judicial manager (or liquidator), where the commissioner is satisfied that the financial position of Occidental Life or Regal Life, particularly in relation to availability of assets, is such as to warrant resort to the levy process;</PARA>
<PARA> * That a grant is subject to the condition that it will only be used to pay up to 90 per cent of each policy holder claim, and related administrative expenses; and</PARA>
<PARA> * That the commissioner may impose other specified conditions including that grant moneys not be applied to the benefit of persons who may have contributed to the difficulties of Occidental Life or Regal Life. He may also impose additional conditions in a grant determination where this is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 5 of the Bill deals with the repayment of grants of financial assistance. In particular, the part provides for:</PARA>
<PARA> * The recovery of grant moneys from the judicial manager (or liquidator) where conditions to which the grant is subject are breached or in circumstances such as where the judicial manager (or liquidator) obtains settlement of debts;</PARA>
<PARA> * Grant repayments to have priority over most other debts of Occidental Life and Regal Life; and</PARA>
<PARA> * Repayment of any surplus levy moneys to the insurers who paid the levies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a number of additional safeguards to protect the interests of insurers subject to the levy and the policy holders of Occidental Life and Regal Life. These provisions will ensure that grants paid, and their application in accordance with the conditions attached to the grant, will be under the control of the judicial manager (or liquidator) who in turn is subject to the control of the court. The provisions also establish arrangements for the review of key decisions under the legislation and regular reporting to the commissioner and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, this Bill, and the companion Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill, provide for the imposition of one-off levy arrangements to assist policy holders who may be affected by the events which led to the appointment of a judicial manager to Occidental Life and Regal Life. </PARA>
<PARA> The broader measures included in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill and the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill will ensure that policy holders generally will, in future, be better protected from events such as those which led to the imposition of this levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991 to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill will allow the Commonwealth to hold goods, animals, plants, embryos, et cetera, which have been in quarantine until payment of expenses incurred in such quarantine has been made or suitable arrangements for payment have been made. It also allows, as a last resort, the Commonwealth to sell the goods and apply the proceeds of the sale to debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Quarantine Act 1908 provides that the expense of keeping goods in quarantine for the time necessary to be assured that the risk of diseases and pests is minimal is a legal charge against the goods. However, if the payment is not made, it is not clear whether the goods can be sold to recoup the costs or whether they must be surrendered to their owners. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in the other place in his second reading speech gave an example of a recent case where valuable animals had undergone extensive quarantine but had to be released with the owner owing the Commonwealth $1.5m. The Commonwealth is now suing for recovery, but with little likelihood of recovering the full amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example the Minister quoted in his second reading speech involves a program where a large number of animals held in quarantine for many years to address the risk of scrapie is coming to an end early next year. While the Commonwealth claims it has subsidised the seven-year care of these animals, charges will be up to $900,000. The importers have disputed the outstanding debt. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give the Commonwealth the power to hold the goods until payment or an arrangement for payment has been made. If this does not happen, it gives the Commonwealth power to sell the goods and apply the proceeds of the sale to the debt owing to the Commonwealth. To protect the right of owners, the Commonwealth must serve a notice advising that if at the end of 30 days any expenses relating to quarantine are still outstanding the goods may be sold. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the passing of this legislation through the House of Representatives, the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, has been contacted by various industry organisations and, in particular, by goat owners who have had goats under quarantine for some years that are due for release early next year. The Minister in his second reading speech mentioned that there was a $930,000 bill due early in the new year and that, as there was doubt about payment, this legislation would allow the Government to sell this valuable stock in order to recover the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister did not say that when these goat breeders contracted with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service they were advised it would cost $50 a head per year for the goats. This was agreed to and the goats arrived. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is alleged to have fed them on whole wheat and they died. These goats were replaced. Later, the goats owners agreed to an increase to $75 a head per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Costs have dramatically increased since then. In 1987, Minister Kerin made a counter offer to set the annual fee at $311 a head, together with what the goat breeders have indicated was a rather nebulous plan of acquisition by government agencies of an unspecified share of each of the syndicate's genetic material. This was considered unacceptable. The current fee per goat is $410 a head per year, which is a rise of more than 800 per cent since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in payments to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has been done without consultation with the goat owners. The owners claim that legal action against AQIS is pending and are worried that this legislation could result in them losing their goats before they have had their day in court. This is an issue that I know has certainly been brought to the attention of many of my coalition colleagues, who realise that it is a major problem for not only goat breeders but also any other people wishing to import plants, animals, genetic material and other goods. They recognise that is it is simply not workable to legislate for a contract. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had representations obviously in connection with the goat issue but also on a broader sphere from the Cattle Council of Australia. The representations made by that important organisation have centred on the major concerns that are basically set out in two major issues. There is nothing in the proposed legislation that precludes its application in a retrospective nature. The legislation in its present form could be inferred to apply to existing arrangements between clients of AQIS and the service. This sets an extremely dangerous precedent and should be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA> The monopolistic powers of AQIS remain in its ability to set fees in the absence of real and effective consultation with the client. The ability remains for AQIS to set such additional fees during an ongoing contract. During the committee stage of this legislation, I will certainly ask the Minister to substantiate the criteria that he would wish to see applied by AQIS, particularly with regard to matters affecting the duration of quarantine, fees at the commencement of service and the acceptance of fee fluctuations not to exceed the consumer price index over the corresponding period. There needs to be a clearly established relationship which sets out with the intending client a clear and agreed set of criteria in respect of conditions that would prevail throughout the agreed service period. I will certainly ask the Minister to give consideration to this matter and for those organisations that have dealings with AQIS to have a watertight contract. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the debate on this issue has certainly focused on issues relating to the goat industry, it will also focus on a number of other industries that I am sure other honourable senators will want to canvass in more and particular detail. I have certainly had representations in the Northern Territory with regard to the operations of AQIS that affect horticulture and, particularly, tropical horticulture and exotic plants that are being imported and are now taking on quite a major significance as a special market in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be well aware that the sociology and, to a certain extent, demography of northern Australia has changed very dramatically in the last few years with the immigration and acceptance into our community of a large number of Asian residents. This has brought about a very differing pattern of horticulture in northern Australia, both in the exploitation of the horticultural industry and its development, and in many of the issues relating to the way in which plant products that affect the important horticulture industries of northern Australia in particular are brought in and then handled by AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises a number of particular issues. There is the ongoing debate amongst bureaucrats in Canberra and northern Australia and new horticulturalists of a new industry who are unable to solicit from the Canberra bureaucracy a proper and decent understanding of this very important new horticultural industry in northern Australia. The typical Canberra mindsets have flowed through to the AQIS operations, be they at a quarantine house and how that needs to operate, the fees and charges that need to be in for the alternate processing, and the very different systems that need to be adopted, particularly as they apply to plant products and genetic materials in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of a 100 per cent cost recovery program raises quite significant issues for this new industry in the Northern Territory. We need to ask very seriously how and what subsequent effects with regard to quarantine could be passed on elsewhere. The matter has raged in the media of the Northern Territory for some time now. I hope that the Minister will be in a position in his response to address a number of these issues that have been raised with him, Minister Collins, who is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, and with the Federal member for the Northern Territory, Mr Warren Snowdon. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take a few moments of the Senate's time to read into the record an editorial which appeared in the Northern Territory News on Saturday, 6 July 1991. It is headed `Quarantine killing local horticulture' and reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Top End horticulturalists do have a point in what they say about the Australian Quarantine Service in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> Their complaints essentially have to do with two things: exorbitant charges and inadequate facilities which kill newly imported plants. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no criticism of the local officers in the service who, according to most growers, are doing a good job with what they have. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is it their fault or the Territory Government's that the charges are so high. Those are set from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The fault lies in a system which allows the expedient policy of cost recovery to triumph over long-term investment while denying proper training and facilities in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence says the horticulturalists are correct. Being hit with a bill of many thousands of dollars for a quarantine treatment which has actually killed your expensive imports is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is also a disgrace to suggest, as some growers did yesterday, that the way out for a few would be to smuggle in new varieties of plants and trees. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the best way to ensure the demise of an industry which should yield great profits in the future. There is nothing more certain than that the illegal import of genetic material would also result in the importation of exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not seem to make a lot of sense to save a few thousand dollars on the one hand, only to see a whole industry wiped out overnight. Which brings us to something of a dilemma. Horticulture is the fastest growing sector in the Territory's primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Value of production was $18.4 million in 1989/90, an astonishing increase of 40 per cent over the previous year's. An estimated 81 per cent of production was exported interstate or overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It has huge potential because the Top End enjoys certain comparative advantages through its capacity to supply early-season and out-of-season southern markets in a range of products. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who have chosen horticulture tend to be very hard working and innovative, two virtues bound to pay off in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> But they are under threat by a short-sighted federal policy which actively operates against the best interests of growers. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> They are made to pay through the nose for their attempts to improve the variety and genetic strains of fruit here, and they are lucky if they are able to collect a small percentage of their imports after they have been through quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, Top End horticulturalists suffer the worst of both worlds-high charges for very little return. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a classic Australian story. Here is a handful of people trying to make a go of a tough industry and clearly succeeding against very difficult odds. </PARA>
<PARA> And there is officialdom fully supported by remote politicians trying to stifle their initiative. The ``clever country'' at work-although horticulturalists could be forgiven for thinking it is not particularly clever. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether it is the goat industry, or whether it is the horticulture industry of the Northern Territory or northern Australia, we do need to be very mindful of the changes that are necessary. This Bill will need to be very carefully scrutinised in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I give notice that the Liberal and National parties will be moving amendments to the Quarantine Amendment Bill in the committee stage. The first amendment reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1. After clause 3, page 2, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``3A The amendment of the Principal Act effected by section 3 does not apply to expenses incurred in respect of any animals, embryos, gametes or other genetic material, plants or goods first detained in quarantine before 1 September 1991.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>2. After clause 4, page 3, add the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``5. The amendment of the Principal Act effected by section 4 does not apply to expenses incurred in respect of any animals, embryos, gametes or other genetic material, plants or goods first detained in quarantine before 1 September 1991.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that these amendments have been circulated to the chamber and I certainly commend them to the Senate. This is a most important issue; it is one that has wide ranging ramifications throughout Australia and one that needs very serious consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Quarantine Amendment Bill 1991 which the Senate is dealing with today amends the Quarantine Act 1908 and commences on 1 September this year. In speaking briefly to the Bill I would like to outline some of the major parts of it and then make some general comments about quarantine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 64 of the principal Act relating to quarantine expenses in the case of animals and plants. This clause allows the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine to direct that animals and goods must not be released from quarantine until expenses relating to the quarantine have been paid or until the owner has entered into some agreement for payment. The Bill provides that under any such agreement the payment of interest must not exceed the rate of 20 per cent per year and/or the giving of a security. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill concerns the sale of animals, plants or goods to recover quarantine expenses. This clause is effected by inserting a new section in part VI after current section 66. This new clause makes it possible to sell animals, plants or goods in order to recover the expenses of quarantine. The owner has to be given notice in writing of the proposed sale which can then take place 30 days after notification. If the sale proceeds, with the Commonwealth recovering quarantine moneys owed plus the costs involved in the sale, any surplus is then paid to the owner. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes go to remedy a difficulty which has existed for some time now in relation to the recovery of money from the users of the quarantine service. The parent Act, which goes back virtually to the start of the century, covered the fact that the costs of quarantine are a charge against the quarantine goods. What the Act did not provide for adequately was the situation where the money was not forthcoming from the commercial importer before the goods concerned had to be surrendered to the owner or importer. This amendment will remedy that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no objection to that at all, but we see the need-and the amendments referred to by my colleague Senator Tambling, who proceeded me on the speakers list, deal with this-to amend the Bill to provide that it is not retrospective in its activities. As the Bill stands at the present time, anyone who is in debt for quarantine services prior to 1 September 1991 will be liable to have those goods sold. </PARA>
<PARA> In at least one case that I know of there is quite a high liability and it is worth spending a few minutes detailing that liability as an example of the situation that might exist. I am not aware of any case other than this one, but there could be others out there. This case relates to the importation of goats. There is a bill in excess of $1m for quarantine fees for the quarantine services provided by the Commonwealth for the importation of those animals. That bill is about 800 per cent higher than the breeders anticipated when they imported the goats. </PARA>
<PARA> That came about because the original charge is higher and the period over which the charge is levied is much longer than they anticipated. They responded to advice from the Department of Health in 1983 to the effect that the quarantine fees would be $50 per goat per year. The cost today is $410 per goat, which is very much higher. Furthermore, they were told that the quarantine service would take only five years and I think it ended up taking eight years-or some years longer than they had budgeted for. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, it is hardly fair or reasonable to expect the breeders to pay that bill. They entered into a business undertaking with the Commonwealth in the light of information supplied to them by the Commonwealth. They acted on that information in good faith, and now they find that their liabilities have blown out to more than $1m. I do not know the value of imported goats, but I doubt very much whether that is a commercially recoverable cost in the marketplace if they sell them for stud or breeding purposes. The goats certainly will not pay for themselves in the wool they yield-presuming they are one of the wool producing breeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that, the Opposition is moving amendments to stop the Government being able to sell any animals that were in quarantine before 1 September this year. As the Bill stands, anyone who is in dispute with the Commonwealth is liable to have his goods seized if they have not been already handed over and sold to recover the debts. We fully support the concept that from now on it will be desirable for the Commonwealth to have the capacity to collect money owing to it because quarantine services are very expensive to maintain for the Commonwealth. I do not know what it cost to install the facilities in the Cocos Islands and the other quarantine facilities for animals and plant species around the country, but a great deal of money is involved in capital cost and in maintaining such facilities. It is quite obvious that any quarantine facility has to maintain maximum security to prevent the import of stock, whether animal or vegetable, carrying parasites or diseases which can move out into the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian quarantine requirements have a proud record of achievement, being based on scientific fact. We have never used quarantine requirements in this country as a non-tariff barrier against imports in the way a number of countries have. Australia has had to work with and respect the quarantine restrictions of other countries because we export material. We expect those countries which export to Australia and those Australians who are importing from other countries similarly to respect our quarantine laws. The quarantine laws are fundamental to the health not only of primary industry but also of the human community in Australia. They are designed for the good of Australia and to ensure that we do not import exotic pests or diseases which would affect the health of our rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Those industries are vulnerable in two ways. First, there is the loss of production and, secondly, there is the loss of markets. There are countries which simply would not accept products from us if we were known to possess certain diseases and parasites. The effect in commercial terms is enormous and difficult to quantify. Quarantine policies are about managing risk, making an initial assessment of that risk and then taking the appropriate procedures on the importation of the stock, whether animal or vegetable, to ensure that what is being imported is absolutely free of contamination. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term viability of our industries depends on maintaining those barriers. As well as maintaining those barriers in the form of the quarantine services, we have to have another arm, a reaction service, within the country so that if anything does escape the quarantine barrier we can deal with it. That depends on having adequate facilities to detect the presence of pathogens or parasites that have come into the country from overseas by escaping the quarantine barrier. The Customs Service provides part of the surveillance in respect of humans, and the Department of Health and the Australian Quarantine Service, in their checks, provide part of the surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the surveillance side, we need a reactive capability in the form of destroying or inoculating against the pests when they are detected. It is one of the great tragedies of modern Australia that at the start of this decade we built the Animal Health Laboratory in Victoria for the development of vaccines and other procedures against parasites and infections in large animals. Industry was taken over, particularly the beef industry, by a wave of both ignorance and fear. The marvellous facility that we built, which I have visited, never reached its full development. The development of the Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong was a great credit to those people in Australia who were involved with its design and construction. What was involved was the construction of a completely viral-proof establishment with airlocks, decontamination chambers, controlled air supplies, quarantine and all the rest of it. It was principally, but not exclusively, concerned with parasites and infections in the large animal field, principally the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of such a laboratory was to identify organisms such as the foot and mouth disease organism. If such a disease had been detected in Australia and if it could have been rapidly identified rather than having to send samples to laboratories in the United Kingdom, the continents of Europe or North America, and if we could have developed and manufactured vaccines, outbreaks could have been controlled and inoculations could have taken place immediately. Unfortunately, the community reaction based on a mixture of fear and ignorance, was such that even though this was the most modern and absolutely secure environment, the necessary vaccines needed to be kept in order to do the phage typing and all the rest of it for identification of the particular strain of the organism was not permitted. It is important from the quarantine point of view not only to have the barriers and assess what is coming in, but to have the detection facilities for those breaches that inevitably occur in the system and to be able to have the capability of reacting to them. </PARA>
<PARA> But I am digressing from the Bill. I think that we can take a great deal of pride in the success of quarantine services in the past. We have preserved in Australia an environment that is relatively free of some of the major destructive infections and pathogens for both the plant and animal kingdoms. We have earned a great deal of money from that, and it has been reflected in the high standard of living that this country has enjoyed this century. With the qualification that we will seek to amend the retrospective elements of this Bill, we wish it speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Quarantine Amendment Bill is proposed to ensure that charges accumulated by people who use quarantine facilities in Australia are paid before goods are discharged and, in the event that the charges are not paid, this legislation gives authority for the quarantine services to sell the goods to recoup costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Opposition signalled in the House of Representatives when this legislation was rushed through that place in the closing days of the last session, we are not opposing the legislation, but I have some grave concerns about several aspects of it. When we talk about goods in quarantine, to all intents and purposes we mean animals, whether they be on the ground or in an embryonic stage. The goods may also be horticultural, although I suspect that the costs that this legislation has necessitated would usually apply to animals. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's quarantine record is one of which Australia can be justly proud. I, like every other Australian, would not wish that standard of control and surveillance to be lowered at any time. In recent years there have been increased demands on our quarantine services as Australian cattle, sheep and goat producers have increased imports of animals from a great number of overseas countries. They have done this because of the necessity to increase the genetic pool in order to increase production and to improve performance of their herd or flock. </PARA>
<PARA> The result has been an expanded gene pool and significant advances in the numbers and the variety of sheep, cattle and goats. One has only to look at the developments in British breeds of cattle such as the Poll Hereford to realise the important contribution that US and Canadian imports have had on that breed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen in recent months the importation of the Japanese Wahgu heifer. In recent years we have had the Piedmontese cattle from Italy, the Belgian Blue cattle and Pinzgauer cattle from Europe, and the Dexter cattle from the United Kingdom. There are sheep and goats presently in quarantine and I understand they will never be allowed out of quarantine because of the risk of scrapie. Some goats have been in quarantine for years and it is only the fourth or more generation that will actually be released onto Australian farms. </PARA>
<PARA> The importers of these animals obviously knew that they would be liable for considerable costs when they decided to import them and were aware of the longevity of the exercise. However, I wonder whether they realised the extent of their investment in terms of lag time before any dividend could be realised. I wonder whether they were able to negotiate a price for the agistment of their stock in quarantine. I would doubt that they were allowed to negotiate any price that was not the one given to them. Indeed, the price they were given at the start of the exercise has, over a series of press releases, gone completely through the roof. It is that aspect of this legislation that concerns me most. What opportunity has the importer to determine a fair and equitable price for the cost of boarding the animals? What opportunity has the importer of entering into a contract with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service over the costs?</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Budget that came down last night, we find that the Government has slugged people in rural areas to the hilt. Obviously this Government does not really care about country people. I do not think it understands the problems that country people or farmers have in importing some of these animals. I do not think that they have an opportunity to negotiate a fair price. Maybe the Minister will be able to explain that at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event of a dispute, who actually will be the arbiter? There seems to be no system for a firm contract, no system for an appeal or examination of the fees charged, and I believe that is unfair for the importers. On the Government's side, what is to stop an importer running up a large bill and then, anticipating that the price at the subsequent auction of the livestock might be less than the import bills, waiting for the auction and paying the lower price? I have no objection to the Government trying to ensure the user pays principle is applied but, at a time like this-and we saw this, as I said, in the Budget last night-to really slug rural people again is a bit inhumane of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of the Bill that concerns me is that those who import the livestock are going to be at the mercy of whatever fees the Government chooses to levy. That is precisely what has happened here. In respect of the interest charged, the fee, at 20 per cent, is savage. The same Government has just finished telling us that interest rates are coming down, so why is the rate set at 20 per cent? I do not believe that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service ought to be attempting to run at a profit. A more realistic interest rate would be fairer. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the starting date of this Bill, the first question any importer will ask is whether the new fee payment arrangements will apply for any goods quarantined after 1 September, or merely that the rules will change with effect from 1 September. I believe it is patently unfair to change the rules for goods received before the legislation is in place. Retrospectivity in any legislation is bad and not sustainable morally or legally. </PARA>
<PARA> People who import plants or animals into Australia are contributing to the overall wealth of this country, in attempting to provide better genetic material, and I do not believe they ought to be unfairly discriminated against by the application of excessive quarantine fees. If fees are to be charged and pressed for without exception, and I stress I have no objection to governments obtaining a fee for service on a user pays principle-if there is competition, of course-I hope that the Government intends to ensure that people get value for their money and that the service is efficient and affordable. I question whether it is, and whether it can be when there is no choice. Monopolies tend not to create an atmosphere of affordability or equity. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope this legislation will be applied equitably and, where the Government decides to press for payment, that the negotiations are handled fairly and reasonably, taking into consideration the ability to pay what could be quite large accounts. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), in his second reading speech in the other place, cited the example of an account of over $1.5m, and Senator MacGibbon alluded to that earlier this evening. That is not a small amount of money to be met on top of the costs of purchase and transport. Obviously, while the animals are in quarantine they are not earning any money for the importer. I question why the amount has been disputed and whether the Bill was accumulated on charges that were levied without consultation with the importer. I suspect they were. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendments to be moved by Senator Tambling in this place on behalf of the Opposition and I urge the Government to ensure, for the sake of Australian agriculture, that its departments provide quality service and not treat every government function as a revenue raiser to prop up a sick economy-a sick economy that this Hawke-Keating-Kerin Labor Government has inflicted on Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a few comments to add to those that have been made by previous speakers because, in essence, I agree with much of what has been said by Senator Tambling, Senator MacGibbon and Senator Brownhill. The concept in the Quarantine Amendment Bill of tidying up the regulations and introducing the principle of user pays is acceptable and should be endorsed. The concerns that have been expressed, especially those regarding the retrospectivity which would ensue under this Bill if it were passed as is, are ones which the Australian Democrats share. I give notice now that we will be supporting the amendments which the National Party proposes to move at the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On looking at the Bills Digest dealing with this Bill, I found that the explanation given of the main provisions of the Bill was that clause 3 provides that the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine may, where expenses are payable in respect of quarantined animals, plants or goods, direct that they may not be released from quarantine until the expenses are paid or an agreement for payment of the expenses has been entered into. There are two things that I think are very important to consider and they have already been alluded to by previous speakers. Firstly, the amount of the expenses and, secondly, an agreement for payment can certainly be placed under question. We are told that in this situation an agreement will be reached after there has been a dispute and until then the goods are not to be released from quarantine. Surely if it is possible to come to some sort of agreement when there is a dispute, logic would have it that one should look at an agreement in the first instance. The first instance is when the proposition is put that certain animals need to be placed in quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that in considering this Bill I have received several different sets of communications. Within those communications there were several different case histories. In each one of those case histories we were able to see that there was a great deal of uncertainty about the sort of arrangement that was being entered into by both the importer and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and about the expenses that would accrue from this arrangement. I shall outline one of the case histories. It will not take long, and I think it is worth hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes from a communication that I received from a pastoral company in Keith in South Australia, where I am told that on 1 April 1984-perhaps that is a salutary date for the people who got involved in this arrangement-the people who were intending to import, following an advertisement asking for expressions of interest in the importation of North American goat stock, in the first correspondence had fees quoted to them of $50 per annum. The advertisement stated in part that the anticipated cost would be of the order of $4,500 per imported animal for all agency fees, testing and freight costs with the major variable being freight, which is related to the number of animals in the shipment, plus-this is the important point-$50 per year per animal kept on Torrens Island. The per animal fee was for imports, progeny and recipients; in other words, regardless of whichever description fitted the animal, it would still cost $50 per animal. In addition, any specific costs for artificial insemination, ovum transplants, shearing, et cetera applicable to and requested by the importer would be charged at normal contract rates. </PARA>
<PARA> That is pretty plain, straightforward terminology. One would imagine that that would be acceptable and understandable to all parties concerned. But on 12 October 1984 at the first importers' seminar in Adelaide, importers were asked whether they would accept an agistment fee rise to $75 per animal per year. The importers-I suggest quite naturally-agreed to this rise. It also took into account consumer price index increases each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it seems quite reasonable so far; but on 18 September 1986 the fees were lifted from $75 to $311. No prior notice was given. Importers first read about this in the press and were not consulted. Soon afterwards, on 13 November 1986, importers received correspondence advising of this rise to $311. That was the confirmation. Again, though, there was no opportunity for consultation on this matter. On 16 October the following year, another fee rise to $340 was approved and then a further rise took the fee to $360, in line with the CPI, the following financial year, and similarly each subsequent year. As we have already heard, the fee is now in excess of $400 per annum per animal. </PARA>
<PARA> This reads as a recipe for disaster for someone who had entered into what seemed to be a fairly straightforward arrangement. As one of the previous speakers mentioned, it seemed a monopolistic situation also, for these people were over a barrel. There was very little they could do to say no or to question. There was very little opportunity-in fact, I can see no opportunity-for them to do any negotiating. As has already been asked-and I agree entirely-where was the opportunity for arbitration and the opportunity to negotiate?</PARA>
<PARA> One can understand the frustration of those who are involved in this industry being put in such a position, where they have very little opportunity to address the financial situation that they got themselves into. What is even worse is that in the Bills Digest on the proposed legislation we are told:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 provides that where animals, plants or goods are being held in quarantine for the purpose of recovering quarantine expenses, the Director may give their owner a notice advising them that if, at the end of 30 days from receipt of the notice, quarantine expenses remain payable, the animals, plants or goods may be sold. At the expiration of the 30 day period the Commonwealth may sell the animals, plants or goods. The proceeds of sale are to be used only to meet the expenses payable, and any surplus is to be paid to the owner.</PARA>
<PARA>It sounds reasonable enough, but it is not because the owner's interest in those animals would be considerably in excess of what their auction price would bring. The investment would include not only the period during which the animals have been in quarantine-the lag time-but also what could be called the opportunity cost. This is not just a case of importing a few animals. It is usually a case of importing animals with the prospect of establishing a stud or breeding program. That is the purpose of introducing the animals to start with. That is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Importers are not going through such an exercise just to add a few numbers to a flock; they are looking at an entirely different sort of flock. Those who believe that importers are content to make that investment and have the Commonwealth receive the auction price, with the few dollars that may be in excess being returned to the original owner, just do not understand the reason for importing stock. I see that as being evidence of a misunderstanding of what importation programs are about. The other aspect which will be the subject of amendment illustrates the lack of understanding of the concerns about retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this Bill contemplates applying these rules or fees now to existing arrangements reveals the Government's attitude to importers. I have described part of a case history in which the importers' interests were not considered, in which the importers were not consulted before rule changes were made. Here we have a further example. Here we have the idea that we can ride roughshod over the existing arrangements; apply fees or rule changes in the middle of the deal, if you like; change the rules of the game while the game is in progress. The fact that the Government was willing to do this, and is being prevented from doing so only by the proposed National Party amendment, illustrates its attitude that it will ride roughshod over the importers without consultation, not willing to pay any regard to the principles of what I expect ordinary people would see as fair play. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason I have no qualms in supporting the forthcoming amendment to be moved by the coalition. I am particularly concerned that we have been unable to draft an amendment which would ensure that there could be a clear and agreed set of criteria in respect of the conditions that could prevail through the agreed service period. Those were the words of the Cattle Council of Australia in a communication I received asking whether such an amendment could be incorporated in the Bill. It is with great frustration that I find that we are unable to do that because, apparently, such an arrangement would create a precedent for other primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the special nature of the importing industry itself, and the special conditions which apply to such an industry, would be worthy of the attention of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) to such an extent that he might be able to understand how important it is for people entering into arrangements to know what they are letting themselves in for before the final commitment is made. In this case history that I read to the Senate, I would have thought that the initial correspondence laid it out fairly clearly, but once the animals are in quarantine, the importer has very little option but to go along with any changes which occur. I hope that somehow or other we can address that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the folklore warning that you do not buy a pig in a poke, where you cannot see what you are letting yourself in for-or a goat in a poke, or a goat on an island, or a goat in a monopolistic situation where you, the owner, can be exploited further down the track. Whatever way one describes it, the situation is inequitable for the importer. I sincerely hope that we can address that situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleagues have said, the Opposition generally supports the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1991, except for its retrospective aspects. My colleagues have mentioned that as well. I am very pleased to note that the Australian Democrats also are opposed to that retrospectivity. I know that my colleague on the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, Senator Bourne, and the other Committee members, are always concerned about any aspect of retrospectivity. It is indeed good to note that in this instance the Australian Democrats will support the amendments that we will be proposing to negative the retrospective elements of this Bill. I am pleased to note that. I urge the Government also to support those amendments in order to get rid of that retrospectivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generally speaking, we support the provisions of this Bill which provide for the Commonwealth to hold goods-animals, plants, embryos, et cetera-which have been in quarantine until the expenses incurred in that quarantine have been paid for or until suitable arrangements for payment have been made. As a last resort, the Bill also allows the Commonwealth to sell the goods after suitable notice has been given and to apply the proceeds of sale to the outstanding debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst talking about the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, I also wish to raise the position of the stone fruits industry in the granite belt in the State of Queensland and, particularly, matters relating to the importation of bud wood for the stone fruits. I have three worries: first of all, the importation of plant material disease into the granite belt area; secondly, the importation of exotic plants on illegal plant material; and, thirdly, the importation of exotic plant disease on legally imported fruit and vegetables. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand the process with stone fruits, if someone wants to import bud wood into Australia, it can be done through the Australian Customs Service. The bud wood for a new species or a new variety is released to plant breeders in overseas countries, usually in December in the northern hemisphere. This bud cannot be grafted in Australia until the following spring because of our differing seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The bud wood is sent by air to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service for the specific nurseryman who is importing it. These buds are then grafted and tested for parasites and diseases by AQIS. One year later they are regrafted in quarantine and the original plants are then destroyed. There are then further checks for parasites and diseases and, if all is well, these small plants are released to the nurseryman after the fees are paid. The legislation that we are talking about today is relevant to that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years after the commercial release of this variety overseas, the Australian nurseryman, for the first time, begins to produce these trees. Two years then elapse before there are sufficient trees available for sale, and a further two to three years are required before fruit is available for the Australian export market. So it is approximately six years after the release of the variety to most other parts of the world-that is, the people that we compete with in the export of these fruits-that Australians can begin producing the fruit for the home market and the export market. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant variety rights are available in Australia, but a variety is ineligible for protection under PVR if it has been commercially available anywhere in the world for six years. Therefore, PVRs are of little use under Australian conditions and do little to encourage the importation of new, improved varieties. This long delay has a down side in that it encourages the illegal importation of plant material which can be budded immediately and which will produce trees years before the same variety can be brought in legally. That is a real problem. It has been a problem in the Stanthorpe area. It is brought about because of this very long process that is necessary to bring overseas new varieties legally into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is quite a large trade in the illegal importation of deciduous fruit bud wood. I can say this because of recent investigations I have done in Stanthorpe and discussions I have had with people in the industry in that area. This has some unfortunate effects. With that sort of importation can come exotic plant diseases, for example, ring spot virus disease in paw paws, which has been rampant in the paw paw growing areas of my State for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Technology now exists for the early detection of plant diseases at the bud wood stage, and this could be done either in the sending country or on arrival. If this proved negative, the buds could be multiplied under quarantine using agriculture departments' facilities, for release in bulk years before it is now available. I suggest that we can test for early detection of these plant diseases at the bud wood stage using the technology that now exists. Regrettably, some of the rules that we work under at the present time were promulgated many years ago-in fact, decades ago-when the technology was not available for this early detection. It is now available, but apparently is not being used. </PARA>
<PARA> If, when a plant comes in, there is no evidence of plant disease at the bud wood stage, my suggestion is that the agriculture departments in the various States could be used for bulk release of this bud wood. This process would largely negate the present illegal importation of bud wood, with its risk of the importation of exotic parasites and diseases. Another paradox is that the plant diseases already in Australia are subject to quarantine of imported plant material. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another side of the coin which should be looked at. I mention these points because I think it is time for a review of the Quarantine Act, particularly as it relates to this issue. The other side of the coin is the legal importation of fruit and vegetables. The Australian Quarantine Service at present is proposing to allow the importation into this country of fruit and vegetables from countries and areas which are affected by plant diseases not presently in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the apple disease, fireblight, is present in New Zealand. The Australian Quarantine Service may allow New Zealand apples to be imported into Australia if they come from trees no less than 500 metres from infected trees. This is a ludicrous proposition. There can be apple trees in New Zealand infected with fireblight, but trees which come from no less than 500 metres away from them are apparently allowed into Australia. If the disease gets into Australia, it may affect Australian apple trees and completely ruin an industry. That does not seem to me to be right, but that is what I am told happens. Bud wood material inevitably comes in on such fruit and, from time to time, it has been illegally used by Australian fruit growers to produce trees of the imported varieties and this creates that danger to local industries that I speak of. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect: spray is not allowed to be used in Australia. For example, antibiotic sprays which are banned in Australia are available in other countries and are able to be used to control bacterial spot in stone fruit. That fruit is then allowed to be sold in competition with our fruit, which is antibiotic-free fruit. That seems to me to be silly. I understand that we ban these sprays because we Australians do not want to eat the antibiotic spray on these fruits because it would build up our resistance to antibiotics. So we ban the use of these sprays in Australia, but we allow other countries that do use them to export to Australia fruit which competes with our fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to be okay if we eat the overseas fruit which has this antibiotic spray on it, yet we are not allowed to have this spray on our own fruit. That does not seem to me to be right. There is a length of time during which the spray is supposed to break down and not pose a danger. It seems very silly to me that we make our farmers compete without using those antibiotic sprays and we allow the importation of overseas fruit which does have those sprays on it.</PARA>
<PARA> Some aspects of the matters that I have mentioned do require further attention and further investigation. This whole question of quarantine, particularly in the stone fruit area and as it relates to the granite belt of my home State of Queensland, really needs to be looked at closely in order to get rid of some of these anomalies which appear to exist. If there is a review of those matters, we should consider at that time whether the AQIS should be subject to competition from people who are properly licensed and who have the proper qualifications which enable them to do the right thing with plant quarantine. Perhaps then some of the costs that are quite often argued about-and there is often a lot of dismay about the extent of charges by AQIS-could be brought into line with the current culture of user-pays. As we all know, competition brings better service and reduced prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole Act, particularly as it relates to the matters that I have been talking about, needs review. In the course of that review, we should look at whether it is feasible to introduce some competition to the services provided by AQIS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1991. As honourable senators have already heard from my colleagues, the coalition is seeking to amend this Bill because of the very basic principle that the Hawke Labor Government has broken. We uphold the right of Australians who enter into financial agreements with government and its agencies not to be subjected to retrospective rule changes and the use of this Parliament to validate the Government's position. We are only told a selected version of the facts in the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) by reference to the lost Commonwealth revenue caused by owners and importers `not paying their lawful debts for quarantine services'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition supports both the just payment of debts and the user-pays principle, as my colleague Senator Macdonald just outlined. We do not support the practice of governments changing the rules as they go along, breaking agreements and then attempting to resolve the ensuing disputes by legislating themselves an advantage. The whole point of our contention is this is not fair and we will not support this retrospective element. That is exactly what occurred in the case of those goat breeders who responded to the 1983 offer by the then Department of Health to participate in the scrapie eradication program whereby imported goats would be kept for a minimum of five years in order to breed out the disease. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost agreed upon then was $50 per animal per year. In November 1984 the importers reluctantly agreed to raising this fee to $75 when it was stated by the animal quarantine branch of the Department of Health that full cost recovery would constitute a `prohibitive' cost to the importer. So far, well and good, but then in 1987 the Hawke Labor Government broke the agreement by deciding to demand full cost recovery. At the same time, importers were alleging that stock losses had been high at the Torrens Island quarantine facility because of lack of appropriate management experience and of facilities not being ready on time. The annual fee was then set at $311 per animal per year. Whatever its cost justification, the importers had reason to believe that they had an agreement whereby arrangements would not be changed in this arbitrary manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost demand by the Government on importers has risen from $50 to $410 per animal, an increase of 820 per cent. A major Western Australian importer with 200 animals at Torrens Island is faced with a bill of $320,000 rather than the $45,000 originally agreed to, and originally budgeted for. While these animals remain in the possession of the Commonwealth, they cannot be insured and thus cannot be forward sold. Once again, this Labor Government proceeds blindly on a course of cost recovery without recognising that farm incomes are in a parlous state, even affecting these larger importers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is being asked to approve this Bill to enable the Commonwealth to retain possession of the animals and to `ensure that the Commonwealth's bargaining position over payment of the debt is not weakened'. That is the most outrageous statement in this economic time that we could imagine. The Government has simply lost touch with reality and the whole rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than submit to any court decision or negotiate with the importers on the basis of the facts outlined, the Hawke Labor Government prefers confiscation that ensures that its demands will be met. This tactic does not even give the importers the opportunity to pay the bill through future breeding from the stock. It is an absolute cut-off for these people. It is significant that the Government has not sought to introduce a firm dispute settling procedure in this Bill. Importers will continue to be at a disadvantage in any future dispute with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will be moving an amendment to prevent the Government from selling any animals in quarantine before 1 September 1991. We are not disputing the need for the Government to protect and recover its costs in the future. What we do oppose is, in effect, the conferring of a retrospective advantage to the Government in a dispute where the importers present a strong case for the upholding of the agreement made with this very same Government in 1984. It is not just a matter of protecting a small number of importers from injustice, bearing in mind that these are enterprising rural producers who entered into a long term project for improved and disease-free stock. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is about honesty in government. It may not be a spectacular case, but private citizens in legitimate dispute with an agency of the Federal Government have the right to seek its resolution by negotiation or through the courts, without having the rules changed by administrative or legislative action. We in the coalition will simply not be a party to that. At the very least, the Senate should not be an accomplice to one party in a dispute. We should all remember the cynicism held by so many Australians as to the fairness of public institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Public confidence in Government diminishes that one little bit more if responsible Australian rural producers are able to state that not only were they misled by the Government and its agencies, but also that their case was destroyed by legislative action. Consequently, I commend the coalition amendment as a necessary exercise to ensure some fairness in this dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear it. There is nothing in section 64 which precludes the enforcement of the charge with respect to expenses due to the Commonwealth prior to the expiration of the quarantine period. The Bill is silent, however, on how the legal charge is to be enforced. The new provisions enable the Commonwealth to enforce the legal charge by retaining possession of the goods until either the debt is paid or arrangements for payment are negotiated without expensive litigation against owners or importers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to all goods in quarantine on and from 1 September, including those animals in the SFAP, as some members of the SFAP are not paying charges lawfully imposed. We understand that the Opposition will be opposing the Quarantine Amendment Bill on the grounds that it should not be apply to the SFAP which is scheduled to be completed by February 1992. The outstanding debt for those syndicates still on Torrens Island is of the order of $900,000 and is the subject of dispute with the syndicate owners and the Ombudsman's office. </PARA>
<PARA> The present section 64(1) of the Quarantine Act 1908 creates a legal charge over any animals undergoing quarantine in respect of which fees are outstanding. This charge can be enforced by seeking an order from a court of appropriate jurisdiction to allow a receiver to be appointed to retain custody of the animals. The SFAP has to date involved an effective Commonwealth subsidy of around $1.6m. The amendments proposed will apply to any goods undergoing quarantine now or in the future. Importantly, however, the amendments will provide flexibility for the owners to enter into arrangements with the Commonwealth for the payment of any debts. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) recently met with a number of the syndicates involved in the SFAP. Without the amendment the Minister will be left with no option but to use the existing section 64 provisions. This obviously would not be in the best interests of the owners. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of an effective and efficient quarantine service for this country cannot be overstated. Australia is absolutely and utterly in the hands of an efficient quarantine service in terms of the essential protection of this country's vital primary industries. It is in the interests of all Australians that that service be given the necessary legislative support which it needs to do its job efficiently. I wish to indicate the appreciation of the Government for the expressions of support that have been indicated by Opposition senators in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate in conclusion, to soothe the troubled breast of Senator Tambling, that the Democrats have indicated to me their intention to support Senator Tambling's amendments. We will not be moving to the committee stage of the Bill tonight. The reason, quite simply, is that Senator Tambling has indicated-as indeed is his right-that he wishes to pursue a number of specific quarantine issues during the committee stage more exhaustively than he has so far canvassed them in his second reading contribution. I believe it is the intention of the Minister responsible for the Act to be in the chamber during the committee stage to assist Senator Tambling in that process. It is for that reason alone that we will not be proceeding with the committee stage of this legislation this evening. </PARA>

They will be supported. Having said that, it is appropriate to say that to some extent I may have to take the blame for this rescheduling. I gave the parliamentary liaison officer to understand that I wanted to speak later in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins. It was, certainly. I had asked to speak later in the debate because I wished to hear the full explanation of the reasons for the amendments so that I could agree with them. Having asked to speak late in the debate, to be listed late on the speakers list, perhaps that was misunderstood to mean tomorrow morning-I do not know. Whatever the reason was, it was interpreted to mean that we were not quite ready tonight. That is not the fact. I was prepared to follow this Bill through the committee stage and to support the proposed amendments. I am still prepared to do that. But if the Minister understood my request for being later on the list to mean that we were not quite ready and that therefore he would not need to be in the chamber, I do not think it is my fault; nor do I think it is the Democrats' fault. In fact, I do not even think it is the Minister's fault. It certainly does not matter because the end result will be--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That is why I interjected earlier: what is more important to the Labor Government? Is it the Parliament or a caucus meeting? Clearly, when I was informed 28 minutes ago that it was a caucus meeting, I already had my answer. If the Government had given us the courtesy that it obviously extended, quite properly, to the Australian Democrats but not to the Opposition, which was improper, we would not be having this disagreement now. Once again, we have bad manners being displayed on this issue by the Government. If we are kept informed, we are more than likely prepared to go along with it. But the Government has run out of business. The Minister knows it and he is now clawing at the door trying to find something else to get thrown into this Senate. The Government brought us back early. It has no business to carry on with. It is a typical case of the Government's mismanagement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, in answer to a question from Senator Hill, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, made a statement which relates to the practice of recognising states and governments. I wish to take a few moments to reflect on his comments because, I think, the events of the last twenty-four hours are quite significant in this regard. Senator Evans said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is, of course, not Australian practice now to do other than to recognise states. We do not recognise or de-recognise governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement of policy was enunciated in January 1988 when the Australian Government said that it would not extend formal recognition whether de jure or de facto to new governments. Instead, it would replace that recognition by the conduct of its relation with regimes, `to the extent and in the manner which may be required in the circumstances of each case'. </PARA>
<PARA> That policy was clearly designed to give the Australian Government a certain degree of leeway in situations where there may be a change of government as a result of an overthrow or coup or where there may be some moves to self-determination in a particular territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the time has come for Australia to give serious consideration both to recognition of the Baltic states and also a suitable conduct of relations with the existing governments of those states, the duly elected governments of those states, which would show to the rest of the world that we in Australia are unwilling to let the power of the gun barrel dictate the lives of thousands of people whose aspirations are for democracy. The events which I have witnessed on television this evening remind me of one thing, and one thing alone, and that is the events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. My heart was filled with the same sadness tonight that it was filled with in June two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to see the world stand by while democracy is crushed in the Soviet Union and in the Baltic states. I have reflected today on the conduct of Mr Yeltsin and wondered how many of us in this Parliament would have the courage to stand up to a military dictatorship, to rally the people to stand for freedom and democracy, albeit at the very real risk of our own life. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the least we can do in this Parliament, as individual parliamentarians concerned with freedom, democracy and self-determination, is to make a stand and say that we believe in democracy and we do not believe the Australian Government should, by relations or conduct or any such things, give succour and comfort to a dictatorship in the Soviet Union which clearly contravenes United Nations principles of self-determination and which, arguably, seized power from President Gorbachev and prevent him signing the union treaty and, therefore, giving the Baltic states, among others, a greater claim to autonomy and recognition in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, I urge Senator Evans, and all of those within the Government, to choose to recognise the Baltic states as states and to conduct our relations in accordance with the 1988 declaration in such a way as to show that we believe the elected governments of those states are the only governments that are entitled to speak on behalf of those people and that we will not tolerate tyranny in the Soviet Union or the Baltic states. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) All the recommendations of the Auditor-General's report No. 9 Department of Defence Post Separation Report have been adopted with the exception of recommendations 3, 7, 8 and 11 for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) With regard to Recommendation 3 it is considered that the existing arrangements are adequate for the task. All civilian application records are centrally colocated. A database has been created to keep track of ongoing cases, and will provide a means of providing disaggregated statistical information as required. Service records of Post Separation Employment (PSE) cases are similarly kept by the Director General of Service Personnel Policy (DGSPP);</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) While the Department agrees in-principle with Recommendation 7, in practice senior management has determined all cases; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) With respect to Recommendation 8 consistency of approach, where appropriate, has been achieved through liaison arrangements between the civilian and ADF policy areas and a separate review is not considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) With respect to Recommendation 11, current Defence processes and arrangements now in place take account of the Defence Industry Committee considerations. Therefore, it has not been necessary to formally raise PSE policy issues at meetings of the Committee since December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Of the recommendations adopted the status of each is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) (Recommendation 1) The Department's policy on PSE has been widely circulated via Departmental Personnel Instruction No. 4/89 which was published on 10 August 1989, and in Defence Instruction (General) 25-1 which was published on 1 March 1990. These instructions, in addition to being a statement of Defence policy, are also considered to be a basic educative tool for use by managers in explaining the obligations imposed by this policy on individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>  In an effort to generally improve staff knowledge of PSE obligations, this matter is one of several topics discussed in an ethics booklet which has been prepared by the Inspector-General Division for widespread use by service and civilian personnel throughout the Department and the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>  Additionally, a section dealing with PSE has been included in the recently published civilian Induction Handbook, thereby alerting all inductees to the Department of the obligations they must meet when separating from APS employment.</PARA>
<PARA>  Other instructions/handbooks will also be framed in the knowledge of the PSE requirements and incorporated into those instructions etc. where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) (Recommendation 2) The final entitlement notice sent to civilian staff who are leaving Commonwealth employment has been substantially revised to reflect the contents of DPI No. 4/89. The revised notice takes into account the special circumstance of staff who retire under s76R and s76W (retirements other than age retirements) provisions of the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) (Recommendation 4) The Department has achieved this by providing written advice to staff (DPI No. 4/89 and DI(G) 25-1), and by preparing the ethics booklet sponsored by the Inspector-General's organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) (Recommendation 5) This has also been achieved by providing written advice to staff (DPI No. 4/89 and DI(G) 25-1).</PARA>
<PARA>  (e) (Recommendation 6) The database referred to in response No. 1 (a) should make access to this form of information relatively easy. As to assessing identified cases which have by-passed the assent procedures, Personnel Policy Branch would seek to counsel these staff of their rights and obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>  (f) (Recommendation 9) A review of the roles of the Inspector-General Division, Human Resources &amp;Management Division and ADF in implementation of revised PSE policy has been undertaken, culminating in the issuing of the civilian and Service instructions DPI No. 4/89 and DI(G) 25-1. Responsibility for prime carriage of the PSE function has been vested in DGSPP for Service members and the Assistant Secretary Personnel Policy for civilian staff.</PARA>
<PARA>  (g) (Recommendation 10) Actions resulting from the Auditor General's recommendations have been addressed. The matter of PSE was last addressed in the September 1990 quarterly return to the Minister for Finance. The Department has not been required to report on it since that time. The issue of updated instructions is seen as implementing the revised policy initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) During 1988-89 and 1989-90, based on available records, the number of Defence employees who left the Department to commence private employment in related industry totalled 16 and 18 respectively. The number of ADF personnel who left for the same purpose during this period totalled 6 and 11 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) At a meeting in December 1988 the Defence Industry Committee considered and provided views on Defence arrangements and processes for personnel moving from the Department to Defence Industry. The Defence Industry Committee was invited to consider the arrangements because of its role as the advisory body on Defence matters involving industry. Current Defence processes and arrangements now in place take account of the Defence Industry Committee considerations.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) A total number of 8 previous employees are now engaged as Departmental consultants. These are listed in the attached table.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Only one person received a redundancy package, all others left the Department on normal resignation or retirement grounds. That person received a standard redundancy payment in accordance with the Australian Public Service Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) The financial payments received by the remainder of the employees listed in Question 5 were the standard entitlements available to staff on resignation or age retirement and covered payment in lieu of accrued leave entitlements and refund of superannuation contributions (where applicable).</PARA>

<PARA>  In his report on the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption's investigation into North Coast Development in 1990 Assistant Commissioner Adrian Roden QC identified a number of alleged corrupt and improper practices including the offering and taking of bribes, involving a number of elected and unelected public officials.</PARA>
<PARA>  Assistant Commissioner Roden in this report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>      `With the mounting cost of campaign advertising, parties must be increasingly vulnerable to attempts by substantial donors to exert influence.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have been advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The postage entitlement available to Senators and Members states that postage at official expense is for parliamentary and electorate business only. Party political business is excluded. Certain Office Holders of the Parliament and Ministers have an additional entitlement to the cost of postage in relation to their official business. Entitlees are required to exercise their judgment when utilising their postage entitlements having regard to the purposes for which the material is to be utilised. Consequently, it is not possible to make a categorical statement about the types of material covered by the question without sighting the material referred to.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Senators and Members are provided with a limited entitlement to stamps by the Parliamentary Departments. Those stamps are for use by the entitlee and can be used for parliamentary and electorate business only. Party political business is excluded.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Senators and Members are entitled to utilise the bulk postage service provided by Australia Post. The facility is available for use by the entitlee.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) See answer to (3) above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The guidelines on the use of personalised letterhead are administered by the Presiding Officers. My Department supplements the entitlements of Members of the House of Representatives to bring it up to that provided by the Department of the Senate to Honourable Senators. Stationery items provided by my Department, such as plain paper, envelopes etc. are subject to the same guidelines which apply to postage. These are outlined at (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) The Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 provides for individual Departments to meet the cost of a Minister's postage expenditure in relation to official business. `Official business' covers business on behalf of the Government and the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) The postage entitlement for Ministers is supplied and administered by the individual Departments. The honourable Senator may wish to raise the matter with each Minister. No evidence has been adduced to me as to a breach.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) My Department would examine any `prima facie' evidence in areas within its responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) It has been the practice of successive Governments, including the current Government, that, in addition to the back-bench entitlement to an electorate office, Ministers and Opposition Officeholders may establish Ministerial/Office-holder offices in the capital city of their home State. Alternatively, Ministers/Office-holders may upgrade their electorate offices to combined Ministerial/Office-holder/electorate offices.</PARA>
<PARA>  Ministers' departments may also make Ministerial office accommodation available within departmental holdings.</PARA>

<PARA>  (11) (a), (b) and (c) The back-bench entitlement provided to Senators and Members is subsumed, in the case of Ministers and certain Office-holders (including Opposition Office-holders) by their Ministerial/Office-holder entitlements and it has been the view of successive Governments that the use of departmental resources by Ministers and Office-holders, while primarily provided for official business, is not solely limited to a Minister's/ Office-holder's portfolio/official responsibilities. I would expect all Office-holders and Parliamentarians to make reasonable and commonsense judgments about the use to which their entitlements are put.</PARA>

<PARA>  *Approval was given for Messrs Staples and Duncan to each employ one Consultant in addition to their staff establishment.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, as members of Parliament, each Minister had an entitlement to three Electorate Officers.</PARA>
<PARA>  During the 35th Parliament, Ministers with combined Ministerial/electorate offices were entitled to be provided with the furniture and equipment provided to back-bench members of Parliament. Additional facilities (including postage and franking machines) and equipment in combined Ministerial/electorate offices was provided by Ministers' own departments. Records of office equipment and postage facilities provided to the Ministers listed in (12) above are held in storage by a number of departments and are not readily available. Detailed information concerning each Minister may be sought from the relevant departments.</PARA>
<PARA>  (14) See answer to (13) above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (15) The Department of Administrative Services provides official telephone services in the electorate offices of Senators and Members. Four exchange lines for voice communication are provided at official expense and an additional line serves as the data communication line for facsimile or modem. Senators and Members are expected to exercise their own judgment as to the proper use of this facility, bearing in mind the purpose for which electorate offices are provided i.e. for parliamentary or electorate business but not for party political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>  Charges for overseas voice communications from electorate offices of up to an average of 15 minutes per month are paid at official expense. The calls are to provide non-commercial assistance to constituents or otherwise undertake parliamentary business. Within the 15 minute limit, reverse charge calls may be made by a Senator or Member to their electorate office when they are travelling overseas. International access to facsimile transmissions from electorate offices for parliamentary and electorate business is at official expense.</PARA>
<PARA>  In accordance with a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal each Senator and Member is entitled to a Telecard for use when making trunk telephone calls and sending phonograms within Australia on parliamentary and electorate business. The card is not valid for reverse charge calls nor for international calls/cables nor to send telexes via the Public Telex Service operated by Telecom. Ministers and some Office-holders are provided with additional facilities for official purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>  In accordance with a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal, the Government will meet the cost of all calls and phonograms within Australia and installation, maintenance and line rental of one telephone answering machine on one home telephone service in the private residence of each Senator and Member. Senators and Members are personally responsible for meeting the costs of installation, rental of and any overseas calls, cables and phonograms charged to telephone services in their private residences.</PARA>
<PARA>  Ministers, Presiding Officers and certain Office-holders are provided with additional telephone facilities for official purposes and also with fully official home telephone services.</PARA>
<PARA>  (16) There is no objection to Senators and Members installing privately-owned equipment in electorate offices at their own expense.</PARA>
<PARA>  (17) The telephone facilities installed at official expense in electorate offices are for use by the Senator or Member and staff. As with other office equipment, it can be used for parliamentary or electorate business but not for party political purposes. Persons authorised by the Senator or Member, including volunteer workers can utilise the telephone services for the purposes outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (18) I am advised that identification of all instances where overexpenditure on entitlements has occurred during the life of the Thirty-Fifth Parliament would require the Department of Administrative Services to perform a full examination of all payments associated with entitlements between July 1987 and March 1990. In many instances overexpenditure occurs as a matter of course, an example being Senators' and Members' entitlement to home telephone services, the full costs of which are met in the first instance by my Department and the personal contribution recovered. I am not prepared to direct that my Department expend the resources required to undertake such an examination.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am advised that my Department is not aware of overexpenditure of entitlements of Senators and Members by other bodies.</PARA>

<PARA>  (3) Would the costs of this form of communication (each `video chariot' costs over $1000 to hire) expose Australian political parties to the risk of corrupt influence.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) No. The only means of communication which is restricted by the proposed Bill is the broadcasting of advertisements containing political matter as defined. News and current affairs programs will not be affected. Nor will talkback radio programs. The print media is not affected by the Bill and all other campaign methods will be unaffected.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3 and 4) The future use of `video chariots' by political parties in Australia is not quantifiable. What has been recorded however since 1984 is the level of expenditure by political parties on broadcasting and the print media for the purpose of campaign advertising. The Australian Electoral Commission figures reveal that expenditure on broadcast advertising by the four major political parties (The Labor, Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats) has risen from $5,907,015 for the 1984 election to $15,523,582 for the 1990 election. Over the same period print advertising expenditure by the same four parties rose from $2,901,173 in 1984 to $7,041,812 in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Use by the major political parties of broadcast advertising represents just under 50% of the total campaign expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA>  (3) When the Government established the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC) for the purpose of managing the industry's debt and wool stockpile, it was decided a $200 million interest free loan over two years should be facilitated as an advance on the sale of property assets. This would enable the industry to maximise the return from property sales.</PARA>
<PARA>  Under this arrangement the interest subsidy would have been paid as the AWRC took out loans which were part of the $200 million.</PARA>
<PARA>  However when the Government was required to accept a tax rate of 12 per cent, a decision was taken to provide the annual interest payment as a grant. This is, in effect, equivalent to the AWRC receiving an additional one percentage point of tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On 19 December 1990 (Hansard, page 6001) Senator Spindler asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning bank interest rate margins over the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable senator suggested that banks have been `recouping the losses caused by their own bad decisions by profiteering ... at the expense of Australian families'.</PARA>
<PARA>  Analytical work carried out by the Reserve Bank suggests that this is not the case. The Bank has estimated that, for the major banks:</PARA>
<PARA>    the return on shareholders' funds fell from 16 per cent in the first half of the 1980s to 13 per cent in the second half;</PARA>
<PARA>    the corresponding notional figures for charges to profit for bad debts relative to shareholders' funds were 2.4 and 5.1 per cent (ie, an increase of 2.7 percentage points).</PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, at least for the major banks, their profits over the 1980s fell by more than their costs of bad debts had risen.</PARA>
<PARA>  A similar picture of falling profitability emerges in recent years when the bulk of the increase in bad debt costs occurred. This is illustrated in the following table which shows the sources of the major banks' profits in 1989 and 1990 (as percentages of their total assets):</PARA>
<PARA>  1989  1990</PARA>
<PARA>    %    %</PARA>
<PARA>Net interest income  3.3    3.2</PARA>
<PARA>Fees and other income  1.7    1.7</PARA>
<PARA>Operating costs  3.1    3.1</PARA>
<PARA>Bad debt costs  0.5    0.9</PARA>
<PARA>Pre-tax profit  1.4    0.9</PARA>
<PARA>Taxes  0.5    0.3</PARA>
<PARA>After-tax profit  0.9    0.6</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable senator also suggested that banks' interest rate margins have doubled in the past few years. There are various ways of measuring margins, all of which have limitations. However, in its recent and publicly available submission to the Martin Committee of Inquiry into banking, the Reserve Bank found on the basis of its assessment of the evidence that margins in fact fell over the 1980s. One measure it looked at was net interest income as a proportion of assets. The above table shows on this basis that the major banks' margins fell slightly over 1989 and 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  Measuring banks' margins as the difference between an interest rate on a particular type of retail loan and the cost of one particular source of funds to banks ignores many factors which are important in determining the behaviour of banks' margins, including:</PARA>
<PARA>    changes in the relative proportions of low- interest and high-interest deposits, which can change the average cost of deposits to banks even in the absence of changes in quoted interest rates;</PARA>
<PARA>    lags in the effect of changes in quoted deposit interest rates on the average rates paid by banks on term deposits and longer-term certificates of deposit and bills. Depending on the average maturity of these liabilities, it can take many months for banks to reap the full benefit of a fall in quoted deposit rates;</PARA>
<PARA>    lags in the effect of quoted loan interest rates on the average rates received by banks. A large part of banks' loans is at fixed interest rates, and margins on these loans do not respond to changes in indicator lending rates until the loans are rolled over or re-negotiated. Many of the loans are initially made for three or five-year terms, but in some cases they can be for much longer;</PARA>
<PARA>    changes in the proportion of banks' loans which are non-performing, ie, earning little or no interest; and</PARA>
<PARA>    changes in the composition of banks' assets between loans and interest-bearing investments which often have lower interest returns than loans, eg, Commonwealth Government securities held to satisfy the Prime Assets Requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>  Each of these factors can cause movements in banks' margins in the absence of changes in quoted interest rates. The first point has been particularly important in recent years: between 1989 and 1990, the average proportion of high-cost deposits rosefrom 47 per cent to 56 per cent. This would have reduced  margins  by  about  0.5  percentage</PARA>
<PARA>points if there were no corresponding changes to lending rates.</PARA>
<PARA>  Increased non-performing loans have also been important in 1990; the cost to banks was equivalent to a reduction in average margins by about 0.3 of a percentage point. This factor was relevant to the temporary widening of bank margins for a time in  rates.</PARA>
<PARA>  None of this is to deny that banks have been reviewing the credit standing of individual borrowers and that some face increases in their interest rates vis-a-vis banks' indicator rates. Information available to the Reserve Bank indicates that banks have not increased their margins across the board--in fact, any increase in average margins resulting from this process has been small.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government will continue to press the banks to pass on to their borrowers the full benefits of reductions in their deposit costs consequent upon the relaxation of monetary policy that has taken place in recent times.</PARA>
