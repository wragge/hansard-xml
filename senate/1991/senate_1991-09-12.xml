<PARA> That the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes the refusal of the Government to comply with the direction contained in the Senate's resolution of Tuesday, 10 September 1991 to lay on the Table of the Senate the tape recording of the discussions held on 4 September 1991 between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and representatives of conservationist groups;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) further notes that this refusal to lay the tape on the Table is not based on any claim of executive privilege;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) is of the opinion that, subject only to reasonable claims of executive privilege, both Houses of Parliament are fully entitled to scrutinise and demand accountability for all aspects of executive behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes with great concern the Government's apparent belief that it is not accountable to the people of Australia through the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) accordingly, censures the Government for its unjustified failure to comply with the Senate's resolution of 10 September 1991; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) calls upon the Government to comply with the resolution of the Senate this day. </PARA>
<PARA>For the benefit of honourable senators who would not have notice of the details of the letter of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, which was given to the Clerk yesterday in reply to the order of the Senate, I will read that letter. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Evans</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 10 September regarding the order agreed to by the Senate yesterday relating to the tape recording of discussions held between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and representatives of the conservationist groups. </PARA>
<PARA>I have noted the text of the order and advise the Senate that the Government will not be tabling the tape recording to which it refers. </PARA>
<PARA>I would point out, however, that the Prime Minister today read to the House of Representatives a transcript of the relevant part of the recording, a copy of which is attached. </PARA>
<PARA>Attached to that letter is a quote as follows, which claims to be a transcript extract from peak conservationist organisations meeting dated 4 September 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>I've really outlined the sort of structure of the EPA,-and where that's going. I'll just go into the intergovernmental agreement. The first draft, let me tell you about, the intergovernmental agreement-as you know has emerged basically from the Prime Minister's initiative with the States and it is really crass politics, at the lowest common denominator-it is all about mainly the people who are involved in it are not the environment Ministers or their departments, they're Premiers and the bottom line for them all this is the bucks, the big dollars. They would sell their mothers for a few bucks and so the bottom line of much of this negotiation is what we-if they get what they want on transport and housing in terms of untied grants and social serv . . . security they would give us anything, if they don't they're going to make our lives a misery and that's not so very satisfactory but that's the harsh reality of it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Government's answer to the order of the Senate that it lay before the Senate a certain tape-recording. In other words, the Government refuses, and it refuses without giving any reason. There has been no claim of Crown privilege and no claim that it is a matter of national security, that it is Cabinet in confidence, that it is commercial in confidence, or whatever. It is just a blatant refusal to comply with the order of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not be at all surprised if certain Government Ministers with a reasonably long memory pricked up their ears when I read my motion earlier. They would realise that it is very much in the same terms as a motion moved in 1982 by Senator Gareth Evans when he was shadow Attorney-General. At that time apparently Senator Gareth Evans believed that the Executive was responsible to the Parliament and that the Senate was fully entitled to scrutinise and demand accountability for all aspects of Executive behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> One might wonder what has changed. What has changed is simply power. Senator Gareth Evans is now in power, and his attitude to the responsibility of the Executive to the Parliament has changed. It is not politically expedient for the Government to provide this tape because it could be politically embarrassing, so it simply disregards the order of the Senate. That is unsatisfactory, and in my submission this Senate has no alternative, therefore, but to move this censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is undoubtedly an important issue, and I will get to it in a moment. However, the question of new federalism, to which the tapes relate, is also important. There is a feeling by some that perhaps the issue at stake, other than that of the responsibility of the Executive to the Parliament, is not of the same consequence as some of the previous orders that have been made over the years. That is not so. We all know that, in a situation where there are about one million Australians unemployed, this country requires major structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA> One area of structural reform that everyone accepts is the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, so that there can be a more efficient administration in both. It has been promoted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and we accept that. If, however, a senior Minister of the Crown says to conservation groups that the Prime Minister is not serious, that the Prime Minister is simply engaging in a political game, that he is simply engaging in crass politics, that is a serious matter because it demonstrates to the people of Australia that this Government is not serious about restructuring the relationship between the States and the Commonwealth in the way it claims that it desires to do. Therefore, the determination by Minister Kelly, as she put to these conservation leaders, that the Prime Minister is about crass politics is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We are entitled to be concerned because we have on the record so many examples where t his Prime Minister, despite there being one million people unemployed in this country, still believes that he has some God-given right to rule and that he is beyond reproach and beyond question. That should never be allowed to occur. In recent times we have had examples of how cynically he regards the Australian people, no better demonstrated than by the conspiracy between him and Mr Keating to deceive the Australian people at the last election. He lied to the Australian people about their intentions as to who would remain Prime Minister after the election. </PARA>
<PARA> We are entitled to be concerned. The Australian people are entitled to be concerned because they have had it demonstrated time and time again that this Prime Minister will play whatever political tricks are necessary to remain in government. Here it appears that he is playing another one, because Minister Kelly advised senior conservation leaders that this new federalism is simply a game of crass politics. That is the way it was interpreted by a number of the major conservation leaders present at the meeting. There is one simple way in which the matter can be resolved forever, and that is by the Government doing the right thing-putting the tape on the table and letting the people of Australia have the opportunity to peruse it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all that is being asked. One must wonder again and again why the Government will not comply with that requirement. What is unreasonable about the people of Australia being entitled to hear the tape and determine who is telling the truth: the leaders of the conservation movement who have been defamed by Minister Kelly, or Minister Kelly? Why is she continuing to refuse to do that, to clarify the matter and let the people make a judgment? One can only suspect the reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the important question of the merits of the case, there is the even more important question of this Government's decision blatantly and deliberately to undermine the democratic structure by rejecting the request of the Senate to table this document. As I said, this is an arrogant Government which puts itself above the responsibility that it has to the people, through the Parliament. Ministers are not directly elected by the people. It is the Parliament that is elected. The safeguard is the right of the Parliament to pass orders and for the Executive to comply with such orders. This is an unquestioned principle of the Constitution which, as I said, Senator Evans was pleased to propound in this place in 1982. It is a principle which this Government follows when it is politically expedient for it to do so. To this Government, such a matter is a nuisance. The Parliament itself is a nuisance-it is a distraction. But we will never allow that to be the case. The Senate has passed its order; and that order of the Senate must be complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Executive assumes an authority beyond that of the Parliament-that is, those members directly elected by the people-a cornerstone of our constitutional democracy is threatened. That is why the refusal to comply with an order of the Senate is in fact a rarity. You might be interested to know, Mr President, that over 20 orders have been passed by the Senate. On only two occasions was the order not complied with. The Government should take into account why, with only two exceptions since Federation, governments normally have complied with such orders. They do so because they recognise that they owe a responsibility to the Parliament. They recognise that if they disregard the Parliament they will be undermining a cornerstone of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years there has been a whole range of orders covering all sorts of matters. The first one in 1924 related to forest products. Another in 1931 related to correspondence between the then Government and the Commonwealth Bank. Another in 1931 related to correspondence between the Labor Party and the then Acting Prime Minister. Again in 1931 there was an order relating to correspondence in respect of Jervis Bay. I will not read them all. But the point I want to make is that the orders relate to a range of different issues covering matters of varying importance. Whether they go to the most vital matter of national interest or otherwise, the practice of government has been to accept that the structure of the Constitution will work only if it respects the dignity of the Parliament-if it respects and duly complies with the orders of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, there have been only two exceptions to the orders being complied with-one in 1975 and the other in 1982. In 1975 the Senate called before it departmental officers to answer questions relating to the Khemlani loan affair. Those departmental officers claimed crown privilege. An impasse developed and the matter was never resolved. There was then a double dissolution, an election was held and the then Government was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> The other instance was in 1982. As I indicated a moment or two ago, Senator Evans brought an action before the Senate which related to the production of legal opinions that concerned bottom of the harbour cases. In the first instance, the Government of the day complied with that by tabling a whole series of documents that Senator Evans required. But it was not prepared to do so in the case of certain legal opinions because it claimed that they had crown privilege. I remind the Senate that, according to Senator Button's letter, there is no issue of crown privilege in what this Government has said today. There is no claim of any justification at all. As I said, in 1982 the Government of the day claimed crown privilege in relation to legal documents and legal opinions. That is not an unusual course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you might like to know what Senator Evans said about the responsibility of government to the Parliament in these instances. I refer to the Hansard of 8 September 1982 in which Senator Evans said that it was important that these documents be tabled to enable the Parliament and the community as a whole to form its own view. This is exactly what we have said today. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The only way that blame can begin to be established and rightly located is by the tabling of all the information, all the relevant documents, that will enable an even better judgment to be made of the situation than we have been able to make so far. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that access to these documents will enable, if not the whole truth to emerge finally, at least us to get some distance down that particular track. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will be surprised to learn that Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have chosen the path of moderation and reasonableness. </PARA>
<PARA>In that instance, it was regarded by Senator Evans to be both moderate and reasonable that the Senate should expect those documents, in the same way that it is more than moderate and reasonable that the Senate be entitled to this tape in the public interest today. He continued, and repeated time and time again-occasionally he can be repetitious:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in order that we and the public at large can better form a view as to where the blame lies, where the merits lie and where the truth lies in this matter . . . the documents must be produced. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, exactly the same position exists today. The Senate is entitled to this document in this instance. Papers, by practice of the Senate, have included tapes. It is in the public interest that the public be entitled to learn where the truth lies in this particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA> What did Senator Evans do at the end of that process when he was unsuccessful in getting those documents? He moved a censure motion, as I said, in terms almost identical to what the Opposition is moving today. He was overtaken in that instance by an election. The issue was never finally resolved. What we demand today is exactly as Senator Evans demanded in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate made an order two days ago. The Government has failed to comply with that order. It has made no claim of Executive privilege. Even if the Government had made a claim of Executive privilege, we would, consistent with our long held view and consistent with the authorities as contained in Odgers, say that it is ultimately for the Senate to decide whether the stand of Executive privilege should be upheld or not. This, as I said, was simply an arrogant refusal of this Government to comply. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has tabled part of a transcript which clearly can be read in exactly the way the conservationists have said it should be read. The letters tabled by Minister Kelly in the House of Representatives yesterday did not contradict that point of view. It was the view of four conservationists that Minister Kelly was saying that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was indulging in nothing more than crass politics. We heard it also from the spokesman for Greenpeace this morning-the same interpretation of what Minister Kelly said. Of course, it would not be surprising if that is what she was saying because she supports Mr Keating in the leadership contest. It is in her interests to undermine the position of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said a moment ago, the only way the people of Australia can know for certain is by listening to the tape. If Minister Kelly is innocent there is one simple way in which she can demonstrate it. While she refuses, one must suspect that she has no faith in the Prime Minister's federalism initiative. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the interjection from Senator Collins. If he had been in the chamber the other day he would know that we rehearsed very adequately the reasons why this was not a private meeting. This, indeed, was very much a public meeting. It was a meeting between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and representatives of peak councils which represent many tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of Australians. It goes also very much to the matter of whether it was a private meeting or not that here we have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), not the Minister for the environment, negotiating with the State governments in relation to the management of the Australian environment. It is a very important area of decision making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those reasons we believe that the public have a right to know that the public interest supersedes any considerations that this was indeed a private meeting. We are particularly pleased that the Opposition's motion is aimed fairly and squarely at the Government, and not in this case at Minister Kelly. We accept the arguments that Senator Hill has advanced in relation to privilege and the clauses in his motion which precede clause 5 censuring the Government for its unjustified failure to comply with the Senate resolution of 10 September. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter before us from Senator Button is an incredibly arrogant letter. Clearly, he is speaking on behalf of the Government. He is not speaking just as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but also as a very important Government representative. He is saying that the Government simply refuses an order of the Senate. I repeat the claim made by Senator Hill a few moments ago that this Senate is composed of people directly elected by the people of Australia. We are a representative chamber. We are responsible directly to the people of Australia. This Government, which is not directly elected by the people of Australia, is thumbing its nose at the directly elected chamber of the Senate and refusing to release the tape-recording. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill has already reflected on the words of the very partial transcript that has been released by the Government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tiny fragment of what must have been a much longer dialogue between the Minister and the representatives of those peak conservation bodies. It is quite clear that a partial transcript cannot give one a flavour of the whole dialogue that occurred at that meeting. Moreover, it is also quite clear that depending upon where the emphasis is put on these words, they are open to the interpretation either that the State Premiers and State governments were indulging in crass politics or, indeed, that the Prime Minister himself was engaging in crass politics and that the whole process of new federalism was an exercise in crass politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the words are punctuated in the partial transcript that we have, they read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . basically from the Prime Minister's initiative with the States and it is really crass politics,-</PARA>
<PARA>The clear reading of those words, in my view, is that Minister Kelly was reflecting on the Prime Minister's moves in this area of new federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will know from yesterday's debate, the Democrats are particularly concerned about the substantive issue of the protection of the Australian environment under this pattern of new federalism. Yesterday, senators learned-almost certainly from Senator Richardson's remarks-that the Government is moving into an area of changing the management of the Australian environment; that that move is being led by the Prime Minister and his officers; and that Minister Kelly and the Department of the Environment have no handle on that process at all. Surely that issue is of vital concern to the Australian people. They have a right to know what is going on and how their environment is to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in my speech yesterday, all the recent surveys of Australian public opinion indicate a very high level of concern by the Australian public for a better protection of the Australian environment. All those surveys indicate that the public want the Federal Government to use its powers more comprehensively-powers which indeed it has used in the past-but it seems from the draft of the intergovernmental agreement which we already have, the fourth draft, that the Federal Government is moving to tie its own hands and not exercise those powers in the ways in which both it and the Opposition have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter of public interest. That is a matter which should be rightly brought before the Senate chamber. That is a matter on which the tape recording of the meeting between Minister Kelly and the peak environment groups is relevant. That is a matter which goes to the heart of the question of whether the Government has a right to withhold that information from the properly elected Senate. Accordingly, we very strongly support this motion moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 of the motion calls upon the Government to comply with the resolution of the Senate, and we note the arrogance of this Government in not having complied with that resolution of the Senate; the arrogance of Minister Button in writing that very terse note to the Senate in which he simply refuses, as the motion before us says, to provide any substantive grounds as to why that tape should not be provided to the Senate. Again, as Senator Hill has said, even if grounds had been provided, it would be up to the Senate to determine whether those grounds were adequate, legal and justifiable or not. But no grounds whatsoever have been provided in this very brief and terse note from Minister Button. Accordingly, we have very great pleasure in supporting this motion moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this motion and congratulate Senator Coulter on a most interesting and convincing contribution. I have disagreed with Senator Coulter many times in the past, but I agree totally with what he had to say today. I would like to deal very briefly with some very significant points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, it must be recognised that what appears to be an inconsequential matter of whether a tape recording reveals that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Hon. Ros Kelly, described Mr Hawke's cooperative federalism as crass politics may not be regarded as a terribly serious matter, I suppose, by those people who are accustomed to Ministers of this Government telling deliberate, total falsehoods. There is nothing unusual about it. I suppose some people are asking: why are we getting so excited about yet another deliberate lie from a Government Minister? The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has admitted to lying, so some people might say that there is not much significance in this matter. But there is, because in the Government's determination not to allow the truth to emerge it has determined to confront the Senate and to deny the authority of an elected parliament. This is not the House of Representatives challenging the Senate; this is the Executive Government challenging the Senate. We have to ask: why is it so significant? Why is Kellygate of such massive importance that the Government is prepared to challenge the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA> The principle of privacy was raised in a quaint interjection by Senator Collins. It followed the nonsensical speech Senator Richardson made the other day on this topic. There is one vital matter that Senator Richardson and the Government have to face up to: the principle of privacy-a very important principle, indeed-is totally breached if a private meeting is held and a party to that private meeting then misrepresents what happened at that meeting to the public. That breaches totally the principle of privacy. That is what this Minister did. She breached the principle of privacy which she now seeks to hide behind by telling complete untruths about what happened there. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservationists who were there have in a united way revealed the extent to which Mrs Kelly misled the public about what happened at that meeting. It was not just a question about crass politics, but it was also a question about objections; it was on another ground. There has been no denial by Mrs Kelly that what the conservationists have now said is absolutely right; that she breached the privacy of that meeting by telling untruths about the extent of opposition from the conservation movement to the draft of that proposal, the Prime Minister's proposal. The privacy having been breached, the Minister is now desperately trying to clothe herself with the protection that she herself destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> This nonsense that Senator Richardson has been going on about, the sanctity of privacy, is absolute and utter bunkum. Apparently it is all right for the Government's Minister to have a meeting in private and then tell lies about the outcome and not be prepared to put up with the other people who were at that meeting saying, `No, that is not what happened at all'. That totally removes from the discussion this phoney issue of it being a private matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What is absolutely central to this particular matter is that when the Prime Minister agreed to reveal a transcript of a small section of 30 seconds out of three hours of the meeting, it was significant that the other people who were there have not come forward to say, `My memory must have been wrong'. The Government did not produce that in the House of Representatives yesterday. People have not resiled, as I understand it, from their position. If that is so, it underlines the question one must ask about how real, how accurate, how correct, that 30 seconds is in conveying what really happened in those three hours of the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> That extract is capable of being interpreted as total support for what the conservationists are saying. It is capable of being interpreted in lots of ways. It is totally incoherent. If it is an expression of the Minister's thinking, God help the environment and Australia. It is full of sentences that begin by being somewhat vague and end by being even vaguer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that Senator Robert Ray demonstrated to us very strongly the day before yesterday why there is a huge difference between a transcript and a tape. He was even prepared to accuse me of lying when I inadvertently said that someone from the Prime Minister's office had heard a little bit of the tape when, in fact, that person had read a little bit of the transcript. On our side we assume those to be the same in terms of substance. Theoretically there is no difference. As far as we are concerned there is no difference between a transcript and a tape because they are matters of substance that are the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray does not think so. He accused me of lying by saying that someone had listened to the tape instead of saying that the person had read the transcript. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, this clearly indicates that there is a huge difference between a tape and a transcript because transcripts can either be fiddled with or a tiny extract, like 30 seconds, can be taken from a tape which distorts the meaning which would be evident when one listened to the tape as a whole. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald's interjection about something being deleted raises questions about this Kellygate affair. To what extent are these Nixon-type tapes, anyway? Why is the Government not revealing them? We have already seen, by allowing the transcript to come out, that there is stuff that is clearly offensive to the State Premiers that undermines-and deliberately so-the Prime Minister's relationship with the States, which is essential if his policy of cooperative federalism is to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly's discussion about the State Premiers with the conservationists clearly does nothing to help the Prime Minister's relationship with them on this sensitive issue. It is aimed at undermining the Prime Minister's relationship with the Premiers. We can see that from the response of the State Premiers. `The emperor strikes back', said Mr Greiner. Labor Premiers are refusing to give a response to it because they are not going to credit it as something worthy of a response. </PARA>
<PARA> If the full tape is not to be revealed, I wonder how many other insults are in it. I wonder how many expletives have been deleted. I wonder how Nixonian Kellygate really is. In the end, I should let the Government know that the Nixon tapes eventually did undo President Nixon. I wonder how undone Mrs Kelly will be when this tape eventually emerges. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt from the tape that Mrs Kelly's views of Mr Hawke's cooperative federalism are clearly antagonistic, no matter how one interprets her comment, and I quote from the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA>The first draft, let me tell you, the intergovernmental agreement-as you know has emerged basically from the Prime Minister's initiative with the States and it is really crass politics, at the lowest common denominator-</PARA>
<PARA>Full stop. The situation that has been created has been created by the Prime Minister. It has emerged `basically from the Prime Minister's initiative . . . it is really crass politics'. In other words, as to the system the Prime Minister has developed, Mrs Kelly now says, `Oh, I only meant that they would misuse it'. Even if we take her interpretation of this messy bit of semantics, she is saying that the Prime Minister has been foolish enough to create a hopeless situation in which the Premiers can play crass politics at the expense of the environment. </PARA>

She is part of the campaign to destroy the Prime Minister and she is using the environment as yet another weapon in that campaign to get rid of the Prime Minister and replace him with Mr Keating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite frankly, she can use in her internal battles what methods she likes. When those methods come out into the public arena, when they cause concern and in fact upset a large part of the population, when they create doubt in the minds of people as to what the Government's policy really is-is it the Kelly policy or is it the Hawke policy-then the Parliament and the people have a right to know what really happened at that expletive-deleted meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a disgrace that this Government is prepared to protect this Minister because of these internal dissensions and because of the need to make certain that the waters remain as unruffled as possible. If the Prime Minister did what he should do and sacked this Minister, there would be repercussions in the battle for the leadership. There is no basis of principle on which this Government is keeping this secret. The Government has something to hide. It must reveal it. </PARA>

If one goes past that, two other events yesterday, which were much more important, prompted the Opposition into action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first was Question Time. Every report of Question Time suggests that Dr Hewson and Mr Chaney were very much the losers; they did very poorly. The Press Gallery sat there and watched but did something that the Liberals really could not forgive: the Press Gallery asked some questions of Mr Chaney, the reaction to which suggests that yesterday was probably the low point of Mr Chaney's career. All the momentum that the Opposition was allegedly building up disappeared yesterday. It did very badly indeed. So here today the Opposition is trying to concoct a crisis. Sadly for those opposite, there just is not one, and no number of speeches can create it. </PARA>
<PARA> First, we should deal with the legalities. We are not here dealing with a question of constitutional law but merely a question of constitutional practice. We have the Senate demanding the release of a tape by a person in another place and we have the House of Representatives refusing to pass the same motion. I quote from Erskine and May. I think the quote is pretty clear. It says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was coming to the crux of this quote from Erskine May:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Hence it is that neither House can claim, much less exercise, any authority over a member of the other-</PARA>
<PARA>So while the Senate can pass censure motions against the Government and demand that Mrs Kelly produce the tape, there is no way that it can enforce those resolutions. What we are indulging in here is not an issue of constitutional law or constitutional practice but, rather, to quote a phrase oft heard in the last few days, an exercise in crass politics-the crassest of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review. One would not refer to the Australian Financial Review as a socialist rag or a mouthpiece of the Australian Labor Party, but its editorial does have some interesting points. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>But by blunting and repelling the Opposition's main attack, the Government has placed itself in a position to turn the attack back, and to argue that the Opposition has indulged in a trivial and time-wasting pursuit. . . . But to concentrate, as the Opposition has over the past week, on what has turned out to be a bit of colourful language by one politician talking about other politicians, and to make the ridiculous suggestion that there was a real constitutional issue at stake, is plain silly. </PARA>
<PARA>That sums up this issue. The citizens of Australia must regard this as one of the great yawns of our time. I am particularly disappointed in Senator Coulter's contribution, because Senator Coulter appears to have taken a position on whether this meeting was private which runs contrary to almost every person who has attended that meeting or the other meetings of the peak councils during the last four years. As the Minister who presided over them for three years, I can assure Senator Coulter, the Senate and anyone else who may be listening, if they are unfortunate enough to be doing so, that those meetings have always been private. They were structured in that way in the first place. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mrs Kelly did not make them public. The difficulty Senator Coulter and all Opposition senators face in this matter is that there is no question not only that they have been private in the past but also that they remain so. If we want to look for the sources of that, they are not too hard to find. Firstly, I quote from Don Henry, the Director of the World Wide Fund for Nature:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>World Wide Fund for Nature Australia believes that the privacy of Peak Conservation Group Meetings should be respected. It has been our understanding in the past that no formal transcript of the meeting has been made, rather, that a listing of action points from the meeting is developed. </PARA>
<PARA>We have no doubt where the World Wide Fund for Nature stands on the question. If one then looks at the Australian Council of National Trusts, we have a letter signed by Duncan Marshall of that organisation and by Harry Barber for the Conservation Council of Victoria which, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Council of National Trusts and Conservation Council of Victoria write to support a call for all parties to respect the privacy of Peak Conservation Group meetings. </PARA>
<PARA>The above groups are participants in Peak meetings. These meetings occur regularly and involve discussions with Ministers, Shadow Ministers and other parliamentarians. </PARA>

If he has that view, I am quite happy for him to express it. He has gone silent. Is that not a shock and a surprise? There is then correspondence here from the Australian Conservation Foundation, in which Phillip Toyne expresses his strong support for the continuation of those meetings to be conducted on a private and confidential basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the matter does not end there. Senator Coulter really has placed himself at odds with the conservation movement on this question. I quote Rosie Crisp, the Coordinator of the Queensland Conservation Council, who of course was a participant in the meeting:</PARA>
<PARA>Well obviously the meeting that was held with the Minister and conservationists was a private meeting . . . these are regular meetings that are held with the Minister and the discussion is very open and honest and frank and it is a private discussion. </PARA>
<PARA>There are not simply one or two people saying this, but a whole raft of people saying that it is a private meeting. As the person who convened them for three years, I assure honourable senators that that was always the case. </PARA>

The privacy of those meetings was respected for all of those three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparently in this exercise of crass politics, there is a suggestion that Mrs Kelly has in some way-I cannot quite understand the way myself-attacked the Prime Minister. If one reads the press this morning, there cannot be any doubt in its mind that the extract from the tape does suggest that she did not attack the Prime Minister but did attack the Premiers. In fact, various newspapers quote the Premiers' reactions to Mrs Kelly's words. The Premiers, from Mr Bannon to Mr Greiner, were not in any doubt about who got criticised, and they have responded as one might expect them to respond if they have been criticised. Let us look at the words of Rodney Falconer on AM on 11 September this week. </PARA>

Perhaps it might not be ordinarily appropriate for a tape of a private meeting to be brought into the public domain. But let us not forget this one fact: the matter in question is already in the public domain. How can anybody honestly say that this was a private meeting when the contents of the meeting-the matter in question-have been spread throughout the newspapers, over radio and television? And this Government has the audacity to come before the Senate and say, `But it is still a private meeting'!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For Senator Richardson's benefit, I will quote from the Australian. He obviously did not get around to reading the Australian today. Referring to Minister Kelly's refusal to make the tape available on the grounds that it was a private meeting, Glenn Milne said:</PARA>
<PARA> Her excuse for not doing so amounted to a legal fiction. Kelly claimed the meeting was private and should remain so. This was a meeting, the contents of which had already been published on the front page of the Weekend Australian, an account that included confirmation by three green representatives present at the September 4 meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a meeting that Kelly discussed with the Prime Minister the same morning when he interrupted his racing tips to call her from Sydney's Ramada Renaissance hotel to check what she had actually said. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the argument that it was a private meeting. The matter is in the public domain and it is therefore important, if we are to have any confidence in this Minister, in this Government and in the honour and integrity of the Executive, that the whole of the tape be produced. The questions that now arise go right to the heart of Minister Kelly's ability to discharge her duties as a member of the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Richardson also tried the line, contradictory to his first argument, that we could get the tapes under the Freedom of Information Act. This Senate, in passing the Freedom of Information Act, never intended to abrogate its powers under Standing Orders to an item of legislation. The Freedom of Information Act was always supplementary to the powers of the Senate that have remained and remain to this day. In raising that foolish freedom of information argument on Tuesday, Senator Richardson showed what a poor grasp he has of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill said, there are some 20 precedents of motions calling on the Government to table documents. These are perhaps instructive for Senator Richardson and his colleagues on the other side of the chamber. For example, on 19 March 1931 a resolution was passed requiring the production of all papers in connection with an increase of duty on oregon and, in particular, letters from the secretary to the executive of the South Australian branch of the Labor Party, addressed respectively to the Acting Prime Minister and to the Prime Minister, to be laid upon the table of the Library. </PARA>
<PARA> This clearly shows that this Labor Party that occupies the Government benches is trying an old stunt. It is trying to do what it tried to do before; but at least the Labor Party of 1931 had a sense of integrity and decency and knew that it had to comply with an order of the Senate when it was made. This Labor Party, this pathetic excuse for what once may have been a great Party, does not have the integrity, the honesty and the courage to comply with an order of the Senate. It treats this Senate with contempt, and for that it should be condemned. That is why we have moved this censure motion against the Government today. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Richardson might also be interested to know that in 1982 the Labor Party Opposition asked for the production of papers. Perhaps Senator Richardson may be enlightened to know that his colleague, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), had no difficulties about requiring the production of highly confidential documents-documents which were much more confidential than these because they related to legal advices on pending court cases. Yet, this Government refuses to make available a tape of a meeting, the contents of which are already public, upon the ludicrous argument that the meeting was private. Senator Richardson clearly does not know what he is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson came into this chamber and selectively quoted from Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice. Senator Richardson said that there was an equality between both Houses of parliament and that neither House could exercise authority over a member of the other House. Erskine May may well say that. But did Senator Richardson tell us what Erskine May said on page 433? No, he did not. For Senator Richardson's information, Erskine May said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been admitted that a document which has been cited-</PARA>
<PARA>and goodness knows how many times this document has been cited-</PARA>
<PARA>ought to be laid upon the table of the House, if it can be done without injury to the public interests. </PARA>
<PARA>I submit that the production of this tape is not only not contrary to the public interest but is directly in promotion of the public interest so that we can see the disgraceful and shameful way in which this Government conducts itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Richardson, in putting the spurious argument that the Senate could not order the Government to produce a document, overlooks the fact that in 1982 his good friend and colleague Senator Evans in fact moved a motion calling upon Senator Chaney, as Minister representing the then Attorney-General, to table documents here in the Senate. Senator Richardson cannot even go back and get it right in regard to what his mate Senator Evans did in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a difference, too, between a member of the House of Representatives and this Government. What the Senate is doing is calling upon the Government to comply with an order of the Senate. Senator Richardson cannot get away with his ludicrous argument that there is some sort of executive privilege. The fact is that the only privilege that this Government can claim is the privilege of its own arrogance in believing that it is not accountable to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a very clear case of what is and is not executive privilege was decided by the High Court of Australia in 1978. I refer to the Sankey v. Whitlam case. </PARA>

What harm could be done to the public interest by finding out whether or not Mrs Kelly is a Minister of integrity? I would have thought that if Mrs Kelly were a Minister of integrity, it would be in the public interest to table the documents. But this Government does not think so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the final word on the matter came from a President of the Senate on 22 November 1978. In relation to the production of documents and the question of executive privilege, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I go no further than to express the view that the Senate would no doubt take the recent High Court judgment into consideration in reaching any decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Replying generally, the questions involve matters which are ultimately for the Senate to decide in the regulation of its own proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate for the Senate to decide these matters. It is within the power of the Senate to decide these matters. It is within the power of the Senate to order this disgraceful, dishonest and disgusting Government to comply with the principles of representative government, to comply with the principles of parliamentary duty and to table the tapes that this Senate and the people of Australia demand to know about. </PARA>

All I am saying is that, as a matter of reality in this chamber and the other place, that is the way the system operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In spite of that reality and things being as they are, the situation is that the Senate has passed a motion and made an order which must be treated very seriously. The fact of the matter is that the tapes have not been laid on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that it is proper in certain circumstances for the Senate and the House of Representatives to make orders for the production of tapes. Everybody has agreed that the public interest is a significant consideration in deciding whether or not a particular tape or a particular piece of evidence should be produced. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this chamber makes decisions on the basis of what is in the public interest. I would like to give an example of where this chamber in recent times has decided that it would be wrong for people to reveal what went on during a meeting. As a result of the content of a particular meeting being revealed in this chamber, a system has been adopted under which the word `isolated' appears when the recording equipment has been turned off. This situation arose because some time ago Senator Schacht revealed the content of a meeting attended by people who were interested in preserving early life. I would have thought that meeting was a public meeting in the sense that people from all parties were in attendance. Even though the meeting was broadcast over the system, people, in my view properly, took exception to the fact that what was said was revealed in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether a matter ought to be revealed seems to me to be an issue. In the matter I have just referred to, the other side was saying that the contents of the meeting should not have been revealed, and Senator Chris Schacht-a man of tender emotions, a person very easily hurt-was subject to some criticism which I do not think he has ever recovered from. </PARA>

He says that, as long as there is a formality which is defined by half the Senate or more than half the Senate, whatever goes on should be made public. No doubt diaries were made by the people who were at the meeting. I think it is wrong for the Senate or for this Parliament to compel people who have gone to private meetings or public meetings to put forward their diaries or any notes that they made about a meeting that has taken place. That gets us to an absurd situation. All of us keep thoughts in our head. That is what the Opposition will be after next. It will want to know what our real thoughts are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can I follow that through and see where we get to? There is a public statement by Mrs Kelly as to what happened at the meeting; there is a public statement by the others as to what happened.

<PARA> Honourable senators have quoted Odgers. The sixth edition of Odgers Australian Senate Practice states:</PARA>
<PARA>The sixth edition contends that the Executive Government enjoys no privilege which puts it above Parliament-</PARA>

<PARA>I agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Any recognition of Executive privilege, as an unchallengeable right, to deny information to Parliament, is inconsistent with that fundamental principle. </PARA>

<PARA>It is not the Parliament that has called for this; it is the Senate. One cannot identify the Senate as the Parliament.

The Opposition cannot produce any evidence to impugn the reputation of Minister Kelly who, at this point in time, has the ability to stand tall as a Minister, as a person and as a member of parliament. By going on a fishing expedition the Opposition hopes that it will find something whereby it can embarrass Mrs Kelly and the Government. We should not tolerate that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter that has been pointed out to me is that-and everybody agreed that it was a private meeting, although my argument is that it does not matter whether it was or it was not-the only person who said that it was not a private meeting was Phil Gilding, who was not at the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> From the speakers who follow me, honourable senators will hear whatever evidence there is to impugn Mrs Kelly. No doubt they will be able to lay some reasonable basis on which one can say that the public interest requires us to produce those documents-something above and beyond the proposition that, if we had a look, we would be able to find something. If one looked at anybody's private papers one would probably be able to find something about that person. But that is not how we should operate in this House because that leads to a complete injustice. </PARA>
<PARA> On that point, it is not in this country that the Parliament is supreme. The real proposition is that the rule of law is supreme. One of the great propositions in the rule of law under the Westminster system under which we operate in the Commonwealth is that persons are entitled to preserve their reputation of innocence and their integrity unless some evidence can be produced to show that they should be diminished in some way. Only when that evidence is produced can we look to furthering that material, not as the Opposition is doing here; that is, making the allegation that there is something on those tapes, and then going on a fishing expedition and hoping against hope-because that is what it would be-that it will find something on the tape. </PARA>

At the end of the day, Senator Cooney knows what the responsibilities of the Executive are. He understands that either House of Parliament is entitled-as this one has done-to resolve that certain matters be put before it and that the obligation of the Executive is to account to that House of Parliament, not to treat it with contempt and not to say, `We will not comply.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go back to the 1982 episode. At that time Senator Chaney, on behalf of the Government in the Senate, put the proposition that those documents should not be released because it was not in the interests of the administration of justice and might well have prejudiced the private affairs of those whose taxation details might have been disclosed and that there was a good and proper reason in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not heard one skerrick of a defence along those lines-not Executive privilege, not commercial-in-confidence and, if one looks at what Senator Richardson did the other day, not even a decent freedom of information defence. I would have thought that the moment the Government put in a request it would be insulted if it was told that there was a need for an internal review. The Government ought to look at the Minister, take his word at face value and hand over the tape. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too much longer before we get the true details of this sordid affair. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a public interest here. In many respects the interest lies in knowing whether the Greens have been defamed by the Minister and, indeed, in knowing what the real agenda is all about. In that regard, I think it is perfectly plain what the real agenda item ought to be. It is whether Mrs Kelly is speaking with a forked tongue; whether she is, on the one hand, publicly accepting her responsibility of Cabinet solidarity and, therefore, supporting new federalism or, on the other hand, privately bagging it and telling the Greens that this is all the fault of those sordid Premiers or, indeed, a Prime Minister who is forcing her into it. The issue is whether we have a Government and a Minister who are singing the same song. If the Government thinks that the public is not interested in knowing whether these matters are real or false it does not have much of a concept of the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not even bother with Senator Faulkner. Senator Richardson quoted Erskine and May. There is no such publication. All of us know that it is Erskine May-first name Erskine, last name May. But no, even a brief stint at law school before he was given the chop was not sufficient for him to understand how important that book on parliamentary practice is. That is about the best that we can get from the Government in terms of an analysis of the issues. It is perfectly clear that Senator Richardson's self-serving justification ought not to be taken at face value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is extraordinary to ask when this document was first claimed to be private. Is it really private to call together a meeting of all those groups around the country which have a vital interest in an issue and not say anything to them beforehand; not say, `Righto, chaps, off the record, without prejudice' and tell them not to say a word to their friends and relatives? Is it really a private meeting if we do not say any of that but just call them in, away they go, and at the end of the meeting-or maybe seven days later-say, `By the way, don't say a word to anyone'? That is how it works. </PARA>
<PARA> Suddenly we have this defence trotted out that this was all off the record. But was it? The Greens were all over the front page of the Weekend Australian telling us chapter and verse, backing it up with the minutes of the meeting, and demonstrating what they say was a very important contradiction between Minister Kelly's public position and her private stance. Then we have all this other self-serving nonsense about how this is private and somehow something that no-one should breathe a word about. If we took that at face value, what would be the logical consequence? No-one would release a word of it. What did we have yesterday? They came along with a self-serving selected extract from the very document they claim is private. In other words, because it suits their political advantage after they got such thrashing in the media over the last few days--</PARA>

Is privacy defined as releasing those parts that help me, irrespective of whether they damage someone else? Is privacy a question of deciding, `There are words here which might somehow get me off the hook politically, which might be able to turn the tide for a day or two, so we will breach our self-proclaimed notion of privacy and trot out a few garbled and equivocal words'?-I would have thought that, if anything, would dig Minister Kelly in even deeper. They make it perfectly clear that she is fundamentally opposed to new federalism. Whatever she chooses now to say about crass politics, she is bucketing those who adhere to it. If the Government wants to pretend she is bucketing the Premiers, let it do so, but who did the deal with the Premiers? The Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

If the Premiers are to be criticised by the Minister for espousing new federalism, for all those base reasons, such as being interested in selling their grandmothers for a quid and all these other disgraceful notions, what is to be said about the other party to the agreement? Why did he go along with it? Should he still adhere to it? The Government cannot have it both ways.</PARA></TALK.START>

She is probably taking her riding orders from those who were trotting out notes to her in the House the other day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One is entitled to have a bit of a chat, but I would have thought a Minister was able to defend herself. Really and truly-to have to rely on a piece of paper from a failed leadership pretender! Of course, Senator Richardson is going down with him, so I can understand his concern. Clearly, if that is the sort of position Minister Kelly gets herself into, it is quite understandable that she should be squirming in the way she has been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite cannot pretend for a moment that this is not linked to the leadership. They will remember the way in which Senator Richardson managed to beat this whole thing up to the point where Mr Keating actually had a run. What was the great tactic? Go around the countryside denying that there is any such thing on the agenda, supposedly hosing it all down by telling people that there is not an issue, that all these rumours are nonsense, the whole time upping the ante, getting people more and more excited and creating an environment in which somebody can actually have a go. They had a go and they are still going-out the back door. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, what Mrs Kelly is on about is taking this sort of advice to new heights; that is, getting out there and allowing something to swing for some days to create all the fuss and bother. If the Government was fair dinkum, why would it not have released even that selected piece of the transcript on day one? Why choose to do it now? It has been done purely to try to deflect all the odium that is attaching to this indefensible position. I would have thought the very least we are entitled to in this chamber is a proper explanation of why the Government takes the line it does. </PARA>
<PARA> Even taking Senator Cooney's position at its highest, the very least Senator Button could have done was to say, `Dear Sir, you cannot have the document because it is not in the public interest'. I would have thought that was a pretty poor defence-Senator Cooney certainly would not charge for drafting it-but at least it would have offered some sort of explanation. We did not even get that. We got no justification at all-a studied contempt, a degree of arrogance I would have thought was quite breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indicative of this Government's determination to tough it out, to provide what information it wants to the Parliament, or to either House, on its terms. If that is not the very antithesis of parliamentary democracy, if that is not flying in the face of those principles that failed law students and others think are important, it would seem that this Government does not even understand the basis on which it occupies the benches opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever there were a clear-cut case of a government being in an indefensible position, of choosing on its own terms to be selective and ignore all the precedents and practice of this chamber, it is this one. The motion we are considering today, and which I commend the Democrats for supporting, simply makes it clear that there are rights, responsibilities and obligations on the Executive and individual Ministers to be accountable. At the very least, the Government should come into this chamber via Ministers of the crown and provide a decent explanation for the conduct it adopts. But we have had none of that. We have simply had a thumbing of their collective nose at this chamber and this Parliament. That is what we are condemning today. </PARA>

There is no question that this tape or the transcript of it will finally be produced. It will be produced under a freedom of information order or by an order of a court or, ultimately, by this chamber. The facts that this tape will reveal will certainly become public in the not too distant future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought it was sad to listen to this debate and to listen to the performance by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and his supporters as to why this particular document should not be produced today.

<PARA> We listened carefully to the Minister, Senator Cooney and Senator Faulkner to learn what the reasons were. I suggest that this matter is of high constitutional interest and of high constitutional practice. It is not a trivial issue. The reason the Minister gave was that the House-the other place-had decided not to produce the tape. By some peculiar misquote from Erskine May this was deemed to be--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. As Senator Alston pointed out, Erskine May. The misquote and highly selective quote failed to tackle the substantive point, that is, that this Senate has the right to determine its own rules and has the right to manage its own business. If we accepted the argument of the Minister there would be no reason for this chamber to exist because, once the other place had determined its view on a Bill or a particular matter of public importance, as far as the Government is concerned that would be sufficient and, therefore, would bind this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that in the history of federation any other Minister would have advanced such a stupid, silly argument. On 20 previous occasions, 20 previous governments have obeyed the order of the Senate and have produced documents. How can Government senators argue that the Senate does not have these particular powers? Were 20 other governments quite wrong?</PARA>
<PARA> The extraordinary thing about this debate is that this document and the tapes and the transcripts that are now available to certain selected people are not apparently available to the Prime Minister or to the Ministers who are standing up in the other place and in this chamber and defending Ros Kelly. Those people have been very careful to avoid making any claim that they have actually heard the tapes or read the transcript. They are prepared to come in here and into the other place and defend Mrs Kelly without having taken the trouble to actually read what those transcripts contain. That is somewhat extraordinary, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA> We are therefore entitled to speculate about what is on those tapes. We have before us three sentences from a transcript of a meeting that went on for three hours. So we are quite entitled to speculate about what precisely is on these tapes. What is the Government afraid of? What particular item of information is contained on these tapes? Are the Government and Mrs Kelly worried, for example, about the robust language she reportedly used during the three-hour meeting? It was very robust indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a slight hint of the sort of language Mrs Kelly uses when we read those three sentences, I suggest, where she accused many of her Labor colleagues-Labor Premiers-of being willing to sell their mothers for the big dollar. That is the sort of language we have a hint of and which we have reports that Mrs Kelly apparently used during this three-hour meeting. Maybe this tape reveals the nature of the grubby deals this Government had done with various Green groups prior to the last election. Maybe there was a fairly vigorous exchange on that issue. Maybe there were some comments about the money the Government had paid out to some of those groups and the trade-offs that were required. Maybe there was a fairly vigorous exchange on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> How interesting it would be for the public, I say to Senator Cooney, who spoke about public interest, to explore those issues. We know that the man in charge of that was none other than the Minister at the table, Senator Richardson. So we are entitled to think and speculate about what is on that tape. </PARA>
<PARA> I was intrigued by Senator Faulkner's comments about the nature of the debate yesterday in the other place and what the final results of it were. He urged us to look at the press. I looked at the press, and here in the Australian we see the headline, `Kelly, Keating out on a limb'. In view of Senator Faulkner's interest in this matter, in view of his strong support for Mr Hawke, one thing he would not be worried about is Kelly and Keating being out on a limb. I suggest to Senator Faulkner that perhaps in the fullness of time we can speculate that the Prime Minister, if he takes the trouble to read the full text of that transcript--</PARA>

We all know on this side of the chamber how hard those factional plays are becoming. All of us have had chats with those on the other side. Unlike Senator Faulkner, I will not comment on anything that may be private or not private. All of us on this side of the chamber have heard some pretty robust comments from honourable senators opposite about the nature of the factional fighting. So I suggest to Senator Faulkner that it is possible that, in the fullness of time, as this issue heats up-and let me say that it is going to heat up; it is not over by any stretch of the imagination-Mr Hawke may be prepared to insist that the documents be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the front page of the Canberra Times, which we all read in the morning, it is reported that Mr Hawke said, referring to Mrs Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA>I would not be unhappy if she tabled the relevant transcript. I agree entirely with it. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a little chink; there is the door being pushed slightly ajar. I suggest to Mr Hawke that the public will at least want to know why he has not bothered to read the transcript, why the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has not bothered to read the transcript. I remind my colleagues that Senator Button was asked twice by Senator Reid yesterday during Question Time whether he had bothered to read the transcript. Senator Button was very careful to make it clear that no Minister had yet bothered to read the full transcript. So I say to Senator Cooney: where does that leave the public interest? Who can judge? The Government's own people are too scared to read this transcript-and I will bet they have jolly good reason to be. This is a vital issue of constitutional practice. The Senate is entitled to pursue this matter with great vigour, and the Senate will do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Faulkner raised some issues concerning what happened in 1982, and he boldly waved around a bit of paper. As he has drawn that debate to our attention, I refer him to some interesting quotes by his colleague Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I will read into the transcript of this debate what the now Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA>It is only by access to these documents that it will be possible now, given the attitude that the Government has taken, for an objective view to be reached as to where the merits and the truth lie. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that ring a somewhat familiar bell? If the Government has anything to hide, then this is what its shadow Attorney-General said in 1982. So I can understand the Government's continued reluctance to make the documents available. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Government believes, however, that its Minister and senior officials have acted throughout reasonably and with a proper sense of responsibility to the public at large, the Government should not hesitate for one second to put these documents in the public domain to enable the truth of that perception to be established once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a bad quote from Senator Evans in 1982. I thank Senator Faulkner for drawing our attention to it. Senator Evans concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is any constitutional issue involved here it is the right of this Parliament to demand accountability from the Executive . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was a fairly devastating comment from another man who holds himself out to be an eminent legal expert, although not as eminent, I regret to say, as I have often thought Senator Cooney to be. Having served with him on a number of committees, I felt that he was a man of great principle and a man of great learning. I have to say that the contribution he made today will not stand up well when the history of this period is written. I am sorry about that, because the contributions he often makes are of great worth and great merit. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the motion before the chair. Whether this motion is won or lost, I point out to Senator Cooney, will not end the issue. </PARA>

On Tuesday, the Senate directed that the Government release the tape recordings taken, according to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), by her Department at a meeting that took place between the major conservation movement representatives and the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The refusal of the Government to comply with the direction of the Senate has put it in contempt. We know that there have been 19 previous occasions in the history of Australia when such a request has been complied with. We know that, when one similar request occurred in 1975 and the Whitlam Government refused, it went to the people and was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Faulkner today has spoken about 1982. On that occasion, the request was made by the Labor Party for the bottom of the harbour papers to be brought before the Senate. At that time, the Executive opposed that on the ground that the disclosure of the documents would have been harmful to the administration of justice because many of those cases were before the court. So it was against the public interest; it was for the saving of public interest that that was opposed on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion, what has the Government put forward as its excuse for not bringing forward the tapes at the direction of the Senate? I have to read from the letter from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, in response to our direction from the Senate. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>I have noted the text of the order and advise the Senate that the Government will not be tabling the tape recording to which it refers. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no excuse at all; it is just blatant arrogance on the part of the Minister, who said that the Government has no intention of complying with the order. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney disappointed me considerably in his contribution because he expressed the philosophy of the Labor Party very clearly. He said, `The only thing that concerns us in this place is the numbers'. Yesterday in the House of Representatives the motion of censure against the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories was lost because of the numbers-nothing else. The Government said, `We are not going to give you those documents. We will not do it. You can request them, but it comes down to numbers and numbers only'. Because it has the numbers in the House of Representatives, it does not intend to comply with the direction of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> There was nothing in Senator Cooney's contribution about Executive accountability to the Parliament. He said, `We on this side do what we are told; nothing more, nothing less. We do not express our personal opinion. Whether it is on principle or otherwise, we vote according to what we are told'. Yes, we are different on this side of the chamber because that is not the case. On this side of the chamber, if it comes to a matter of principle, we vote the way our principle and our conscience tell us. Senator Cooney acknowledged today that the philosophy of the Labor Party is that numbers are more important than philosophy or principle. That is exactly what he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know only too well because it happened very recently, we had some legislation in this place on tobacco advertising and several of our senators crossed the floor and voted against their Party on that issue because for them it was a matter of principle, and they were permitted to do so. I have crossed the floor on several occasions-in one case on the referendum-because for me it is a matter of principle; not numbers but a matter of principle. I have crossed the floor on occasions in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still here and my colleagues who crossed the floor are still here but, unfortunately, the only member of the Labor Party who had the courage to cross the floor on any issue-Senator Georges-was expelled from the Labor Party as a result of his crossing the floor. That is the sort of democracy we know, and we have learnt, that the Labor Party indulges in: `Vote for a principle against your numbers and you will be expelled'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats do not do that. They often divide on issues. At least they know what true democracy based on principle is about. We on this side have that opportunity and the Democrats have that opportunity but, in the Labor Party, there is no such thing as principle. Let us look at the history of this situation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I was speaking on that subject because I was commenting very clearly on Senator Cooney's contribution. The only excuse that has been put up by the Government or by the Minister in defence of not supplying the tape-and that is not officially with a letter to the Senate but in debate in the other place-is that the tape was private.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson today said that the conservation movement does not want the tape to be revealed. That is frankly not true. Indeed, the conservationists present have released their minutes, which confirm their opinion of what occurred at that meeting. They have asked for the tape to be released and have said that until it is released a cloud hangs over their heads because the Minister has accused them of lying. The Minister was the first to bring the meeting into the public arena. The conservationists objected to her calling them liars, and so the fight has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Prime Minister has released only one very small section of a transcript-not of the tape but of a transcript of the tape-leaves the situation where today in the Australian Glenn Milne said:</PARA>
<PARA> The part of the transcript released by Hawke confirms that Kelly criticised the new federalism process, but with the weight of that criticism directed at the premiers rather than the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the rest of the tape remains under wraps only keeps suspicion and the issue alive. If Kelly has nothing to hide, which she says is the case, she would be better off complying with the directive of the Senate and giving up the tape. </PARA>
<PARA>Until the Executive decides that it is responsible to the people of Australia and to the Parliament of Australia, it does not have the luxury of saying, as Senator Button has said, that it just does not intend to release the tape, with no excuse at all. The Senate will pursue the issue on behalf of the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate which, from this side, has been a very careful analysis of the questions before us, my colleagues have made very telling points about what this motion is all about. It can be summed up, I suppose, as the absolute arrogance and contempt which the Labor Party and the Government have for the people of Australia as represented by those in this Parliament. I repeat that this motion is all about the absolute contempt and arrogance that the Labor Party has for the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the ACTU says to members of this Government, `Jump!', they ask, `How high?'. They are not at all interested in doing what is right. They are beholden to their masters in the ACTU. That is very easy to clearly understand when one looks at the background of the honourable senators on the Government side in this chamber. A good majority of them are only here because they owe allegiance to the ACTU and the union movement. Those who do not are only here because they are party hacks who have come up through the paid offices of the ALP and been given a sinecure in this place. That is what the ALP is all about. Government senators are beholden to the Labor Party and the union movement and that is all they are interested in. </PARA>
<PARA> When Government senators want to do things in government, do they do what is right or what they are told by the union movement? Who elects the union movement? A few people vote sometimes, but one only has to look at the Cooke inquiry in Queensland to see that many of the union elections are full of rorts and shady dealings. Nobody elects the union leaders except a few little people with very narrow interests, their own power bases in mind, and no real interest in what is good for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A good majority of Australians have elected, to this chamber, a large number of honourable senators from the Liberal Party, the Australian Democrats and the National Party. Those electors represent the views of well over 50 per cent of Australians. They have said to this Government, `We want you to do something that is not protected by privilege and is not something of grave commercial or national secrecy. We want you to do something'. What does this Government say to the people of Australia as represented by the senators who are asking for that? It says, `Go and shove it'. That is what the Labor Party has said. It is not interested in what the people of Australia want. It is only interested in what it is told to do by its union mates and the little coterie of people who control the Party and have its members put into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the people of Australia, through this Parliament, say, `Do something', this Government ignores them completely. That is my concern and it is the concern that is well brought out in this motion, and it is supported and identified by the Democrats. The people of Australia have asked the Government to do something. The Government has ignored them completely. The motion, amongst other things, notes with great concern the Government's belief that it is not accountable to the people of Australia through Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that this Senate again flexes its muscles and shows its relevance by agreeing to this motion to censure the Government for its unjustified failure to comply with the Senate resolution. This Senate also calls upon the Government to comply with the resolution and to table that tape. That is why it is again important that the majority of this Parliament-the representatives of the majority of Australians-demand that the Government take notice of the people of Australia and table the tape. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The 308th Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) was tabled in both Houses on 14 March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>The report presents the findings of the committee's inquiry into the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) `Unofficial Account'. The report includes a number of recommendations, most of which are systemic in nature, aimed at improving Commonwealth management and administration.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of the recommendations made by the JCPA have direct relevance to the Parliamentary Departments while others have wider implications. We have therefore responded to all nine of the Committee's recommendations in the report as set out below.</PARA>
<PARA>We are confident that implementation of the Committee's recommendations will ensure effective safeguards are in place to protect the interests of the Parliamentary Departments, will result in improved financial disciplines and strengthen accountability mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Administrative Services review the guidelines and procedures regarding the disposal of surplus, unserviceable or obsolete assets to ensure that the arrangements currently in place are adequate, clearly understood and properly implemented. (paragraph 2.5)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst this recommendation does not directly involve the Parliamentary Departments, they are assessing the adequacy of the guidelines and procedures and ensuring adherence to them.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2:</PARA>
<PARA>As part of the induction process, all new entrants to the Australian Public Service be briefed on the financial legal framework affecting public servants' dealings with Commonwealth financial resources. (paragraph 2.55)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>Although this recommendation has implications for the wider Public service, all Parliamentary Departments have taken action to implement this recommendation. Formal induction processes have been, or are being, developed by all Parliamentary Departments. Briefing on the financial legal framework is recognised as a major part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA>In future, all Parliamentary Departments will include, in literature made available to all new employees, an outline of the legal framework for public servants who are involved in the administration of Commonwealth financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Departmental officers who have ongoing responsibility for financial administration will continue to use formal financial documentation made available to them and will be reminded regularly of their responsibilities to be aware of, and comply with, the relevant laws and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>All Parliamentary Departments have issued, or are in the process of issuing, Secretary's Instructions to ensure that departmental staff are clearly informed as to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government examine ways to ensure its major contractors comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation and operating policies which impinge on contracts. (paragraph 2.55)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>Although this recommendation requires action by the Government, the Joint House Department has advised that the following actions and procedures are currently in place or in the process of implementation within that department:</PARA>
<PARA> standard contract documents which more clearly define the contractual and legislative obligations of the contractor are being developed;</PARA>
<PARA> a Purchasing and Supply Manual outlining both policy and procedures for departmental staff involved with procurement action for their sections has been endorsed by the Secretary, Joint House Department, and is currently being printed prior to distribution;</PARA>
<PARA> training seminars are being conducted for departmental officers designed to reinforce understanding of their obligations with respect to Commonwealth policy when dealing with contractors or when placed in a contract administration capacity;</PARA>
<PARA> procedures are being developed in consultation with client areas to more closely monitor contractor performance against terms and conditions of the contract, and</PARA>
<PARA> it is a requirement that all contract change/amendment/cancellation actions be firstly cleared and subsequently formalised by the Purchasing and Services Section in the form of a formal contract amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>Similar action has been, or is being, taken by the other Parliamentary Departments where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>Comment on Recommendations 3 and 4:</PARA>
<PARA>These two recommendations in no way relieve senior public servants or contractors to the Commonwealth of their responsibility to be aware of, and comply with, the relevant laws and regulations. (paragraph 3.41)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary executive officers are aware of their responsibilities and the requirement to comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Specific action has been taken to ensure this.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4:</PARA>
<PARA>All Commonwealth Departments ensure that cancellation of purchase order requests be clearly documented to show on whose authorisation the cancellation was made and for what reason. (paragraph 3.41)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>All Parliamentary Departments have implemented procedures to give effect to the committee's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Librarian take appropriate action to recover from Mr Blume his outstanding debt of $330 to the Commonwealth. (paragraph 4.41)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>Following a letter sent to Mr Blume on 12 April 1991 by the Parliamentary Librarian asking for settlement of the debt, Mr Blume paid the outstanding sum of $330.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6:</PARA>
<PARA>Each Parliamentary Department that has not already done so should establish, as a matter of priority, an adequately resourced internal audit function. (paragraph 6.19)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>All Parliamentary Departments have entered into contractual arrangements for the supply of internal audit services with the accounting firm Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu. The Parliamentary Departments are fully committed to ongoing internal audit activity, although the method of achieving this through an internal audit consultancy or an in-house function will be reviewed from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA>All departments either have in place an approved internal audit charter and an audit program, or are taking action in this regard as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7:</PARA>
<PARA>The delegate of the Secretary of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff review the actions of the former Manager of PISO, Mr Goodall and PISO's former Director, Planning and Administration, Mr Blume, with regard to establishing whether any misconduct may have occurred or whether there was a failure to fulfil their duties as officers while employed in the Australian Public Service. Should this be the case, an appropriate record be placed on the relevant personal files to ensure that this is taken into account in the event that either individual seeks reappointment to the Service. (paragraph 8.34)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>Following the receipt of Report 308, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff wrote to the Public Service Commission on 2 April 1991 requesting that the Commission nominate a suitably qualified officer to act as the Secretary's delegate to review the issues and advise the Secretary on the above matters.</PARA>
<PARA>It was considered that seeking an officer from outside the Department to carry out the review was the most appropriate method of ensuring that the principles of natural justice were followed and that no allegations of bias could be made. In a letter dated 19 June 1991 the Commissioner advised that the Public Service Commission was unable to assist.</PARA>
<PARA>Following receipt of this advice the Department engaged the services of Mr Brian Smith a retired former Senior Executive Service officer of the Australian Public Service to conduct the review and prepare a report and any appropriate associated recommendations. Mr Smith has now completed his review and on his recommendation notations have been placed on the personal files of both Messrs Blume and Goodall.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8:</PARA>
<PARA>Finance regulation 133 be revised to ensure that penalties for breaching the Finance Regulations can be applied not only to current accounting officers or persons subject to the Audit Act 1901, but also to persons breaching the Regulations who are no longer accounting officers or persons subject to the Audit Act 1901. (paragraph 8.34)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation is a matter for consideration by the Department of Finance.</PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has resolved to address item (h) of its Terms of Reference, the retiring age of judges of the Family Court of Australia, in this first report.</PARA>
<PARA>The only federal court to have a maximum retiring age of less than 70 years is the Family Court of Australia. Section 23A, which established 65 as the maximum retiring age, was inserted into the Family Law Act in 1977 following the amendment to section 72 of the Constitution. Prior to this judges of the Family Court of Australia were appointed for life. </PARA>
<PARA>It was felt at that time that the provision of the 65 retiring age was a reflection of community concern. Due to the demanding and arduous nature of some of the disputes it was considered that there was good reason for requiring judges of the Family Court to retire by the age recognised as the maximum retiring age for most other occupations in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The major arguments advanced both for and against retaining the present retirement age of 65 years for Family court Judges have been examined. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee does not believe, in the light of the evidence available to it, that there would be any valid reason to consider lowering the maximum retiring age to less than 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA>It is acknowledged that Family Law matters may cause a significant level of stress as a result of the often highly emotional issues involved, for example, in access and custody disputes and the distribution of the assets of a marriage, however the Committee believes that the issues dealt with in some of the other federal courts, where the retiring age is 70 years, would be equally stressful. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of judges hold dual commissions with the Federal Court and the Family Court. The Committee believes that it is an unusual situation to have a retiring age of 65 years for Family Court Judges and 70 years for Federal Court Judges where a dual commission is held. </PARA>
<PARA>The importance of awareness of social values for Family Court Judges was also considered by the Committee. The Committee believes that there would not be a substantial difference, between the social values of judges who are 65 years and those who are 70 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>In coming to decisions in relation to matters before him or her the judge would hear from solicitors, witnesses, counsellors and registrars. The judge's experience is then brought to bear in bringing all these threads together and reaching a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of judicial burnout was raised as a concern by one Family Court Judge. It was suggested that if the retiring age were to be extended it should be subject to the provision that no judge should continue beyond 65 if he or she had more than 20 years service at that time. A judge who is suffering from stress or burnout has the option of retiring at age 60 but must have ten years service to qualify for a judicial pension. The Committee believes that the issue of judicial burnout may warrant further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that there is no reason to assume that judges of the Family Court have a diminished capacity to make sound decisions after age 65 when all other federal court judges are considered competent to adjudicate up to age 70. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the early days of the Family Court the processes of the Court have been refined. Routine and uncontested matters are now determined by registrars and judicial registrars leaving the judges to preside and adjudicate in the more complex contested cases that come before the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite this refinement to the operation of the court the Committee has received many complaints relating to the length of time taken for particular cases to be heard. It has been suggested to the Committee that there is a need for more Family Court Judges. By forcing judges to retire at age 65 the problem will simply increase. The Committee believes that valuable expertise is being lost to the Family Court through the early retirement of Family Court Judges. </PARA>
<PARA>In its early years the Family Court had a specialised jurisdiction, but this role has been considerably expanded to include not only property cases and issues relating to children but also matters previously dealt with by the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Disputes about property in the Family Court can raise complex questions relating to such areas of the law as property, equity, taxation, contract, company, constitutional and conflict law. Similar questions may be raised in other superior courts where the retiring age is 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear to the Committee that if a judge of a Supreme Court, up to the age of 70, is able to preside over a matter relating to children, there is no logical reason that a Family Court Judge would be any less able to do so beyond the age of 65 years. The same can be said of the appeal process in the Family Court. An appeal from the Family Court is first heard by the Full Court of the Family Court. Any subsequent appeal is heard by the High Court whose judges have a maximum retiring age of 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The jurisdiction of the Family Court has been increased. This increased jurisdiction can be seen in the provisions relating to cross-vesting. This legislation, introduced in 1977, has meant that the Family Court can exercise the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the State Supreme Courts in a number of matters. The legislation allows disputes involving a third party to be determined by the Family Court. In exercising this jurisdiction the Family Court is exercising jurisdiction that would otherwise come under State Supreme Courts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Family Court has often been treated as a poor relation compared to the Federal Court of Australia. It has generally lacked resources and the conditions of service for judges have been thought to be unequal to the other federal courts. There have been difficulties in the past in attracting the most suitable candidates to the Family Court. The Committee believes that an increase in the maximum retiring age for Family Court Judges would make the Family court a more attractive option for many experienced legal practitioners. By extending the retiring age the opportunity would be created for new judicial appointments to obtain the necessary experience under the guidance of senior Family Court Judges who may wish to continue past 65 years. With ten of the current judges of the Family Court, who have tenure until 65, due to retire in the next five years an extension of the maximum retiring age to 70 would allow greater time to attract the most appropriate people to the bench. </PARA>
<PARA>The reasons for fixing a 65 retiring age for the Family Court are no longer valid. The original basis for the decision on retiring age for Family Court Judges, due to the narrow jurisdiction of Family Law, has been considerably eroded. The role of the Family Court Judge is no longer one that deals exclusively with Family Law but may now involve similar matters to those heard in the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>A recognition of the equal status of the Family Court to other superior courts would be further enhanced by increasing the maximum retiring age for Family Court Judges to age 70. By allowing Family Court Judges who are willing and able to remain at the bench, there could be a considerable cost saving to the Government and the community. Not only is the knowledge and ability of an experienced judge invaluable to newer appointees but it would represent a considerable saving in terms of costs associated with new judicial appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly the Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> as a matter of priority the Family Law Act be amended to fix a maximum retiring age of 70 years for Family Court Judges. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Last month the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inspected defence facilities in north Queensland and the Torres Strait. The trip is significant because it is the first time that the Defence Sub-Committee has visited Torres Strait since the Sub-Committee came into existence in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1973 familiarisation visits and inspections have been considered an essential part of the Sub-committee's activities. They provide the Members with opportunities to gain first hand appreciation of the capability of our Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>The Defence Sub-Committee has conducted rigorous inquiries into several Defence issues, for example, into the Management of Australia's Defence, into Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force-and now into the Australian Defence Force Reserve. The extent to which information gained during inspections complements the formal evidence submitted to inquiries cannot be overestimated. </PARA>
<PARA>On this occasion we visited an Army Reserve formation-11 Brigade at Townsville-where we were able to discuss issues which had been raised by the inquiry into Reserves in terms of 11 Brigade's experience. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with the wider educational value of familiarisation visits, the Sub-Committee inspected elements of the Australian Defence Force's Operational Deployment Force, namely 3 Brigade, and 5 Aviation Regiment and Operational Support Group at RAAF Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst in Townsville the Sub-Committee was provided with an opportunity to participate as observers in a live-firing exercise. Members were carried with combat soldiers of 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment by Black Hawk assault helicopters to High Range Training Area where a platoon attack was made on a section post. We were impressed by the high level of skills demonstrated by the soldiers engaged in the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>In Cairns the Sub-Committee was briefed at Headquarters 51st Battalion Far North Queensland Regiment which is a battalion of 11 Brigade. The 51st Battalion is also one of the Australian Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units which has elements located throughout north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The surveillance function of the 51st Battalion is complemented by the Patrol Boat Fleet based at Cairns and by Coastwatch. The itinerary therefore included briefings by both HMAS Cairns and the Australian Customs Service. Coastwatch enjoys a cooperative relationship with 51 FNQR through joint patrols and exchange of information. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Torres Strait region the Sub-Committee inspected the Depot at Thursday Island which C Company of the 51st Battalion shares with the Resident Naval Officer Thursday Island. We were briefed on the particular concerns of Reservists in the island communities. </PARA>
<PARA>We gained some perspectives on the value of a Defence presence on the islands of the Torres Strait from discussions with the Chairman of the Island Co-ordinating Council, Mr Getano Lui and with the Chairmen of Boigu and Saibai Islands, Mr Donald Banu and Mr Terry Waia, respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>Boigu and Saibai Islands are located within three or four kilometres of the Papua-New Guinea coast. We were told that some time ago rumours had circulated that `Raskols' had left Port Moresby with the intention of causing strife on the islands. The Chairmen of both islands made it clear to the Sub-Committee that they would like a more visible Defence presence. They would appreciate more visits by Defence authorities and more consultation on recruitment of Reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sub-Committee also visited Yorke Island because an exercise was being held there for Reservists. This gave us an opportunity to speak to Reservists about their activities in the Army Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>At Weipa we were briefed on the operations of the Reserve patrols in the area of operations of B Company. The Officer Commanding B Company confirmed the view put to the Sub-Committee on other occasions that the most valued training exercises are those involving `real' tasks. For example, B Company patrols were required to assist in the search for the F/A-18 which disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sub-Committee also visited the COMALCO bauxite mine at Weipa where we gained an appreciation of protecting a vital asset in the northern region. </PARA>
<PARA>Members gained a great deal from this trip, from the experiences and the briefings provided throughout the tour. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sub-Committee is grateful to the Minister for Defence for making available the Caribou aircraft which transported us for most of the visit. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA>The 311th Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is a report on the Committee's activities for the financial year 1990-91 and informs the Parliament of the work undertaken by a committee concerned with issues of accountability, the financial affairs of the Commonwealth and the achievement of value for money for the taxpayer's dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>The year has been an extremely busy one for the Committee. It conducted 7 inquiries, tabled 5 reports, and together with its four Sectional Committees met 111 times for a total of 285 hours. </PARA>
<PARA>Reports</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's reports have dealt with several diverse issues which include:</PARA>
<PARA>an investigation of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (or PISO) `unofficial account';</PARA>
<PARA>a review of annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities; and</PARA>
<PARA>an examination of Australia's Business Migration Program. </PARA>
<PARA>Each of these reports has been a catalyst for change and I note in particular, the Report on the Business Migration Program. Only one month after tabling, the Minister for Immigration announced the Government's acceptance of the Committee's recommendations-effectively dismantling the Business Migration Program. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say few reports of parliamentary committees receive such prompt attention and lead to such dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual Report Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's activities are not limited to the conduct of inquiries. The Public Services Act requires the Committee to approve the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports and this year the Committee reviewed a revised set of guidelines prepared by the Prime Minister's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines had been revised in response to the findings and recommendations contained in the Committee's 304th Report, Guidelines for departmental annual reports, tabled in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee approved the annual report guidelines subject to the Prime Minister agreeing to certain changes to them. One important change was that House of Representatives Standing Committees be assigned the ongoing role of reviewing the operations of Commonwealth departments based on the departmental annual reports tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am happy to report that this task has now formally been given to the House Standing Committees.I believe the work of the House Standing Committees in this regard will complement the work undertaken by their Senate counterparts-and, I am hopeful that the combined efforts of the House and Senate Standing Committees will contribute to the enhanced accountability of the Executive Government to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Inquiries</PARA>
<PARA>During the year, the Committee made substantial progress on a number of its inquiries-and reports on these inquiries should be tabled during the current Budget Sittings. I do not wish to elaborate on the inquiries but only to mention them by name. They are inquiries into:</PARA>
<PARA>research and development in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>Defence computing;</PARA>
<PARA>the social responsibilities of statutory authorities and government business enterprises;</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Customs Service; and</PARA>
<PARA>the role and work of the Independent Auditor-that is, the auditor who audits the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the diversity of these inquiries indicates the Committee's clear interest in all areas of Commonwealth administration. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>The achievements of the Public Accounts Committee reflect the commitment and hard work of its members, staff and advisers and I take this opportunity to express my thanks to them. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Committee, I would also place on record our appreciation for the assistance provided by the Auditor-General and his staff and the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Report to Honourable Senators. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill</PARA>
<PARA>In May 1989 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presented its Report No. 3, which flowed from its Inquiry into the Conduct of the 1987 Federal Election and the 1988 Referendums. A number of the recommendations made by the Committee in its Report have already been put into effect administratively or by regulation, and some others were enacted in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to give effect to the remaining recommendations made in the Committee's Report No. 3 which have been accepted by the Government. A number of minor amendments the need for which has become apparent since the Committee reported have also been included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I turn to the major provisions of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes that registered officers of political parties are to be able to nominate all endorsed House of Representatives candidates to the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory concerned up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. It is also proposed that nominations may be made by facsimile provided the deposit is also received before the close of nominations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also imposes a new requirement on a candidate to state in his or her nomination whether he or she became an Australian citizen by birth, by naturalisation or by other means. This should minimise the possibility of the election results being subsequently voided by the courts because the candidate is not an Australian citizen as occurred in the case of former Senator Wood. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes that any person who at the hour of nomination is an officer of the Crown is not capable of being nominated as a Senator or a Member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Any person who makes a claim on the nomination form which is false or misleading in a material respect shall be guilty of an offence, with a penalty of $3,000 or imprisonment for 6 months or both. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes to introduce an infringement notice system for enforcement of compulsory voting at elections and referendums, under which apparent non-voters will be given the option of paying a penalty, showing cause why they should not be prosecuted, or having the matter dealt with by the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, other features of the Bill include:</PARA>
<PARA> provision for candidates who have silent enrolment not to have their addresses publicly announced;</PARA>
<PARA> ensuring that the addresses of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting postal vote applications;</PARA>
<PARA> giving Senators and Members the choice of recording their enrolled address or place of residence when completing their nomination forms;</PARA>
<PARA> enabling an incumbent Senator who has lodged a voting ticket to be included above the heavy black line on the Senate ballot paper along with the word `Independent';</PARA>
<PARA> clarifying the provisions relating to the scrutiny of Senate voting; and</PARA>
<PARA> modifying the provisions of section 351 relating to the publication of matter regarding candidates to enhance its enforceability. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also allows for the provision to each House of Representatives candidate a copy of the certified list of voters for the Division for which they have nominated as soon as possible after the close of the roll. It also allows for copies of the certified list of voters to be provided to Senators and Members as soon as practicable after the election. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Joint Standing Committee for their valuable contribution in reviewing the operation of the Electoral and Referendum Acts. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1991 will provide a new representative action procedure in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>The new procedure will enhance access to justice, reduce the costs of proceedings and promote efficiency in the use of court resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Bill a person will be able to bring a proceeding on behalf of a group of persons where the claims of those persons arise out of the same, similar or related circumstances and a common question of law or fact arises with respect to all their claims. </PARA>
<PARA>The new representative proceeding provided in the Bill is based on the existing representative action procedure in the Federal Court and in State Supreme Courts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives the Federal Court an efficient and effective procedure to deal with multiple claims. Such a procedure is needed for two purposes. The first is to provide a real remedy where, although many people are affected and the total amount at issue is significant, each person's loss is small and not economically viable to recover in individual actions. </PARA>
<PARA>It will thus give access to the courts to those in the community who have been effectively denied justice because of the high cost of taking action. </PARA>
<PARA>The second purpose is to deal efficiently with the situation where the damages sought by each claimant are large enough to justify individual actions and a large number of persons wish to sue the respondent. </PARA>
<PARA>The new procedure will mean that groups of persons, whether they be shareholders or investors, or people pursuing consumer claims, will be able to obtain redress and do so more cheaply and efficiently than would be the case with individual actions. </PARA>
<PARA>The procedure contained in the Bill has been developed following the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled `Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court', which was tabled in Parliament in December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was not able to accept all the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. In particular, it has not adopted the Commission's `grouped proceedings' approach or the extension of the Federal Court's jurisdiction for such proceedings. The Commission's proposals for contingency fees and a Grouped Proceedings Assistance Fund have also not been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has engaged in an extensive consultative process in preparing this Bill and has received comment from the business community and consumer and legal groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Since I announced details of the Government's proposed reforms two matters of concern have been raised by some sections of the business community and of the consumer movement. </PARA>
<PARA>The area of concern to business appears to be whether persons having relevant claims against the respondent should be included in the group covered by the proceedings unless they choose to `opt out' or whether all such persons should have to take a positive step to be included, that is to `opt in'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that an opt out procedure is preferable on grounds both of equity and efficiency. It ensures that people, particularly those who are poor or less educated, can obtain redress where they may be unable to take the positive step of having themselves included in the proceedings. It also achieves the goals of obtaining a common binding decision while leaving a person, who wishes to do so, free to leave the group and pursue his or her claim separately. </PARA>
<PARA>Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the new procedure will not be available for causes of action arising before the commencement of the amending Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Practical considerations have led to the Bill applying only to future causes of action. These are the possible insurance implications of enabling increased recovery of claims in respect of past premium years and the possible impact on the Federal Court if past claims could be brought. </PARA>
<PARA>The only likely costs to business of the reforms in the Bill will be through people being able to enforce existing substantive rights which claimants could not previously afford to enforce even though the liabilities existed. </PARA>
<PARA>This is to the benefit of ethical businesses which honour their legal obligations without having to be forced to do so by legal action. </PARA>
<PARA>The other main feature of the Bill is the comprehensive powers given to the Court to ensure that the proceedings are not abused. The Court will be able to order that a proceeding no longer continue as a representative proceeding where it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so because, amongst other matters, it would be less expensive to have separate proceedings or that the relief sought could be obtained by means of an individual proceeding. It will retain all its current powers including the power to stay or dismiss any application it considers to be vexatious, oppressive or trivial. The Court is also given power to stay or discontinue any representative action where it considers that the costs of identifying group members and distributing money ordered to be paid to them would be excessive having regard to the total of the amount at issue. </PARA>
<PARA>These reforms are a significant part of the Government's equity and access policies embodied in its social justice program. </PARA>
<PARA>There is considerable community concern about the cost of, and access to, justice which is now the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The measures contained in this Bill will remove at least some of the barriers for persons who seek redress before the Courts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill represents a considered, balanced and responsible response to problems in an area where there is a recognised and pressing need for reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Following introduction of the Bill a period of time will be given to enable interested persons and groups to provide comments to the Government on its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not expected that the Bill will have a significant financial impact. A small number of additional cases may be brought. Offsetting this will be savings where multiple individual actions would otherwise be brought. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSSAT REPEAL BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's November 1990 statement on micro-economic reform outlined changes to take place in the provision of telecommunications services in Australia. As part of these reforms, AUSSAT Pty Ltd will be sold to form the basis of the Second Carrier. A number of regulatory changes have recently been made by the Parliament to create a competitive environment for the Second Telecommunications Carrier and new owner of AUSSAT. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth's 100% shareholding in AUSSAT is to be sold and general telecommunications and public mobile licences awarded. Once ownership of the shares is transferred, AUSSAT will cease to be a Government Business Enterprise. Accordingly, the AUSSAT Act 1984 will need to be repealed and a number of consequential provisions will need to be put in place so that the sale can be completed. </PARA>
<PARA>After the sale, AUSSAT will be a privately owned company and subject to the laws that presently govern the corporate operations of such companies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequential provisions are also required to extinguish AUSSAT's tax losses, to empower the Treasurer to give an explicit Commonwealth guarantee to AUSSAT's borrowings up to the point of sale, to appropriate funds to pay out those borrowings prior to the sale and to remove AUSSAT from future coverage of other Commonwealth legislation such as the Archives Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Under s80 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, a company may offset prior year losses against future income to reduce taxable income and income tax liability until such time as the accumulated losses have been used up. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSSAT's accumulated and projected trading losses to 30 June 1991 provide a potential future income tax benefit to a purchaser. While it is normal practice to sell an entity with any tax losses, doing so in this case would clearly have budgetary implications in future years. From a budgetary viewpoint, therefore, it is desirable that they be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>On the matter of AUSSAT's borrowings, in the period leading up to the sale, AUSSAT will continue to fund its operations from both revenues and borrowings. It is essential therefore that the viability of the borrowing program is maintained until it is paid out by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of AUSSAT's high gearing, investor support of its borrowing program in the lead up to the sale is heavily reliant on Commonwealth expressions of support for AUSSAT. </PARA>
<PARA>Paying out the debt prior to the sale will have a two fold effect. Firstly it will reassure lenders in the period prior to the payout and secondly it will facilitate the orderly sale of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>The appropriation provided for in the Bill is set at an estimated maximum amount allowing for contingencies such as the impact of variable interest rates applying to AUSSAT's borrowings between now and when they are paid out, the possible payout of one or both of AUSSAT's leveraged satellite leases as well as its commercial paper borrowings and any slippages in the timing of the payout due to factors relating to the sale itself. The figure is $800m, but the Bill provides for the actual appropriation to be set at an outturn figure below the maximum. </PARA>
<PARA>The need to pay out the leveraged leases will not be known until the bidders, the banks and the Commonwealth decide as part of the sale negotiations how the satellite leases are to be treated. </PARA>
<PARA>The amount of the debt payout will ultimately affect the price received for AUSSAT. </PARA>
<PARA>The explicit guarantee is required to support the restructuring of AUSSAT's borrowings in preparation for payout. Just prior to payout AUSSAT will consolidate its borrowings into a single credit instrument with the Commonwealth Bank to facilitate the logistics of payout. </PARA>
<PARA>For its part, because of its very large exposure to AUSSAT through this arrangement, the Commonwealth Bank has quite reasonably requested that the Commonwealth guarantee the credit instrument up to the point of sale. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the guarantee to cease at the point of sale. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also makes minor amendments to other Commonwealth legislation consequential upon the repeal of the AUSSAT Act 1984 and, in respect of other telecommunications legislation in particular, to correct drafting anomalies and to clarify the technical operation of some of the provisions of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA>As indicated above, this Bill provides for a maximum of $800m which can be paid to AUSSAT in the form of additional share or loan capital. The amount actually paid will be determined by movements in interest rates between now and the time of payout, the timing of the actual payout and the treatment of the satellite leveraged leases. It is not possible nor desirable to predict what the incoming sale proceeds will be as this will be determined in the sale negotiation process. </PARA>

<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>

In accord with established practice, the Overseas Students Charge is adjusted annually in line with movements in the index of higher education charges. The amounts payable in 1992 are shown in the Bill. The charges are payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Act relates. </PARA>

<PARA>ABORIGINAL EDUCATION (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE)</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 amends the principal Act, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal Act provides a legislative basis for a consolidated program and funding approach that is supplementary to mainstream Commonwealth education funding. The Act underpins the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. This policy, commonly known as the AEP, has been endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. It is truly a national policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The AEP is a significant reform initiative in Aboriginal education developed when my colleague the honourable J S Dawkins was the Minister responsible for Aboriginal education.The AEP is a cooperative effort to address the education needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, by focusing on the educational strategies of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, non-government education authorities and educational institutions, in achieving agreed national goals. </PARA>
<PARA>The AEP has a number of program elements including:</PARA>
<PARA> the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP), which incorporates the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program (ASSPA);</PARA>
<PARA> the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme (ATAS); and</PARA>
<PARA> Vocational and Educational Guidance for Aboriginals Scheme (VEGAS). </PARA>
<PARA>The AEP arose from the findings of several major reports that identified Aboriginal people as the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. It has four main long term objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> to increase the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in educational decision making;</PARA>
<PARA> to ensure equality of access to educational services;</PARA>
<PARA> to ensure equity of educational participation; and</PARA>
<PARA> to achieve equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>All governments of Australia have agreed on 21 specific goals which cover all sectors of education. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted that these amendments to the principal Act are administrative in nature. They will not affect the national policy nor the long-term commitment of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, the non-government educational authorities and the educational institutions to achieve the goals. </PARA>
<PARA>The administrative amendments reflect the transfer of the higher education funding component within the principal Act to the Higher Education Funding Act and minor changes to the administration of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program, the program which gives effect to the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will not appropriate any additional funds. The amendments to the amounts appropriated under the principal Act also reflect budget neutral transfers between the special appropriation and the annual appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>The central features of the AEP will remain the same. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, as in other areas of Aboriginal affairs such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, or ATSIC, the policy emphasises the necessity for Aboriginal involvement in decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA>As an example at the school level, there are now over two thousand ASSPA committees. These are committees made up of Aboriginal parents and teachers, that meet and discuss program priorities in schools. The ASSPA program is recognised by State and Territory education authorities as being a successful means of increasing Aboriginal involvement in educational decision making at the local level. Such involvement occurs at all levels of the AEP.Secondly, the policy emphasises a cooperative approach at every level and operates with cross-party support. It links the work of education providers and State and Territory governments of all kinds through an agreed national approach. </PARA>
<PARA>The AEP is strategic. It is based on agreed operational and strategic plans intended to improve the poor national report card in Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>The AEP is working. We already have early indications that Aboriginal school retention rates, increasing steadily throughout the duration of the Hawke Government, have increased further. More Aboriginal people are becoming employed in education and more schooling opportunities are becoming available.</PARA>
<PARA>The AEP also has a relationship with two other areas of my responsibilities as Minister. It is an essential part of both the process of reconciliation and the Government's response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA>The reconciliation process emphasises education as a central and essential concern. As the Bill supported unanimously in both houses of Parliament, stresses, there is a need to educate all Australians about Aboriginal history and culture and about the reasons for Aboriginal social and economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>The AEP does that through the nationally agreed goal 21, and through the role the policy plays as a framework for the national reconciliation and schooling strategy, which I announced last April. </PARA>
<PARA>Initiatives are now under way to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies have a valued place in the curriculum of Australian schooling and in the professional development of teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>The reconciliation process also emphasises a strategic effort throughout this decade to address Aboriginal disadvantage. Aboriginal people are clearly of the view that any attempt to respond to these issues that does not start to meet the education needs of their community will not be able to succeed. I share that view and I am pleased that the AEP provides a national policy framework for addressing that concern. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody called for responses from government to address the underlying causes of the Aboriginal imprisonment rates. Education was one area that it emphasised and the AEP provides a model for the cooperative arrangements that it had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission also emphasised the central importance of Aboriginal people's involvement in decision-making, especially to ensure that their priorities and concerns are reflected in the education of their children. It cited the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program (ASSPA) as a positive example in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>Education is central to social change for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy recognises this and, linked with other key areas of national commitment such as the reconciliation process, is a clear indication of the priority that this Government places on ongoing change and development in the area of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the changes to this legislation are minor and administrative the passage of these amendments provides an opportunity for the Parliament to give a commitment of support to the principles and practices of the AEP as a means of addressing the educational needs of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is addressed to Senator Button. I refer the Minister to the labour force figures for August, released today, which show that a further 8,600 Australians joined the unemployed, lifting the massively understated total jobless in Australia to a seasonally adjusted post-Depression record of 840,500. I ask the Minister: why have 152,000 young Australians' full time jobs been wiped out over the last two years, of which 23,200 were lost last month alone? How much worse does the Government, in its deliberately engineered recession, plan for youth unemployment to get on top of August's worst ever recorded seasonally adjusted figure of 29 per cent of young Australians unable to find full time work?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite sought to make capital of this at the time of the Budget and that is a legitimate function for an opposition. But let me just say that the 9.8 per cent figure, accompanied by a higher participation rate, is something which the Government both expected and predicted in the course of the Budget Papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The components of that 9.8 per cent are simply as follows: the number of employed persons rose strongly by 106,000, reflecting rises in both full time and part time employment in all States; the participation rate rose markedly by 0.8 per cent to 63.4 per cent, after peaking at an historic high level of 64.2 per cent in July 1990, leading to a slight fall of 8,600 in the number of unemployed persons to 840,500. I should agree, in the light of earlier comments I made, that the trend unemployment rate continued to rise from 9.7 to 9.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume also referred to the 29 per cent rate in the ABS statistics. I just want to make a couple of points about that. Senator Baume always focuses on that figure, as if it is an equivalent estimate to the overall unemployment rate-that is to say, the overall unemployment rate is 9.8 per cent but the rate for teenagers is 29 per cent. That totally overstates the unemployment situation in relation to teenagers. The 29 per cent rate in the ABS release relates to the number of 15- to 19-year-olds not at school but looking for work. Therefore, it is the total unemployment in that age category as a proportion of a relatively small number of people.</PARA>
<PARA> The 8.8 per cent figure referred to today by Minister Dawkins in his press release is the number of unemployed teenagers looking for full time work as a proportion of the total teenage population. That figure is more comparable to the 29 per cent figure which Senator Baume selected in the course of his question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for that misleading answer. I draw his attention to the fact that the Budget budgeted for total unemployment to reach 10 3/4 per cent. What does this mean youth unemployment will rise to?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget prediction or forecast was as Senator Baume indicated in his supplementary question. I thought Senator Baume, full of synthetic outrage as he always is in this place, would have been happier that that figure is not attained in the monthly figures that have just been published. But, far from that, he wants to refer again to the Budget figure. That is a forecast. It is not necessarily a precise forecast.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not always have time to read the Adelaide news in detail. But the article about this matter has been drawn to my attention. Agri-Dri is apparently a product of considerable commercial potential. It has been developed by the South Australian Department of Agriculture for the drying of fruit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not give a detailed description of the technology. Agri-Dri uses a pump system which achieves a high degree of efficiency and offers great savings in energy. The project has been partially funded by the Electricity Trust of South Australia. I understand several of these machines are in use, not just for drying fruit but also for other food processing production. Not only is the Agri-Dri an alternative to conventional dryers used by rural cooperatives; it can also be a substitute for conventional sun drying used by farmers. The problems of sun drying are substantially reduced by this technology.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the idea has been fully commercialised at this time. Its development is continuing with the aim of improving the efficiency even further. The machines in operation have been custom-made for specific requirements. Other applications may well be identified as development proceeds. Initial production has been for the Australian domestic market. In terms of the question that Senator Maguire asked, it can be said with confidence that there are good export prospects down the track for this technology.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1985 Hamilton report, entitled Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses, and the 1988 Cross report, entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force, identified the need for the Australian Defence Force to provide additional family support measures to improve the quality of service life. Since then, a wide range of measures have been taken to improve family support. The creation of the Australian defence family information and liaison staff was a major step in this. Through the ADFILS service, families have access to a toll-free telephone information service which has dealt with more than 10,000 calls. The inquiries, since its establishment in 1989, have been on a wide range of matters to do with service conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The family support funding program budget for 1991-92 of $1m is distributed nationally in grants of up to $20,000 for play groups, child-care centres, spouse organisations and neighbourhood centres. A further $1m has been allocated under the facilities program to provide for the establishment and capital improvement of child-care centres. Already a number of the centres have been set up at facilities around the country.</PARA>
<PARA> The normal posting cycle has been extended from two years to three years to provide greater geographic stability. Where possible, members with school age children are given back-to-back postings in the same locality.</PARA>
<PARA> The standard of housing has been upgraded significantly. The Defence Housing Authority, set up in 1987, is half way through a decade-long billion dollar program for constructing and acquiring better quality housing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not a dorothy dixer, Senator Newman; it is a question that Senator Zakharov has asked. As the Opposition has asked only one question on defence in the last 14 Question Times, Senator Zakharov probably felt impelled to ask a question in the defence area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators will appreciate from these remarks, much has been done on the family front in recent years. However, refining family policy is a continuing process. That is why we commissioned the Australian Institute of Family Studies to conduct a census of members and their families in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The data provided by the census gives us a very powerful tool to identify whether the needs of service families are being met. Its value lies in its ability to provide quantitative answers to highly specific questions. For example, it can tell us the number of school age children in a particular area, the average age of the serving members at a particular facility and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> Assessing and utilising the data is a complex job. The census will be of the most value over the longer term as the results are matched against the national census and, subsequently, ADF family censuses. The data will provide the ADF with firm evidence to back up its submissions to Federal, State and local authorities for access to community facilities. It will allow greater targeting of ADF family needs. The Defence Housing Authority is already using the data to ensure that its married quarters purchasing and construction program matches family requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Later this year the Australian Institute of Family Studies will prepare a detailed technical report which will allow us to focus on areas of greatest need, ensuring that the service and the community gain the maximum benefits from these family support measures.</PARA>

<PARA>While Opposition backbenchers had been given few details of the tax, Mr Palmer said he had been well briefed because the tax will have its biggest impact in the NT, where all freight costs will be lifted by the tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely true, of course, as Senator Tambling knows. According to that article, Mr Palmer said:</PARA>
<PARA>I haven't got a crystal ball, I have been told . . . I had quite good briefings, particularly by Fischer and Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA>I have known for 10 years that Arthur Palmer is a complete drop kick, but now Mr Fischer and Dr Hewson know it as well. I did try to tell the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory what a total drop kick he had preselected for the seat because, until last year, I think, Arthur Palmer was a Labor Party supporter for 10 years. I was always terrified that he was going to nominate for preselection for a seat. As president of the Party, I told him that it would be over my dead body if he ever did.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Palmer has claimed publicly that Dr Hewson and Mr Fischer have told him that this tax will be 12.5 per cent. As all honourable senators know-and those from northern Australia should know-one of the most vital industries for northern Australia, and certainly for the Northern Territory, is tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, the Australian Tourism Industry Association expressed grave concern about the impact of a goods and services tax. I commend to honourable senators from north Queensland the recent paper on the impact of such a tax entitled The impact of a goods and services tax (GST) on the Australian tourism industry. In that paper, Mr Peter O'Clery said that his association was concerned about the possibility that GST might be struck at a rate of 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr O'Clery's paper said that if this happened `we would have a disaster on our hands in the Australian tourist industry'. Recently, ATIA has had first hand discussions with the tourism industry in New Zealand and Canada, which have both suffered greatly as a result of the imposition of a GST.</PARA>
<PARA> ATIA believes that a GST would have a more severe impact on overall tourism in Australia than it had in New Zealand-and it will-and would weaken the fragile edge of the domestic market which has been won from the Hawke Government's deregulation of domestic aviation. It is the assessment of ATIA that this disastrous impact will be evident on any consumption tax above 7 per cent. I say again that this would be a disaster for northern Australia, because tourism alone is worth $400m to the Northern Territory, which is 8 per cent of the gross domestic product of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> In a separate study for the ATIA, the Australian Tourist Commission has estimated that there would be a 15 per cent price increase applied under a consumption tax; that the proposed annual loss to Australia would be 125,000 visitors from Japan, Germany, Britain, New Zealand and the United States of America; and that the loss of export income from these destinations would be $250m a year. Those estimates come from the tourist industry. It is hardly surprising that it makes such claims. I have had a look at the list and I understand-maybe I am wrong-that there is no representative from northern Australia in the coalition on the coalition's committee on consumption tax; it is hardly surprising that there is not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the question is: in October. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided me with a response. The Government is conscious of the problems being experienced by the many farmers who have been affected by the current dry conditions. Many of these farmers have also been affected by the downturn in commodity prices. The rural adjustment scheme is the Commonwealth's main instrument for providing support to farmers in financial difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under part B of the scheme, assistance is in the form of interest rate subsidies provided to farmers to enable them to obtain carry-on finance. Farmers affected by drought may be eligible for assistance under this provision. The farmers seeking assistance should approach the relevant State authorities responsible for the administration of RAS.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth funding for the rural adjustment scheme has been increased to $160m in 1991-92 and $13.6m will be provided for carry-on assistance which requires matching funding from State governments. Funding of the scheme will be reviewed in October, including an assessment of the need for additional funding for drought relief assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the first part of Senator West's question, the answer is yes, I am aware that 103 additional schools have been placed on the list. I am aware of the letter from Mr Bull. I have been asked whether these statements are true. Unfortunately, they are not. The real situation is that under the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 the Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training does in fact have responsibility for determining variations to existing prescribed country areas eligible to receive available funding under the country areas program. That is a matter of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, this declaration is made on the basis of recommendations received from the State Minister of education-and in New South Wales that is the Hon. Virginia Chadwick. This situation recognises that, as State and Territory governments have the primary responsibility for education, State education ministries are responsible for the detailed administration of the Commonwealth country areas program, including of course that most basic aspect: the definition of prescribed country areas.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the 1991 variations to the prescribed country areas program in New South Wales were made following a review of the operation of the program carried out by the New South Wales Department of School Education in 1990. As a result of this particular review, the boundaries of the prescribed country areas were altered to include the extra 103 additional schools. On Mrs Chadwick's advice, the Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training declared the prescribed country areas for New South Wales on 9 April 1991, which included those 103 additional schools.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bull's statement that the addition of those schools to the list was at the insistence of the Federal Government is therefore entirely untrue. It is part of a dishonest and divisive campaign in New South Wales, which seems to be being run by Mr Bull. It is dishonest in that the basic element of it is untrue; dishonest also in that he claims that some larger schools have been included and some smaller isolated schools have not because of the action of the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of this particular campaign that I think is totally objectionable and totally offensive is that Mr Bull in his correspondence-which, as I say, seems to be part of an orchestrated campaign-is running a very divisive agenda. In the second last paragraph of his correspondence, he says to this particular person:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . each region has a committee that allocates the C.A.P. funds to the schools depending on submissions put to those committees.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why some of the isolated schools on the program cannot still retain all or most of their funding regardless of larger schools coming on to the programme. This will be a decision for the local committee.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is essentially doing is dividing one school in the country against another. That is totally irresponsible, totally divisive and totally dishonest. It should not be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has provided $3.3m to New South Wales under this country areas program in 1991. As we do not run schools, we are happy to leave the detailed administration of the program, including the definition of prescribed areas, to the State Government. However, this sort of dishonesty has to be exposed; this sort of divisiveness has to be rejected. It is unfortunate that, while the opportunity for greater flexibility in Commonwealth-State relations is being fostered by the Special Premiers Conference, these relations are in no way helped by false claims about the Commonwealth's requirements as to our programs.</PARA>

<PARA> The encouragement of growth and activity in the private sector, as we come out of the recession, is a prime aim of the Government. A number of methods can be used to assist with that process and a number of inhibitions to investment in this country have to be tackled by governments. I think that Mr Dawkins was probably referring to those. If the Government has any methods to remove some of those inhibitions-whether they be in the taxation system, in the foreign investment arena or in relation to a range of bureaucratic inhibitions which exist in the area of investment-we will make an announcement about those at the appropriate time, which I hope is as soon as possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided me with the following response. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation commenced operations on 1 July 1990 to support new industries, small industries, and the rural industry in general, through a broad based multi-industry program. It also supports the operations of the semi-independent research and development councils associated with well established but smaller rural industries, such as honey, chicken meat, eggs and tobacco.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The role of the RIRDC is to take a long term view of the research it funds from the sustainable use and management of Australia's natural resources through to end markets and value adding to Australian products. The release of the five-year research and development plan on 6 August was the culmination of 10 months work, during which some 90 industry and research groups, including the National Farmers Federation, were consulted.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of the plan will see the Commission take on an innovative role to stimulate a change in Australia's rural sector. It will be investing in research projects and programs that have the potential to provide a high pay-off to small, emerging or new rural industries which will provide, over time, the opportunity for existing farmers to diversify their operations. Examples of such industries of particular relevance to South Australia are goat fibres, oat and fodder crops, pasture seeds, wild flowers and native plants.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth funding stands at $8.36 million for the current year 1991-92, increasing to $15 million, in 1991 dollars, by 1995-96. These funds will be spent in the following areas: specific industry and research development programs for established industries: for example, pasture seeds, oats and fodder crops, rice and sorghum. These will be designed and implemented to enhance the viability and profitability of these industries. Particular attention will be focused on the creation and expansion of markets, technical skills, ecological sustainability, the development of entrepreneurial capacity, and research and development programs for new and emergent industries, for example, cashews, coffee, deer, essential oils, goat fibres, spices, herbs and teas, tea tree oil, wild flowers and native plants, new grain legumes, new tropical fruits, new plant products and new animal products.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problems of small business are always with us, as Senator Boswell pointed out in an earlier question. The issue raised by Senator Foreman has been raised repeatedly by the small business sector. A number of inquiries, including the recent parliamentary inquiry into small business in Australia, have recommended action to provide greater access for small business to effective protection against unconscionable and unfair trading practices. The Government has now decided to extend to all trading and commercial transactions the principles embodied in section 52A of the Trade Practices Act, which currently relate to consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>

The proposed extension of section 52A will provide small business with access to the same remedies against unconscionable conduct as are currently available to consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government recognises that this reform will not provide universal protection against unfair trading practices. Complementary measures, including industry specific measures and self-regulatory codes may also be necessary to provide protection against potential unfair treatment of small business in particular markets. For example, I have initiated discussions through the oil industry forum about ways to deal with a range of concerns of this type in the petroleum marketing industry. We have had a series of meetings with the industry and representatives of service station owners and so on to discuss those issues. My colleague Mr Beddall, the Minister for Small Business and Customs, has established a franchising task force which will report in November on a self-regulatory code for the franchising industry.</PARA>
<PARA> State Governments are involved in this and State and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for small business have also agreed to examine options for developing common approaches to the regulation of retail and commercial tenancies and improving the protection afforded to small business tenants against unfair dealings. These initiatives provide a clear indication of a willingness to address some of these problems, which are largely generic problems for small business and I think it is important that these initiatives be proceeded with as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most honourable senators would agree that, these days, environmentally conscious Australians will, if the prices of goods are more or less equal, purchase those which do the least possible damage to the environment. They are, therefore, attracted to those goods which bear some sort of logo indicating that the product is environmentally friendly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a difficult matter to judge, in my view, because one may be talking not only of the product but also of the manufacturing or agricultural process which led to the product being available in the marketplace. There is the question of the wrapping or the container in which the product is marketed and how that is disposed of. There is some difficulty with making environmentally friendly claims, but they are made and it is extremely important that consumers feel confident that such claims are not misleading or deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, the Trade Practices Commission has been provided with substantial funds in this Budget, first of all to provide for a guideline to be issued to manufacturers, retailers and so on, so that they can try to avoid the perils of not complying with those sections of the Trade Practice Act which deal with misleading and deceptive advertising. Secondly, resources will be available to ensure that, if a matter is brought to the attention of the Trade Practices Commission indicating that a product has been marketed as environmentally friendly when, in fact, it does not measure up, then vigorous action will be taken to ensure that that non-compliance is dealt with by way of court action resulting in substantial fines of up to $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> All would agree that, when people can exercise their power in the marketplace to ensure that their purchasing is in harmony with their desire to undertake an environmentally friendly decision, we need to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission has the power and the capacity to ensure that any claims which are misleading or deceptive are dealt with by the courts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's appalling youth unemployment figures have generated a new style of creative accounting by Senator Button, who somehow has sought to demonstrate to the chamber that a 29 per cent unemployment rate-the worst recorded in Australia; it may have been worse during the Depression, but we do not know what the figures are-is somehow inconsequential because he has established what proportion of the total population that is. If Senator Button applied the same criteria to the unemployment rate of people over 65, he would also get a quaint figure; in other words, the criteria he is using are absolute nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to demonstrate just how bad the real unemployment figures are because they are far worse than the 29 per cent that Senator Button pretends does not exist. I mention to Senator Button that his Government has instituted a procedure which enables young people aged between 15 and 19 years to stay at school. I must say that I commend aspects of that program because it gives many young people an opportunity to improve their options. However, a very large proportion of those people are being paid to get out of the dole queues. When we look at the jobs for young people that are disappearing, we see exactly how many people are unemployed around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get a feeling of the number of people who are being paid to stay out of the dole queues. In July, there were 100,000-odd young persons under the age of 20 years receiving unemployment benefit of one kind or another. Between January and May of this year, the average number of 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds receiving Austudy was 241,000-2 1/2 times as many people. I concede that a large number of them are people who would have sought Austudy anyway, but surely Senator Button must concede that a large proportion of those 241,000 young Australians are back at school because they could not get a job. That is easily demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an increase in youth employment in recent years before the depths of recession. The figure went up from about 410,000 to 430,000 a couple of years ago and then suddenly collapsed. It is during this collapse of the last two years that people who cannot find jobs have been paid to go back to school and that hides the real impact of youth unemployment. The figures are there, they are evident, and any nonsense that Senator Button comes out with cannot hide the realities. We can see this. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse in the last couple of years in the number of young Australians holding jobs indicates this huge level of hidden unemployment because the job losses have not been offset or accounted for by anything like matching increases in unemployment. On the contrary: there has been a loss of 152,000 jobs for young people in the last two years, and this has resulted in a rise of only about one-quarter of that number in the unemployment level. It has gone up by about 40,000 instead of 152,000 job losses. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the other 112,000 young Australians who simply disappeared from the unemployment figures? There has been a fall in the 15-year-old to 19-year-old population of something like 50,000 over that time, but this still leaves more than 60,000 young Australians unaccounted for, particularly by Senator Button's creative accounting. He is only dealing with people, so maybe he does not take it too seriously. The bulk of the 62,000 young Australians either returned to school funded by Austudy as an alternative to joining the unemployment queues or simply withdrew from the work force, because the rate of participation of young people has collapsed. It has gone from over 60 per cent to around 52 per cent or 53 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If my analysis is correct-which the numbers clearly indicate-then the real full time youth unemployment level is probably around 190,000 in Australia, which gives an appalling unemployment rate of just under 40 per cent for those seeking full time work. On top of this, there is clear evidence of mounting underemployment as the proportion of the total youth work force made up of full time employees has slumped over the past decade from 68 per cent to only 41 per cent, while part time workers have more than doubled from 17 per cent to 37 per cent. As 236,000 full time youth jobs have disappeared-70 per cent of these in the last two years-they have been only partly replaced by 137,000 extra part time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is-and nothing Senator Button says can escape this fact-that there has never been such a bleak outlook for employment for young Australians as part of this engineered recession since the Great Depression. The problem is that this Government does not know what the level or total of youth unemployment will reach. We have asked over and over what the Budget figures, which indicate a 10 3/4 three quarters per cent total unemployment rate, will reach. </PARA>
<PARA> We have yet to find out what this Government is budgeting for in terms of youth unemployment. We presume it knows but simply does not want to tell us because the figures would be so horrific-although there is a prospect that it simply does not know. I fear that that may be the situation because clearly it has yet to work out how to resolve the disastrous recession that it deliberately engineered and the disastrous impact on unemployment-not simply youth unemployment but total unemployment in Australia, which has now reached a dismal record once again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the adjournment debate this afternoon to highlight the situation in my State with respect to persons unemployed, and especially young Australians unemployed. I can do that by reference in the first instance to some Jobstart and Newstart allowance figures. We already know that Australia-wide the number of recipients of the Job Search and Newstart allowances in August increased by 1.2 per cent. It does not sound much but, as we frequently have to repeat in this place, it does not matter what the percentage of unemployment is, if a person is unemployed, he or she is 100 per cent unemployed. The number of recipients on these allowances increased in August by 1.2 per cent. To convert that percentage into a number, we are talking about 8,126 more people needing these allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this instance, I am not referring to the people who are staying at school because they cannot get a job. I am not addressing that question at this time. I am simply stating that over 8,000 more people this month are on various allowances who no doubt do not want to be and would much rather have a job. </PARA>
<PARA> All States, except Queensland, recorded increases in these figures, with Victoria and my State of South Australia recording the biggest increases. My State was only pipped at the post for the shameful honour of coming last by Victoria. We had a 1.9 per cent increase and Victoria-a State managed by a Labor government, as my State is-had a 2.1 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, one of the DSS offices in my State-that is, the Murray Bridge office-recorded an 8.5 per cent jump on July's figures. I know that that figure does not take into account seasonal adjustments and that it does not satisfy a lot of economists-there are times of the year when a jump from one month to another can create a difficulty-but it does at least tell us in plain figures how many people there were one month and how many there are this month. Those people are real people looking for but not able to find work. </PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that there are some differences between those who would have been considered to be receiving the unemployment benefit last year and those who are now considered to be receiving the Job Search and Newstart allowances. Given those differences, the number of Australians `on the dole'-if we want to use the old-fashioned terminology-has increased by 262,393 since August last year. That is a 58.6 per cent increase in one year. In my State of South Australia the figure has jumped by 20,179 from August last year. That represents a 45.9 per cent increase in one year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to some figures on unemployment and unemployment rates, because they can also be instructive. On the one hand, we can look at who is collecting an allowance such as Newstart for training and, on the other, we can look at other figures. In August 1990, there was an unemployment rate of 8 per cent in my State. I see that in August 1991 that unemployment rate is now 10.3 per cent, which represents a shift from 58,300 unemployed last year to 73,500 unemployed this year. That means that thousands and thousands more people are out of work looking for but unable to get jobs. It is a disastrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is compounded very dramatically when we look at young Australians in my State aged 15 to 19. It is a particular category that deserves recognition. In August 1990, 21,500 young Australians in the 15- to 19-year-old category were looking for full time work in my State. In August 1991 there were 27,800. It is a disastrous situation. Over 6,000 more people aged 15 to 19 are unemployed and looking for full time work. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that not long after I came into this place this Government said it would fix this problem. It introduced the traineeship scheme. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-I got into enormous trouble calling him the `silver budgie'-advertised himself on television, saying that in our bicentennial year there would be 75,000 traineeships per annum. That statement has just been forgotten, not only by the media but also by people from your Party, Mr Acting Deputy President. It was a promise to create 75,000 traineeships for young Australians-the people I am talking about now, the 15- to 19-year-olds. Last year, 21,500 of them in my State were looking for jobs; this year, 27,800 are looking for a job. Yet we still have Ministers coming in here daily and telling us that they are pulling the right levers on the economic wheels. It is just an embarrassment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate for too long because I know we are all very keen to return to Estimates committees. I want to make some comments about the effects of unemployment in my home State of Western Australia, particularly with some pertinent comments about young Australians. I see that the galleries today are full of young Australians. They obviously knew that Senator Michael Baume, Senator Vanstone, Senator Patterson and I were going to say something today. I welcome all those young Australians here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must be very trite for young people, particularly young unemployed people, to hear politicians going on about the unemployment rate. Of course, oppositions will always focus on the unemployment rate. If one wanted to be cynical, one could say it is a cheap, cynical political trick, but it is not. Politicians must focus on this national disaster because nearly one million people are unemployed. As Senator Baume said earlier, something like 152,000 young Australians are lost from the statistics. Even the figures do not show where they have gone. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term unemployment problem in Western Australia is my State's biggest problem. It is clearly the result of some of the policies of this Federal Government and some of the policies of the Lawrence, Burke and Dowding Labor governments in Western Australia. Over 38,000 people in Western Australia have not worked for more than six months. This is a very serious problem, because when people are out of work for that long they start to lose self-esteem, confidence, any faith in the future and, indeed, any faith in the very fabric of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few weeks ago, I visited a YMCA shelter for street kids in a suburb called Kelmscott. I spoke to young 14-, 15-= and 16-year-olds who spend their days at the shelter playing pool and ping pong and basically keeping out of trouble. These kids told me about the amphetamine problem in Perth and the fact that people steal videos, cars, television sets, radios, jewellery, purses or whatever they can get to go into Northbridge, around the nightclub districts, and trade these goods for amphetamines. They knock themselves out for a day or two or at a time and then recover for a day or two. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked one of these young chaps, `Do you want to get a job? What's your ambition in life?'. He said, `Yes, I would like to be a carpenter'. Another one said, `Yes, I would like to be a motorbike mechanic'. I said, `That's great. What is your longer term ambition once you have a job?'. He said, `Well, if I got a job I would not have to go around pinching videos. At least I would be able to use my money to buy the amphetamines'. </PARA>
<PARA> I use that terribly sad example of youth in Kelmscott in the Federal electorate of Canning, just down the road from my office, to show that there is a new culture in Australia. When there are a million people unemployed-hundreds of thousands of young unemployed and hundreds of thousands of long term unemployed-society builds a new culture where people just do not look forward to having a job. They do not know what it means, or what family life means. They do not know what it is like to look forward to owning a house, to settling down and having what most of us are lucky enough to call a relatively normal life. This is all happening after eight years of a so-called compassionate Labor Government-a government that is supposed to stick up for the rights of the less well off in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by going through some of the more appalling statistics in some of the worst areas of Western Australia. Figures released today show that in the last 12 months there have been massive increases in unemployment in some specific areas of Western Australia. Albany, a regional town on the south coast of Western Australia, in the last 12 months has seen an increase of 78 per cent in the number of people registered to receive unemployment benefit. Let me take as an example Innaloo, in the Federal electorate of Stirling, represented by Ron Edwards, who won the seat at the last election by 100 votes. I wonder how many of those people reckon they really stuffed it up when they stuck the number one in the box on the ballot-paper only 18 months ago. In Innaloo, which is right in the middle of Mr Edwards's seat, there has been a 73 per cent increase in the number of people registered to receive unemployment benefit. I bet a lot of those people who stuck a number one in Mr Edwards's box last time are now regretting it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the unemployment office in Gosnells, just a couple of miles down the road from my office, in the middle of Mr George Gear's electorate of Canning, there has been a 75 per cent increase in the past 12 months. As Senator Vanstone said, these are not just plain numbers that politicians like to focus on sometimes, whether in terms of elections or when speaking of bodies on the unemployment scrap heap; they all represent people. As Senator Vanstone said, it does not matter whether the rate is 10, 11 or 12 per cent; when one faces this situation one is 100 per cent unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> This requires the earnest appreciation of politicians on both sides of the political fence. It requires policy measures, but clearly this Government has shown an inability to implement them. It requires courage and focusing on the achievement of economic growth for Australia so that we can rebuild hope for all these Australians, particularly Western Australians, who find themselves with little hope of finding employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not take up a great deal of the Senate's time in speaking in this adjournment debate, as we all have to get back to the Estimates hearings. I wish to support what my colleagues have been saying about the unemployment figures, and also to address the issues as they particularly affect the State that I represent, the State of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the figures over all for Australia, we see that there are nearly a million Australians who are out of work. The unemployment rate has risen by about one third-from 7.3 per cent to 9.8 per cent in the last 12 months. One of the most concerning rises has been that from 20 per cent to 29 per cent in youth unemployment. As Senator Campbell said, the young people who are currently here in the galleries are the ones whose hopes are being dashed as they see their friends who have left school unable to get jobs. As that figure rises, there will be more and more of them who cannot get jobs. In August this year there were 709,800 people receiving Job Search allowance or Newstart. Let the public not be deceived by the dressing up of the dole or the unemployment benefit with their new names, because what they represent is 709,800 people receiving a benefit because they do not have a job. This is a record high figure and an increase of 8,100 on last month's record high figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me concentrate on Victoria because it is winning the doldrums stakes. We in Victoria are renowned for races such as the Caulfield Cup and the Melbourne Cup, and we are now winning the doldrums stakes. I regret that, because a Labor Government in Victoria and a Labor Government federally have brought my State to its knees. Only today I was reading in the Age about a small town, Rochester, where people have been thrown out of work because of the closing down of factories following this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria 224,300 people are looking for work. This represents 10.2 per cent of the population. One in every 10 people is looking for a job. A year ago, in August 1990, 147,100 Victorians were looking for work. There are 120,000 more Victorians looking for work now than at this time last year. Unfortunately, in youth unemployment, Victoria heads the States. Youth unemployment is now over 30 per cent, with 30.4 per cent of young people aged 15 to 19 years looking for full time work, compared with 19.3 per cent at this time last year. Only a few months ago I visited a group of young people in a youth organisation in Shepparton. What they were most concerned about was the fact that they would not be able to get a job. There were no jobs for them in Shepparton, and even if they left and came to the city there would not be a job for them. Unlike those of us who grew up in the baby boom where the world was our oyster, these young people now live with this constant threat. How are their ambition and enthusiasm for studying at school affected when they think, `Will I get a job at the end?'. That is the legacy that this Government has left those young people-no hope of a job for one-third of them. </PARA>
<PARA> In August this year there were 179,600 people receiving these newly named unemployment benefits, Job Search allowance and Newstart. This was an increase of 3,860 on the previous month-the largest increase in any State. So we are leading the stakes in youth unemployment and in the increase in the number of people on unemployment benefits. In August 1990, 87,000 people in Victoria were receiving the dole. This means that the number of Victorian beneficiaries has more than doubled in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly interested in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, because that is where I have relocated my office so that people can have better access to a senator in that area. It has been very interesting to focus attention there because it is the unemployment capital of Australia. In 12 months the number of people on unemployment benefits in the seven Social Security offices in the south-eastern Melbourne area that surrounds my office has increased from 14,770 to 36,130. In this area there are 2 1/2 times as many people on the dole this year as there were last year. For every four people who were unemployed in August last year there are 10 this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate an example in Mr Duffy's electorate. As Senator Campbell said, the people who put their tick in the box number one for Mr Duffy may wish they had not done so. In July last year 3,500 people were registered at the Dandenong Social Security office. This is about average for a Social Security regional office. By July this year the number of unemployment beneficiaries had risen to over 9,000, and Dandenong had become the second busiest Social Security office in the country. This month when I looked at the figures I saw they had gone down. I thought that something must have happened. Yes, something happened-a new Social Security office had been opened in Fountain Gate. So the only areas in which employment is increasing are Social Security offices. My advice to people in Dandenong is to get themselves a job in Social Security, because it seems that is where the expansion is.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to Knox, an area in which I spent a good deal of time before Mr Peter Nugent won that seat and now ably represents it. In August last year there were 1,298 people registered at the Knox Social Security office and by August this year the figure had grown to 3,876. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other five offices at Springvale, Oakleigh, Frankston, Cheltenham and Caulfield-many of those offices covered by Hotham; the people who ticked the box for Mr Crean might regret doing so-the situation is only marginally better. In all these offices, the number of unemployment benefit recipients has more than doubled. In Oakleigh and Cheltenham, the numbers have virtually tripled over the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> We can become blase about these figures and forget that there are real people behind them. Only the other day in my office there was a man who, with his wife, has run his own business for 20 years selling commercial washing machines-a solid citizen of Australia, running a small business, employing three people. He was in my office in tears because he could not pay his telephone bill. Here was a man of integrity, a man who had provided for himself for 20 years. He was in tears because he could not pay his telephone bill. His telephone had been cut off. The telephone was the lifeblood of his business. It makes one realise the real tragedy behind unemployment; the real tragedy behind each one of those figures. Each one of those numbers represents an individual who has a story to tell about how he or she is on the scrap heap as a result of this Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is downright self-centred. Although it has been focusing on its leadership squabbles-the Hawke-Keating leadership struggle-it knows full well the sorts of problems and policy paralysis it is causing. We saw that even this week in the amount of legislation coming through this place. The Government is so focused on its leadership struggles that it is not concentrating on legislation, on doing something about turning Australia around and reducing the unemployment levels that it is causing by the recession we had to have-now the unemployment levels we had to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government can take no joy from the unemployment figures released today. In my own State of New South Wales, 9.2 per cent of people are unemployed. This happens to be the lowest in Australia. The Australian figure overall is 9.8 per cent, which is an incredibly high level. Looking at some of the reasons for this figure, particularly the way in which the figure has changed recently, we cannot really give much credence to the statements of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, about the rate slowing, because if we go behind the figures we discover, for example, that in August there was a census collection. Approximately 38,000 temporary staff were hired to collect the census; 11,000 of these people did not have jobs in July and reported that their only employer in August was the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the census collector. Therefore, there is a distortion of about 11,000 in the unemployment statistics for August. If we discount these people, we find that 850,000 did not have a job at the end of August, which is 9.9 per cent of the work force-not the 9.8 per cent claimed by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The number of Australians on the dole in August rose by 8,000 to 709,000. In my own area of the Hunter, 35,000 people are on the dole, which is a rise of 36 per cent since August last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In the Hunter in the last year, 17,000 people have lost their jobs. The unemployment rate in the Hunter has risen from 9.9 per cent a year ago to 11.1 per cent today. If honourable senators think that is bad enough, they should think about the rate for the young people. A year ago, 16,500 were in full time employment; today, only 9,500 are in full time employment. Seven thousand of them have lost their jobs. But saddest of all with the young is to look at the figures of the participation rates. A year ago, 64.9 per cent of young people were in the work force; today, that figure has dropped to 57 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great burden of the unemployment visited upon Australia by the recession has fallen on young people. Just when productive, wealth-creating working lives are supposed to begin, employers have no choice but to put up the shutters. What is the Government doing about this appalling situation? It says that it is worried and concerned. But is it genuinely worried and concerned about the 850,000 people out of work? I remind the Government that that is 850,000 votes it could lose at the next election. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claims:</PARA>
<PARA>The present level of unemployment is totally unacceptable as anything like a permanent feature of our society. It is no part of our policy to allow it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did the Government let it begin? It was this Labor Government policy that put 850,000 people out of work by engineering a recession that it said we had to have. Because the Government has no answers, the Prime Minister has promised the ACTU that it will consider a union proposal to relieve Australia's high unemployment rate. The ACTU charter aims to create an extra 125,000 jobs a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Prime Minister given an undertaking to the ACTU to look at its employment proposals? Because the ACTU has warned Mr Hawke to change the jobs policy now or to lose his job. Martin Ferguson, the ACTU President, does not hesitate to blame the Government. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>We do not meekly accept the consequences of policies which have produced the current level of unemployment. No section of the community will be more vigilant in ensuring that the federal Labor government keeps to its undertakings . . . that the economic recovery will restore sustained growth and secure employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, Bill Kelty, Secretary of the ACTU, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian workers and their unions could bear no blame for the unemployment problem after making substantial sacrifices under the prices and incomes accord. The federal government should adopt a more expansive economic approach balancing growth with continued low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Other comments have been made recently by Labor supporters who are obviously worried about losing their hold on power or losing their seats. John Halfpenny has said, `Labor will be forced out of office if it does not tackle the crisis'. A Labor backbencher, Laurie Ferguson, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment is finally getting the attention of the ACTU and ministers. I think it's pretty pleasing Bill Kelty and John Button have come out of the sleepy hollow. It's late in the day, but I'm pleased they have both come out in support. </PARA>
<PARA>I don't think there is any argument that over the last few years more (help) has been required for unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a Labor government which is not offering any hope to its own members at the next election. But, worst of all, it is not offering any hope to the 850,000 people out of work in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There may be around the corridors of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland today a certain degree of backslapping because it may be deluding itself into believing that the slight improvement in the unemployment situation in Queensland is a cause for celebration. Amongst the unemployed of Queensland, however, the last 12 months on the unemployment treadmill have been no cause for celebration and are a cause for condemnation of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate today to the 12 months change in unemployment in my home State of Queensland. It tells a chilling tale of despair and desperation for thousands upon thousands of good, hardworking Australians who, try as they might, are incapable of finding a job in the recession that this Government, through its ignorance and folly, has imposed upon them. For example, in Cairns in August last year at the start of the recession there were 3,599 people unemployed. What is the figure in August this year? The number of people receiving unemployment benefit in Cairns is 4,974. </PARA>
<PARA> That means that another 1,375 people in Cairns-a 38 per cent increase compared with just 12 months ago-are receiving the unemployment benefit. This is a sign of what the Government has done. But this is not limited to Cairns. The experience in Cairns is typical of what is happening across many towns in regional Queensland and that causes me, as I am sure it does all senators on this side of the chamber, a great deal of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the detailed figures. However, the percentage increases in some selected towns give some good examples of how badly this recession is hurting people-real people and real families. In Mackay the level of unemployment is up 43 per cent on what it was last year. In Mount Isa unemployment is up 28 per cent. About a week and a half ago I was told in Mount Isa that the figure would probably be worse but for the fact that some 50 to 60 people leave that city every week and do not come back because there is no work there for them. In Rockhampton unemployment is up 20 per cent on what it was last year; in Townsville it is up 28 per cent; and in Toowoomba it is up 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an exercise in numbers, economic formula and statistics. This is a measurement of a tragedy, not just for towns and States but for the whole nation. I would like to address, as many of my colleagues on this side of the chamber have done, the grave tale of youth unemployment. It is the people of my generation who suffer most from unemployment.

What we have seen in the 12 months since last year is a massive increase in youth unemployment in Queensland from 20 per cent in August 1990 to 29 per cent in August this year. This means that, in many towns in regional Queensland where the highest levels of unemployment are concentrated, over one in three young Australians aged 15 to 19 cannot find a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Heaven help us in January or February next year when all of the school leavers, like my brother, start looking for a job. What will the youth unemployment rate be by then? I can only say that the figures that have been released today show more than anything else the desperate need for this Government to change its economic policies and once again give hope and opportunity to young Australians and to Queenslanders in particular. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly no pleasure for me to stand in this place today and talk about the very depressing subject of unemployment. It is depressing because, as other senators have said, we have a situation in which 850,000 people are unemployed. We have an unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, of 9.8 per cent. At best, the future of the young people of this country-and we have seen them here in droves today-can be said to be uncertain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst we stand in this place and talk and talk, the people of Australia are in despair because they do not know what is going to happen. Whilst members of the Government are spending their time trying to sort out their leadership problems and whilst there is concern about which faction is winning, time is passing and more and more people are becoming unemployed. If ever Australia needed leadership, that time is right now. I believe that our side of politics will give that leadership. We have the wherewithal and the policies to reverse this terrible trend. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look at my own state of Tasmania, I can understand what happens when leaders do not pull together. Tasmania has a Green-Labor accord. At the moment, the Greens are keeping the minority Labor Government in power. In some ways, I feel sorry for the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Field, because, whatever he tries to do-whatever it is-he is always frustrated by the spectre of the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA> Not a day goes past without one picking up a newspaper and reading that the Greens are changing their minds on resource security legislation. It must be terribly frustrating to anyone, let alone a minority Labor government, to try to give a bit of leadership in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania has the dubious honour of having the highest unemployment rate in Australia. That rate is 11.8 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. In Tasmania 12.3 per cent of the male work force and 11 per cent of the female work force are unemployed. Also, 30.7 per cent of those poor, unfortunate young people-those aged 15 to 19-who are trying to find work just cannot do so. The fact is that 25,900 Tasmanians-or 2,400 more than this time last year-out of our reasonably small population are looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough that the businesses and people of Tasmania are having to put up with the deliberately engineered recession that the former Treasurer foisted upon us. But I believe that the extra percentage of unemployment in Tasmania, which is far above that of anywhere else in Australia, has been caused by the failed and disruptive effect that the Greens are having in our State. I am not the only one who says that. Even today, one of the leading editorial writers on the Examiner is very critical of the Greens leader, Dr Brown, because he keeps changing the goal posts. We know that the Greens get whatever they are looking for. But, as soon as they achieve what they want, they change the goal posts and seek to lock up more of our resources. The editorial writer says:</PARA>
<PARA>Time and again the Greens, whether by accident or by design, give the impression that development is not only bad, but unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk about the latest decision that the Greens have made to back away from supporting the Government. Once again, they are causing uncertainty in our State. As a result, businesses are not working. The Tasmanian Chamber of Mines has said that the Tasmanian Government-and the Greens are included in this and are the main reason for this happening-is giving negative signals. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>These have combined to make investors feel at best, uncertain or at worst, unwelcome. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a tragedy in my State of Tasmania that not only do we have high unemployment figures but also we have a minority government that has been continually frustrated by the Green movement. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some talk about the Australian Democrats and the Greens getting together. I am sorry that Senator Bell is not in the House today but I just hope that, as a Tasmanian who knows what is happening in our State, he opposes such a move. Quite frankly, I think the Democrats would have rocks in their heads if they joined the Green movement in Tasmania. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Senate for any longer than I have to. However, as the Senate will not meet again for another few weeks, I feel that I should say something now about the problems associated with commuter airline services in country New South Wales. I think honourable senators would be, as is the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), very well aware of my continued interest in this subject and the wider issue of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have given some seven notices of motion on the subject. I have raised the matter no fewer than 13 times in the past three years. I have also issued several media releases on the subject and given countless radio interviews. Indeed, this session alone I have asked two questions of the Minister regarding the problems associated with the third runway at Kingsford-Smith airport and the peak period landing charges, and the problems that that has caused to commuter services in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also presented more petitions than any other senator on the questions of peak period surcharges and the third runway for Mascot. The tens of thousands of signatories to those petitions represent a majority of country people who absolutely depend on flights to Sydney to conduct business, to gain access to specialist health services and to visit families. </PARA>
<PARA> For two years now the debate as to whether Sydney airport needs a third runway has dragged on. The genuine needs of air travellers have been overridden by sordid little factional squabbles in an effort to save Labor Party seats around Mascot. To keep the story brief, I have been hounding the Minister over the third runway issue and peak period surcharges. I was concerned then, and remain concerned now, that the viability of commuter aircraft and the viability of the country centres that they service would be at risk if the inefficiencies remained and the efficiencies were not put in place at Kingsford-Smith airport. Such efficiencies, of course, include the third runway as a matter of urgency. As I have said, I have been absolutely pushing that for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I was assured, when I raised the matter in February and again in April this year, that the review of the three-month trial period for peak scheduling would be completed by the end of May. The Minister assured me at that time that it was not designed as a revenue raiser but merely as a regulator. It has certainly been an effective traffic regulator. Last week Hazelton Airlines announced that it would cease services to 14 country centres in New South Wales. It cited the peak period surcharge as one of the reasons that those routes had become non-viable. </PARA>
<PARA> Not surprisingly, the Minister would not concede that the charges had caused bigger problems or more difficulties than had already been there. He did accept, however, that this year alone Hazelton would have to pay $4.2m in government imposts. I believe that, for an airline the size of Hazelton, that is an excessive amount of money to be absorbed and passed on in fares. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the Minister up on one of the answers he gave to me the other day with respect to charges. He said that there was only something like $1.34-I think that was the figure he mentioned-per passenger extra because of the Government-imposed charges. I tell him that for morning and afternoon services Hazelton had to put on $25 per ticket and for night services something like $22 extra per ticket. That is working on 60-odd per cent loading. Obviously, the Minister's figures were a little wrong and out of kilter with respect to the problem it was causing to the airline. The government charges have increased over the last five years to such a degree that in 1986 they represented something like 2 per cent of an average passenger ticket. Today, the charges represent 17.6 per cent or more of an average passenger ticket. How can Hazelton cope with increases of that magnitude and still give the services that it does?</PARA>
<PARA> I divert for a moment to say that Hazelton has been one of the top country airlines in Australia. It is a privately owned airline that has gradually built its way up. The fact that it has had to move away from those 14 airports which it was servicing, albeit replaced in some by other people, is to the great discredit of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The peak period surcharge, I believe, has been one of the big problems. It has been inequitable. Hazelton, of course, using its eight seater or 16 seater planes, pays the same peak period surcharge as a jumbo jet with 300 passengers. Obviously, that must have some bearing on Hazelton's viability, and for the Minister to suggest otherwise is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government demonstrates regularly that it cares little for rural Australia and that it is not prepared to give any sympathetic consideration to the special needs of country commuters. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, should in his commonsense way tell the Government about some of the problems that it is causing to country people. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, any country town that can boast direct daily flights to Sydney can attract companies looking for decentralisation opportunities or, indeed, government and other public instrumentalities wanting to locate a particular regional headquarters or service in that country town. If a country town does not have regular services going to the city in the morning and coming home at night there is not much value in an air service. In my area, it has been replaced by services that just do not work out. Commuters have to stay overnight in Sydney, for example. It costs them something like another $150 to go on a trip to Sydney, whether it be for health reasons or to visit family. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision that has been taken by Hazelton because of these government imposts has resulted in the loss of some 60 jobs within its operations, and job losses in country towns have a much bigger effect than in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne. The multiplier effect has a devastating impact on the people in those country towns. </PARA>
<PARA> For two years I have been trying to warn the Government of the cost of its procrastination on Mascot. I have been fobbed off time and time again with EIS processes, reviews, reports and submissions. It astounds me that in a country like ours we have to go through so many little processes to get a result. The result will be that we need it and the Minister realises that we need it but it will be too late for airlines such as Hazelton. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the ultimate furphy this week with the suggestion that airlines should levy a $5 surcharge on tickets to pay for the insulation of houses in the Mascot area. I think that is the biggest furphy in the world. Under the new proposal for the third runway planes will not fly over any more houses than they do at present. They will fly over a lot of factories before reaching the airport. They will be taking off and landing near the water. That will make it a lot better for the people who live in those areas. All the warnings that I have given over the years about the airport and the need for the third runway have fallen on deaf ears. Now it seems irrelevant because what I said would happen has happened. That has made me feel very sad. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural New South Wales is suffering. Country towns are drying up and the forced withdrawal of services by Hazelton, caused by the Federal Government's procrastination, is assisting this drying up process. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the end of the issue. When more time permits, I intend to raise the matter again. I will continue to raise it until either commonsense prevails in the Cabinet and the third runway gets built or we have the next election and the Labor Government, along with those members whose electorates are around Mascot, is thrown out of office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other senators, I refer to the unemployment figures which were released today. The national figures are quite significant for many thousands of Australians. When we refer to the unemployed in percentages, we tend to forget the number of people who are actually referred to in the figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way the ABC presented the news at 12 noon today prompted me to speak today. The unemployment figure was presented in a way that was supposed to be good news-it is only 9.8 per cent and has not risen from that. To those who still have jobs, of course it is good news because they still have jobs. For those who do not have jobs, there is no good news in it at all. The figure is 9.8 per cent, and that is almost one million Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of young unemployed people particularly causes a great deal of concern. The figures in the ACT are not as high as in some other places. I am grateful for that. The figures show that 5,800 were unemployed in August this year as against 5,200 last year, but that is still a lot of people looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of unemployed young people in Canberra amounts to just on 23 per cent, and many of them have never been able to obtain employment. Canberra has a very high retention rate of school students. Those students stay on to Year 12 because they believe that by doing so their prospects in the future will be much better. I think it is doubly disillusioning for them then to find that they have no prospects of obtaining employment. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra, the situation is also aggravated by considerable delays in getting under way building projects which in fact could be proceeded with if the ACT Government got on with the job that it should be doing. It is not only the ACT Government that is at fault. I refer to the Federal Government's attitude to the York Park project. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you will no doubt remember that last year the commencement of the York Park project and the funding to enable it to proceed was much trumpeted in the Budget as a worthwhile and important building project for Canberra, given that the other large projects had been completed. This year, it was with considerable amazement that I looked at the Budget Papers and found that the York Park project was not even mentioned. When I raised the matter with the Minister at an Estimates committee meeting, he confirmed that it is not going ahead. That is a real blow for the building industry in Canberra which, as honourable senators know, is a very significant source of employment. It is a place where young people do get the opportunity to learn skills. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, in addition to York Park, the ACT Government has not assisted in getting under way a number of other smaller ACT projects. I ask the Minister what is happening to the Customs computer centre and the Tax computer centre. </PARA>

<PARA> Without taking up undue time at this hour, I want to place on record that there is 22.8 per cent youth unemployment in Canberra. With not much going on in the building industry and the Public Service not recruiting, the outlook is pretty grim for young people in Canberra. There are 5,800 looking for full time work and 3,600 looking for part time work. Many of those people are breadwinners. Many of them are in the older category where the prospects of getting jobs are limited in the ACT. I hope that the Government will take notice of these facts and that the ACT Government, too, will move more speedily with the projects with which it can assist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak about the tragic unemployment figures that were released today. This situation is the result of what is left of the Labor Party's socialist philosophy-a philosophy of control, regulation, taxation, the taking away of initiative and the destruction of enterprise. That philosophy arose when this Government was in opposition. In February 1983 it adopted the accord on economic policy between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. At that time, I said that the accord document would prove to be a tragedy for this country. And that is what it has proved to be. The implementation of that agreement with the ACTU has led to the tragic unemployment figures that exist today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not deny that in 1982 the unemployment figures were extraordinarily high. The percentages were probably as high then as they are at the present moment. However, there was a clear reason for that. During the last 18 months or two years of the Fraser Government's term in office, there had been a massive break-out in wages. Certain members of the Australian Labor Party, including then Senator Don Grimes-who, in effect, admitted it in this chamber-urged people in the ACTU and various trade unions to carry out a war of attrition against the Fraser Government by claiming wage increases and going out on strike for no reason whatsoever other than the ultimate objective of getting the Australian Labor Party into office. </PARA>
<PARA> Various members of the Australian Labor Party who contributed to that tragedy then became Ministers in the Government. It is a disgrace that they set about destroying the economy of this country. They pushed that situation until ultimately the unemployment figures and the strike rate had reached certain levels. In due course, the people chose the Hawke Government. After the Hawke Government took office, the strike rate fell enormously in accordance with the prior arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other factors had affected the Fraser Government. There was a worldwide recession that broke shortly after Mr Hawke came to office. There was also an Australia-wide drought, the like of which we had not seen for over 100 years. Shortly after Mr Hawke came to office, that drought broke. </PARA>
<PARA> So the unions had achieved their objective. They had got rid of the Fraser Government and achieved enormous wage increases which meant that there was no need for further wage increases. In his last year of office, Mr Fraser introduced a wages freeze. The benefit of that freeze flowed through into 1984 and created an excellent situation for the economic recovery of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a short history of why unemployment fell enormously in 1984 and 1985. This fall had nothing to do with any of the policies introduced by the Hawke Government. It was a result of the factors that I have mentioned: the Fraser wages freeze; the world recovery from the worldwide recession; the breaking of the drought; and the fact that, because of the wages freeze, moneys flowed through to business. </PARA>
<PARA> Just prior to that election, the Australian Labor Party entered into the accord. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the first page of that accord document, which states, `The party's prime objective is full employment'. In February 1983, the Labor Party and the ACTU entered into an agreement, the prime objective of which was full employment. What do we have in 1991? We have practically 10 per cent unemployment. In fact, the percentage of those who are really seeking work is probably much higher than that. About one million people are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight years ago the prime objective was to achieve full employment. But after eight years in office, the Government is faced with massive unemployment. Clearly, the accord and those philosophies have failed miserably. That agreement criticises the Fraser Government for its policies. It talks about interventionist policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet this document has clearly failed. What happened during 1986-87-and Mr Hawke confessed it the other day-was that the Government tried to do something about the unemployment situation by pump priming. Mr Hawke made a comment along the lines that what we did was to borrow our way out of our difficulties. Mr Kerin has now acknowledged that it is necessary for there to be a deregulation of the wage fixing structure. Even Mr Hawke has finally confessed the failure of the accord by his statement at the ACTU Congress yesterday, in which he said-and I quote from the Australian:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that in the move to a more flexible wages system, it was essential to safeguard workers unable to take part in enterprise bargaining immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke was now putting to the ACTU that there would be an across-the-board wage rise. After all the disaster of the across-the-board wage rises that have occurred under this Government, Mr Hawke is now back to saying that there will be another across-the-board wage rise and, in addition, that there will be some sort of flexible bargaining system over and above the general wage rise. </PARA>

The one million people who are unemployed are to be totally ignored because of this foolish statement by this Prime Minister, confronted by the ACTU, the body that he was associated with when it was trying to destroy the Fraser Government. He went on-and I quote from the newspaper-to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government would not ``allow people to fall away and behind and have standards lowered because of their industrial weakness'' . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What industrial strengths do the unemployed have? How can they go on strike? How can they demand some wage rise? I find this to be one of the most extraordinary statements I have heard or read from this Prime Minister. He has made some extraordinary statements over his period in office and when he was President of the ACTU. All he is doing when he is talking to the ACTU is saying to them, `We will protect those of you who remain in employment. That is what we will look after. We will make sure that if you have a job your wages will not fall in real levels at all. We will maintain the standard of your wages so long as you have got a job'. The fact that his policies will continue to maintain an unemployment rate of about 10 per cent for the next 12 months or so is just completely ignored. What chance have these people got of getting back into work?</PARA>
<PARA> I was told recently about a young lass who graduated from an institution with a qualification in interior decoration. As I understand it, 400 people around Australia graduated with a similar qualification last year, but only five jobs were available in that sort of work. That is the sort of nonsense this Government is going on with. Under its educational policy system, the Government is pushing people into doing courses at institutions, but when they graduate from those courses the poor kids discover that there are no jobs available. They have spent four years of their lives trying to get a qualification and there are no jobs in that industry when they qualify. This Government needs desperately to address its mind to the unemployment problems of the nation and find some reasonable solution to those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not sure whether I would respond to this manufactured display of concern that has come from the Opposition benches, but Senator Lewis has persuaded me to do so, for two reasons. One reason is the very gracious thing he said about me yesterday; the other is the speech he has made today, with which I entirely disagree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thing that some Opposition senators have said, with which I do agree, is that one person unemployed is one too many. Honourable senators spoke about their concern that, irrespective of the rate of unemployment, for those individuals who are unemployed they are 100 per cent unemployed. That is not exactly an original line. I think it goes back to Harold Wilson in 1963 or 1964. It is no less accurate for being somewhat antiquated. </PARA>
<PARA> We all need to remember that, even when we had much better unemployment figures, as we did in the years when the Government's economic policy was the undoubted success that it was for the first 6 1/2 to seven years when 1 1/2 million jobs were created and unemployment fell substantially, the pain was no less then for the individuals who were unemployed. It is a little difficult to sit quietly and hear people come in one after the other and express attitudes of outrage that we have a high rate of unemployment when they also sit calmly behind a leader and an Opposition that advocates policies which would destroy jobs and cut the benefits to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also annoying when one hears from time to time people saying that the Government needs to tighten fiscal policy and cut Government spending but also seeking increased expenditure in various areas of activity, as we have heard on several occasions today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am actually talking about someone else's contribution, but Senator Brownhill's point is also accurate. The honourable senator may want to admit that some expenditure increases are justified-some of the others to which I am alluding were also justified proposals-but we cannot reduce the total level of expenditure and increase every bit of it. We have the old conservative policy of solving unemployment by getting rid of jobs; of solving inflation by jacking up prices; and of improving workers' living standards by cutting their wages. We cannot have all those, yet that is exactly what we have had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have the GST which will put up prices; we have the cutting of $4.7 billion from outlays which will cost 46,000 jobs; and we have the continuing concern that the 7 1/2 million people who are in employment might get an increase in wages. I think the trends for the recovery are apparent. They are all too painfully slow for those individuals who are unemployed-the human concern that is being expressed is shared by everybody-but, as we find the increase in jobs reflected in this month's figures, the improvements in housing, the improvements in business expectations and the improvements in retail sales, there is no doubt that the signs of the recovery are on the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> We all wish it would come more quickly, but what we need now are not policies to cut government spending by $4.7 billion and abolish 46,000 jobs, not policies to introduce a GST to put up prices, and not policies which attack the wages system, but policies to sustain and maintain that recovery which is under way. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do not wish to conclude without acknowledging the validity of the somewhat separate point raised by Senator Brownhill. I do not agree with his views, but I respect the consistency with which he has advocated that position. I am sure I do not need to draw it to the Minister's attention; I am sure he is already well aware of it. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that he has made that point on a continuing basis. I could not allow that series of speeches, which fly directly in the face of the positions of those advocating the policies, to go unremarked. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is the Australia Council's practice to deal with all applications for grants on the basis of individual merit in competition with other applications received.  With regard to project grants, amounts of grants are determined by consideration of the application amount, its relevance to the success of the project and the availability of funds.  This practice is common to all areas of Council and is the basis for determining the grant amount in each of the individual cases listed below.</PARA>
<PARA>Study of Bookreading and Borrowing in Australia (Policy and Research) $16 000</PARA>
<PARA>    This was a major research project commissioned by the Australia Council. Tenders were called and the successful tender was Economic Strategies Pty Ltd. The total cost was $50 000 with payment spread over two financial years.</PARA>
<PARA>    It was a statistical study of the public's use of books in Australia, based on three surveys conducted in 1990, one of book buyers, one of library users and one household survey.  It includes information on book reading, book buying, library usage and detailed information about Australian books especially Australian books in public libraries.  It also includes summary information about the book industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>    The resulting report was published by the Australia Council, with some copies distributed free and the balance on sale through D W Thorpe.</PARA>
<PARA>Survey of Public Attitudes to the Arts, 1990 (Policy and Research) $20 000</PARA>
<PARA>    This was a research project commissioned by the Australia Council from the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, University of Melbourne, following the interest shown in two similar studies undertaken by the Institute in 1988 and 1989.  The amount was determined on a quote from the Institute which sought competitive quotes for the field work.  The Institute was originally chosen by the Council because of its work with a comparable social opinion analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>    Issues covered in the household survey included: defining the arts, knowledge of the arts, the arts on television, value and uses of the arts, arts occupations and skill, arts occupation and income, funding of the arts. The resulting report was published with detailed appendices.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Tourism Exchange (Advocacy) $42 790</PARA>
<PARA>    Two amounts initially expended in the areas of Cross Art-Form Activities ($6940) and Music Performance-International Touring ($33 060) were on analysis, found to be more appropriately described as 'Advocacy Travel'. However, a posting error resulted in these two amounts, totalling $40 000, being allocated to the above entry.  The amount spent on the Australian Tourism Exchange in 1989-90 was $2790.</PARA>
<PARA>    The Australia Council allocated $10 000 to provide a display and information on the arts in Australia at the Australian Tourism Exchange, held in Sydney on 22-25 June 1990.  Of this amount, $2790 had been expended by the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>    The Council's participation at the Exchange focused on the marketability of Australian art, especially Aboriginal art, and the provision of a quick and easy reference guide for the travel industry on capital city arts facilities: 'A Quick Guide to the Australian Arts'.</PARA>
<PARA>    This is part of a long term strategy for promoting Australian arts and culture as part of the tourism experience.  It will result in a much greater awareness of the arts by the tourism industry, as well as increasing the potential for arts organisations to take advantage of tourism markets.</PARA>
<PARA>National Ideas Summit (Council Projects) $42 747</PARA>
<PARA>    In December 1989 the Australia Council agreed to organise and host an 'Ideas Summit' to discuss how new ideas could play a part in producing a more productive and creative Australian nation.  Provision was made in the budget for the cost of consultants, venue hire, guest speakers' travel and publications.</PARA>
<PARA>    The National Ideas Summit was held in the Senate Chamber of Old Parliament House on 26 February 1991.  It was attended by 300 participants and observers representing a wide range of disciplines from around Australia.  The four sessions explored the roles of scientists, the art, universities and publishing/broadcasting in Australian intellectual and cultural life.</PARA>
<PARA>    The Summit focused attention on changing the perceptions of Australia from a 'Lucky Country' to a 'Clever Country'.  Extensive interest from the general public and the media demonstrated that the issues being raised and discussed were of national concern.  Two conference reports were prepared and widely distributed, and following the Summit two forums have been held to explore in more detail some of the issues raised.  A major outcome of the Summit has been the establishment of the 'Ideas for Australia' program.</PARA>

<PARA>    The program undertaken was a five-week Creative Development project to incorporate South East Asian influences into a presentation of 'The Tempest'. This was a collaborative activity undertaken between a director, dramaturg, choreographer, Gamelan teacher and seven actors.</PARA>
<PARA>    The work resulted in a 'work-in-progress' showing at Sydney University in early 1991.  A subsequent Performance Project application to extend this work was submitted to the Australia Council, but it was not approved because the funds were not available.</PARA>
<PARA>King, Peter (Drama - Performance Project) $45 000</PARA>

<PARA>    The program undertaken was a series of 14 concerts featuring Indian musicians of the Academy of Indian Music and Cultural Studies.  In addition, the project stimulated interest in the Indian Classical artform.</PARA>
<PARA>Union of Australian Turkish Workers (Music Performance Project) $3000</PARA>

<PARA>Buckley, Brad (Overseas Development Studio Stipend) $30 000</PARA>
<PARA>    Brad Buckley was one of nine artists short- listed for a 1990 Overseas Fellowship Residency at the Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA), New York, by the Professional Development of Artists Committee of the Visual Arts/Craft Board in February 1990.  The short-list was forwarded to the ICA where its own assessment committee selected Brad Buckley for the residency.</PARA>
<PARA>    The amount paid to Brad Buckley is the standard level ($30 000) set by the Visual Arts/Craft Board for all its Fellowships.  Fellowship grants seek to give support to established artists with a substantial record of professional activity and achievement, including at least ten years of independent practice.  The amount is set at a rate intended to allow recipients to have twelve months away from the pressures of earning a living in order to concentrate on the development of their art practice.  In the case of Overseas Fellowship Residencies, the Fellowship takes the form of a stipend which accompanies a year's residency at one of the Board's overseas studios.  The amount is set at comparable levels to Fellowships offered by the Australia Council's other Boards and Committees.</PARA>
<PARA>    The ICA is a centre for contemporary artists with studios for fifty artists who are funded by the governments of their own countries (eg Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden).  The ICA provides studio space for the artists and the Board maintains an apartment for the accommodation of the artists and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>    Brad Buckley used the studio for the period 3 September 1990 to 4 August 1991 to develop his work as a sculptor and installation artist.</PARA>
<PARA>    Brad Buckley has just completed his residency at the ICA.</PARA>
<PARA>Valamanesh, Hossein (Overseas Development Studio Stipend) $30 000</PARA>
<PARA>    Hossein Valamanesh was one of the artists short-listed for a 1990 Overseas Fellowship Residency at the Kunstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin, by the Professional Development of Artists Committee of the Visual Arts/Craft Board in February 1990.  The short-list was forwarded to the Kunstlerhaus where its own assessment committee selected Hossein Valamanesh for the residency.</PARA>
<PARA>    As with Brad Buckley (see previous entry) the amount paid to Hossein Valamanesh is the standard level ($30 000) set by the Visual Arts/Craft Board for all its Fellowships.</PARA>
<PARA>    The Kunstlerhaus provides a residential studio space for artists drawn from various countries.  The Kunstlerhaus is operated under the auspices of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service).</PARA>
<PARA>    Hossein Valamanesh has the studio from 1 December 1990 to 30 November 1991.  While there, his intention is to develop his work as a sculptor within the German context;  meet and communicate with German and other international artists;  and work in three dimensional collage and construction using materials gathered within the local environment</PARA>
