<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Paul,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the staff at Lipscombe Child Care Centre, write to ask for your support in stopping the legislation to come before the Senate in the near future, which deals with the new two-tiered fee relief for Children's Services throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine has indicated to us, the Service Providers, that if possible (depending on the wording of the legislation) he will move a motion of disallowance to prevent this legislation being passed in its present form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed new system discriminates against the non-working parent or the single income family. Fees for this section&mdash;category 2 will double and in some cases triple.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been little and in some instances no consultation with peak child care bodies throughout Australia, and Tasmania was simply forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administration to implement the new system is beyond the resources of most services which are already stretched to the limit in every area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a real concern that utilisation of services will drop, as parents will no longer be able to pay the price of quality care. This will mean some services, particularly in the areas of Brighton, Clarendon Vale, Rokeby and the Huon will close.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA  ACT  2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No.266, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 17 October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raises several points about the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Regulation 13 provides that an eligible voter may request a secret ballot. However, there appears to be no provision which requires such voters to be notified of this right. It may be reasonable to include information about this right in the notice fixing the election date and calling for nominations under r.7 or perhaps in the notice relating to the declaration of nominations under r.11.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)There may be a conflict between r.19(1) and r.24(c). Regulation 19(1) requires a voter to mark the ballot-paper to indicate his or her preference by placing the number "1" in the box opposite the voter's choice. Thus, r.19(1) does not provide an option; the voter must use a number "1" for the vote to be valid. It is not possible for the voter validly to put a tick, a cross, an "aye", a "yes", or any other indication of choice. However, r.24(c) provides that "a ballot-paper is informal if (among other things) it is so imperfectly marked that the intention of the person who marked the ballot-paper is not clear". Under this provision an intention could be made quite clear by using a tick, for instance, but it would be invalid under the strict provisions of r.19(1) which require a number "1".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)Regulation 27(2)(b) provides that in conducting a recount of votes the returning officer, in the case of a poll not by secret ballot, may make any reasonable decision in respect of the allowance or disallowance of a vote cast in the poll. Regulation 28(1) provides that in certain circumstances the returning officer may declare an election to be void. Some criteria are provided for the exercise of these discretions. Thus, in both cases the decision must be reasonable or on reasonable grounds. Also, r.28(2) limits and guides the discretion in r.28(1). However, r.28(2)(c) itself includes a subjective discretion, requiring the returning officer to decide if it is "just" that an election be declared void. The Committee asks whether there are appropriate external review procedures of the merits of these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)There is a typographical error in r.9(2)(c).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)Regulation 29(2) provides only that after the poll the returning officer must notify the candidate who has been elected. There is no provision for notifying the unsuccessful candidates, and apparently not even a requirement that the result should be publicly notified and displayed in the way that the holding of the election and the notification of the nominated candidates are required under rr.7 and 11. If this is the case, it would seem to be an important omission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)Regulation 29(2) refers to paragraph 25(1)(a). There is no such paragraph, but there is a paragraph 25(a). However, the reference should be to r.25 in toto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)Regulation 32(3) appears to lack the word "and" after the word"certificate" in the third line. There is also a typographical error in that line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h)Regulation 34 provides that certain notices issued by an investigator must be in the "approved form". These notices cover some very important matters such as taking possession of plant, issuing prohibition notices and issuing improvement notices. These forms, covering matters which could be at least as serious as search warrants, are not set out in the Regulations, but are provided by r.2 to be in a form provided by the Commission. In contrast, under r.30, the possibly less important provisional improvement notice "must be set out in accordance with the Form in Schedule 1". This Form is very full and, in addition to specifying the relevant facts and action required, gives the relevant statutory provisions and their effect. The Committee considers that even search warrants issued by Judges should be in a prescribed form. It would seem suitable to provide for such forms in the Regulations themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be appropriate for the Regulations to be amended to meet these concerns of the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA   ACT   2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to my letter of 11 November 1991 concerning the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Regulations, Statutory Rules No.266 of 1991. I am now in a position to respond more fully to the Committee's concerns which were set out in your letter of 18 October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset I should inform the Committee of the circumstances in which the election provisions of the Regulations will be utilised as it appears to be these provisions which have caused the most concern to the Committee. Under section 25 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991</EMPHASIS> (the Act) secret ballots for the election of health and safety representatives will only occur where there is no union presence in a workplace. Such a circumstance in workplaces covered by the Act would be rare. The election provisions in the Regulations are, therefore, expected to be used only in respect to isolated workplaces with few employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has commented that, although an eligible voter may request a secret ballot under r.13, there is no requirement in the Regulations for voters to be notified of this entitlement. In this respect I draw the Committee's attention to the requirement in r.7(1)(b) that the notice calling for nominations must include notification of the last date upon which a request for a secret ballot may be made. It was considered that this was sufficient to draw to the attention of voters the entitlement to a secret ballot. If the Committee does not regard this provision as sufficient notice I am prepared to amend r.7 to ensure that the entitlement to request a secret ballot is highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also raised the question whether a conflict exists between the provisions of r.19(1) and r.24(c). I do not consider that there is such a conflict. A voter is required to mark the ballot paper with the number 1. Even though the ballot paper may be marked with the number 1 the voter's intention may not be clear, for example if every box on the ballot paper were to be marked with the number 1. It is not intended that the provision contained in 24(c) allow some other method of indicating a preference than that provided in r.19. The provision in r.24 provides only that a vote will be considered informal if the voter's intention is not clear. The ballot paper must be marked with the number 1 in order for a valid vote to be cast. Regulation 24(c) does not, and was not intended to, allow for an additional means of indicating the voter's preference to that provided in r.19.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In answer to the Committee's question concerning the availability of appropriate review mechanisms for decisions of returning officers I can advise that no such mechanism is currently provided. I understand the Committee's concerns in relation to this matter and undertake to have the Regulations amended to provide for a review of a decision of a returning officer by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Given that the relevant provisions will be rarely used and that a review will be unlikely I do not believe that such a provision will unduly burden the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Committee's concern that r.29(2) does not provide for notification of the results of an election for a health and safety representative I draw the Committee's attention to subsection 25(9) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991</EMPHASIS> which provides for the timely display of a notice in the workplace for the purpose of informing employees of the selection (including by election) of a health and safety representative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted the Committee's concerns about notices under Regulation 34 being required to be in an `approved form' rather than prescribed in the Regulations. While I do not share the view that the relevant notices are in the same category as search warrants, I accept that the notices are of a serious nature. I will, therefore, amend the Regulations to ensure that the forms are prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will also be made to correct the minor drafting errors detected in r.9(2)(c), r.29(2) and r.32(3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the Committee for drawing these matters to my attention and trust that I have been able to allay the Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Order No.L10/91, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 7 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Order substituted a new Form L which gives information relating to the consignment of live-stock by ship or aircraft. Clause 4.3(b) provides that the original copy of Form L must be posted to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation no later than the first working day after the departure of the particular consignment to which it refers. However, Clause 4.5(c) provides that, if the number of stock changes or the destination of part or all of the consignment changes, the licensee must send an amended Form L to the Corporation by facsimile transmission no later than the first working day after the consignment arrives at the final port of discharge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee asks why the amendment is required to be sent by facsimile when the original only need be posted. In this context the Explanatory Statement advises that the purpose of Form L is to provide the Corporation with "statistical information which is used for the purpose of market analysis and determining the levies payable by reporters".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that the instrument may force each licensee to obtain a facsimile machine to send amendments of a Form, the original of which may be sent by post, with the whole Form being used only for statistical purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that it may be appropriate for the instrument to be amended to provide that changes to Form L may be posted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be that there are particular reasons for the urgency attached to amendments of the Form and we would welcome your advice on this. However, if this is the case the Committee would like to be assured that the instrument is not likely to impose additional costs on primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your advice would be appreciated.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA   ACT   2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 7 November 1991 to the Minister for Resources, the Hon Alan Griffiths MP, concerning Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) Order No.L10/91. Matters relating to the administration of the AMLC fall within my responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You questioned the need, under Clause 4.5(c), for an amended Form L to be forwarded to the AMLC by facsimile rather than post if the number of stock changes or the destination of part or all of the consignment changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As stated in the Explanatory Statement, Form L provides the Corporation with statistical information which is used for the purpose of market analysis. This information forms the basis of market intelligence which is provided to licensed exporters by the Corporation and, given the nature of the trade, needs to be provided quickly if the industry is to take full advantage of the opportunities that open up to it. Past experience has shown that amendments sent by mail will not necessarily reach the Corporation in time for it to perform this function in a completely effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further function of Form L is to provide the Corporation with a means of monitoring compliance by exporters with other Orders and Directions issued by the Corporation, in particular to ensure that shipments are not diverted to markets that have restrictions placed on them. For example, earlier this year a shipment of live sheep was diverted to Saudi Arabia in contravention to an Order that had been issued by the Corporation. You will appreciate that such a situation may have significant animal welfare implications should the shipment be rejected and as such it is important that the Corporation be immediately aware of any proposed amendments to the original intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation is also conscious of the possibility of imposing additional costs on exporters. Before putting the Order into effect the Corporation circulated it to licensed exporters and surveyed the ownership of facsimile machines amongst licensees. The survey found that of 108 licensed exporters, 105 owned a facsimile machine. The remaining three licensees are not active exporters. I should also point out that the requirement to forward amendments to the Corporation by facsimile does not necessarily mean that the licensee must own a machine, given that facsimile facilities are available at Post Offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope this has satisfied your concerns, and I thank the Committee for its interest in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standards) (Cosmetics) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No.327.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For information, I attach a copy of a representation in respect of the Regulations which the Committee has received from the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association of Australia. The Committee considered the representation at its meeting of 28 November 1991. I will write to you again in respect of the Regulations when the Committee has had the opportunity to consider them in more detail. In the meantime, perhaps you could consider the points raised by the representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since it appears that our correspondence on this matter will not be completed until the Autumn Sittings 1992, I will place a protective notice of disallowance on the Regulations. However, at this point such a move will be purely procedural, being intended only to keep the matter before the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 29 November 1991 regarding the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standards) (Cosmetics) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No.327.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attached to your letter was a copy of a representation from the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association of Australia (CTFAA) requesting that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances consider requiring the inclusion in the Regulations of a mandatory nomenclature based on the United States Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) Dictionary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of specifying the nomenclature of ingredients of cosmetics was considered at length and discussed with a wide range of consumers and suppliers during the development of the Regulations. A nominated dictionary of chemical names, or other nomenclature, has the advantage of being very specific but this may restrict the provision of meaningful information to consumers, which is contrary to the primary purpose of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have carefully reviewed the CTFAA's representations and remain of the opinion that the CTFA Dictionary should not be included as the mandatory nominated nomenclature in the Regulations, at this stage, for the following major reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The Regulations do not specify any nomenclature. However, guidelines will be issued which will encourage suppliers to choose the nomenclature which gives consumers the clearest and most meaningful information about ingredients. The first preference for nomenclature, therefore, is that an ingredient should be identified by the name generally recognised by consumers. Ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, herbs and animal or marine products should be identified by their common name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The second preference is for the ingredients to be identified by a chemical or other technical name or description using a recognised reference (such as the CTFA Dictionary or the Draft Australian Approved Names for Pharmaceutical Substances) where a common name is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-Use of the CTFA Dictionary is wide-spread in North America and Japan but is not universal. The European Community, in particular, has not finalised its nomenclature. It would be premature for Parliament to make the nomenclature of the CTFA Dictionary mandatory in Australia. Moreover, the Regulations do not prevent members of the CTFAA from using the CTFA Dictionary on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-There is some opposition within Australia to the adoption of the CTFA Dictionary because of a preference for the use of the Draft Australian Approved Names for Pharmaceutical Substances;  and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The CTFA Dictionary costs over $600 per copy with possible subsequent costs for amendments. I am mindful of the need to avoid imposing additional costs upon industry and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware, however, that there is a genuine concern both by some industry members and some consumers that a mandatory nomenclature would be desirable. I have asked the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to monitor the Regulations and if it appears that problems with nomenclature are being experienced within the first 12 months of the Regulations becoming effective, then the matter will be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist the Committee's deliberations, I have included in the Attachment some additional background information about the nomenclature of ingredients in cosmetic products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please let me know if I can be of further assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE TRADE PRACTICES (CONSUMER PRODUCT INFORMATION STANDARDS) (COSMETICS) REGULATIONS,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATUTORY RULES 1991 NO.327</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed regulations were first issued in draft form for public comment in December 1990. The draft regulations contained the following suggested hierarchical structure, in descending order, for the naming of ingredients used in cosmetic products:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the United States Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) Dictionary;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-US Pharmacopoeia and supplements OR the European Pharmacopoeia and supplements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the accepted chemical name in the Chemicals Abstraction Service nomenclature OR in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-if the ingredient is a colour but is not listed in the CTFA Dictionary, the publication Society of Dyers and Colourist Index;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-Draft Australian Approved Names for Pharmaceutical Substances;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-US Approved Names and the US Pharmacopoeia Dictionary of Approved Names with cumulative lists;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the chemical or other approved technical name or description.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nomenclature was specified because of earlier representations from the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association of Australia (CTFAA) who claimed that the majority of cosmetic companies in Australia were at that time already using the CTFA Dictionary as the main source for nomenclature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responses to the public consultation process indicated that the suggested nomenclature posed a number of difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the above order of preference followed the CTFAA's suggestion, some officials of the Australian Society of Cosmetic Chemists preferred the Draft Australian Approved Names for Pharmaceutical Substances as the first choice. There are some differences between the names in the CTFA Dictionary and the names for the same compounds in the Draft Australian Approved Names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nomenclature in the European Community is different again to both the CTFA Dictionary and the Draft Australian Approved Names. European exports to the United States must comply, however, with the US requirements and follow the CTFA Dictionary. It is understood that the European Community is currently developing a uniform nomenclature for cosmetic ingredients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a letter of 6 November 1991 to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the CTFAA notes that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There are several different nomenclatures operating around the world.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The CTFA Dictionary nomenclature has been adopted in the USA, Canada and Japan and is now being modified to include European chemical names and thus will be eventually used throughout the EC.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Since most of the countries which export cosmetics to Australia already use this nomenclature. . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be noted that the CTFAA admits that there are several different nomenclatures; that the CTFA Dictionary has only been adopted by the USA, Canada and Japan; and that only a majority of Australian cosmetic imports are labelled according to the CTFA Dictionary. The CTFAA's confidence that the European Community will adopt the CTFA Dictionary could prove misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An additional difficulty centres around the proliferation of small Australian suppliers who are not members of the CTFAA and who may use ingredients not listed in the CTFA Dictionary. It has not been ascertained whether all ingredients used in Australia are listed in the CTFA Dictionary, eg eucalypt oils, ti tree oils, and goanna oils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 20-month period from January 1988 to November 1989 the value of cosmetics imported into Australia was $189m. Imports from European Community countries totalled close on 50% of all imports whilst the US accounted for only about 20% of all imports. This also may have implications for nomenclature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the CTFAA has some interest in promoting the CTFA Dictionary. US members of the CTFA are already using that Dictionary and it would be more convenient for those companies if the US nomenclature was made mandatory in Australia. If the Dictionary was mandatory all suppliers would be forced to adopt it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales of the Dictionary, which costs over $600 plus amendments, are a source of income to the CTFA and possibly the CTFAA. It is not known whether sales of the Dictionary or the application of the Dictionary are limited in any way to members of the CTFA or CTFAA. Such a restriction, if it exists, may have restrictive trade practices implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To compound the above difficulties of nomenclature, a number of consumers have said that they want meaningful information and not a long list of complex chemical names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons a nomenclature requirement was not included in the Regulations. Guidelines are to be issued with the Regulations stating, inter alia, that the primary purpose is to provide meaningful and clear information to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines as currently proposed state:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Suppliers are encouraged to choose nomenclature for the ingredient labelling of cosmetics which will provide consumers with the clearest and most meaningful information.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Thus an ingredient would most usefully be identified by the name generally recognised by consumers. Ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, herbs and animal or marine products may be identified by their common name.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Where a common name is not suitable, it would be preferable for the ingredient to be identified by a chemical or other technical name or description. The preferred sources in naming ingredients are the United States Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association Dictionary and the Draft Australian Approved Names for Pharmaceutical Substances.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If the above two preferred sources do not contain the nomenclature of an ingredient, reference may be made to the US or European Pharmacopoeias, Chemical Abstraction Service nomenclature, or the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature, the Society of Dyers and Colourists Index, the US Approved Names and the US Pharmacopoeia Dictionary of Approved Names.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If an ingredient is not listed in the above sources, the ingredient may be identified by a chemical or other technical name or description.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has been drawn up to allow for acts of conscience by public sector employees when they uncover acts of gross fraud and corruption in Government. It seeks to establish a Whistleblowers Protection Agency, headed by a Commissioner, which will have powers to investigate claims of corruption within government or government agencies by Commonwealth employees or by any member of the public. Protection is also extended to consultants engaged by the Government or its agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agency established by this Bill will have two major functions: to investigate allegations of wrongdoing within government and its agencies, and to protect those employees or members of the public who make such allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agency will have the power to receive and investigate allegations from any member of the public (not just Commonwealth employees) about serious wrongdoing involving federal government employees up to, and including, the Prime Minister. Allegations to be investigated would include  violations of law, gross mismanagement, gross waste of public funds, abuse of authority, substantial and specific danger to public liability or safety, or a failure to act lawfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill seeks to protect former, current or prospective Federal Government employees who believe they are being harassed or discriminated against because they blew the whistle (or are believed to have blown the whistle). Remedies include re-instatement, ex-gratia payments, and, where appropriate, damages. The remedies will need to be enforced by the Federal Court, and the Agency will have the power to apply to the court for orders or injunctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Whistleblowers Protection Agency will also have the power to recommend disciplinary action or, for severe cases, criminal action against government employees responsible for the harassment or discrimination against whistleblowers. The Bill also seeks to protect whistleblowers from any legal action as a result of the allegations they make to the Agency. This protection would be extended whether or not the allegations were disproved, but not if they were deliberately false or misleading. A person making false and misleading claims would be criminally liable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A complaint to the Agency will only be made public if it is found to be true. The Agency will also publish details of all complaints in its annual report which will be tabled in Parliament. However, only the full details of substantiated and true claims will be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission Act 1902, the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986 all contain some provision for individuals to make complaints about government breaches of ethical standards. However, none of these pieces of legislation were specifically intended to offer protection to whistleblowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has provisions to guard against claims which are made for personal gain, or which are frivolous or deliberately malicious. These provisions will include criminal liability for any person making a false claim to the Agency. In a recent article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS>, Mr J.G. Starke pointed out: "the whistleblower must have reasonable grounds for believing that a crime or civil wrong has taken place or will take place; and there must be evidence of good faith on the part of the whistleblower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will complement the existing defences for whistleblowers under common law and will provide some protection for them legally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Government and public sector processes have been governed by official secrecy for over a century. Breaches of this secrecy have at times attracted criminal liability and, historically, no defence of public interest has been entertained. In Commonwealth legislation alone there are as many as 150 secrecy provisions which penalise the unauthorised disclosure of information. Possibly the most ubiquitous of these is section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which imposes a two year prison sentence for any unauthorised disclosure of information by a current or former Commonwealth employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some degree, the advent of Freedom of Information legislation and certain privacy laws have challenged the notion of official secrecy. But unfortunately, official secrecy is a shield still used by our present political institutions. The very first public service regulations passed in this country in colonial Victoria in 1867 set the pattern for what was to come in all jurisdictions&mdash;an official could only disclose information if the disclosure was part of official duty or made with the consent of a Minister. As a result, all jurisdictions with the exception of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia made it a criminal offence for officials to disclose information they were bound to keep secret. Our legal system needs to be altered to protect acts of conscience that are expressed in the exposure of illegal or improper practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been moves to introduce some form of whistleblowers protection through state based anti-corruption authorities in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia. Legislation is urgently needed at the Federal level because the community demands that government and bureaucracy should not be above the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scandals relating to State Government corruption in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia may have never occurred had individuals been empowered to blow the whistle on corrupt practices. In all cases, some Government employees knew what was going on, but kept quiet. Had they felt protected by law, some of them may have been encouraged to tell the truth, saving taxpayers millions of dollars and preventing political and private sector practices from becoming so debased that the public, to a large degree, lost confidence in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the Criminal Justice Commission and the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission have just finalised a report recommending state legislation allowing for whistleblowers. The former Corruption Commissioner, Tony Fitzgerald Q.C., drew attention to what he called an "urgent need" for whistleblowers legislation. In his Report released on 3rd July 1989, on public administration and criminal justice in Queensland, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>"It is enormously frustrating and demoralising for conscientious and honest public servants who work in a department or instrumentality in which maladministration or misconduct is present or even tolerated or encouraged. It is extremely difficult for such officers to report their knowledge to those in authority. Even if they do report their knowledge to a senior officer that officer might be in a difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be no-one that can be trusted with the information. If either senior officers and/or politicians are involved in misconduct of corruption, the task of exposure becomes impossible for all but the exceptionally courageous or reckless, particularly after indications that such disclosures are not only unwelcome but attract retribution. Strong honest leadership is one step which is essential to a build-up of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an urgent need, however, for legislation which prohibits any person from penalising any other person for making accurate public statements about misconduct, inefficiency or other problems within public instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fitzgerald went on to argue, "It is necessary to establish a convenient means by which public officers can disclose matters of concern. What is required is an accessible, independent body to which disclosures can be made, confidentially&mdash;at least in the first instance&mdash;and in any event free from fear of reprisals."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protection for whistleblowers should be an important element of modern government because this encourages employees to be a part of maintaining honest, effective and accountable government. Employees who blow the whistle on either a private corporation or government, although this legislation deals only with government, are often persecuted and eventually sacked, yet they have usually blown the whistle as an act of conscience with the greater good of society in mind. They are in fact, ethical resisters. By protecting whistleblowers, we enable individuals to make an ethical choice between their responsibility to society generally and their obligations to their employers. To refuse such protection may be to require a person's complicity in activities which they abhor. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Bill is primarily for people who use the Agency mechanism. However, in certain circumstances, a person will be entitled to the Bill's protection, even if they act outside the Bill by going directly to the media or a politician, provided the information they supply is found to be substantially true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good case study which reveals the essential conflict between official secrecy provisions and the public interest was revealed in the Ponting case, recently resolved in the United Kingdom. Clive Ponting was prosecuted under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act for providing information to a member of parliament. This information cast doubt on the accuracy of statements made to parliament by a Minister about the sinking of the Argentinean ship, the Belgrano. Mr Ponting's defence relied in part on the terms of section 2, which provided that it was not an offence where a person communicates information to "a person to whom it is in the interests of the State his duty to communicate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trial judge directed the jury in accordance with the arguments of the prosecution, namely that the interests of the state referred to Government policies. If this direction had been accepted by the jury, conviction was inevitable, since the policy of the Government was clearly against unauthorised disclosure by civil servants to parliamentarians. Ponting's acquittal by the jury perhaps indicates that on the yardstick of "judgment by peers" the public perceived the interests of the State differently, and most importantly were willing to tolerate individual acts of conscience and courage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are double standards operating at present which condone whistleblowing in some circumstances yet, in other circumstances, see whistleblowers vilified and persecuted. For example, reporting a neighbour for defrauding the Social Security Department is regarded as laudable. If I inform the police of some criminal activity that I witnessed, I may even be paid money from public funds in return for demonstrating loyalty to the state. However, other whistleblowers may be variously ridiculed, referred for psychiatric assessment, sacked and possibly prosecuted because of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for this treatment of whistleblowers is that in the corporate state, governments tend to demand of employees that their first loyalty is to the government itself. Dissent is permitted within the organisation but not against the organisation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the Managing Director of Westpac, came:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Bad debts increased as medium-sized commercial customers and small businesses failed. The level of bankruptcies is now running at uncomfortably high levels. For the year, the group has recorded a net charge for bad debt and doubtful debts of $1.2 billion compared with $578.7 million in 1988-90.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Annual Report of the Commonwealth Bank last year contains a report from its Chairman, who says of the year's performance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"While the group's profit performance and targeted capital generation fell short of plan for the year due principally to the impact of increased bad debts&mdash;the Bank's performance continues to meet industry standards".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And this year, due once again to a massive rise in the charge against profit for bad and doubtful debt, (a staggering $1.026 billion), group operating profit after tax fell to $272.1 million&mdash;a 45.3 per cent fall in profit. In fact, non-performing loans stood at $2.2 billion at June this year, compared with only $504 million 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chairman's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Weak domestic economic activity and depressed world market prices for some key Australian exports are expected to limit opportunities during the coming year and intensify competition amongst the banks for quality lending. . .weaknesses in the economy are still affecting borrowers and are expected to continue for some time".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it wasn't only the larger banks which experienced bad debt problems. The State-owned Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia, the largest financial institution in WA, with an asset base of $8.5 million, also reported a net loss of $97 million in the year to March 1990, the first loss in its 45-year history. The charge to general and specific debt provisions was $179 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the State Bank of NSW reported a 62 per cent drop in pre-tax profit in the 15 months to September last year, to $34.8 million, after charging $207 million to cover provisions for bad and doubtful debts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. At the conclusion of my remarks last evening I had also referred to the fact that, apart from the disastrous economic circumstances created by this Government's policies which have contributed to those losses, there was also the problem of inadequate and incorrect risk control being applied by a number of those banks. That has created some of those problems. Those two main factors, rather than deregulation per se, were the source of the problems for the banks and their customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, loan policies which lacked risk control and accountability were the norm during the 1980s. Often, massive sums of money were loaned to companies and individuals purely and simply on a piece of paper. There was no inspection of assets or on-site discussion as to any assets the borrower might have had. No comprehensive report existed on how they were ever going to repay the money. Hence, it is evident that there are inherent problems when trading banks and savings banks operate as separate entities. The Victorian Auditor-General's recent report on the State Bank of Victoria highlighted that taxpayers are nearly $1,700m down the drain over the sale of the State Bank of Victoria and the collapse of Tricontinental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Hawke Government is under the mistaken assumption that economic recovery, like Santa Claus, is on the way, it is a cruel and heartless government which is deceiving the Australian people and one which will be ousted at the forthcoming election and dumped on the political scrap heap. Indeed, it seems that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) may be dumped well before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties support this Bill. But, as usual, it is a spoonful of medicine for the banks which has been administered far too late to assist those individuals and companies that have already suffered at the hands of both the banking industry and the indifferent Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bank Integration Bill 1991 is probably the second last piece of financial deregulation legislation to be introduced during the period of the Hawke Government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>. The Bill proposes to facilitate the restructuring of bank groups by granting legal succession to any succeeding entities, and to ensure that any reorganisations are tax neutral for both income and capital gains tax and are exempt from any State tax or duties such as stamp duty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation arises from the 1988 Budget decision to eliminate the distinction between savings and trading banks. The legislation to facilitate this decision was included in the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which was opposed by the Australian Democrats. Of course, the Opposition voted with the Government to pass the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill before us today merely eliminates the practical problems associated with group restructurings. The Democrats will support this Bill but with the qualification of our second reading amendment, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senate condemns the Government for deregulating the banking system because the lack of Reserve Bank control on the money supply has led to the imposition of punitive interest rates which have caused the worst recession in 60 years and the Senate notes that any reductions in interest rates have benefited corporate customers and not retail customers.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's current problems can be traced directly to the policies of deregulation imposed upon Australia by ideologically driven bureaucrats and a like-minded Government and Opposition. As Mr Keating complained when he was looking for a scapegoat for his recession, the banks are running a monetary policy which is inconsistent with the Government's policy. What did he expect when he gave them the power to do so and, indeed, encouraged them to act as they wished?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also general agreement that the finance binge of the 1980s contributed more to inflation that decade&mdash;that is, through asset price inflation&mdash;than did the increase in wages. That is a scandal for any government and a disgrace for a Labor government. A fascination and almost religious adherence to the belief that only the private sector can do anything efficiently and that competition is the universal cure to any economic problem have dominated this debate. As I said previously, this philosophy still remains. This is why I stated that this is probably the second last piece of bank deregulation legislation of this Government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final piece will repeal the requirement that foreign banks operate in Australia as Australian subsidiaries and not as branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Martin Committee report, which I will address later, has proposed that the foreign branches be allowed to operate here. The Reserve Bank has already signalled that such an approach will lead to insurmountable supervisory difficulties. In any event, why does everyone seem to accept that the overseas banks are so strong and wonderful and secure? For years we have watched a crisis develop in the American banking system which the Congress has not been able to address. There have also been numerous other bail-outs, such as some recent examples in Norway and Sweden and the disgrace of the BCCI scandal. I think it is right to ask the question: why do we assume that these foreign banks are so impregnable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is before the Senate today because of the policy to deregulate the financial system in Australia. That decision, taken exactly eight years ago, must rank as one of the greatest blunders in our history. The former Treasurer, Mr Keating, decided to abandon public control over the money supply and credit growth&mdash;the value of the currency &mdash;and to eliminate nearly all exchange controls. These decisions reinforce the June 1982 announcement that the Reserve Bank would cease to be involved in the guidance of quantitative bank lending. The impetus for this decision was the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. This Committee was established by the Fraser Government and reported in September 1981. Mr Howard was the Treasurer then and was constrained from implementing the recommendations of this Committee report by the wisdom of the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the hostile disposition of the then Labor Opposition. On coming to government, the Australian Labor Party appointed its own committee, the Martin review group, to review the recommendations of the Campbell Committee. The review group generally endorsed the Campbell Committee's findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the greatest binge in history occurred. Australia and the rest of the Anglo-Saxon nations went crazy. It was suddenly much more important to shuffle paper than to conduct research, produce inventions or to be involved in productive investments. Greed was good and the very greedy were therefore very good and were idolised by an ignorant and self-indulgent media who led everyone to believe that this time the bubble would not burst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the bubble did burst. One day in 1987 all the computers trading on the New York Stock Exchange decided it was time to sell. The Dow Jones Index fell by over 500 points in one day, thus eclipsing the record set on Black Tuesday in 1929 at the beginning of the Great Depression. The resultant loosening of monetary policy was too large and the economy went into an unsustainable boom which was crushed by the criminally high interest rate regime which Mr Keating imposed. The result is almost one million unemployed and the planned destruction of the farm and manufacturing sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s the United States went from being the largest creditor nation in the world to the largest debtor nation in the world. In just a few years, the financial dominance of the United States was reversed, bringing it to being the main destination of international savings. Similarly, Australia's foreign gross debt has exploded to be over $168 billion, and the financing of that debt represents a cost to the community of about $12 billion per year. This is the legacy that the Australian community has inherited from financial deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank has estimated that the level of non-performing loans is about $29 billion. That means that the supposedly efficient, deregulated banking sector has made about $30 billion worth of mistakes. If we look for a suitable cliche, what cliche do members of the financial community use to justify this scandal? They say they have been on a deregulation learning curve and now, having moved from that, they are entering the mature phase of deregulation. They say, `Everything will be all right; just trust us as usual'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that the Government asked the Martin Committee in the House of Representatives to inquire into the effects of bank deregulation. The Martin Committee has simply endorsed what the Government has done, and indeed it has proposed to further deregulate the provisions applying to foreign banks in Australia. The Committee has accepted that total financial deregulation is the way to go, without considering the relative benefits and costs. That is despite the fact that, at page 2 of the Martin Committee conclusions and recommendations, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deregulation has not led to a significant reduction in the average domestic interest rate margin. Any reduction has tended to benefit corporate customers rather than retail customers.</PARA>
<PARA>At a different time such a conclusion would have moved the members of the Labor Party to seek to address the situation by legislating to attempt to redress this imbalance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting on to that. I wonder what John Curtin or Ben Chifley would think of the recommendations in this report. I think they would be appalled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before examining a few more details of the Martin Committee report, it is important to remember that the commercial banks are merely a part of the financial system. The Government agreed to continue the policy of non-intervention by the Commonwealth into the area of non-bank financial institutions, and this unquestionably led to the collapse of the Pyramid Group in Victoria. We now have the hurried adoption of the second best option&mdash;the second best option being the creation of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission&mdash;to bring some teeth and a national perspective to the regulation of the non-bank financial institutions. I guess it is better than nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has the power and, I would argue, the responsibility to protect people's savings. Most members of the public do not understand the various risks which each different type of institution bears and&mdash;it is perfectly acceptable for us to realise this&mdash;they do not understand the financial jargon associated with the 1980s. But they do understand that they want to be able to save with security and that the Government should facilitate such a situation. They do not want to be ripped off by fees and charges. They also know that they have no chance in a legal dispute with a financial institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deregulation did not apply only to banks. The 30/20 rule which applied to superannuation funds was abolished from July 1984. This provided that the tax free status of superannuation funds applied only where at least 30 per cent of the funds' assets were invested in government securities and two-thirds of those had to be invested in Commonwealth securities. The former Treasurer, Mr Kerin, affirmed only two months ago that no restrictions would be imposed upon the investment patterns of superannuation and, as such, the Treasury line continues intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did the Martin Committee recommend for the future of banking in Australia? It made extensive recommendations, some of which the Democrats agree with. However, the matters which are most relevant to consumers, that is, to the millions of depositors and small borrowers, are dealt with in a pathetic, almost apologetic, way. For example, recommendation 65 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . banks should pay a reasonable rate of interest on all deposit accounts. This should take into account the cost of maintaining accounts.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>What about a recommendation to legislate to ensure that banks must pay a reasonable rate of interest on all deposit accounts? This trend continues with recommendation 67, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . banks be strongly encouraged to convert all remaining deposit accounts which pay interest on the minimum monthly balance to daily interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, why should banks and other financial institutions not be forced to pay interest on a daily basis? Are we in such awe of the financial sector? Are we frightened of offending it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of penalties for the early repayment of loans is also addressed by the Committee's report. Given our huge foreign debt, it is rather bizarre that a borrower should suffer a penalty for repaying a loan early, and it is to the Committee's credit that it has considered the matter. However, instead of recommending that the law provide that a bank be allowed to recover only the actual costs it incurs because of an early repayment of a debt obligation, the Committee has wimped out, so to speak, and has recommended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all banks adopt the practice of recovering actual costs for early repayment of loans rather than imposing a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the most tragic or hilarious recommendation, depending on one's point of view, is No. 74, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . banks should ensure that their assessment of risks and other related areas such as ability to repay are thoroughly investigated.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> For the benefit of those people listening to this debate, I ought to put on the record that these quorums are being called in the middle of my speech because the Opposition is trying to force Labor Party members to come into this chamber, because the Opposition suspects they are meeting in huddles somewhere. Opposition members do not have any commitment to getting on with this legislation. It is the most vexatious way of using quorums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was saying that recommendation No. 74 of the Martin Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . banks should ensure that their assessment of risk and other related areas such as ability to repay are thoroughly investigated. Credit scoring systems should be amended to incorporate criteria such as income or, where it already exists, to strengthen this requirement. Bank loans officers should be adequately trained in risk assessment techniques.</PARA>
<PARA>Call me old fashioned, but I assumed that banks generally did lend with reference to the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In fact, I thought that such a principle had been operating ever since the Venetians invented banking. I can conclude only one of two things: either the Committee was attempting to brighten up a rather sombre report with some humour or the shareholders in Australian banks should consider getting some new managers. Either way, it is a rather terrifying indictment of deregulated banking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said previously, the Committee did produce some good recommendations. For example, the proposal to clarify the confidentiality obligations of the banks is long overdue and a worthwhile exercise. A similar exercise should also be undertaken in respect of the non-bank financial institutions. The complementary proposal that all customers should have access to all personal information concerning them in the records of the bank is another recommendation that the Democrats support. But again this should be specifically guaranteed in legislation, not in some sort of self-regulatory arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation that banks cease the practice of obtaining an unlimited guarantee from a person other than the borrower is another long overdue step. The matter has been raised by the Banking Ombudsman and a number of consumer groups. There have been horrific examples in the media of migrants or poorly educated people not understanding the ramifications of becoming a guarantor and then suffering the consequences of losing their homes. There must be plain English wording for these kinds of arrangements and the liability of a guarantor should be carefully explained to a potential guarantor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations Nos 98 and 99 of the report are a welcome change to the self-regulation or market forces approach of much of the rest of the report. I commend the Committee for tackling the question of a standardised calculation of the rate of interest on all loans and deposits. The Committee has recommended that this Parliament legislate to require that all banks and other State regulated institutions adopt a comparison rate of interest when describing loan or deposit rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would mean that the consumer will, for the first time, be able properly to compare the true returns or costs of an investment or a loan. This, more than anything else, will assist in true competition in banking because the consumer who makes the choices will be better informed. Even the most ardent economic rationalist must agree with this proposal, as it will really promote competition in the banking sector and across the whole financial sector if the State regulated institutions are also regulated in a similar manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar issue exists in relation to life insurance and superannuation investments, which I will pursue in the Senate at a future time. The tragedy of the current system we are talking about today is borne out by recommendation No. 101 of the report. Here the Committee recommended that retail banks and the Department of Social Security jointly investigate the feasibility of developing a basic banking product. The product should be offered by all retail banks, should allow for a set number of free withdrawals each week and should be targeted to the needs of low income Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would have believed that, after the longest period of Labor rule in the history of this country, a basic social justice facility such as a fair bank account does not exist, and that the best a Government controlled committee can come up with is that banks and the Government jointly investigate the feasibility of establishing such a facility? Of course such a proposal is feasible. What about a recommendation that the law be changed to ensure that all retail banks provide such an account? Who is really suffering the long term results of the deregulation of the financial system? It is the sort of people who need that account. The Government introduced a punitive deemed earnings regime against pensioners and other social security beneficiaries. There was no cooperative investigation into the feasibility or fairness of that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final recommendation of the Martin Committee is that the terms of reference of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration be broadened to include a responsibility for reviewing the banking industry. This is well short of the royal commission requested by former Senator Paul McLean and other members of the community, but it does show that even the major parties have discovered enough about the abuses which are possible under a deregulated system to warrant a permanent parliamentary watchdog. It remains to be seen whether this watchdog will have the teeth that it should have and, more importantly, whether it will have the personnel to protect the interests of the community instead of being a compliant rubber stamp. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate condemns the Government for deregulating the banking system because the lack of Reserve Bank control on the money supply has led to the imposition of punitive interest rates which have caused the worst recession in 60 years and the Senate notes that any reductions in interest rates have benefited corporate customers and not retail customers".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a minute. I give him credit because in this chamber he exposed the actions of the banks on foreign currency loans&mdash;something that no-one else had done before, or has done since in Australia. Foreign currency loans came out of the 1982-84 period, when much cheaper money was available overseas than in Australia and when some Australian banks, short of funds and wanting to satisfy their customers so they would not lose them, started bringing in and retailing foreign currency. They retailed a lot of foreign currency to businesses or people who could not afford to pay the interest charged on Australian money, if it was available. When the Australian dollar collapsed, interest rates on money brought onshore became too high, and a lot of businesses went to the wall. Foreign currency loans had been going on for 50 years&mdash;they were nothing new&mdash;but they expanded in the early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that the primary reason for banks offering foreign currency loans to a much wider part of the community than they had previously was competitive pressure; for example, some banks did not have enough Australian currency and wanted to market foreign currency loans so they could keep their customers. The banks denied this. The Committee also identified that there were perceived tax advantages&mdash;that is where the banks came under suspicion at the time, and they have been under suspicion ever since&mdash;to banks selling foreign currency loans. It would appear that some banks deliberately structured the product to take advantage of those perceived tax benefits. No doubt, the Australian Taxation Office is looking at that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation 59 is that the banks ensure greater disclosure of foreign exchange transactions by advising foreign currency loan customers in advance of all fees and charges associated with foreign currency transactions. There are greater risks involved in foreign currency loans, even if loan customers do not go into hedging, which brings the interest fairly close to the Australian rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks claimed they did not market, promote or sell foreign currency loans. They endeavoured to portray themselves&mdash;and they did it pretty well&mdash;as passive victims of borrowers, often advised by brokers determined to obtain foreign currency loans. This may be true in some cases, but it is difficult to sustain in all cases. I have heard from people all over Australia&mdash;not only from my State of Western Australia, but from New South Wales and Victoria&mdash;that banks did actively market them and brokers did market them, so the banks have to cop their fair share of blame for what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the brokers marketed foreign currency loans so well that all the clients of certain brokers from Western Australia were flown, at whose expense I do not know, to the Commonwealth Bank branch at North Sydney to fix up loans. Let no-one say that brokers did not push foreign currency loans and that the banks were not actively marketing. Former Senator McLean used to say that the villain in this fiasco was Westpac. I will come to the Westpac letters later. I believe that in the end when all is disclosed about how the Commonwealth Bank acted&mdash;and a lot was disclosed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> some time ago; some of the bank's ex-officers have made public some of the goings-on&mdash;it will make Westpac look like a Sunday school outfit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also identified some of the promotional measures adopted by some banks. There was some advertising of the product. I remember the advertising that took place. Some seminars and other promotions were conducted which involved a discussion of foreign currency loans. There was at least one instance where a member of a bank's staff had targets for selling foreign currency loans. This could have happened at somewhere like the North Sydney branch of the Commonwealth Bank. People from even Western Australia and Queensland were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I would not take too much of the Senate's time but I have a little more to discuss. Recommendation 60 relates to people who are in trouble, irrespective of whether they have been to court or cannot afford to go to court. The Committee recommended that all mediators:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . funded by the banks, but acceptable to both banks and foreign currency borrowers, be appointed to mediate in foreign currency loan cases that remain in dispute. Mediation is not compulsory, banks will pay for their own mediators or for a general mediator based on usage. The determinations of the mediator will not be binding on either party. Banks should endeavour to the extent possible, to advise all foreign currency loan borrowers of the mediatory mechanism. The mediator should operate under the following conditions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">mediation would be not possible where cases have already proceeded through all stages of appeal so that the court processes are recognised.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough to me but, as has been portrayed in the newspapers, there have been problems of discovery. The banks, whether deliberately or not, certainly did not discover all the relevant documents that litigators would have needed to be successful in court. We are now finding that some cases are starting to be successful. Unfortunately, many of those who took the banks on did so far too early. So I have my reservations about accepting that recommendation in toto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also those borrowers who have gone through the legal system&mdash;Senator Cooney would know about this&mdash;and, at the end of a 12-day trial, have lost their case. By the time many of them have reached the appeal stage they have no money after paying all the solicitors, the QCs and the costs awarded against them. They have no money left to risk doing anything further by way of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks offered some of their customers deals&mdash;and I know that the Commonwealth Bank did this&mdash;under which they were given nine months leeway to sell their assets. Thankfully, I was successful in convincing a bank to extend for three months the time period for repayment of one of its customers from Western Australia so that that person could get finance somewhere else. But to me these customers had to sign the deals because, in effect, they had a gun held at their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I welcome recommendation 60, it does nothing for those who, under duress, signed away their right of appeal. The recommendation is not strong enough. It should be extended to cover those who signed a deal under duress not to carry on with an appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 60 makes the point that mediation under section 60 would not be possible where out of court settlements have been reached. That is something that we would have to agree with. Of course, I believe that, where there has not been total discovery, that ground should be gone over again. However, mediation can be sought where cases are still pending in court without final decision. Of course, that can happen in commercial litigation at any time. Finally, recommendation 60 concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">any determination of the mediator will be non-binding on both parties so that both have the appropriate option of pursuing court action.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is only commonsense. The other Committee finding I would like to comment on is recommendation No. 61: the Westpac letters. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Attorney-General refer the so-called `Westpac letters' to the National Crime Authority for investigation as to whether any criminal wrongdoings arise from the management of foreign exchange contracts by Partnership Pacific Limited.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this was the driving force behind Senator McLean's argument. That is where he started. Unfortunately, he clouded the issue by looking at a wide range of dissatisfactions with the banks, but it was originally the central point of his argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome that recommendation because, having read the Westpac letters, I believe Westpac has a lot to answer for. But I do not believe that recommendation should apply just to Westpac. I know that it is its letters which have been exposed, but I think the recommendation also applies to other banks. In fact, former senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have admitted that there are some problems in that bank also. I throw in the other banks which are in the same position. In this case, many more discoveries should have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is about all I have to say on this matter. I have not had the chance to read the Democrats' amendment to this motion, but no doubt someone will decide which way we will go in relation to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief in my remarks. Unlike my colleague Senator Panizza, I have had the opportunity to read and consider the amendment which the Australian Democrats have moved to this motion and I can assure the Democrats that we will not be supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that there is a major dichotomy in this Parliament between the Democrats and the Liberal and National parties. The Democrats believe in regulation and control. That is simplistic and, ultimately, it does not work. When people are members of parliament, they think they can fix up all of the problems simply by exercising some degree of control in some way or another over an organisation or a body. If honourable senators want to see the ultimate result of that approach, they should go and look at Eastern Europe and see the devastation that has been brought down upon the poor people of Eastern Europe by governments&mdash;operating in what they probably genuinely believed was the best interests of the people of their nation&mdash;controlling and regulating all of the activities of society. It is no good for people such as the Democrats to say, `We don't want to regulate and control all of the activities, just some'. It has been demonstrated quite clearly time and time again that regulation and control arrangements end up producing devastating results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular banking problem that we have in Australia has been, once again, brought about because of control. When Mr Keating was Treasurer he introduced what was called banking deregulation. The problem was that he did not go far enough. Having allowed 16 foreign banks to come into Australia, he panicked. The left wing of the Labor Party panicked; they were jumping up and down about these foreign banks coming in. People such as the Australian Democrats were also jumping up and down. After 16 of these foreign banks came into Australia he said, `That is it; we won't allow any more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did he limit the number to 16, but also he exercised a degree of control over those banks by making sure that they were not allowed to open branches in Australia. They had to be genuinely full banks in Australia so that even a bank as large as Germany's Deutsche Bank, which I think is probably one of the largest banks in the world, is not allowed to operate a branch system; it has to operate here with a capital base as required by Australian banking regulations. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do wish Senator Kernot would listen to this, because it is very important. Those managing the Australian banks are not fools; they are business people. They said to themselves, `There are only 16 of these banks here and we are going to make sure that none of them get established properly. We are going to do our best to break those banks, to make sure that their management back at the home base closes up their Australian operations'. So, the Australian banks took on the 16 foreign banks. They undercut their loans. Every time a foreign bank put a proposition to someone, one of the major Australian banks was prepared to lend more on less security to get the business, to make sure that, for example, Chase Manhattan did not establish itself securely in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a while the Australian banks squeezed the 16 foreign banks to the stage where their management back in their home country said it was not worth while being in Australia. But, of course, the Australian major banks were destroying in many ways their own capital base. Now they have to recover their equity, and they are taking it out of Australian depositors. We will not solve that problem by regulation and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now these banks are deliberately trying to re-establish their equity by reducing their loan arrangements. They are not deliberately doing it to small business people; they are not deliberately taking away money from them. They are simply saying to their branch managers, `Reduce your lending in that particular branch, and do it however you wish'. The branch manager will look around and he might see a business which is up against it. He knows that if he were to take $10,000 or $20,000 of that fellow's overdraft, the business would go to the wall. He will not take it off him, so he looks around and sees a business that is doing all right, that has a few bob or does not have a big overdraft. He reduces the overdraft of that business so that that business becomes squeezed. But that is probably the one business that he ought to be lending more money to, because it is the one that is successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So around Australia small businesses are being squeezed because the major trading banks are undertaking a general reduction of debt in order to recover the losses they effected upon themselves by competing with the foreign banks. That is the situation. It is a simplistic explanation but generally that is what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this happened in Australia? Because Mr Keating limited the number of foreign trading banks that came in. Had he said that it was unlimited or that banks could open branches in Australia, there would have been genuine competition and the major Australian trading banks would not have tried to take on those 16 foreign banks and tried to squeeze them out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were to open up banking to genuine competition and allow banks such as the Deutsche Bank of Germany to operate simply on a branch arrangement in Australia, it would find that there would be plenty of money made available at very low, reasonable interest rates to the businesses which ought to be able to borrow money in Australia. The fundamental difference between us and the Australian Democrats and between us and many people in the Australian Labor Party is that they do not understand that there must be genuine competition if this country is to get over the economic problems which it is suffering at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Genuine competition in all areas and genuine competition in the banking area would make money available for housing, for small business and big business, and for those who will be successful&mdash;those who will create the jobs that are needed in this country. Until such time as this Government&mdash;we do not have to worry about the Democrats because they will never be in government&mdash;wakes up to this matter, this country will continue to bump along at the bottom of the economic depression that we are suffering at present. This country will not recover from its present problems until such time as this Government allows genuine competition to come into effect or until such time as the Liberal and National parties get into government and are able to effect the policies so very well set out in our Fightback package. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has substantially been&mdash;not inappropriately in the circumstances&mdash;about the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Australian banking industry&mdash;the Martin Committee. Although, technically, this is not what people should have been discussing, given the significance of the report and the fact that the Senate will not otherwise get a chance to debate it, it is at least of passing relevance to this legislation. I think it was appropriate that the Senate was used as a forum for such debate on this occasion. I do not intend to pursue that indulgence, but I understand why Senator Panizza and Senator Kernot did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will very briefly reiterate what the Bill is about and then say something about the Australian Democrats' amendment. This Bill will facilitate the integration of savings banks and trading banks. It is not a major measure in that regard because most of the relevant and required legislative amendments received royal assent in November 1989, implementing a decision announced during the Budget Speech in August 1988. At that time we indicated that further legislation would be necessary, and I think it is appropriate that we are proceeding in this methodical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate would be aware that the rationale for amalgamating into group trading banks and savings banks results from a policy decision to treat them in the same way and a prudential preference by the Reserve Bank of Australia for each banking group to have only one licence. Without this legislation, however, the amalgamations would have been unduly complex and costly. Therefore, the Government has decided to pass Commonwealth legislation to facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities for each of the eight pairs of banks involved, exempting them from most Commonwealth and State taxes and charges and providing for income tax neutrality. All the States and Territories have indicated general agreement with the Bill and will cooperate by passing complementary legislation in the States for the incorporation of the relevant banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That briefly outlines for the record the purpose of the Bill. I have reiterated what has been said in the second reading debate and have mentioned what Senator Chapman said in his response on behalf of the Opposition.

I was referring to Senator Kernot's remarks in support of it, which would have been even more surprising had it been an Opposition second reading amendment. When Senator Kernot started to speak, it sounded like a reiteration of all the urban myths we heard in the 1980s about the banking system, strung together with a series of assumptions and assertions. I then found that a second reading amendment had been distributed and subsequently moved by Senator Kernot. It is a remarkable amendment in that I regard it as absolutely economically incoherent. Some people might think that is not remarkable because it is a Democrats amendment. The amendment makes no sense at all. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that on the last two occasions there has been a marginal indication of priority by the banks to pass on the interest rate cuts more quickly and in larger measure to corporate customers and not retail customers, to use the phraseology of the amendment. Overall, that has not been the case; in fact, there was some concern in the early stages that there was not a sufficient pass-on of reductions in interest rates to the corporate sector. People were very concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of a priority concern about the creation of jobs, there is a lot of merit in saying that one of the priorities in the reduction of interest rates should be that they are passed on to the people for whom interest rates are a significant cost burden. Interest rates make it impossible for them to spend money in other ways, such as employing people. I do not think the statement is right. However, if it is right, I do not apologise for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is an attempt to put a veneer of economic logic on a series of assertions that, if the banks had not been deregulated, we would not have a recession. There is no evidence of that. I understand it is possible to argue a case against deregulation of the banks. Some competent economists have put an internally consistent argument for that. The Government does not share their view, but I accept that it is possible to put forward such a thesis. In nearly 60 years since Lord Keynes wrote his work there has been a lot of discussion. Many people thought that we should have deregulation, and some have thought that we should not. I am not saying it is impossible to put forward an argument for that. I am not aware of anybody who would say that has caused a loss of Reserve Bank control of the money supply, nor would I expect anybody to say that it has therefore led to the imposition of punitive interest rates, et cetera. </PARA>

The Government has accepted the recommendations as a package and this legislation sets about implementing the first of the legislative changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are long awaited. Since 1977, not including the Baume inquiry, we have had no fewer than 17 inquiries into pharmacy and the supply of pharmaceuticals. There was one in 1977, two in 1979, three in 1980, one in 1981, two in 1985, two in 1986, three in 1987, one in 1988, two in 1989 and now there is the Baume inquiry. Finally, we have an inquiry the recommendations of which have been accepted by the Government, which has promised to implement them quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must give my former colleague Professor Peter Baume credit for producing a report that has gained the acceptance of not only the Government but also the industry and consumer organisations. I could say that it took a former Liberal member to get changes implemented in our drug evaluation process. He brought to bear on that Committee his experience here in this chamber, his experience as an outstanding physician and now his background experience as an academic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the Senate makes a number of significant changes to the drug evaluation and approval procedures. The amendments include the following: a change to the objects of the Act to include timely availability of therapeutic goods as an objective of drug evaluation; a new scheme to permit greater use of experimental or unapproved drugs; greater reliance to be placed on data supplied to the Therapeutic Goods Administration by increasing the penalties for false or misleading information; provision for time limits within which the evaluation of drugs must be completed; the enabling of sponsors to make safety-related changes to product information without the need for prior approval; and provision for the lapsing of 25 per cent of evaluation fees where deadlines for the completion of evaluations are not met by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact is the possible loss of revenue by the TGA if it fails to meet deadlines for the evaluation of therapeutic goods although, due to an increase of 20 per cent in that fee, the 25 per cent forfeited by the TGA will mean that it is only 5 per cent behind, so there is no great incentive for the TGA to be on time. I hope that the new and improved arrangements will allow deadlines to be met and that the forfeiture of evaluation fees does not become commonplace. As I said, because it is such a small amount, given the increase, I do not think it will act as an incentive to the TGA to speed up its processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into the specifics of the Bill, I want to outline how the therapeutic goods program of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has operated for some time. The administration of this program has been marred by delays, inefficiency and, in general, the inadequacy of access to new and unapproved therapeutic goods. Patients have been denied access to life saving drugs, and the compliance costs incurred by industry have been too high and have acted as a deterrent to seek general marketing approval for therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular concerns of industry about the current approval process include: the time taken to prepare applications in accordance with the strict data and formatting requirements in Australia; duplication of work already undertaken overseas; and a high level of rejection at the screening for acceptance stage, with a need to supply supplementary information not previously sought by other regulatory services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 brought with it significant hopes of improvement in the drug evaluation process but, given the problems which were encountered with the regulations accompanying the Act, it is not surprising to see many of these concerns continuing. Some of the concerns that remain include:  the unsatisfactory and adversarial nature of communication with the TGA; inefficiencies and resourcing problems</PARA>
<PARA>within both the TGA and the drug evaluation branch; a lack of accountability in the evaluation process generally; and a lack of any professional appeals body in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment in this Bill gives effect to a change to the objects clause of the Act. For too long there has been little or no consideration given to the timely availability of therapeutic goods. Australia's drug evaluators may have served it well by avoiding calamities such as thalidomide in the early 1960s, but this has been at the expense of availability. Of course, there is a great difficulty in achieving the balance between avoiding the thalidomide experience and making sure that there is a timely availability of drugs for Australian residents and citizens. Given that the objects of the Act did not include timely availability, it is not surprising that it was not sought. The result has been a safe therapeutic goods environment but, as I said, to the detriment of patient access to drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data provided by the TGA to the Baume inquiry showed that the target time for a new chemical entity approval from submission to written approval was 350 days. The actual time was 702 days&mdash;twice as long. One of the TGA figures provided to the inquiry showed that it took almost seven weeks for a general marketing application just to be accepted by the TGA. Figures provided by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association show that the time taken from submission to written approval was increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is intolerable for consumers and for the industry. Consumers are disadvantaged because therapeutic goods are available here later than in other countries and are sometimes not available at all because the firms do not consider it worth while to seek approval. For the industry the situation is unacceptable in terms of the forgone revenue and the discouragement of research and development in Australia. A paragraph in Professor Baume's report seems to sum up the situation. Page 54 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DEB&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the drug evaluation branch within the TGA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has never committed itself seriously to timeliness and seems not to have in place any mechanisms ever to allow it to achieve expeditious evaluations for most drugs. Earlier reports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>those are the reports which I mentioned before, some 17 of them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have drawn attention to inefficiencies and resourcing problems, but there seems to have been no adequate corrective action and no hope that the situation described so often will not continue indefinitely. There is a lack of accountability in the evaluation process generally, so that officers have no incentive to place any importance on timeliness as one important aspect of their task. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians wrote of `considerable in-built delays' in the present system and almost all critics have drawn attention to the same failure of the TGA in greater or lesser detail. One of the more notorious delays was the almost 10 year wait by Australians for slow release morphine, available to the British in 1981, in New Zealand soon after, but approved by the Australian ADEC only in December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Baume goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In defence of the TGA, I understand that about half of this time had elapsed before the application was received by the TGA. Nevertheless the TGA took another four years to evaluate the product before it became available on the market.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of us in this chamber will know that morphine is associated with pain relief. I wonder what might have been said by the relatives of those patients who were in pain when a bureaucratic organisation took four years to approve a drug which was involved in pain relief.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, one of the amendments provides for timely availability to be included as an objective of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. However, the existence of an objective in itself will not speed up the drug approval process. Other amendments will help to facilitate this objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major reforms emanating from the Baume report is the recommendation relating to greater reliance being placed on data supplied to the TGA in support of applications to register goods. This Bill implements this recommendation. Concurrent with this change is an amendment to increase the penalties for providing false or misleading information. The Secretary will make decisions about the suitability of goods for registration, based on claims made by the applicants. This change is intended to reduce the time taken to check the accuracy of statements made in support of applications. The increase in penalties for providing false or misleading statements is justified, given the increased reliance to be placed on claims by applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Baume report concluded that, on grounds of resources alone, Australia cannot continue to analyse individual patient data routinely during the evaluation process. Although some critics may suggest that Australia will lower its standards of safety and efficacy, the reality is that our standards will remain at least as high as those of comparable nations. Professor Baume, in his report, makes an important point in regard to the usefulness of assessing all individual patient data. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final point which I wish to make in response to the critics is that I am not convinced that outcomes in Australia have been better than overseas outcomes as a result of the local evaluation of individual patient data. The oft quoted case of benoxaprofen, for example, where Australia was spared the deaths and serious adverse reactions reported overseas, was a result of concerns about the drug's potential to cause photosensitivity reactions, not a result of concerns which were apparent as a result of the examination of individual patient data.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also provides for time limits within which the evaluation of drugs must be completed. The therapeutic goods included and the time limits are to be prescribed in regulations. As part of the reductions in evaluation times that have been set, the evaluation fees for an application, as I mentioned before, are to be increased by 20 per cent&mdash;75 per cent of the fee is payable at the time of application and the other 25 per cent upon completion of the evaluation process within the specified time limit. If the evaluation time is not met, the 75 per cent accounts for full payment. I hope that the TGA does not just accept this reduction in payment and use it as a means of extending the approval process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also allows for sponsors to make safety related changes to product information without the need for prior approval. This is in situations where the variation would have the effect of reducing the class of persons for whom the goods may be used. This amendment allows for a speedy change of this information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major changes included in this Bill relates to the introduction of the special access scheme to replace the individual patient usage scheme. The current IPU scheme&mdash;I am sure that Senator Collins, having been up to 2 o'clock, would have even more difficulty than I do in saying that, since I actually went to bed last night a bit earlier than he did&mdash;would have to be the greatest indictment of the drug approval process in Australia. The number of IPU approvals has increased at a significant rate in recent years. In 1988, there were 7,767 requests; in 1989, 14,297 requests; and in 1990, 19,415 requests. This contrasts with 9,000 approvals under the equivalent Canadian emergency drug release program in 1990. Due to the unacceptable delays in drug approvals, patients have been forced to seek their therapy through the IPU scheme. The individual patient usage scheme has been plagued by problems. Professor Baume has outlined those problems in his report on pages 128 and 129.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of the concerns and inadequacies of the present system, this Bill introduces a new system called the special access scheme. The new scheme has been designed to provide greater access to unapproved and experimental drugs for terminally ill patients or patients with a life threatening illness. One of the major reforms in this process will be the ability of certain medical practitioners to authorise the supply of specific classes of therapeutic goods to certain classes of patients. The former IPU scheme operated by allowing the Secretary to approve the supply of therapeutic goods not on the register or exempt under the Act, given certain administrative criteria. The central authorising role of the Secretary or his delegate was a problem. Approvals took an inordinate amount of time. Freeing up the system to allow for certain medical practitioners to approve the use according to the prescribing criteria will ensure that patient access to these potentially unapproved and possibly life saving drugs will be improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arrangements for access to unapproved drugs under the SAS vary according to the health status of the individual. Category A patients include terminally ill patients with life threatening conditions. The guidelines for medical practitioners for use with the SAS outline the criteria and the procedures for the scheme. The Opposition supports the introduction of this scheme and believes that it is of vital importance that terminally ill patients have access to the supply of unapproved drugs without delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the availability of the regulations. The regulations not only provide for a list of exempt goods under the Act, but also provide for time limits to be set for the TGA to process applications. There are a number of other measures in the regulations, including changes to the composition of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. I believe that it assists the Senate, when examining legislation, especially in this case, to have the associated regulations before it. We have been provided with a draft copy, but only after we asked for it. This morning we received an altered version of that draft. One of those alterations is aimed at addressing a concern that members of the Opposition had that in some aspects of the special access it may be possible for large quantities of drugs to be given to a patient rather than the doctor controlling the amount of drug to which that patient can have access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A cursory examination of those regulations this morning has not totally convinced me that the concerns that the Opposition has have been addressed. I believe that the intention of the Government is to address those concerns. I put the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and the Department on notice that the Opposition will be carefully examining those regulations when it has more time to do so and when the regulations are tabled. If the regulations do not meet our concerns, the Senate has the ability to disallow them. I hope that there will be cooperation between the coalition and the Australian Democrats and the Department to ensure that those concerns are addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one final matter I want to raise. In both the April and August Estimates this year I raised a number of matters regarding the import and export of therapeutic goods. In 30 seconds the unemployment figures for the nation for this month will be released in the press gallery. The issue that I want to address concerns unemployment. It concerns a factory that exists in the electorate of Hotham, where my office is situated. It is the electorate of Simon Crean, one of the contenders in the leadership bid that is currently plaguing our nation. In that electorate is a factory that put off 21 people a couple of weeks ago. The parent company had intentions of investing in capital to open another factory to produce therapeutic goods. That parent company is now most probably not going to invest and is looking to go off-shore because of the problems that it has had in dealing with the bureaucracy&mdash;the Therapeutic Goods Association and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It saddens me to think that an Australian company, which has a potential of employing Australians when our unemployment situation is most probably at its worst ever, along with other companies is going off-shore or putting off staff. When I was a small child my grandmother used to say to me, `Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves'. This applies to business in Australia. If we look after the small businesses, the economy might have a better chance of looking after itself. We see those jobs eroding bit by bit&mdash;21 here, 22 there. These are the numbers that add up to create the pain and misery that we are seeing in Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened with this firm?  It approached me because it seemed to be getting nowhere with the TGA. When I moved my office into the electorate the firm approached me because it knew I was responsible for taking health legislation and legislation in this portfolio through the chamber. That was some time ago&mdash;earlier this year. I cannot remember the exact date it approached me. It was sufficiently long ago for the problems that it outlined to me to have been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that Mr Crean, whose electorate this factory is in, and whose constituents are being put out of work, has lost a bit of interest because he has now become the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I remind him that he still has responsibilities in his electorate. Apparently, he took some interest in this before he became the Minister for Primary Industries. I call on Mr Crean to address this issue and negotiate with the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, to ensure that the problems facing this business are settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firm is not asking for special treatment&mdash;it is not asking for money or a handout; it is asking for a fair go. I believe that one of the reasons the significant investment this firm was to make in Australia is at stake is the inflexible and uncompromising attitude of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I wish to refer to a letter that I received from the firm. It points out that after a meeting that it had with the Minister and Terry Counihan there was a degree of sympathy from them. I give credit to the Minister and his assistant, Mr Counihan, for that. The letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this meeting we found the TGA to be intransigent and inflexible; their attitude to our plight was uncaring and they seemed quite unconcerned when told that we may well be forced to relocate offshore.</PARA>
<PARA>Many public servants in Canberra&mdash;and I know there is some unemployment here&mdash;are insulated from the trauma that is going on in Australia. We cannot afford to let one company go off-shore if we can avoid it. If we can do anything to maintain standards in Australia in terms of imports and exports of therapeutic goods while at the same time ensuring that we do not lose companies here, then we will have served Australia well. I do not believe that Australia is being served well at the moment by the actions of this Minister and the TGA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the problems are as follows. Imported products which have been grandfathered under the Act have not been checked regarding their standard of manufacturing, despite a specific assurance given to the firm in December last year by the Minister that this would occur. It was given an assurance. It tells me in its correspondence that on the basis of that assurance it was going to make this investment. Now that that assurance has not been upheld it looks like not investing in further factories or investing further capital here. Because of this and because of the fact that the Minister has not kept to his assurance, imported products are now cheaper than local products which are being manufactured to a higher standard. What the firm is asking for&mdash;an assurance was given by the Minister&mdash;is that imported products meet the same standard of good manufacturing practice as do the therapeutic goods manufactured here. That is what we would all expect. Domestic business is declining as sales are being lost to cheaper imported products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Minister should stand by his word and require all sponsors of imported products to provide evidence of good manufacturing compliance. If this evidence is not forthcoming, registration or listing should be cancelled. On the export side, a major concern has been with the wording now being used on certificates of pharmaceutical products, CPPs. These certificates are required for registration and re-registration of products in the various export markets. The new wording on CPP is unacceptable to the overseas regulatory authorities and is affecting the registration of existing export products. For new products, registration will not even be considered, given the new wording. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the problems, the firm to which I am referring is beginning to lose forward orders for export products. If this continues to happen we will have more people losing their jobs in Mr Crean's electorate or Mr Duffy's electorate of Holt because some of those people come from there. These are two electorates with the highest unemployment rate in Australia&mdash;the unemployment capital of Australia&mdash;and, because of the intransigent nature of the Department and the Minister, we have this company which is losing business in Australia and losing export potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem with the process involved in the evaluation of export products. The industry is far from happy with the procedures as they currently stand. It is very difficult for a firm to compete on the export market when it is subject to the rigorous procedures set down. I will read another letter that was sent from somebody in the Therapeutic Goods Administration to DITAC. It implied in a funny sort of way that this company was concerned about the commercial outcome. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paradoxically&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the company&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is concerned about any restrictions on exported goods. Again its motivation is commercial but the outcome is inconsistent with the intent of TGA&mdash;firstly to protect consumers and secondly to protect the reputation of exported Australian made therapeutic goods and the Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Twice this letter says `although the company's motivation is commercial', as if that were a sin. Of course its motivation is commercial. It wants to create jobs for Australians, not destroy them. That is what it is motivated by. It is motivated by good standards and it is motivated to ensure that it can create jobs in Australia, something some of our bureaucrats forget. That is my concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Minister to give an assurance that these problems will be examined. As yet the problems have not been resolved. The Minister has failed to keep his assurance. The situation seems to be in a stalemate. When somebody rang Mr Crean's office, one of his staff said, `You should make peace with the Minister'. That is what was said. This is about jobs and about the futures of those 21 families who now have somebody unemployed. What does Mr Crean's office say?  It says, `You should make peace with the Minister'. Is it not about the Minister making peace with the people he represents as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firm needs to know what is happening with imports so it can decide whether to go ahead with further investment. Surely out of work Australians deserve employment generating projects to be able to go ahead, instead of being stalled by what seems to be&mdash;I may stand to be corrected&mdash;an uncaring attitude of the Department, the TGA and the Minister. I hope that we will see this issue resolved. There is little time to wait. That investment decision is hanging in the balance. I hope that we will see a response to the concerns and the Minister meeting the assurances he gave to that company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991 introduces certain changes to the drug approval process following the recommendations made by Professor Peter Baume in his report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Question of Balance&mdash;Report on the Future of Drug Evaluation in Australia</EMPHASIS>. As perhaps could be expected from someone of Professor Baume's experience and sensitivity, his report was a very careful and considered exploration of the issues involved in drug evaluation and availability in Australia. While it did not entirely please everybody, I think it is fair to say that most individuals and organisations involved in this field felt that he had made a significant and long overdue contribution. He has certainly made enormous progress and it is going to help us now to work through a bureaucratic nightmare that has been in need of major reform for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume's recommendations were far from being radical, but he did identify one of the major issues in the administration of therapeutic goods; that is, the question of timely availability of drugs. The desirability of balancing that concern against the need to maintain high standards of safety is now going to have to be a major consideration. As many commentators on the Australian situation have observed, our drug regulation system has really been defined by two medical disasters: thalidomide and AIDS. These two catastrophes represent the opposite ends of the regulation spectrum. On the one hand, we want a system that provides adequate protection from dangerous or potentially dangerous new drugs; on the other hand, we want to make sure that we give people who have a terminal or life threatening illness the best possible chance of survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two sides of the argument are not always easy to reconcile and, although people with serious illnesses face these difficulties for many years, this issue of timely availability has become more urgent and more focused as a consequence of the advent of AIDS. The relatively high profile of HIV-AIDS and the problems associated with its treatment have very clearly highlighted the tension between the need for safety and the need for a speedy evaluation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume's report was not the first time these issues have been canvassed, as has already been noted in this chamber today; indeed, it was the sixth, seventh or eighth time that our drug regulation system has been looked at. However, Professor Baume considered this tension between safety and availability very carefully and he pointed out the need for a balance between these two concerns. He also highlighted the fact that this is not really covered anywhere in the existing legislation&mdash;the Therapeutic Goods Act. He saw that omission as having a significant impact on the performance of the TGA and the perception it has of itself. In his report summary he was critical of the TGA's mission statement which refers only to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods and fails to mention the crucial aspect of timeliness at all. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present object of the TGA would be served best if no new drugs were made available <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ever</EMPHASIS>, for only then could one be completely sure that Australians would suffer no untoward effects of new drugs.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill attempts to rectify the imbalance in the Therapeutic Goods Act, giving our drug evaluators a clear statutory direction that timeliness is now to be one of their principal aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Patterson has proposed amendments on this issue. I believe&mdash;although I have not as yet seen the final draft of the amendments&mdash;that the Opposition will be attempting to insert Professor Baume's specific words. While we could argue that this may be somewhat of a semantic exercise, I believe that this is something that we can support because it seems to be a more comprehensive approach and certainly makes it very clear that timely availability of therapeutic goods is to be one of the major objects of the Act. This may turn out to be important, especially given Professor Baume's public observation&mdash;following the release of his report&mdash;that the TGA has virtually made up its own policies because it was effectively operating in a policy vacuum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also introduces the special access scheme, which is intended to provide greater access to experimental or unapproved drugs by persons with a terminal or life threatening illness. Again, although concerns about this issue have been around for some time, the problems experienced by people with HIV-AIDS in accessing treatment has really brought this issue to the forefront of public attention. Many people find it difficult to see why a person confronted with a terminal illness such as AIDS should not be able to access unapproved drugs&mdash;drugs that have been approved overseas and are readily available in, for example, the United States and Europe, but have not been approved here&mdash;and many people who are dying are often not only willing to take the additional risks for themselves, but they often feel that the risks that they are taking may eventually be of benefit to others in similar circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have frequently been moved by the view expressed by people with a terminal illness that, even if their use of an unapproved or experimental drug proves to be of no personal benefit to them, it may save the lives of those who come after them. There are certainly problems with any approach that totally opens up access to drugs without any accompanying standards at all or regulatory measures, not the least of them being that we do not want to put terminally or seriously ill people in a position where they are susceptible to unethical or fraudulent exploitation. But it should be possible to exercise commonsense and come up with a drug evaluation regime that is sufficiently flexible and practical to assist people with a claim to earlier access, but which also ensures that standards are maintained. Under such a flexible system it then becomes the case that people having access to drugs at an earlier stage in the development or evaluation process must personally accept the greater risks involved. As I said earlier, many terminally ill people are certainly prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the United States national committee to review current procedures for approval of new drugs for cancer and AIDS, which looked at approval procedures in the United States for cancer and AIDS drugs, put this matter very clearly in its opening statement. The committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life-threatening illnesses for which inadequate therapies exist deserve urgent attention by society. Cancer and AIDS qualify eminently for this designation. Patients suffering from these diseases cannot afford the luxury of waiting for drug development and regulation to move as slowly as they usually do towards ultimate regulatory approval and marketing. For cancer and AIDS patients time is running out and they are understandably impatient with delays in obtaining the pharmacotherapy which represents their only hope.</PARA>
<PARA>When, as has been occurring in this country, we combine delays in marketing approval with a complex and unwieldy individual access program, it is not hard to see why people with a life threatening illness have become increasingly frustrated and annoyed by the hoops that they have to jump through and the hurdles that they have to climb over in order to gain the drugs that they urgently want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years many people with life threatening illnesses have travelled overseas to attempt to access these drugs. They have secretly imported some restrictive products or unapproved drugs into the country, and in this past year we have seen the AIDS Council of New South Wales set up a program to assist people to import anti-HIV drugs via a quite complex overseas network, including a buyers club in America. I believe it is neither fair nor desirable that seriously ill people should have to go to such lengths, should have to go through such trauma and should be put to such expense because the official system is not properly catering for their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go into the issue of clinical trials, but I do want to make some points about the individual patient usage scheme that Senator Patterson has already detailed. Professor Baume noted that there were many complaints about the operation of the IPU. I understand Senator Patterson has incorporated the complaints, so I will not go over them again, but I stress that it really is getting out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 we had 7,667 requests for IPU approvals; by 1990 it had gone up to 19,415 requests. One of the commonly voiced observations about the IPU arrangements is that this high number of requests is an indication that the IPU scheme is compensating for a serious deficiency in our regulatory system and, in effect, has become a kind of de facto marketing scheme. Recognising the limitations of the IPU system, Professor Baume recommended that a new scheme for special access to unapproved drugs be established, and this Bill before us sets up some of the legislative framework for such a scheme. Among other things, the Bill contains provision for the secretary to authorise specific medical practitioners to directly supply unapproved drugs to patients who are seriously ill with life threatening illnesses. This makes it clear that, subject to the authorisation process, the decision about the use of the unapproved product and its associated risks is the province of the patient and his or her doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is definitely a step forward but, as much of the finer detail will be in the form of regulations&mdash;and I have seen no draft regulations at all&mdash;it is quite difficult for me to state with any certainty at this time that there will be a major improvement in the availability of these drugs to terminally ill individuals. I certainly hope that there will be approval and that is the whole issue on which this Bill is based. I do not believe that terminally ill people should have to resort to subterfuge to obtain drugs and I do not believe they should have to drag themselves over unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles at the very time when they are most susceptible and most in need of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has dragged its feet for far too long in this area at very high cost to seriously and terminally ill individuals. Although we are still a long way from the perfect system, I hope that the changes introduced as a consequence of the Baume report signify the start of a better deal for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes brought about by this Bill are also welcomed and are directed towards improving the evaluation process. The introduction of target times for the processing of applications is a sensible move, providing an incentive for timely performance that has quite clearly been absent within the TGA for some time. Professor Baume pointed out that the TGA's performance appears to have deteriorated in recent years and that the available evidence confirmed that the TGA was in fact getting further and further away from meeting its targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume also noted that the drug evaluation branch within the TGA has never committed itself seriously to timeliness and seems not to have in place any mechanisms ever to allow it to achieve expeditious evaluation for most drugs. There is a lack of accountability in the evaluation process generally, so that officers have no incentive to place any importance on timeliness as one important aspect of their task. Professor Baume recommended some very specific time lines and performance indicators in his report, and this Bill provides the framework within which those time lines can be fixed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has had considerable problems with the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991, mainly because the Government has not abided by the normal procedure. The normal practice&mdash;and I would like to make this very clear&mdash;is for a Bill to be introduced into the House of which the relevant Minister is a member. In order to allow proper debate to take place, the Senate has set down a specific time by which Bills must be introduced into this chamber. The Government sought to get around this requirement by introducing this health Bill into the Senate, not into the House of Representatives. As a result, tremendous problems have been created for the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has not been before our shadow Cabinet or our party room. The Government, without any direct consultation with the Opposition on the likely problems which could arise, brought this Bill into the Senate, thereby avoiding the proper procedure that is normally followed. A considerable number of phone calls have been made because of the tremendous problems this has caused for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill tries to strike a balance between the approach of making sure that Australia is able to keep its very high standard of assessing the safety of new drugs that enter this country before approving them for use by our citizens and the approach of allowing people with life threatening diseases or terminally ill patients access to overseas drugs which have not yet been approved for use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have known for many years that the drug evaluation process has been very slow. There has been an immense backlog of overseas drugs waiting to be evaluated. People have called for the approval and introduction of drugs that have been approved overseas and which have been acknowledged to be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases. However, because of the backlog, those drugs are not available. This Bill allows for the timely availability of new or improved therapeutic goods. I hope the Bill is successful. I hope that these objectives are able to be carried out and that the problems can be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doctors often face a dilemma when they are treating terminally ill patients or patients who have a life threatening disease for whom no more can be done under normal medical procedures. The patient says, `I read about a drug that they are using in America, or Taiwan, or wherever. I think that drug could help me. Can't you get it for me?'. The doctor says, `No, I can't get it for you. I can't bring it in. It is not available'. The patient says, `But I am dying. Perhaps I have a chance with this drug. There is nothing more you can do for me. Please, can't you get it for me?.' Under this legislation, the doctor will be able to bring in that drug for that patient. As I said, this will apply only to people who are terminally ill or who have a life threatening disease. In those circumstances, this Bill allows a drug company or agent to bring a drug into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has faced a dilemma because of the problems we have had with the introduction of this Bill into the Senate. We had a briefing from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. I suggested to the Department that we follow this matter through in a practical way. Take the situation where a doctor is permitted to bring into Australia an unlimited quantity of drugs for his patient. The doctor could well say to the patient, `Look, I don't think that drug is going to do you any good. Indeed, the drug could do you harm'. The patient says, `Doctor, I'm dying. Please bring it in for me'. The doctor says, `Fine. I'll bring it in'. He brings in, say, a 12-month supply and says, `This is on your own head, because I don't believe this drug will do you any good. It has not been approved. I have concerns that it has not been tested well enough'. The doctor then has 12 months supply on his hands. I asked the Department what will happen to the drug. Will the doctor be able to give the 12- months supply straight to the patient and say, `You organise it. You house it&mdash;I really don't want to have anything to do with this drug'. The Department said that there was nothing to stop that occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has accepted in principle an amendment that the Opposition has put forward. However, rather than amend the legislation, the Government suggested that the amendment be put in the regulations. The Opposition accepted that. The regulations now state that the drug is dispensed on prescription of a medical practitioner who has prescribed the drug in accordance with good medical practice. So the doctor must prescribe the drug in accordance with the recommended quantities over the period of time. That is one of the problems that the Opposition faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other problems, and Senator Patterson has spoken about those at length. I do not want to take up too much time of the Senate. I know that my colleague Senator Knowles will also speak in this area and I also know that Senator Kernot wants to add a few words. Senator Patterson spoke of a problem that she has in her State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment figures have just been released. Unemployment has gone up from 10.1 per cent to 10.5 per cent. It is appalling that the unemployment figures are really as high as they are. We know the Government has admitted that the figures will go above 11 per cent. I have not had time to assess the seasonally adjusted figures or even the actual figures, but I know they are horrific. I will leave these figures for my colleague Senator Knowles, who will perhaps have a few more minutes to look at them, to decipher. The figures only arrived while I was on my feet. When the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, responds, I wonder whether he would tell us what the Government intends to do about unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees has already indicated that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991. I take this opportunity to make a few brief comments regarding the administration so far of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, particularly in relation to a case that has come to my attention in my home State of Queensland. The case concerns a couple who run a small herb farm on the Sunshine Coast. They have spent many years building up a small business which grows and sells herbs often used in natural remedies. Recently, these people have been prosecuted for breaching the Therapeutic Goods Act by allegedly selling herbs which, according to the labels, had therapeutic properties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go into whether this is right or wrong under the terms of the Act, but I want to make a few comments about the way the case has been handled. The herb growers made the mistake of relying on their local Federal House of Representatives member to inform them of when the Bill was to passed, but it was not until many months afterwards that they found out it actually had been passed. They then made many attempts by phone, and in writing, to find out how the new Act would affect their business, particularly in light of the new labelling information and the claims that could be legally made by them on their herb labels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While they were trying to find this out, they were visited in May by a Queensland health inspector who said they had contravened the 1982 Queensland Therapeutic Goods Act over labelling claims of a herb. The herbalists then wrote to the Queensland Health Department to try to find out what was in the Queensland Act as compared with the Federal Act. They submitted their herb labels for inspection to see whether they complied with the Act. Months later, in September, a reply finally arrived in the form of a summons to appear in court. After that, in October, another reply was received which referred them to Canberra if they wanted information on how to correctly label their herbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this date, the matter has still not been resolved and these people are still not clear on what they now can or cannot say on their labels. They believe they have been unfairly treated. They believe they have been singled out because, like many others, they used their democratic right to express an opinion to their parliamentarians against the introduction of this Therapeutic Goods Act. They can see that many other herb growers and sellers who did not object to the Act, and who were known to them before it was introduced, seem to have escaped prosecution despite using the same labels. That is the problem: they are identical labels. Some people have been prosecuted and some have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite numerous attempts to find out how the Act affected them, and despite every effort to get information so they could comply with the law, they believe they have been thwarted by bureaucratic inefficiency and buck-passing. It seems to me to be rather pointless to pass a Bill and then not to make every effort to inform the people who are most affected, especially when those people themselves take measures to seek out that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about their claims that the majority of people who spoke out against this Act seem to have had some action taken against them. I assure the Senate that these people are trying to comply with the Act and need some further assistance. I hope that the Therapeutic Goods Commission, which administers this Act, clarifies or improves its efforts in distributing the information that it is supposed to distribute. I hope that, through cooperation, compliance will be encouraged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991. I am delighted to see it before the Parliament because I think much of its contents are well overdue. The report put down by Professor Peter Baume covers so many of the aspects for which people in Australia have been waiting for so long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been enormous difficulty in getting approval for use in Australia of many drugs that have been used overseas very successfully over a long period for the treatment of a wide variety of illnesses. This legislation will ensure that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee does not engage in long and drawn out procedures. This is one of the most encouraging results of Professor Baume's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a need for the Australian system to accommodate more rapidly drugs that have been used overseas, even drugs that are not necessarily lifesaving but do provide a better quality of life for many patients. I just cite two drugs that are used in areas with which I have been involved for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chelation therapy has been used extensively overseas for the treatment of many circulatory problems. In fact, a number of countries in Europe will not allow people to undergo procedures such as coronary bypass operations without taking a course of chelation therapy. In years gone by, chelation therapy has been regarded as very much an alternative medical procedure. Yet, in overseas countries it has led to a lessening of demand for surgical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, if I were confronted with the need for bypass surgery, I am sure that I would prefer to have the option of having a drug available to me that had the possibility of delaying, if not totally avoiding, surgical procedure. While chelation therapy has been used very successfully in New Zealand, it is not allowed in Australia. In New Zealand, in fact, the private health insurance companies have actually allowed people to insure for this procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in Australia we have had a very different set of circumstances. Although two or three years ago people were readily able to receive various forms of this treatment, they were unable to make a claim on Medicare or private health insurance. All that people are asking is for the drug to be made readily available for them on an ongoing basis even if they had to pay for it themselves. Quite often, a course of treatment might cost a person about $1,200. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should be allowed to choose. Not only would this procedure be of benefit to the individual concerned but also all taxpayers would benefit if there were less demand for people to go into hospital for surgical procedures. When one considers that this type of treatment can be undertaken in a doctor's surgery for maybe two or three hours over about 12 weeks, that it keeps people off waiting lists and that it keeps people out of hospitals, surely the cost advantage for Australia is far greater than putting a handful of ball-bearings under the feet of everyone who tries to get the drug approved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been able to ascertain from ADEC, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and any other authority, that a number of years ago a drug used in this procedure proved to have some deleterious side effects and that, in about 1945, a death occurred as a consequence of its use. This is quite ironic. It is amazing to think that the overuse, the wrong prescription of a drug, in 1945 is still being cited to me as a reason why this drug has not been approved here for use in the treatment of circulatory problems. Yet, the only way that many people, including children, are treated in Australia for lead poisoning is by chelation therapy. So therein lies the real contradiction: a drug can be approved for therapy for one illness and yet not for the wider illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constituents who have been on the verge of facing major surgery have written to me and talked to me about this matter. Some of these people are facing amputation of limbs because poor circulation has led to gangrene in their extremities. They are now leading full and active lives as a result of receiving chelation therapy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the stalling by ADEC is that if that treatment had been more readily available for a lot of people it would have also kept them off sickness benefits, it would have kept them off unemployment benefit and it would have allowed them to get back to living full and active lives without being a demand on the community in general. We must look at the availability of those drugs. I certainly hope that this legislation will enable action to be taken in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that we have been active in pursuing&mdash;and Senator Jones has also been involved in this&mdash;is the use of the oestrogen patch which is a very good source of treatment for menopause. One of the worst side effects of menopause is osteoporosis. While the oestrogen patch has been approved in 31 countries, once again ADEC has been dragging the chain here in the approval stakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons cited for this delay was the marketing details provided by the manufacturer, Ciba-Geigy. It is claimed that the manufacturer's information was only suitable for European countries. Yet once again, one can go across the Tasman and get this product freely in New Zealand. Many people cannot take other forms of medication, other forms of oral oestrogen or subderminal, the gels, the creams or whatever, because of their very bad side effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have known first-hand of people who have had very serious side effects. If the patch had been available to them they would now be leading better lives. They would not have suffered broken bones, broken limbs and stress caused by illness. Once again, if we can ensure that there is ready access to these drugs and eliminate the delays that have existed in this country for so long, we will be able to improve health in this country without having to resort to surgical intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that agreement has been reached to cover another concern of the coalition by amending the regulations. I refer here to the importation of lifesaving drugs. We were concerned that drugs brought in by a doctor for the treatment of a patient facing a life threatening disease could be distributed widely in the community. There was no control mechanism in place to ensure that they were not, for example, put on to the black market or used for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is consoling to see that, under the regulations, drugs will only be dispensed on the prescription of a medical practitioner who has prescribed the drug in accordance with good medical practice. I think that will allay any fears that the community might have about crank drugs being brought in and about quackery. Let us face it, there are enough controls now on medical practitioners to ensure that they do not get caught up in that, regardless of what the patient requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year in Western Australia, a lady who was terminally ill with cancer and very near the end of her life was asking for one last shot at living. She wanted access to particular drugs. It was largely through the work of her medical practitioner, her husband, the community and even the media that this lady eventually got the drugs. But, of course, it was all too late. She received the drugs only about two or three weeks before she passed away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will allow those people to have some freedom of choice without forcing drugs on people who might consider that they are crank drugs or quackery. I am very pleased that this legislation has now come before us. I think it is well overdue. I am delighted that it is a former colleague of mine Peter Baume, now Professor Peter Baume, who has been the catalyst to this happening and to people in Australia being given a real choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I appreciate the contributions made by Opposition and Democrat senators to the debate on this important Bill, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991. I believe there is general recognition that it is extremely important to the health and well-being of Australians, particularly those who are suffering from painful or debilitating illnesses, that drug evaluation in Australia be carried out in a way which, whilst taking due cautionary and precautionary measures to ensure the safety of therapeutic goods available within Australia, makes such goods available in a timely way to alleviate pain and distress and perhaps help effect a cure and speed up the healing process for those who are stricken with an illness or subjected to some traumatic accident or other acute situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges that Professor Peter Baume, a former colleague in this place, in his report on the future of drug evaluation in Australia, has come up with a very well-balanced approach to timeliness and safety. The Government also acknowledges some of the very practical suggestions he has made: for example, as an encouragement to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, to require government funding to be subject to a monetary penalty if certain evaluations are not carried out according to a set timetable. In these ways I believe he has&mdash;and the Government accepts&mdash;indicated a way in which applications can, and ought to, be processed. Incentives are built in to ensure that that process is undertaken as speedily as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators from all parts of the chamber have pointed to the fact that when people are confronting the certainty of death and have a terminal or life threatening illness special provision clearly ought to be made to help them psychologically face that prospect by giving them the assurance that virtually whatever they wish, by way of the administration of a drug of which they have learnt, can be undertaken. I think Senator Lees emphasised that the voluntary subjection of people confronting death to treatment by a particular drug or therapeutic process may not have any great beneficial impact on their own situation but is recognised as being part of the clinical evidence and history which might, together with treatments administered to others, constitute a reference point for the evaluation of that drug and, hence, lead to a better situation in the future for others suffering the same or similar diseases. I think there are very good reasons for the type of process which is being implemented by this amending Bill, and therefore I am not surprised that it has received such support around the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate, Senator Patterson raised the matter of a company which imports goods, has had those drugs registered under the grandfather clause and now wishes to re-export those goods. The Act says that the exported goods must meet the same standards as locally supplied drugs, and therefore they are required to be evaluated. The company is complaining of delays in that evaluation process. The Act does recognise and require that the same standards should be applied to exported goods as to those available in Australia. It is very important to preserve Australia's reputation as a supplier of therapeutic goods overseas, and it is important as a matter of moral principle that we do not export therapeutic goods which do not meet the minimum required standards within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the Therapeutic Goods Authority is making every effort to expedite the evaluation but that other priorities have intervened, such as the approval of new AIDS drugs. As honourable senators will know, DDI was only cleared on about 6 December, following a meeting of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. It is most unfortunate that this matter has been delayed in the way in which Senator Patterson has indicated, but I will undertake to ensure that the further representations she has made during the debate are relayed to both the office of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and that of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Simon Crean), quite apart from the officials in the chamber who have heard Senator Patterson reinforce those representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Patterson also raised the forfeiture of the 25 per cent evaluation fee if the program is not adhered to in a timely manner and was querying whether that was sufficient as an incentive. I understand that in the Baume report there is a recommendation that from 1 September 1992, if the TGA fails to meet an evaluation deadline, the normal process may be bypassed and an appeal made direct to the AAT. I am advised that the Government intends to accept that recommendation, so there will be further incentive and process built in to ensure that the evaluation timetables are adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter raised by Senator Patterson in the debate was the supply of benemid, or probenecid, in Australia. I understand that probenecid is a drug used in the treatment of gout&mdash;hence Senator Patterson's interest&mdash;and also to potentiate the action of certain antibiotics. The drug has been available in Australia for over 30 years and was manufactured in Australia by Merck, Sharp and Dohme. Recently, the company has experienced problems with the manufacturing process of the approved Australian formulation of the drug. This has resulted in the removal by the company of the Australian formulation from the market as its quality and efficacy could no longer be assured. As an interim measure, the Department has approved the importation of several batches of the same formulation of the drug from the United States pending resolution of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, the parent company in the United States had been unable to fully satisfy demand, and shortages have therefore arisen. However, the company has recently identified additional batches for importation, which should overcome the supply problem. The company in Australia also manufactures a different formulation of the drug for export to New Zealand. This formulation has not been evaluated in Australia and its quality, safety and efficacy cannot be guaranteed. Supply of such an unapproved drug by a company in Australia would constitute an offence under the Therapeutic Goods Act. Under the personal import arrangements, the Act provides that an individual may obtain supplies of this unapproved drug from an overseas source at his or her own risk. In many instances, other drugs available on the Australian market can be used by doctors in place of probenecid. Senator Knowles spoke about the oestrogen patch&mdash;or is it estraderm?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a couple of points that Senator Tate referred to in his reply to my speech. I am glad that we were not talking about patches for ostriches but instead ended up talking about oestrogen patches. Senator Tate gave me two replies, one of which concerned Benemid. I do not think that that response satisfies my query, but I will take it back and look at it in more detail and follow up with him if I still have some concern, which I believe I do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other response concerned a company to which I referred in my speech at the second reading stage. My query did not involve the problem that Senator Tate outlined. There are two problems; one concerns imports and the other exports. With regard to imports, the company is concerned that therapeutic goods are being grandfathered and are not being subjected to good manufacturing practice standards and that, therefore, the company's manufactured products are competing with imports that are of a potentially lower standard because they have not been subjected to as good a manufacturing process as the one it has. So the company is losing to a cheaper import. Further, the requirements for labelling are such that it is affecting forward orders for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, whatever the problem, it ought to be resolved if it can be. As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, if it can be resolved appropriately it should be, without silly comments about making peace with the Minister and so on. I appreciate Senator Tate's assurances&mdash;I find that they may be trusted a little more than those of his colleague Mr Staples&mdash;that something will be done to address this problem because, if it is not, more jobs will be lost in that company and it will not have that investment.

<PARA>This first amendment relates to the objects of the Therapeutic Goods Act. As I mentioned at length in the second reading debate, there was a need for balance between timely availability and safety. I gave the example of thalidomide. For too long the emphasis has been on safety alone. This has been at the expense of the availability of new and unapproved drugs. I gave the example of timely availability with slow release morphine and how it took 10 years for Australia to approve that measure. Britain approved it in 1981 and nine years later Australia got around to doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume, in his report into drug evaluation in Australia, recommended an amendment to the Act to include timely availability in the objectives. The problem the Opposition has with regard to clause 3 of the Bill is that it relegates the objective of timely availability behind the objectives of ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The amendment I have moved on behalf of the Opposition relates to  bringing into effect the true intentions of the Baume recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a statement that AIDC had made a profit of $9.6m, which it could keep&mdash;which was contained in his statement on employment last month&mdash;when the day before he made that statement it was announced that AIDC Ltd, the operating subsidiary of AIDC, had in fact made a loss of $8.8m, prompted me to take a more thorough look at the accounts of both AIDC, the corporation, and AIDC Ltd, the operating company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read the Prime Minister's statement and I had seen the announcement of the loss of AIDC Ltd it seemed to me then&mdash;and I still believe now&mdash;that the Prime Minister had misled the Australian people by making them believe AIDC, which is clearly meant to be a tool of industry policy, had in fact failed. A closer look at the consolidated accounts of AIDC shows that it had an operating loss of $30.6m, with AIDC Ltd itself having an operating loss of $32.9m. Those figures come down to $8.9m and $9.9m respectively when a figure for tax credits&mdash;being both for losses and imputed dividends&mdash;is set off against those operating losses. That practice is fine so long as at some stage it is anticipated that there will be profits made against which those tax credits can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing that the Prime Minister said on 14 November concerning AIDC was that he intended to extend the Commonwealth guarantee for loans and other obligations that AIDC enters into, including itself giving guarantees and indemnities, from 1994 to 1998. That, in turn, prompts the question: if that had not been done, would AIDC as a group and AIDC Ltd, in particular, have been viable? If it had been left to the market, would it have failed? In this particular recessionary time, the facility of a government guarantee gives an enormous advantage in terms of borrowings to AIDC, which in turn passes on that benefit to AIDC Ltd for a very small consideration of a service fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of accountability, other exceedingly important questions are raised. The first of these relates to how the accounts deal with contingent liabilities and commitments, because no provision is made for contingent liabilities and commitments. These are dealt with in note 25 of the AIDC report, which was tabled in this place the other day. I think it is quite significant that these accounts were signed in September, yet only in December did we finally see them. How convenient it was for the Government that this annual report was tabled a long time after the statement of the Prime Minister on 14 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Note 25 includes the financial statements of AIDC's consolidated accounts. A provision is made for contingent liabilities for guarantees and credit risk facilities&mdash;there is a statement that these exist&mdash;of $433.7m and for commitments for loans and investments committed but undrawn of $318m. These figures started out at $943m and $883m, respectively, but they have become smaller figures because a portion of those risks have been syndicated among the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going to further notes in the accounts, specifically note 1j, one finds to one's concern, in terms of accountability, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contingent liabilities arising from guarantees and credit risk facilities provided as part of lending and financial services activities are recorded off balance sheet.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is no accountability for those items at all. The only provision that is made for doubtful debts is a provision of $129m in note 10. The $129m provision relates to those things which are on balance sheets. However, again if one has a look at note 9, one will find that shares have not been written down fully to the market value. At every turn, one finds that in terms of accountability a great number of things are left to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIDC does not come before Senate Estimates committees. I say here and now that it should. It does not come before Estimates committees presumably on the basis that it does not have funds appropriated for it. Yet if one goes back to the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in 1988 when the principal Act was altered, one will find that the Minister said&mdash;to paraphrase what is meant&mdash;that AIDC is to remain a tool of industry policy and the preferred option would be for additional capital to be provided to AIDC out of Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budgetary restriction simply did not allow that to occur. So the Government went through the course of allowing up to 30 per cent of the shares in AIDC Ltd to be sold to the private sector. Of course, about 19 per cent of the share capital has been taken up in that way. But the Minister says that at no time ought this to be taken as an intention to privatise AIDC. So the intention is clearly always to have it a public entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though no funds are appropriated to the AIDC by way of the Appropriation Bills, nonetheless the fact that Consolidated Revenue is exposed in an unlimited way by way of the Commonwealth's guarantee clearly means that the AIDC should come before the Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 a provision was made that with regard to borrowings, as distinct from other obligations, the Commonwealth guarantee would operate only in the event that the Chief Executive made a note at the time of the transaction that the guarantee would operate. I do not think one has to be very smart to realise that any person who is in a transaction with the AIDC would insist that the Chief Executive made such a determination. Yet nowhere in the accounts do we see any mention or listing of those transactions where such a determination has been made, and it must be made in writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One gets further concerned when one looks at a report that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday concerning Dayton Plaza, a building which has been finished in Perth. It is totally and utterly empty. There is presently a vacancy rate of 18 per cent for office blocks in Perth, with a likely rise to 25 per cent next year. Yet the AIDC has a first mortgage to the tune of $45.8m and the value of the building has been written down from $73.5m to $43m. In its own annual report, the AIDC sets out quite clearly what its charter is, how it is meant to operate and where priorities are meant to go. Buildings in CBDs are not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Section 6 of the enabling legislation sets out quite clearly what the AIDC is meant to do. Section 6 says basically that the functions of the Corporation are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to facilitate and encourage, and to facilitate participation by Australian residents and enterprises in, the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It then says that priority in the performance of this function shall be with regard to manufacture, assembly, construction, processing, treatment, transportation or distribution of goods. It further provides for the provision of services in the tourism industry, where indeed they are likely to become subject to competition. Then it refers to industries concerned with technology and research leading to such development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One wonders whether, if one were able to have a look at the investment portfolio of AIDC, how many other Dayton Plazas one might see. And where is the provision in the accounts for the writing down of the value of those investments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the important point I want to make is that there is not sufficient scrutiny by the Parliament of a body which is clearly meant to be used as a tool of industry policy by the Government. A decision has been made to extend the guarantee to 1998. Bear in mind that that is the date at which transactions are entered into, not at which they terminate. So, in fact, transactions entered into prior to 1998 can go well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could well say that the contingency liabilities, which are shown as a large sum, will never be subject to scrutiny and that any payments that are made pursuant to those guarantees or indemnities are never going to be disclosed and certainly will never be known by this Parliament. Either AIDC Ltd is meant to be an operating company which can stand alone and which perhaps ought to apply for a banking licence and come under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank and get out of equity investment, or it should continue the course it is on now and stay in equity investment. But it is simply not viable unless it receives the guarantee by the Government, which in turn exposes Consolidated Revenue in a way which is not subject to accountability and in which no quantity or quantum can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The function that government has entered into of corporatising entities and pushing them away from scrutiny by the Parliament is one that really has to be condemned and, indeed, I am saying here and now that when we come to the Supplementary Estimates I will be asking that officers of AIDC come before Estimates committees. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 August I wrote to Mr Baldwin, the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Authority, and asked him the same question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 August a letter of acknowledgment was received from Minister Bilney.

On 22 October I wrote again to Minister Cook asking him why I had not received a response, or even an acknowledgment, to my letter of early August or to the letter that was referred to him by Minister Bilney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sick of responding to the Minister by polite letters which do not get answered. On 4 December I received a letter from Senator Cook saying that he was not prepared to take the matter further. I notice that Senator Cook is now leaving the chamber. Senator Cook said he was not prepared to take the matter further because of the fact that the people involved received superannuation benefits and thus had no intention of serving on in the Commonwealth employ and that, therefore, it could not be counted as Commonwealth service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 December, EXDRAC members Peter Jorm, who has Master of Education and Bachelor of Laws qualifications, and Keith Engelsman, a CAA test pilot, came to see me about the matter. They raised a number of points, the first of which was that neither of them is personally affected in the representations. Secondly, the break in Commonwealth service which is alleged by Senator Cook has never occurred for most people. They were working in the Public Service before they resigned officially from the Australian Defence Force. In some cases they were working on furlough or leave without pay from the Defence Force and they were still, in fact, officers, warrant officers or sergeants in the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point made is that they are not double dipping because they receive superannuation. Their resignation and long service payments are quite different payments. Commonwealth superannuants will get these redundancy payments; Commonwealth superannuants will get their superannuation. The only difference between those who served in the Department of Defence as civilians and those who served in the Department of Defence as uniformed personnel is that when the uniformed personnel leave the Defence Force&mdash;as part of our policy of making sure it is a young and fit defence force&mdash;they acquire their superannuation entitlements at that stage. Public servants do not get theirs paid until later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, they have an entitlement to superannuation at the time they leave the Department of Defence and transfer to the CAA. The only difference between an employee of the Department of Defence and a member of the Defence Force is that one has received his or her superannuation benefit earlier than the other. Both will receive their superannuation benefits in due course. Nevertheless, the two groups of employees are treated entirely differently for redundancy purposes. The prior service of a civilian in the Department of Defence is counted for the continuation of service in the Civil Aviation Authority. The uniformed member does not have any of his service in the Defence Force counted together with his service in the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue with the points that EXDRAC members made to me on 9 December. They said that Defence personnel, under the Defence Act, need to resign from the Defence Force in order to be covered under the Public Service Act. There is no other way by which they can come under the Public Service Act; they must resign from the requirements on them under the Defence Act. Other Commonwealth members can move around between departments under the same Act, namely the Public Service Act. The problem rests on the legal opinion of what is continuous service. A further point raised was that the Government's RAGE guidelines, to which I referred earlier, are not adequate for this situation or for future situations&mdash;and it is a situation which is going to be facing the Commonwealth increasingly in time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was also raised that it could affect quite a large proportion of people when redundancies occur in government business enterprises such as Telecom. A number of technical people leave the defence forces to go into entities such as Telecom. If and when redundancies occur in Telecom, they could well be affected in the same way. I suspect that that might be part of Senator Cook's reason for delay on this matter and for his lack of sympathy for those who came out of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people were, for instance, pilots, air traffic controllers or engineers. They were poached by the Civil Aviation Authority from the Defence Force at a time when we could ill afford to lose them from the Defence Force. They were attracted to the stability of employment that they would get in the Civil Aviation Authority. They left the defence forces with a letter in their hands offering employment from the Civil Aviation Authority. Some of them&mdash;quite a number of them, I understand&mdash;actually served out a period of furlough, or leave without pay, in the Civil Aviation Authority while still legally members of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In former times, women who married had to leave the permanent Public Service on their marriage. I did so a number of years ago. Those women are now able, if they come back into the Public Service, to have their prior service treated as continuous service for superannuation purposes. Yet these people who served in Australia's Defence Force are not given similar treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I brought this matter before the Senate as a matter of public interest because I believe these people are being discriminated against because their pre-CAA employment was with the military rather than the civilian side of the Department of Defence. People go into bodies such as the CAA from both sides of the Defence Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If two workers working side by side in the Department of Defence, one uniformed and the other not, move over to the CAA, why should it be only the civilian employee who is able to count his service in the Department of Defence as Commonwealth service for redundancy purposes? As I said earlier, both will receive superannuation: the uniformed worker receives it early, by determination of a government Act; the other receives it after the age of 55. Yet the Department of Industrial Relations wants to say that the person who received the superannuation has retired and did not intend to work on further in the Commonwealth, even though, as can be demonstrated with documentation, this is clearly not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this in the Senate&mdash;and I am sorry that Senator Cook has left&mdash;because, despite repeated requests, these people have been unable to get a hearing from the Minister for Industrial Relations.

One does not normally regard that as natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Minister, although he is not in the chamber now, to take a serious and personal interest in the matter because there has been gross unfairness for the individuals concerned. I have also suggested to EXDRAC that, if it is not satisfied, it should approach the Ombudsman and ask him to investigate on its behalf. At least the Ombudsman, unlike the Opposition, has the right to go into the Department and investigate the files. The matter may end up having to be resolved in the courts, but that would be most unsatisfactory, costly and time-consuming. It would be preferable for all concerned if the matter could be resolved now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>I raise a matter of crucial importance to Australia&mdash;the Government's current leadership crisis. I believe that it is appropriate at this time, with the meetings and matters of today and previous days, to have a look at the pretender to the throne, Paul Keating. Mr Keating has been described as the Grim Reaper. He has consistently used catchlines such as `good number' and `on track'. He is also the man who failed to lodge two tax returns, yet in his position as Treasurer he pursued others like a rat up a drainpipe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the sowings that have been reaped as a result of Mr Keating's stewardship as Treasurer. First, for five quarters in a row the economy has shrunk, and it has shrunk for seven quarters out of the last eight. Our net foreign debt is of the order of $133 billion. When Paul Keating began his stewardship, it was $23 billion. More significantly, our net foreign liabilities are now in the order of $180 billion. That is the debt this country has to service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the current situation is the worst since the Great Depression. The impact that it is going to have on the confidence and attitude of people into the next decade and beyond cannot be underestimated. I want to highlight a couple of related points and refer to the destruction of the aspirations of many good Australians. I want to relate the experience that I had with my father following the Great Depression. To the day when we lost him, his decision-making regarding our financial operations was always based on the question, `Can we handle another depression?'. A generation of people made their judgments about what they were going to do bearing in mind whether they could handle a depression. In terms of investing in this country and getting on with the job of promoting growth, people's confidence has been shattered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the figures that this Grim Reaper has brought to this country. If we look at the unemployment figure released today, we see that there is an increase to 10.5 per cent&mdash;a disastrous figure for Australia, particularly for those people who cannot get a job. In my State of Western Australia the unemployment figure is some 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us look at what has happened over the last three years. In 1988-89, 535,000 people were unemployed; in 1989-90, 515,000; and in 1990-91, 713,600. As of this month, the official figures show 900,700 people are unemployed. We are well on track, unfortunately, to coming up with an official figure for the 1991-92 year of an average of one million unemployed people. It is well known, of course, that these figures do not reflect all those people who are unemployed&mdash;those unfortunate beings who are the victims of Mr Keating's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the other results. I have quoted to the Senate the figures in terms of the position which existed. In 1989-90, as I said, some half a million people were looking for jobs, but at that particular time there were 64,300 vacancies. The August 1991-92 figures&mdash;the latest available to me&mdash;show that, with nearly one million people unemployed, there are only 25,600 vacancies. So in August the number of vacancies was only slightly more than one-third the number in 1989-90, but the number of people unemployed was double that of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get back to my point about confidence. People's confidence has been shattered, as is borne out by recent figures showing how investment rates have fallen off. To take this a little further in terms of jobs, in November last year there were actually 7.832 million people in the work force. In November 1991, that figure had shrunk to 7.6501 million. That means that 181,900 fewer people are working now than there were at this time last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at more figures in terms of what Mr Keating has wreaked on the economy of the people of Australia. Look at the great Australian dream, the dream of owning one's own home. This is a dream which, I believe, has been supported by all political parties in this country since Federation. If we look at the figures in terms of dwelling approvals, we find that in 1988-89 the figure was 186,358; in 1989-90 the annual average shrank to 140,016; in 1991 it shrank again to 126,046. That is, in 1991 there were 60,000 fewer approvals than there were just two years ago. Of course, it is a lot worse than that because one has only to drive around Perth, for example, the capital city of my State, to see house after house with `for sale' signs up. The `for sale' signs are continuing to grow in number. I saw one `for lease' sign the other day which read, `Absolutely urgent that we rent this place. We will take anything for it'. That is the impact that the Grim Reaper has had on dwellings and on that great Australian dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at bankruptcies, the other side of the equation. I talked about unemployment, but the other side of the equation concerns the people who are in a position to provide jobs. We find that the increase in bankruptcies has been absolutely enormous. If we look at the 1989-90 figure, we find there was an increase of 15 per cent on average in bankruptcies in Australia. We find in 1991 an increase of 53.1 per cent. We find that so far this year that has grown to in excess of 70 per cent. So we have another statistic about the policies of this man, Mr Keating, who has been touted as the next Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to deal with the impact of interest rates on the Australian economy. Two days ago in this Senate, the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh acknowledged that the misuse of monetary policy has done much damage to our economy. One can start almost anywhere, but at the beginning of 1988-89 the banks' prime interest rate was 15 per cent. That gradually grew until in June 1989 it reached 19.75 per cent. In 1989-90 interest rates started off at 20.25 per cent, remained there for seven months and then came down to 18.75 per cent. There have been gradual reductions since that time, but the problem is that the damage has been done. The policies of this man, Mr Keating, have wreaked havoc not only on the businesses in the cities of Australia but also on the farm sector and the miners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from the most recently released figures that the farm sector has shrunk by some 16 per cent. Much of that has been a direct result of the high interest rate policy. Operators have been forced to reduce their operations. We see that around Australia in wheat plantings, wool production, employment patterns and the various activities that lead to a strong economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather interesting but very alarming that Government members cannot find amongst their ranks a replacement leader who has the potential for a better track record than exists at this time. In the current recession, many people were paying prime interest rates of 25, 26 and 27 per cent as the impact of monetary policies filtered through to the banks. Even today, when the indicator rate is down significantly&mdash;thank goodness&mdash;on what it was, bank overdraft rates are still up around the 15 or 16 per cent mark, at a time when people's incomes have diminished significantly in terms of business output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat what I said two days ago about Mr Keating when I was speaking on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His reliance on monetary policy and his inability to recognise that there must be incentive, reward and profit in one's industrial and taxation systems should condemn him to the depths of the pits forever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's unemployment figures are not good. I do not deny or in any way seek to diminish the real pain they represent for working Australians and their families. I do say something about those figures, though.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there is an extraordinary volatility month to month in the unemployment figures, as we all ought to be well aware of by now. The figures this week show that an additional 36,000 people are unemployed. Those figures should be compared with the figures for the July-August period when 106,000 people were added to the ranks of the unemployed, or those of an earlier month when 83,000 people came off that list. The figures do jump around by quite significant margins and we are seeing just another example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it needs to be said that bad as the unemployment rate is, and I frankly acknowledge that it is, at 10.5 per cent it is still within the parameters that were predicted at the time of the Budget and that were fully debated then&mdash;the assumptions on which they were based and the policies settings on which they were based. It is our hope and expectation, as was articulated at Budget time, that there will be a pick-up in activity throughout 1991-92, bringing with it reductions in unemployment in the latter part of this financial year and, of course, subsequently throughout 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early signs of that pick-up are now apparent. Non-farm GDP grew by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, as we have said in this place before, with demand growth, particularly in the export sector, being even stronger. Dwelling unit commencements data released yesterday provide further evidence that the turnaround in the housing sector is well under way. Total commencements rose 6.2 per cent in the September quarter, after rising just 2.6 per cent in the June quarter before that. Again, today's retail trade release shows that turnover rose 2.1 per cent in October, further confirming the now clearly evident sharp improvement in trend growth that began around April-May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies that this Government has set in place, which I have identified throughout the course of this week&mdash;as people in debate and discussion throughout the year have before me&mdash;have put in place a recovery which will produce sustainable continuing job growth. That is a very different environment to that which we can contemplate as far as the Opposition is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we talk about the position of working people under the present Government, we should look at the attitude to workers' living standards that is so apparent from the Opposition's industrial relations policies. As Senator Cook has said on so many occasions, those policies would bring chaos to our industrial relations system. They would threaten workers' rights to be represented by unions; result in the abandonment of general wage increases, leaving industrially weaker workers exposed to even greater falling living standards; and halt progress in securing adequate superannuation cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In health policy the same attitudes prevail&mdash;those opposite would abolish bulkbilling for non-card holders, they would cause doctors' fees to rise and they would cause a $2 billion blow-out in Australia's health care bill.</PARA>

The fifth and final general element in our economic strategy is to reduce the current account deficit and, thereby, to stabilise the external debt. They are the five basic pillars of macro-economic policy. The general objectives which underlie the application of each of those instruments and seek to produce each of those results are, first, the objective of keeping demand growth below production growth, thus enabling us to lock in inflation and to lock in the gains which we have achieved in the current account deficit reduction; and, secondly, through a combination of industry policy and micro-economic reform policy, to produce an economic environment which is productive, competitive, efficient and flexible. That is the kind of economic strategy we have. We make no apology for it. We have fully described it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Macdonald for pointing out the time to me; I am conscious of it. I am asked about the liquid assets test. Honourable senators might recall that in last year's February statement the Government announced that it was to impose a liquid assets test for Jobsearch allowance. It is $10,000 for those with dependants and $5,000 for single people. Obviously, in setting that amount, the Government took its time and considered quite a number of levels. Obviously, we can make a level as harsh or as lenient as we like. Once we chose that level we decided that people would have to wait for four weeks if they had sums in excess of those amounts. That is a reasonable thing, given that there ought to be a responsibility on the part of people in so far as it is possible to look after themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately after that announcement, and since the onset of the recession, we had continual representations from the welfare sector to suggest that that was too hard and too tough. The Government has, however, maintained the figure and has no intention of changing it. I am aware that there have been suggestions in recent times&mdash;in particular from the coalition in the consumption tax package&mdash;that that four-week waiting period ought to be vastly extended, that in some way that was far too weak, not tough enough, and that it needed to be tightened very considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the Government will not consider tightening the waiting period further is best done by example. If a 54-year-old production worker&mdash;married, with three children &mdash;lost his job, after 20 years service he might get as much as $50,000. It might be said that that is a fair bit of money. Under the proposal that the Government will not adopt, one would not get any help from the Government for 101 weeks. For just on two years, one would be expected to exhaust every single cent that that $50,000 represented. That $50,000 represents hope and some kind of future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a proposal such as this, every single cent is wiped out for just on two years. That is not a matter of being tough or targeting beyond this, because I have to concede that it does target something. It targets any Australian put out of work during the recession for another mean and vicious test. It makes certain that people are not having to wait just four weeks but years. Even if we use the Opposition's example of someone who gets $15,000 upon termination, one has to wait six months&mdash;25 weeks. That is not targeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people ask questions about the increases in unemployment that have been announced today, I hope they understand in asking those questions that the only prescription they give for those people who are unemployed is further misery&mdash;the kind of misery and straight-out destitution that that kind of liquid assets test demands and imposes. We will not be doing that. The Government will not be adopting the kind of nonsense that is entailed in making someone who is in his or her fifties wait two full years to get unemployment benefit. That is the kind of misery that this Government will never impose and to which it will never agree.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell Senator Baume: we do not pay excise on our fuel. The Power and Water Authority in the Northern Territory pays a total of $5m a year in excise on diesel fuel. If it was fully passed on to consumers it would cut their electricity costs by&mdash;wait for it&mdash;$13 a year. However, that will not be passed on because the Power and Water Authority in the Northern Territory has never made a profit; it loses $90m a year, and&mdash;Darwin is unique in this respect&mdash;it is subsidised by Federal Government subsidies for that loss. So it will not be passed on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the second part of the question, Senator Macdonald was making the point that these items, which consume an enormous amount of electricity in northern Australia, will be cheaper under the coalition's GST tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in the week I was interjected on by Senator Parer asking me to tell him about the Japanese situation. What we have just heard is a set of words that I am sure that Senator Parer does not agree with, but they are quotes from, in the first place, the Japanese Constitution and, in the second place, Japanese jurisprudence. They are, of course, constitutional provisions in Japan and the legal framework within which the practice of industrial relations in that country is worked out. To explain it further, let me go to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Encyclopaedia for Labour Law and Industrial Relations</EMPHASIS>, supplement No. 47, January 1985, and read the brief based on that description. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese Constitution guarantees the right to organise and to act collectively. These provisions have been interpreted by the Japanese courts as extending beyond the right to organise, to encompass the right to bargain collectively and the right to strike.</PARA>
<PARA>The unions' exercising of this constitutional right takes precedence over other legal considerations and unions and their members are exempt from civil or criminal liability for strikes or justifiable acts of dispute. I could go on, but one of the reasons why I think this is a question that is relevant to the Australian industrial relations system is that the Opposition touts the Japanese model of industrial relations as its model. It does so because of the enterprise union structure in Japan. There are over tens of thousands of trade unions in Japan and the Opposition wishes to translate that structure into Australia. The same brief tells us what the union structure in Japan really is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Japanese unions are fundamentally enterprise based&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the very point I have just made&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">they do not operate independently, but co-operate on a national level under industry-based umbrella organisations and the Japan Trade Union Confederation.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to make this important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry wide union organisations or federations are key players in wages and conditions negotiations, and the policies of these organisations are reflected in individual enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we have in Japan is industry unions with branches based on the enterprise but with their wage negotiations coordinated by the industry federation, which in turn is affiliated to the central confederation. The feature of the Opposition's package is that it simply cites the number of unions and does not explore the issue any further, as if the number of unions indicates the whole framework. It does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot select an industrial relations framework from the Japanese experience because, obviously, culturally, traditionally and in terms of the paternalistic nature of its society, it is different from Australia. The legal structure is this: there is an inalienable right to strike as well as organise, and that right is predominant over the practice of the civil law; and Japanese unions, while numerous, are affiliated to central confederations which negotiate wages and working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to hear from the Opposition any more about the Japanese example. Our legal structure is slightly different, but what this Government is seeking to achieve is industry based unions with enterprise based branches in order to generate at the enterprise level agreements which lead to higher productivity and profitability. I think if we cease hearing examples of how many unions there are and look exactly at the whole of the structure, we will advance this debate most beneficially for us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is that the Japanese Constitution guarantees rights. It does not deny the rights of organisations; it recognises that if a framework is created in which organisations and individuals have guaranteed rights, they will act responsibly. What we have from the Opposition is a denial of rights and the creation of a framework in which organisations and individuals will have to take action to protect themselves, which is a highly disputatious scenario. That is the scenario of the Opposition. Not only is it a policy of low wages in Australia; it is a policy of high disputation as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wages system over which we have presided as a government is a wages system that is supported by the industrial parties. The Confederation of Australian Industry and the ACTU both applauded the last national wage case, which was a case that responded directly to the Government's national wage case submission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our wages policy enables moderate aggregate wage outcomes to be factored into the Budget and to be delivered. Therefore, it is a positive macro-economic tool. It also enables us to manage the decentralising of the centralised wage fixing system in a cooperative way. It does this in a way which features world best practice to increase productivity and efficiency of Australian industry and which ensures that there is an equitable outcome for wages across the board, including for workers who are poorly protected or who have no bargaining power. They can achieve an equitable wage outcome in our system. I might say that throughout Australia as a consequence of these settings, workers and employers are now sitting down together and sorting out the joint goals of the company, working out how to increase production, how to share the rewards between themselves fairly in profits and wages; they are coming to win/win outcomes.</PARA>

It is a path that will make sure it is efficient, effective and internationally oriented.</PARA>

What he has failed to indicate is that under those particular cover arrangements, the small excess he refers to means that in the case of NIB a person has to pay $300 up-front and in the case of HCF a person has to pay $500 up-front. For persons who require care, that is a considerable payment that Dr Woods tries to imply they will receive by way of insurance covered by tax credits. That will not be the case. The tax credits will not cover the cost of the insurance that people need to take out.

However, if by some curious chance the Minister believes that I was referring to the cost of generating electricity, I put it to him that I was also correct and that he was quite wrong today to dismiss my comments as false. All remote rural farmers who generate their power from excise free diesel have to face an enormous transport cost on that diesel, which emerges out of the freight paid to take it to them. The huge freight cost depends heavily on the excise price of fuel. So even if the Minister misunderstood me, he is wrong on both cases. I should not have been treated with that nonsensical aside today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) during Question Time this day, relating to unemployment benefit and disability support pensions.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because the Australian public might misunderstand some of the partial statements made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). For example, he referred to the coalition's policy in relation to extension and typing of a liquid assets test and leave deferment waiting periods as somehow harsh and unconscionable and&mdash;I suppose, in his terms&mdash;inflicting more misery on people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to what has happened in Western Australia in recent times. The State Government granted a $50m voluntary redundancy package payment to public servants. Dr Lawrence, when asked whether these people would be eligible for unemployment, or JSA, said that people accepting the redundancy package would not be able to claim the dole for two years. In other words, she said it without comment because she thought it was reasonable and that is what she understood the position to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence subsequently said that she had been confused. She said that given the complexion of those selected for redundancy she would be surprised if they went on the dole. Again, she was saying that they might technically be entitled to the dole but she could not imagine that they would be so greedy as to want to receive the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very same article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> it is reported that a spokesman for the Department of Social Security said that the Department's benefits&mdash;meaning the State Government's&mdash;and entitlement criteria were generous. He said that the Department's financial information service had been flooded with calls from many of the 1,700 public servants wanting to know whether their redundancy pay-outs would put them outside the entitlements net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, Senator Richardson is saying that he and this Government condone public servants getting pay-outs on average of $35,000 each and immediately putting their hands out. I would have thought that was a disgrace and something that the Minister ought to be disapproving of. But no, again we have a bland statement saying, `Because you can identify someone who might have received a $20,000 pay-out at age 54, that somehow implies that they have an entitlement'. People in that situation getting a $20,000 pay-out will have an implicit income of $455 per week under our approach. We therefore say that they should be required to defer their application for a period of 33 weeks. If that is not reasonable, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge Senator Richardson to explain the concept of redundancy. It is a payment made to tide one over between jobs&mdash;in other words, to meet the very cost that one is expected to cope with on one's own once one ceases receiving a regular income. That is what it is about. It is not a free handout to pay off the flat, the mortgage or whatever else; it is meant to be an income support arrangement to which people have quite often contributed during their working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Minister to misrepresent our policy in this way is nothing more or less than simply trying to ignore the obvious. The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 13 November said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is something wrong with a system which allows people who accept voluntary redundancy payouts to sign up for dole payments only a few weeks later.</PARA>
<PARA>It is compounded in Victoria by public servants who are getting payments under a $300m voluntary redundancy package immediately getting the dole. The average pay-out is $44,000 each. If that is the sort of system that Senator Richardson wants to preside over, we are delighted to hear it. I am sure the Australian public will reject that as totally outrageous, as bringing welfare into disrepute and simply giving the lie once again to the oft repeated statement that he makes that there is not one more cent to be squeezed out of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question that I wanted to deal with related to wives of disability support pensioners. I want to make it clear that our policy says that only wives under the age of 50 and whose husbands do not need a carer ought to be required to look for work. The Minister's erstwhile leader&mdash;we do not condescend to names because Senator Richardson only supports the leader of the moment&mdash;the leader he used to support, Mr Hawke, used to run around the countryside pretending that our policy involved people having dole payments stopped once they had been on the dole for nine months. Everyone else in the community understands by now that that has never been our policy. Our policy has simply been that people would go on to special benefits after that time if they qualified. It is utterly wrong and mischievous of Senator Richardson to pretend that we are somehow taking these women off income support, because we are not. All we are saying is that they ought to be required to look for work. By definition, they are able bodied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Richardson wanted to chalk up a lower back injury, to get himself onto a disability support pension, which is absurdly easy to do, all he would need to do would be to get a couple of medical certificates to say that he has a 20 per cent impairment level, which I would have thought is ludicrous. If we compare it with equivalent standards around the world, honourable senators would immediately come to the conclusion that it is ludicrous too. Let us say that Senator Richardson managed to get himself a lower back injury. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is a very serious impediment and it is probably fatal for some people. Let us say that Senator Richardson is able to show that he is not likely to be able to get income for the next two years. He would get himself a disability support pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By definition, Senator Richardson's wife would be entitled to a pension. Is that fair? His wife could resign from work, where she has been able-bodied and gainfully employed for a period of years, but simply because she is married to a disability support pensioner she gets a pension. I do not understand the logic of that and I would like the Minister to explain it. I would have thought that is unfair, that is un-Australian, that brings the system into disrepute, and that is an advantage given to one-half of the population simply because, by definition, they happen to be spouses of disability support pensioners. It is not even a spouse pension; it is a wife's pension. I do not understand the logic of it and I do not think the Australian public does either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that if Senator Richardson wants to go around pretending that somehow we should have a welfare system that subsidises able-bodied citizens who are capable of earning a living, who do not have responsibilities to care for disability support pensioners&mdash;because they would be eligible for a carer's pension under our policy&mdash;I would have thought that is a classic example of why the welfare state is in the trouble that it is today. </PARA>

If one looks right across the board at private industry, at where people have been losing their jobs in manufacturing in the course of the past 12 to 18 months, one will not see them with the big payments. The honourable senator's own example is about someone on $15,000 who stays out of reach of unemployment benefits for 25 weeks. His own example is about someone with $15,000 being forced to spend every single cent of it before they are entitled to unemployment benefit. That is just wrong.

If we then turn to the second issue, we get this statement about disability support. This issue has been going on now for a long time. We always get the scoffing by Senator Alston of lower back injuries. Apparently everyone who has a lower back injury, irrespective of what pain and what discomfort it causes, is a malingerer. All of those people who have lower back injuries and receive invalid pensions have the support of members of the medical profession. Senator Herron is not going to disown doctors; he is not going to tell us that all of these doctors have got it wrong; he is not going to tell us that none of these people with lower back injuries&mdash;at which Senator Alston scoffs&mdash;are not suffering pain, are not suffering discomfort and are not finding it impossible to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it so disappointing that not only Senator Alston but his colleagues cannot understand that those people are suffering and do need income support.

He is saying that the wives of disability support pensioners, if they are under 50, on low impairment levels, or what he would call low impairment levels&mdash;he is saying the lot&mdash;are not entitled to any form of income support. So do not take some extreme example of a woman who may have resigned from employment.

An extra load must be placed on women in those households. We are not talking about a few women; we are talking about thousands upon thousands of women. All Senator Alston does is scoff at lower back injuries and tell us that a woman somewhere might resign from employment. The fact is that he has never come to grips with, and does not even understand, the plight of these women. That really worries me. Forget about the political argument. I wish he would go out and experience the conditions in which these women are living. If he did, even he would have to back away from this policy. There is an awfully long way to go in this argument.

<PARA>The unemployment figures released today are not simply the last political nail in Mr Hawke's coffin; they are a tragedy for all Australians, particularly young Australians leaving school&mdash;there will be just under 200,000 in the coming weeks&mdash;who will be thrown onto the job market. This means that, at present, 31 per cent of young people under the age of 20 cannot find a full time job. That is the most horrendous figure on the records of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that we have an overall unemployment figure of 900,700. That is almost double the number of people who were unemployed during the Great Depression. It represents an unemployment rate of 10.5 per cent. That is despite the fact that the participation rate in Australia&mdash;in other words, the number of people trying to get jobs&mdash;has gone down by almost one per cent over the last 12 months. If the same participation rate had existed this month as existed at the same time last year, the unemployment figure would be well over one million. It is not over one million only because people have given up the hunt for a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This disaster is not simply a problem that is happening to other people, it is happening to everyone in Australia. Everyone in Australia has a friend who is suffering from this Government's deliberate recession we `had to have'. It is extraordinary that the man who deliberately engineered this recession is now being promoted as the man who should take over from the Fall Guy, Mr Hawke, who happily allowed Mr Keating to engineer the `recession we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But look at the number of jobs that have been simply wiped out as a result of these policies. A quarter of a million full time Australian jobs have been wiped out over the last 12 months as a result of policies that the Government says are fine. We heard here at Question Time the Government consistently saying not to worry, `We have everything in hand, we are on track'. That is exactly the same phrase Mr Keating used to use before we actually had the recession we had to have: everything was on track. We were not told in what direction this track is leading us. But everything was on track&mdash;on track to disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appalling thing is that of those 250,000 full time jobs that were wiped out, almost 40 per cent of them were for young Australians &mdash;Australians under the age of 20. So this Government has generated a situation of very little hope for even the most skilled young Australians, and no hope for unskilled young Australians. A 31 per cent unemployment rate for young people seeking full time work is certainly the highest ever. When the school leavers eventually break over the dam wall that this Government has created by paying Austudy to secondary school students to hide the real level of youth unemployment, the level of unemployment will be appalling. As the Australian Chamber of Manufactures warns today, the nation's unemployment rate may reach 11 per cent early next year when these school leavers hit the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we have this disastrous reduction in the number of jobs available to people but also there is no prospect of anything happening in the near future to resolve the situation. There was nothing in the answers at Question Time that indicated any plan or any coherent action being taken by this Government. Only three weeks ago the Government brought out an employment statement. It did not create one job. All it did was seek to take further measures to hide, in various training schemes, particularly in TAFE, the genuine level of unemployment. Despite all of these schemes, we still have this horrendous unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there are only 269,000 young Australians actually at work. I compare that with the 450,000 young Australians who were in full time work in the depths of the 1982-83 recession that we keep hearing so much about in this chamber. Mr Hawke said no government should ever be forgiven for creating that kind of unemployment. But there were more people at work&mdash;a huge difference &mdash;under the Fraser Government than there are now under this disastrous Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to ask, how did all this happen? How did we end up in this terrible disaster if everything was on track, if the Government knew what it was doing, if in fact it is looking forward with confidence to a pick up? All the experts are saying that they expect unemployment to be over 10 per cent or around 11 per cent for two or three years to come. We have not seen any effective denial of that. I look forward to Senator Cook denying that later, if he can, and giving us solid forecasts about how there are going to be reductions in unemployment within that timeframe. All the experts say that the prospects are gloomy for employment unless there is some circuit breaker, unless something is done to restore incentive, to restore job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen today's press release in which Senator McKiernan, the former Labor Whip, asks: why do we have this huge level of unemployment, why did it happen and how did it happen? He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are now 900 700 reasons why Paul Keating should not be elected Prime Minister of Australia. The man who gave us the recession we had to have should not now be rewarded for his accomplishment.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing can be more accurate than that. Yet we heard at Question Time Senator Evans say, `Oh well, the Budget had indicated that unemployment would be around 10 3/4 per cent and what is happening now is simply in line with the Budget forecast'. If the Government expected these sorts of unemployment levels, the Government and Mr Keating's supporters must also recognise that it is generally accepted that the Budget parameters were set by guess who? They were set by Mr Keating before he left in May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget parameters were clearly set by the man who created the crisis and who now seeks to oust the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, whose sin in this area was to allow Mr Keating to do what Mr Keating wanted to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Mr Keating quit in May of this year to avoid being seen as related in any way to this Budget which has deliberately created this unemployment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not heard in this debate any policy input whatsoever from the Opposition. All we have heard is a lurid and somewhat overemotional description of what in fact is the case, and I will set that in context in a minute. We have heard some personal allegations about Mr Keating and inferences about Mr Hawke but no policy prescriptions whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamentals that we have set in the economy mean that we do have a policy which will put people in jobs. They will not be false or make-work jobs; they will be jobs with careers. In a moment, I propose to outline those policies in broad detail. I also propose to reply briefly to the Opposition and to set the record straight on the significance of these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the middle of those three objectives in this speech first, that is, to reply to the Opposition. Governments must be judged on their capacity to deal with the economic realities of the day. The judgment therefore is: are we better equipped than the Opposition to deal with it? It is interesting, therefore, to see, in terms of the Opposition's position, the analysis that has recently occurred in the media over its consumption tax package released by Dr Hewson, which will be the basis of all economic reform in this country should the Opposition come to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most interesting article I have read is one that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 10 December. This was written by the former chief of staff to John Howard, when he was Leader of the Opposition for four years, and a senior adviser to the Fraser Government. It is therefore a column not written by a Labor sympathiser but a think-tank expert from the Liberal Party. In his column, Mr Gerard Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the firm warranty that some 2 million jobs `will' be created and unemployment halved by the end of the century is just a guess. Well meaning, no doubt. Yet a hypothesis just the same.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, the AEM model on which this overtly optimistic promise is based does not take into account the inflationary impact of the Coalition's across-the-board goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that these are the words of Mr Henderson, John Howard's adviser and an adviser to the Fraser Government. Mr Henderson concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is all pie in the sky.</PARA>
<PARA>What Mr Henderson is talking about is the Opposition's policy of creating employment. He says that it is pie in the sky, that there is no basis for the Opposition's estimates of job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not simply rely on the words of someone who is now out of the Opposition organisationally. Let me rely on what Dr John Hewson said on 23 November when he appeared at the Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club and talked about the goods and services tax package that he had released. What did he say on employment? He dodged the question; he evaded giving an answer of any significance. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not making any promises about the level of unemployment. There will be transition effects.</PARA>
<PARA>He said something similar on 22 November. I do not want to spend any more time on the Opposition's pretensions to power in this country. It is clear that one of the people best placed to judge and who has been part of the Opposition's economic thinking for so long, has condemned the Opposition's package. He has said that the job increases are illusory and pie in the sky. Dr Hewson himself has evaded the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the package has a $2.6 billion hole in it; that it imposes $2 billion extra costs on medical expenses for Australians; that, according to Syntec, an independent economic forecasting unit, it is inflationary to a level of 9.5, not 4.4 per cent; that it will create a permanent underclass of working poor; and that it provides a revolving door under an alleged training program for unemployed which has no training requirement at all. I think that is testimony to the credentials of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put into context the current figures on unemployment. It is true that liars can figure and figures can lie. The Government is not at all fazed by the fact that the situation is as presented. We do not like the situation that way and we regret the level of unemployment but, as I have said, the economic settings are properly attuned to dealing with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even after the loss of employment due to the recession, almost 1.4 million, or 22.3 per cent, more Australians are employed than when we came to office. At the peak of employment in July 1990, 7.928 million Australians were employed, compared with a mere 6 1/4 million when the Government came to office&mdash;almost 1.7 million more people employed than when the coalition was thrown out of office by the people of Australia last time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear by way of interjection, `What about the participation rate?'. The participation rate is an economic measure that measures how many people are in the work force applying for jobs. In November of this year the participation rate stood at 63 per cent. The participation rate during 1982 and 1983, the last years of the Fraser Government, stood at 60.3 per cent. The number of people offering for employment is much greater now that it was then. If we applied the Fraser level of participation rate to the current level of unemployment in this country, the figure would be 6.5&mdash;not 10.5, as it is now. The fact is that these figures show the extent to which the size of the Australian work force has grown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other contextual point is that in the seven years of the Fraser Government, employment grew by 5.6 per cent. In other words, in the seven years and five months that Australia lost to the Fraser Government, a Government in which the current Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was the economic adviser, the coalition could generate only about 330,000 jobs, a growth rate of a mere 0.7 per cent per annum. I contrast that pathetic performance with the record of this Government. In the first seven years and five months of this Government&mdash;that is, from April 1983 to August 1990&mdash;this Government produced over 1.6 million jobs. I wish to make the point that we are looking at a mere 330,000 compared with 1.6 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the numbers further. Under this Government, employment grew between April 1983 and July 1990 by a total of 27 per cent at an average rate of 3.3 per cent, not by a total of 5.6 per cent at an average of 0.7, which was the Fraser comparison. Ours, 27 per cent; theirs, 5.6. Our average rate of growth was 3.3; theirs, 0.7. That is what the figures say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, even after the employment loss over the last year, employment today is still some 22 per cent above the level of April 1983 and has grown by an average of 2.3 per cent per annum. We are 22 per cent above the level of April 1983. Even taking into account the recession, this Government has still created jobs at a rate over three times faster than the Opposition managed the last time it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those remarks for the reason of setting into context a them-and-us comparison. Those opposite are the pretenders to power. That is their record and that is our record. Let the record speak so that an assessment can be made about who can handle these matters more effectively. On the record and when it speaks, it can be seen with the figures set out quite clearly that the record is very much one that sits with us and not with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy is undergoing a massive transformation. Through the policies of this Government, we are going from a country that in the past has ridden on the sheep's back to a more diversified, competitive exporter striving for world best practice. As I have said, the present level of unemployment is unacceptable, but I believe that we have the basic policy elements that will restore sustainable growth, and thereby sustainable and secure job growth. There is evidence that the first stages of the recovery in the economy are under way. Unfortunately, employment is the lagging indicator. It picks up only after production and sales in the housing, retail and manufacturing sectors pick up. There is substantial evidence that our policies are working and that these leading sectors&mdash;the housing, manufacturing and retail sectors&mdash;are picking up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just today we have had the good news in statistics released on the retail, building and manufacturing sectors. Retail trade increased by 2.1 per cent in October. Dwelling unit commencements increased by 6.2 per cent in the September quarter. Industrial production in manufacturing increased by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter. Manufacturers' sales also picked up in the September quarter, by 2.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the leading indicators of employment prospects of the Department of Employment, Education and Training have been rising for the past four months. This augurs well for the better employment picture in the first half of next year. Already DEET's skilled vacancy survey for November has shown a 2.4 per cent increase in the vacancy index for trade related skills. It must be remembered that this Government has undertaken major reform measures that have placed Australia in a favourable position to take full advantage of the recovery to get back to the sustainable path for secure employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now a low inflation country. Make no mistake: the maintenance of low inflation is critical to achieving sustainable employment growth. Inflation distorts investment decisions, significantly reducing the incentives for productive job creating investment. Our inflation rate is 3.3 per cent. It now stands below the 4.3 per cent of our major trading partners in the OECD. We are lower than the OECD average. For the first time in a generation, we have an opportunity to make this a permanent situation. The commitment we have received from our accord partners to work with us in keeping Australian inflation at levels comparable with those of our major trading partners is a key element in our strategy for sustainable growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has made Australia a more competitive economy than the one we inherited in 1983. Restructuring and micro-economic reform are not just being talked about; they are being achieved. The performance of our manufacturing sector competing on world markets attests to that fact. Over the eight-year period to 1990-1991, the value of exports of machinery, transport equipment and other elaborately transformed manufacturers increased by 220 per cent, involving growth in volumes of 149 per cent. Over the last two financial years, the volume of these exports has grown an astonishing 57 per cent. We are now exporting more manufactured goods than we are exporting agricultural commodities for the first time in our history. The industrial base of Australia is transforming and it is because of that transformation that more jobs will be created which offer longer and better careers. The result has been a dramatically improved balance of payments. The balance on goods and services is forecast to be in surplus in 1991-92 for the first time in over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest trade statistics show that the value of merchandise exports rose by 5.5 per cent in the September quarter, reaching $12,000m. They rose a credible 4.4 per cent in the June quarter, but the September quarter is the highest level ever recorded for merchandise exports. These figures are a remarkable testimony to the effectiveness of our restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in the past 8 1/2 years this Government has instituted a program of economic reform unprecedented in the history of this country. Never has the pace been faster than in this year where, through the March economic statement, the November employment statement, and the Budget, we can see the evidence of the fundamental changes we are bringing about. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the remarkable success of Senator Collins in reforming the waterfront and in going about the other micro-economic reforms that this Government has achieved. For example, nationally there has been a 50 per cent reduction in the cost of grain handling through our ports. The Australian Wheat Board has heralded the change. It has said that Australian ports are now among the most efficient grain loading ports in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are questions of fundamental shifts in the economy. These are changes that take time to put into position; it will take time to reap results. We are going through a low spot now; that is true. It is towards the middle of our term and it is not surprising that it would be a low spot. But these fundamentals will now be working in the economy to see that there is a productivity surge in the Australian community, to see that job prospects lift, and that jobs will not be illusory&mdash;they will be real. The training programs we have put in place in the meanwhile will ensure that the degree of training which the work force is undergoing at an enhanced level during this period of downturn will be able to be picked up in real jobs when those training programs mature and the economy recovers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has virtually replied to the first part of the motion, as to why the Government will not respond. Basically, it is because it believes its policies are on the right track. I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with two words which appear in the first line of Senator Baume's motion: `human tragedy'. This is something that other speakers have tended to skip over. We are not just talking about figures here; we are talking about people. I  would like to quote from two different sources. The first is a statement by the Catholic Bishops of Australia which was made at the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment is not just an abstract problem: it involves people: the young who have never had a job: the middle aged who are stunned to find their careers suddenly cut short: those who have been without work for so long that they are no longer regarded as "employable". And it does not stop there: their families are affected, we are all affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment means that a person's work is not wanted, or not valued. It can mean real losses: of participation in the life of the community; of esteem and self-esteem; financial security. The losses can multiply into loss of emotional and physical health and disturbance in personal relations.</PARA>
<PARA>I now quote from an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> not too long ago, entitled `Clock off&mdash;for the rest of your life'. It refers to a study conducted by two economists, Raja Junankar and Cezary Kapuscinski, of the ANU Centre for Economic Policy Research. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The long-term unemployed are not only a wasted resource but also a wasting resource," the study says. "They lose their skills, motivation, fall ill more often. In crude economic terms, human capital is being depreciated. There is a mass of misery and suffering: often they live in poverty, they have lost their self-respect and dignity and they accept the verdict of the labour market with a mixture of resentment and resignation. The social implications of this are very serious: some people argue that it leads to increased illness, suicide and homicide as well as to civil strife and a breakdown of marriages.</PARA>
<PARA>I come back to what we are looking at now: the Government's response to this problem. Today we have before us the worst unemployment figures that we have seen in Australia since the Great Depression. I say again that, basically, the reason the Government has not responded&mdash;and apparently does not intend to respond in any significant way&mdash;is that it would mean a change in policy and a new direction. It would mean taking another look at what it has been doing and admitting that it has not been going in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I have time to look at only a few of these policies. I will start with this mythical level playing field. The rest of the world seems to believe that the pursuit of this strange place is a nonsense. The rest of the industrialised countries support their industries and, in particular, encourage research. I draw attention to Senator Coulter's question today regarding the low level of support for the CSIRO. These countries often fund new sunrise technology and encourage the people in their countries with talent to keep new technologies in their own nation and to put them to best effect for the benefit of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to this the pursuit of the level playing field in agricultural policies. Australia and New Zealand are the world's agricultural odd couple. The latest figures indicate that 11 per cent of Australian farmers' incomes are attributable to government subsidies and other support mechanisms. In New Zealand it is 5 per cent. For our main partners and competitors, the figures are: 48 per cent in Europe, 30 per cent in the United States and 68 per cent in Japan. It is an incredible testimony to the efficiency and productivity of our farmers that they are still in the race at all and that they still remain world competitive with comparatively so little government or community support. In 1990, just as the Uruguay GATT talks were meant to be reducing world agricultural protection, the world cost of subsidies soared by 12 per cent to a total of $383 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to deregulation, something Senator Kernot touched on earlier. Speculation and greed replaced regulated banking practices. One example is the television industry. Two of the three commercial networks are in receivership. The production staff have been slashed and the quality of programs has deteriorated significantly&mdash;all because of the availability of easy money to a few greedy entrepreneurs who were only after the quick dollar basically because of bad banking decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at our tight monetary policy and the decision to hold interest rates high for far too long. Farmers and business people, already disadvantaged by what I have spoken of previously with regard to the tariff structure in this country, have had to face this additional burden. Interest rates rose to the point where not even the interest payments could be met and this forced many into bankruptcy. There have been record levels of bankruptcies. Many of those people will never recover. They will not be able to trade their way out of debt and will not recover economically or personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to the refusal to put more funds into areas where expenditure would not only boost employment but achieve important community goals, such as in the public housing sector. I acknowledge that the better cities program is a step in the right direction, but it is nowhere near enough. In the area of public transport it is the same story again. Nothing is happening in the area of local government expenditure or in respect of the enormous need in the environmental area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, those who have been hit the hardest have been hit again by the tightening of the social security system, and those who are already suffering under the Government's policies&mdash;the people who are mentioned in the two articles I referred to previously&mdash;are being hurt even more. Record numbers of people are now queuing at our welfare agencies. The Salvation Army in South Australia has just revealed that it spent its five-month government grant in six weeks. That represented 195,000 separate requests for food and money&mdash;a 300 per cent increase compared with the 65,000 requests received in the corresponding period last year. The number last year was up significantly compared with the year before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my last couple of minutes, I would like to look at what the Opposition would propose in each of these areas. Unfortunately&mdash;I find this really depressing&mdash;the hands off policy would worsen to a `no hands at all' policy. Its plan is to reduce tariffs even further to&mdash;I quote from its document&mdash;`negligible levels'. Our vehicle, textile, clothing and footwear industries would be being threatened. There is no way we can get our wages down to this level playing field nonsense. To do that we would have to get down to the sweatshop conditions, the sweatshop levels of many of our Asian neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent article it was said that children as young as eight and nine are forced to work in backyard factories for however many hours it takes to make the required number of articles. The Opposition would have even less tariff support for our rural industries. I did read the figures earlier. A number of policymakers, particularly from the Liberal Party, are flocking across the Tasman to study the New Zealand 5 per cent model&mdash;a model on which they want to base Australia's future. Liberal leader, Dr Hewson, flagged his views in March when commenting on the problems being faced by wheat growers and the probable devastation of country towns based around the wheat industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think you solve problems by throwing money at them and breeding inefficiency. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats believe that Australian agriculturalists simply cannot afford to lead the world in further tariff and other support reductions. It is suicide. The ideological path advocated by Dr Hewson may be economically efficient according to some textbooks he reads, as long as the rest of the world decides to play on a level playing field. But the Democrats believe that in Australia in the latter part of the 1991 it is unachievable; indeed, it is totally unrealistic for the foreseeable future and politically irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a Liberal Party government we would not only see further deregulation; we would also see a wholesale sell off of the rest of the family silver&mdash;the little that is left after the Labor Party has had a go. That would even include the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and Telecom Australia, et cetera. If inflation is to be kept in check, a tight monetary policy is the only alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we will be supporting this urgency motion with some hesitation. However, we find that there is absolutely nothing in the Opposition's package that will improve the situation. It is relying even more on the trickle down effect which has been proven throughout the world to be an absolute nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's failure to respond to the human tragedy of the worst level of unemployment in Australia since the Great Depression, in Mr Keating's deliberately engineered "recession we had to have".</PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious debate. In this chamber today are Senator Cook and Senator Schacht, two men who are the strongest backers of Mr Keating to replace Mr Hawke as the leader of this country. I say to those two honourable senators, `There are a million reasons out there, numbered in the people who cannot find jobs, why your man for Prime Minister, Mr Keating, should not become the head of this country'. Neither should Mr Hawke, but that is a matter which I will be pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her speech, Senator Lees drew our attention in a somewhat moving and correct way to the tragedy embodied in these figures&mdash;the tragedy of individuals who now cannot find jobs as a result of the policies of this Hawke Labor Government. I say to Senator Cook, who seemed to read his speech without enthusiasm: the unemployment rate in Victoria is not 10.5 per cent or 10.6 per cent; it is over 11 per cent. Unemployment amongst young people is rising to close to 32 per cent. Senator Cook should come down to Victoria and visit St Albans, Footscray or the western suburbs. He will see what has happened to the people who have ceaselessly put him and his colleagues back into government and the damage that this Government has brought on those people. I believe that he would then ask himself how he could continue to support policies which are inflicting such damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook stands up in this chamber day after day pretending that the Government's policies are a success. How he can say that, on this of all days, is beyond belief. Senator Cook, in his speech, said that he was not fazed by the problems that the Government is currently facing. He dismissed them by saying that the Government is mid-term. As if `mid-term' is an excuse for one million people being without jobs. That is an absolutely disgraceful comment. Senator Cook then pointed to some aspects of the Government's policy and suggested that they were a remarkable testimony to the success of the Hawke Government&mdash;when there are one million people without jobs and we have a foreign debt above $140 billion. When this Government came to office, foreign debt was $30 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook is an absolute disgrace not only for any government but for a Labor government. He has cut living standards of ordinary Australian workers. I have put this charge to him time and time again and he has failed to come into the chamber and counter that charge. Not only has Senator Cook cut the living standards of workers under his precious accord, but he is now throwing them out of a job. Senator Cook speaks about his accord partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How about having a partnership with the Australian people, with the ordinary workers in this country?  Senator Cook's partnership is one with the union bosses. We will not have a bar of that. This Government has said that the union movement was part and parcel of this Government. My oath it is; it is absolutely part and parcel. How Government supporters can go out and talk to their union members, the very people they are putting out of work, is beyond belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious debate; it is a vital debate for this country. We hoped that when Senator Cook got up he could have made a contribution. The question that people out there in the community will have to ask themselves, and those people who are listening today, from Senator Cook's speech&mdash;and we shall be listening closely to Senator Schacht's speech&mdash;is: what are the Government's plans to deal with this human tragedy?  It has now created the worst unemployment for 60 years; of that now there can at least be no dispute. I suggest that when Senator Schacht stands up he outline in detail the Government's plans to deal with this tragedy, because those opposite say that their policies are on track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just point to a newspaper today where it says that the mining industry this year, which the Government has killed with its green and red tape, is expected to cut investment expenditure by nearly $1 billion because of a loss of confidence. Of course, how can the mining industry possibly have any confidence in this Government when half of the Ministers show no support and no loyalty to their Prime Minister; these Ministers who plot and connive against him and who undermine him ceaselessly?  I have no truck for the Hawke Government; nor do I have any truck for Mr Hawke. But I believe that Mr Hawke is at least entitled to the loyalty of Ministers in his Cabinet. If they are not prepared to give that loyalty they should leave that Cabinet. But no, these Ministers want the best of all possible worlds; they want to undermine their Prime Minister; they want to retain their jobs; but they do not care less about the one million people who have lost their jobs. </PARA>

Year in, year out, this sort of urgency motion comes up so that senators like Senator Kemp can speak froth and bubble but with no substance. I am astonished that Senator Kemp would stand up in this Senate and proclaim his interest in the unemployed, such as the ordinary people of St Albans, when he is a self-professed member of the New Right of the Liberal Party which before the last election made sure that it destroyed any of the more moderate elements of the Liberal Party of Victoria. For instance, Mr Macphee, the former member for Goldstein, paid the penalty and Senator Kemp himself arranged the political assassination of Senator David Hamer, the former Deputy President of this chamber and a long respected senator.

But the Opposition does not tell too many people that the package also contains $10 billion worth of cuts to government expenditure. The Opposition does not tell us how many more tens of thousands of people will be put out of work by imposing $10 billion worth of cuts. Those opposite say, `Oh yes, but after a period of time we will create some confidence and there will be 200,000 jobs created elsewhere'. That is an absolute fantasy which is not based on any substance in the document. It is an attitude of trusting Dr Hewson who says, `This is the culture I want to create'. The culture is basically to sack tens of thousands of people and to destroy the public sector by reducing its expenditure by $10 billion in a whole range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I represented the Government at the graduation ceremony at the Australian Defence Force Academy where 250 young Australians graduated with pride from that academy to go into our defence forces. There is not much talk by those opposite saying, `We are going to cut back the defence expenditure by at least $200m'. Some of those graduates will be put out of their jobs in the defence forces. The Opposition in its obsessive, ideological desire to reduce government expenditure is setting about wrecking the competence and efficiency of the Australian Defence Force. It is an absurd notion. </PARA>

Senator David MacGibbon is absolutely silent, and he is supposed to be a defence expert. Senator Newman is always whingeing and whining in this chamber about the conditions and the role of the defence forces.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that the figure today of 10.5 per cent unemployment is tragic. No-one on this side of the Parliament has any joy in talking about this figure; we accept that. But I want to make a couple of points about the unemployment figures. One reason the unemployment rate is at 10.5 per cent is that there are a lot more people seeking employment. If we had the same participation rate as the Opposition had when it was last in office in 1982-83, the unemployment rate would be 6.5 per cent, not 10.5 per cent. There are a lot more people still in jobs because when the Opposition was last in office the participation rate was just on 3 per cent less than it is now. That is an equivalent in the unemployment rate of 4 per cent. There is no mention of that from the Opposition or that, despite the loss of jobs in the last year, this Government has still provided well over one million extra jobs since we came to office. We still have the highest percentage increase in job creation, which is more than any percentage level achieved when the Opposition was last in office. There was no mention from the Opposition that we now have the lowest interest rates for over 20 years. There was no mention that, despite the decline in the rural economy because of the decline in world prices for our primary products, we are now exporting much more than we ever did in manufacturing, which is a splendid achievement. </PARA>

Guilt follows that collapse in self-esteem and there can be no greater damage done to any individual than to destroy self-pride.

The Keating camp's crocodile tears over unemployment are an even  greater act of hypocrisy than Prime Minister Hawke's. At Christmas 1991 we have a Labor Party which, while showing absolutely no remorse for the suffering that it has created, is fighting amongst itself to decide who gets the top job. There are one million unemployed while the Labor Caucus squabbles over one job&mdash;a job which pays well over $150,000 a year, comes with two houses, an army of staff, and a plane at beck and call. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of honourable Members, I present a statement containing the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Active Citizenship Revisited</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1989 the Standing Committee tabled a Report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education for Active Citizenship</EMPHASIS>. In that Report the Standing Committee surveyed the widespread evidence of ignorance, apathy and feelings of powerlessness among Australians, and particularly young Australians, towards democratic institutions and processes. The Report went on to review the provision of courses, programs and services which attempted to give students and youth the capacities and motivation to actively participate at a number of levels in the Australian democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Active Citizenship Revisited</EMPHASIS> the Standing Committee has monitored the progress which has been made since the earlier Report, and makes a series of recommendations directed towards ensuring that citizenship education continues to be a priority for schools, higher education institutions and other relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee received 146 submissions, including submissions from the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Australian Electoral Commission. The Standing Committee tabled its Report on 14 March 1991. The Government has closely examined the report and its recommendations and I am pleased to present this statement in response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Active Citizenship Revisited</EMPHASIS> the Committee has surveyed progress in citizenship education at a number of levels and in a variety of forums. It found that there has been considerable progress by States and Territories in incorporating the goal of citizenship education in formal policy and curriculum statements. School systems are also acknowledging the need to go beyond a strictly institutional approach to this subject ("civics") and are emphasising the participative aspects of active citizenship. The Committee found, however, that there is a significant discrepancy between curriculum theory and practice, and that some systems have yet to provide teachers with the curriculum materials and professional training to make citizenship education more than a collection of political facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee also found a number of innovative projects at school level which are successfully exploring the possibilities of citizenship education. These initiatives indicate that, when teachers are convinced of the value of citizenship education, and are supported by their school, students can be prepared to actively participate in democratic processes. In summary, significant progress is being made in promoting active citizenship, but much remains to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that perhaps the most important pre-condition for citizenship education, and one of the most easily overlooked, is the presence of young people in educational institutions. Between 1983 and 1990 overall participation in education and training by the teenage cohort rose from 56.9% to 66.7%. The most significant element is this change has been the increase in Year 12 retention rates which reached 64% in 1990 compared to 33% for most of the 1970s. This dramatic increase in the number of students in educational institutions will work to promote active citizenship both by developing the literacy skills and general knowledge which are essential to effective political participation and by exposing much larger numbers of students to specific citizenship education programs which are developed by schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its Report the Standing Committee has recognised the positive advances the Government has made in promoting citizenship education at a number of levels. Since the publication of the 1989 Report the Australian Education Council (AEC), which comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers of Education, has agreed to act jointly to improve Australian schooling within a framework of national collaboration. The AEC has also announced ten common and agreed national goals for schooling, the seventh of which seeks to `develop knowledge, skills, attitudes and values which will enable students to participate as active and informed citizens in our democratic Australian society within an international context.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to give effect to these common and agreed national goals, the AEC has embarked on a mapping of a number of key curriculum areas in primary and secondary schooling and has also begun the task of developing common and agreed curriculum frameworks or national statements in eight approved areas of learning for all Australian schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the eight learning areas for mapping and development of a national statement is Studies of Society and Environment. The mapping of Studies of Society and the Environment has been completed and is expected to provide broad information about the definition, status and location of active citizenship in the curricula of Australian government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is already apparent that States and Territories have different ways of defining and integrating such studies in school curricula. One of the outcomes of mapping the area will be to reveal different approaches but more importantly, to identify areas of commonality across education systems. Such information will be of value in developing the next stage&mdash;a common curricula framework for Studies of Society and the Environment, acceptable to all Australian school education systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work on the development of the frameworks paper for Studies of Society and Environment will commence in October 1991 and is expected to be completed by March 1993. The Commonwealth is a member of the Steering Committee for this project, along with other State and Territory governments. It is expected that wide ranging consultation will occur during both the planning and development of the Studies of Society and Environment frameworks paper. It is in this context that the Commonwealth, and its collaborative partners in the process the State Governments, will have an opportunity to consider in what ways the Report and its findings has implications for school curricula and the development of a common curricula framework for this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While teaching and learning about active citizenship may be seen as integral to Studies of Society and Environment, it has relevance in other areas of the curriculum where learning has a social dimension and impact, including the curriculum areas of English, science, technology and mathematics. The skills of language, communication and negotiation, for example, which are also important aspects of learning for active citizenship, are also important aspects of learning in the curriculum area of English; such skills may also be considered for inclusion in a national statement on health education, which incorporates the area of personal development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to report that the Committee has commended the Government for initiating and providing ongoing support for the Citizenship Visits Program (CVP). This Program, initiated in response to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education for Active Citizenship</EMPHASIS>, has been very successful, with the numbers of students visiting the Parliament from the distant States of Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory growing from a few hundred in 1988 to over 6,300 in 1990. The Government  has agreed to funding for the CVP in 1991-92 of $650,000. More than 100 schools have booked places to participate in the Program this year, involving more than 4,000 students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this Program, the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Australian Electoral Commission fund the drafting, production, distribution and evaluation of a comic for disadvantaged youth called Streetwize. The comic covers such issues as the political process and its relevance to youth, the individuals potential for political action, where to enrol to vote and information on how to vote. Evaluation of the comic is carried out by sampling its readers. For example, in 1991 a sample of 130 young people from three States (metropolitan and rural) completed a questionnaire after reading comic number 18. The results have been used to better understand the problems encountered by youth in dealing with the political process and their part in this process, and to provide valuable feedback on these issues. Streetwize Comics have a national distribution system whereby sample comics and order forms are sent out to most youth services around Australia, including some distribution through Youth Access Centres. The Streetwize production and distribution process is documented in Reaching young People: The Streetwize Option. There have been seven evaluations of different aspects of the comics over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the Committee are wide-ranging, and the majority of them are directed to agencies other than the Commonwealth Government, including schools, school systems and universities. The Commonwealth does not have the administrative responsibility for the operation of schools or higher education institutions and on many of the issues raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Active Citizenship Revisited</EMPHASIS> report the Commonwealth's primary contributions to the advancement of the recommendations is to refer them to the relevant agency for consideration or co-operation with the States through the Australian Education Council (AEC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth tabled the report at the recent 66th meeting of the AEC in October 1991. At this meeting, the AEC agreed to ask State and Territory Ministers to consider Recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 in relation to their school systems and provide a progress report to the first AEC meeting in 1992. The AEC also agreed to refer recommendations 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5 to the AEC Curriculum and Assessment Committee for advice and report back to the first AEC meeting in 1992. The AEC has also asked the Curriculum and Assessment Committee to refer the report, as a source document, for the use of steering committees responsible for developing curriculum statements in Studies of Society and the Environment and other collaborative curriculum areas. Such referral will assist these processes take into account definitions, ideas, and issues concerning active citizenship and their role and integration in the curriculum. The AEC further agreed to refer recommendation 5.1 regarding production and distribution of the Australian Constitution to the Curriculum Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the Report which are directed to the curriculum, organisation and research of Higher Education institutions can only be acted upon by those institutions. The Commonwealth will refer the Report to the Australian Council of Deans of Education (ACDE), a newly formed body comprising representatives of State and Territory organisations representing education faculties and with special interests in teacher education and educational research. The ACDE is an appropriate national forum for the issues raised in the Reports recommendations for Higher Education. In addition, where appropriate recommendations will be referred to the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) and the State higher education authorities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1.3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that schools provide training and other assistance to student representatives on school councils to enable them to maximise the opportunities offered them to contribute to school governance. It further recommends that such training be extended to all school students to assist them to become active citizens in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the recommendation, and has referred it to State and Territory Ministers of Education through the AEC.  This recommendation has implications for school governance, school practices and organisation, teaching skills and strategies, participative learning and the transfer of learning from the school to the wider community environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, it has implications for the teaching and learning of skills of language, communication, decision making and negotiation. To this extent the Report's findings may be considered relevant to curriculum areas beyond Studies of Society, such as those of English and Health, which incorporates the area of personal development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1.4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that libraries, schools and other public information providers ensure the ready accessibility of a range of newspapers, and promote the reading and discussion of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the recommendation, and has referred it to State and Territory Ministers of Education through the AEC. Newspapers are already an important source of information and comment for many classroom activities but their wider promotion would need to be integrated with teaching and learning skills which focus on language, analysis and interpretation. In this context the curriculum frameworks paper in Studies of Society being developed by the AEC will not only seek to define the curriculum area encompassing active citizenship and identify it as a single discipline, cross-curricular and/or multi-disciplinary area of Studies of Society, but describe a number of strategies such as use of newspapers which could support the teaching and learning of active citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. TO THE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION          COUNCIL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC preface its national curriculum framework on Studies of Society and the Environment with an affirmation of the importance of values learning and with policy directions for teachers on appropriate strategies for implementing it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC develop a clear statement of the concept of active citizenship as a prerequisite for the formulation of the national curriculum framework for Studies of Society and the Environment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth and State Ministers of Education jointly commission regular national surveys of the political knowledge, attitudes and orientations of young people. This should be undertaken either as a separate initiative of the AEC, or as part of the existing national survey operations by, for example, the ANU, Research School of Social Sciences or the ACER, or the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controlled studies be undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed national social education curriculum specifically in relation to citizenship education in schools. Such studies might best be performed by the Curriculum Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the recommendation, and has  referred it to State and Territory Ministers of Education through the AEC. In addition the AEC has already endorsed a process whereby in conjunction with the development of frameworks documents in each curriculum area subject profiles (or descriptions of learnings) and related assessment strategies are also being developed. Such processes will have considerable potential for schools and teachers as a mechanism for monitoring learning outcomes for students in areas such as Studies of Society. It is understood that the National Social Science Survey (NSSS) at the Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS), ANU surveys Australians attitudes to the political situation and opinions concerning the Commonwealth, State and Local Governments. The samples used are drawn from the Australian Electoral Roll, which by definition represents members of the population 18 years of age and over. The ABS would collect this type of attitudinal information concerning Australian youth on an ad hoc basis only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2.4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that active citizenship education at both preservice and inservice level be promoted in the context of the National Project on Quality Teaching and Learning being carried out under the auspices of the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Project on the Quality of Teaching and Learning is a tripartite body with a mission to provide a forum for co-operative development work on key policy and procedural issues designed to improve the quality of teaching and learning across the nation. Since its inception the Project has established its priorities to enable attention to be given to the resolution of important structural issues. The major focus of the Project is therefore on award restructuring in the teaching profession covering such issues as: competencies, skills and techniques which make up the pedagogical component of teaching; structure and organisation of teachers' work and the relationship this has to management structures at school and regional levels; existing support structures for teachers; training and career structures; national framework for teachers' qualifications, conditions, and entitlements. `Active Citizenship' education, along with other teaching content and values issues fall outside the scope of the project. The Government will however refer this recommendation to the Australian Council of Deans of education in relation to pre-service education and to State/Territory education authorities in relation to in-service education activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2.5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that a co-ordinated approach be adopted to the production of resource materials for the national curriculum on Studies of Society and the Environment. Production should be the responsibility of a variety of organisations including the Curriculum Corporation, the Parliamentary Education Office, the Australian Electoral Commission, State Education Departments and Legislatures and individual organisations with an interest in this subject. Materials should be designed to broaden the approach to active citizenship in schools and to complement existing materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the aspects of national collaboration in curriculum and the development of national curriculum frameworks for the eight main curriculum areas is the identification of particular areas for curriculum materials development. The Corporation is currently considering the area of political education/active citizenship for curriculum materials development. A proposal to develop materials, subject to consultation with member systems and following development of a national statement in the curriculum area of Studies of Society and the Environment, is being considered. The Commonwealth will ensure that curriculum materials development work in this area involving Commonwealth agencies will be undertaken by, or in reference to, the Curriculum Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND          DEPARTMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that seeding grants be offered by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA), and other relevant agencies, to schools with a high proportion of non-English speaking background (NESB) students for innovative programs which are already operating successfully or have been developed to implementation stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DILGEA offers a range of funding programs to facilitate settlement of migrants of NESB. One of the programs, the Migrant Access Projects Scheme (MAPS), provides funding towards the cost of projects likely to improve services to migrants settling in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications from organisations such as schools can already be considered under the Scheme for projects of a developmental nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, under the Scheme preference is given to applications for projects which address current settlement priorities. In particular, the Scheme aims to improve the design, planning and coordination of services with migrants' needs in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While recognising the value of such programs, it is not DILGEA's role to fund curriculum related initiatives. Should applications for such programs be received, usual practice is to refer them to other appropriate agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that local government associations coordinate and encourage individual local councils in implementing and following up educational programs on local government for adults and students within their communities. This should be done in cooperation with education systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of Local Government (OLG) supports this recommendation. The OLG is conscious of the need for greater awareness of the activities of Local Government and the relationship between local councils and the local community. The OLG prepared an article written to appeal to school age children outlining the role of Local Government within the three spheres of Government. This was included in a publication entitled `Project Help for Students of All Ages' which is sold through newsagents. Run-on copies of the articles have been sent to all local governing bodies throughout Australia plus Local Government Associations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Local Government Development Program, the Queensland Branch of the Municipal Officers' Association was funded to produce a booklet `Career Opportunities in Local Government' intended to provide school leavers and graduates with information on positions and careers available to them in Local Government. The book was released as part of a Local Government Awareness week in 1989 and the book and promotional ideas would be readily transferable to other States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Entries in the 1990/91 National Awards for Innovation in Local Government indicate that individual Councils are promoting Local Government in their communities. For example, Flinders Shire Council produced a curriculum kit for school children to educate them about Local Government; Knox City Council produced a Local Government Projects Book designed for upper level primary school children and St Kilda City Council produced an information video on the services and facilities provided by Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that education for active citizenship in the broad sense referred to in this Report be promoted as a National Priority Area in its own right under the National Priorities (Reserve) Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian studies is one of the national priority areas identified for the National Priority (Reserve) Fund. Under this category, institutions have been invited to submit curriculum development proposals which promote an appreciation and understanding of Australian issues, including "projects concerned with instruction in the parliamentary system of government, legislative processes and administration in Australia". In 1991 $80,000 was allocated under this heading to a project assessing the undergraduate and postgraduate needs of local government staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the 1992 Fund there has been a change of emphasis away from funding individual projects to the funding of institutions under broad headings. Australian Studies will remain as a general priority area on which institutions may focus in applying for funding. The new arrangements which have been introduced for funding under the 1992 Reserve Fund are designed to place much greater emphasis on funding within a framework of institutional planning and decision making in relation to national priority areas. In this context funding will be directed to larger projects which reflect institutions' priorities in terms of their strategic plan instead of the former practice of funding many smaller projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth specifically promote Goal 7 of the Hobart Declaration as an objective to be pursued in inservice training for teachers. This might best be pursued through Commonwealth Education Centres which should be encouraged to play a part in developing and coordinating inservice training for teachers of active citizenship in collaboration with state systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Education Centres are Commonwealth funded independent organisations. They were established with the principal objective of improving the professional competence of teachers by providing inservice teacher training and the opportunity to test and implement curriculum changes. Commonwealth Education Centres provide resources and training to teachers from all school systems and have admirable relationships with most State and Territory education systems. These Centres would welcome the opportunity to promote Goal 7 of the Hobart Declaration, particularly through dissemination of materials on participative citizenship. The Commonwealth will undertake to involve the Centres in the dissemination of curriculum materials developed in this area through national collaborative processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. TO HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that teacher training institutions place due emphasis on active learning, critical reflection and community involvement in their courses for teachers at both primary and secondary level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that teacher training institutions look closely at introducing participation as a way of stirring interest and enthusiasm among student teachers, too many of whom still lack the knowledge, skills and enthusiasm to excite their pupils with regard to active citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to 4.1 and 4.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be possible for institutions to include elements of active citizenship and related themes within their pre-service programs for primary and secondary teachers, but the extent to which they would be prepared to do so, given the constraints applying to their existing programs in terms of time, resources and structure, would be an issue for consideration by the institutions, possibly in consultation with employing authorities. Both of these recommendations will be drawn to the attention of the Australian Council of Deans of Education (ACDE).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4.3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that relevant Departments in Australian universities consider undertaking research into the way young people obtain information from newspapers, and the influence of print media on their political attitudes and awareness.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the production and distribution of copies of the Australian Constitution, at minimum cost, to schools and to the general public through libraries, AGPS bookshops where they exist. This could be undertaken by the Curriculum Corporation, the Parliamentary Education Office or State Legislatures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) prints and sells the Constitution through its bookshops and other outlets, and through its mail order service. Rates for bulk orders are available and, depending on quantity and quality, can be as low as 60 cents per copy. The size of the print and quality of paper of the A6 version enable it to be offered for sale at the inexpensive price of $2.50 which is the minimum necessary to cover production and distribution costs. A higher quality version, in a larger print size, is available for $8.50, while a Department of the Senate publication (including an outline of the content and structure of the Constitution) is available for $9.95.</PARA>

<PARA>Following the very lively debate showing the ills of our economy at the moment and our large unemployment rate, it is interesting to see that there is a glimmer of hope in the 1990-91 annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) the Chairman, John Haddad, points out that despite the Gulf war and the effect it had on tourism into Australia, tourism grew by 4 per cent over the last 12 months when international travel overall is estimated to have dropped by 10 to 15 per cent. It speaks volumes for John Haddad, whom I know personally. He was responsible for the first casino in Australia&mdash;the Wrest Point Casino. He is a man of vision. I am pleased to see that at least the Government appointed someone who will achieve something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Commission is aiming to achieve $10 billion in foreign exchange earnings by 1995-96. I just hope that that happens. According to this report, the major increase in tourism into Australia is from Japan. The actual increase is 20.3 per cent over the last 12 months. Senator Sherry would have to agree with my own experience in Tasmania and the large number of people out of work there. It was sad to see that, when the Sheraton Hotel advertised about 15 part time jobs recently, there were in excess of 200 people queuing all day to try to get interviews. It shows how bad the unemployment situation is in Tasmania at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disturbed during Question Time to hear Senator Evans commenting on the proud record of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over the last eight years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>This report is a report of hope. The Commission is looking to bring many more tourists into Australia. There has been a big increase in Japanese tourists; hundreds and thousands of them are flooding into Australia at the moment. Unfortunately, they use a lot of our services but they leave very little money to pay for them. They arrive in Japanese planes, they stay in Japanese owned hotels, they travel in Japanese owned buses and they buy their goods in Japanese owned duty free shops.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all very well&mdash;they are investing in the future in Australia and they are creating jobs in Australia; there is no question about that. But under our proposed Fightback program, with a goods and services tax they will at least be making a contribution to the services in this country that they use.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the 1990-91 annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission. This document is one of the great success stories of the Hawke Labor Government. The Commission outlines, and underlines in black and white, the sheer increase in the volume of tourism into Australia in the period of the Hawke Labor Government during the 1980s. Australia has gone from having only about 200,000 international visitors per annum in the early 1980s to 2 1/4 million overseas visitors in 1988 in the bicentennial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that, despite the impact of the Gulf war, in the financial year 1990-91 we almost achieved that record figure of 2 1/4 million overseas visitors. We were within a few thousand of attaining that peak level of international visitors to Australia. It is a tremendous achievement compared with the backwater Australia was under the conservative Government in the early 1980s, when very few international visitors came to Australia. They could be numbered in the hundreds of thousands; now they can be numbered in the millions. The key growth area this year was Japan. About 480,000 Japanese visitors came to Australia, and there was a 20 per cent growth in the Australian inbound tourism market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert very studiously ignored the important point in this report that not only are visitors staying longer in Australia, but also they are spending more in this country. Very important comments are made by the Australian Tourist Commission itself in underlining just what a contribution international tourists are now making to the Australian economy. They are spending more in the Australian economy; they are staying longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new focus in tourism will be on Korea and Taiwan. There are now Qantas flights to Korea and a Qantas subsidiary&mdash;Australia-Asia Airlines&mdash;is now operating on the Taiwan route. Those areas have been targeted by the Australian Tourist Commission as potential major growth areas for inbound tourists to Australia. Of course, there has been the recent campaign by Mr Greg Norman to generate interest in Australian tourism in North America. I understand that the bookings from that new campaign of advertising Australia as a destination have gone up dramatically and are very optimistic for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism now at an international level is a major contributor to the Australian economy. It generates jobs, it generates investment and it is also a major contributor to our balance of payments. It is now effectively a major export earner for Australia in the form of a generator of foreign currency process. There has been a tremendous turnaround in the period of the Labor Government in international tourism. Australia was once a backwater under the Liberals; now we have a very large international tourism sector in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very labour-intensive sector of the economy. It creates many jobs. The Australian Tourist Commission quite rightly gives credit to the Federal Government for the success of recent campaigns. I refer to page 8 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of ATC's success can be attributed to the level of support we now get from the Federal Government and our industry colleagues.

<PARA>There it is. The Commission is sheeting home the success of this recent campaign for increased assistance from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing that this Government will do to the tourism industry is introduce a goods and services tax. We are not going to make Australia a more expensive international destination than it is at the present time. Those opposite are crazy in what they want to do to the tourism industry with a goods and services tax. People sitting in California will look at brochures, look at the opportunity and say, `Do I go to Hawaii? Do I go to Australia?', and they will see that with a goods and services tax the cost of travel to Australia will be increased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1990-91 annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission is important because in the present economic crisis around the world it is vital that Australia does what it can to develop one of the few industries that are still alive under this Government, and that is tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire's comments illustrate the sort of muddled thinking that seems to be going on in the Government about the impact of a GST on the tourism industry. I am glad that Senator Maguire has said on behalf of the Government, and no doubt with deep authority&mdash;the sort of authority that he no doubt deserves from his position in the Government &mdash;that the Government is not going to introduce a GST on the tourism industry. In other words, the Government is going to leave Australia as one of the few nations in the world out of step with what happens throughout the developed nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire's claim that it would massively disadvantage tourists if a GST were to be introduced is just clear, self-evident bunkum. He knows that this Government has a very substantial sales tax on the inputs into the tourism industry. Maybe the good senator has not become aware of that&mdash;has not come in contact with it&mdash;but he must surely know that there is a 20 per cent sales tax on every sheet of toilet paper that is used in every tourist hotel in Australia. Apparently this Government regards that as a luxury; so it puts a 20 per cent sales tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the Government hypocritically saying that it is somehow offensive to put a 15 per cent GST on accommodation, when at the same time the Opposition would totally remove the sales tax on all the inputs into the tourism industry. We would remove the payroll tax, which is one of the crippling elements of costs&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a State Government tax, and we will withdraw it, and Senator Maguire knows that. We have a clear situation where we would be significantly reducing the costs of the tourism industry. For example, we would reduce the cost of freight by widening the excise on fuel. Think of the stimulus to internal tourism that that would generate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We keep hearing absolute nonsense from people like Senator Maguire. The Senate will note that he said that because of the GST which will come in&mdash;and I am glad to notice the way that everyone, especially on the Government side, takes it for granted that the GST will come in because we will be elected&mdash;Australians will choose overseas destinations because it will be relatively cheaper to go there. The fact is that whenever Australians go to a European destination they end up paying VAT on their hotel rooms and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the Government, soon to be the Opposition, that it has no position on this and is in total disarray. As has just been announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), he will stay on and fight the next election, and his decision has been endorsed by the six senior Ministers here. It means that we are going to have policy paralysis until heaven knows when, as this Government fails to do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any threat to the tourism industry, it is the threat of a government which is going nowhere, doing nothing and has no policies, and no capacity to reduce our massive unemployment. I stress to those opposite that it will be a disaster for local tourism if these 10 per cent unemployment rates persist, because Australians will not be able to afford internal tourism, let alone overseas tourism. That is the basic threat to the hospitality industry in Australia, whereas when the Opposition becomes the Government the coalition's Fightback package will be a massive stimulus to the Australian tourism industry, particularly local tourism. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Job growth has continued. This time last year there were 561,000 jobs in the tourism industry and now there are 605,000. That is an example of dramatic job growth. In the past year under a Labor Government, 45,000 jobs have been created in the tourism industry. What do we get from those opposite? We do not get a word of thanks; all we get is negative criticism.

New Zealand is an interesting example because tourism arrivals there have declined by 2,000 in the past year. Why? The economy has collapsed because of a goods and services tax and the implementation of policies that those opposite want to implement. Those policies have flattened the New Zealand economy and that is startling evidence of what those opposite would do to this economy if they ever got into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We increased funding to the Australian Tourist Commission in the past year from $56m to $62m. The Tourist Commission is a good example of what a positive increase in government funding can do. The industry should be congratulated. The industry itself has increased its contribution from $11m per annum to $13m per annum. Even in the area of other income, the Tourist Commission has done an excellent job. Its revenue rose from $3.8m to $5.5m because it had the foresight to ensure that the money that it brought in from overseas increased in value due to changes in the fluctuation of the dollar. So the ATC should be congratulated for what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has shown vision for the future. The television campaign by Greg Norman was actively pursued and promoted by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, David Simmons. That is another great example of what this Government has done in tourism. I am pleased to see in the report that the Tourist Commission is looking at eco-tourism. That is one of the greatest areas of improved visitation in the world. One of the few things I will agree on with Senator Calvert is that it is good to see that John Haddad has been reappointed to the position of Director of the Tourist Commission. He did a great job for tourism in Tasmania and under this Government he will continue to do a great job for Australia. </PARA>

We could probably double or triple the number of tourists who come to Australia and thereby create the sort of job growth that the Hewson Fightback package looks at. An important point that should be made is that there are a number of disincentives to growth in this industry, and the area of industrial relations is one of them.

It is clearly stupid for someone working at the Mirage in Port Douglas to be told by someone in Collins Street in Melbourne how much they should be paid per hour, as it is for someone working in Caves House in Margaret River&mdash;a place that I am sure the Minister for Industrial Relations is familiar with. We need a decentralised wage system and the tourism industry is a particular example where that can apply. The work structures of those who are employed in the industry need to be more flexible. We need more multiskilling, to use the Minister's term, but more flexibility, to use my term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is to be congratulated and the Australian Tourist Commission should also be congratulated. We should be going a lot further. It is wrong to criticise the effects of the GST on the industry. The tourism industry supports our package. There is a lot more in the package than Senator Sherry would have others believe. When people living in the United States of America make a choice as to whether to travel to European destinations, to Australia or to Japan, they will note that in just about every OECD country to which they may choose to travel there is a similar form of value added or goods and services tax. So, of course, Australia is putting itself in the same league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the removal of fuel excise, I heard Senator Sowada interjecting earlier about the tax on jet fuel. Of course, there is no such tax. The fact is that domestic tourism is a very important part of our market. One hell of a lot of mums and dads, middle Australians and lower income Australians are big users of fuel. Under the Opposition's policies, the cost of their travel and their holidays will be reduced. The other point that Senator Sherry should realise is that the cost for someone travelling from the mainland to Tasmania on either the Sea Cat or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Abel Tasman</EMPHASIS> will be reduced by between $10 and $20 per head, which will help his own State. So before he criticises our policies, he should look at them very closely. I will give his side of the chamber credit where it is due.

<PARA>Qantas has been through a very difficult year and faces another period of difficulty. However, I think with a very dedicated board and with enthusiasm there is a prospect that its long term problems may well be overcome; but it will take a great deal of effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems can clearly be seen from the table at the beginning of the report which shows that although Qantas flew an extra 10 per cent of kilometres, increasing from 118.7 million to 130.7 million, the number of passengers carried fell by 2.1 per cent; so it worked harder to receive less. Its revenue seat factor fell from 69.1 per cent to 66 per cent, and the revenue load factor fell from 66.7 per cent to 65.2 per cent. This clearly was a year that was interrupted by problems in the Middle East and, as the Australian Tourism Commission report shows, passenger traffic from Europe was seriously interrupted. </PARA>

<PARA>Landcare is a non-profit company which was established in 1989 as one of the spin-offs of the decade of land care and the billion trees program. The company was established with a number of objectives. Amongst those was included the following: to develop a land care ethic amongst all Australians; to encourage and stimulate public awareness of the importance of land care and the adoption of land care principles; to encourage and stimulate public participation in land care activities; and to encourage and facilitate education on land care principles in schools and the community generally. </PARA>

<PARA>The report describes the operations of the Committee during the 1990-91 year. During this year the Committee was particularly active, scrutinising some 1,645 pieces of delegated legislation, which is a greater number than in any previous year. I think I can say that the Committee is carrying out its charter from the Senate to ensure that delegated legislation, made by the Executive under the authority of Acts, is of the highest quality. In this context the Acting Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Norman Reaburn, mentioned the work of the Committee when he opened a public seminar on delegated legislation earlier this year. He said that the Committee `was vital to maintaining the integrity of the law of this country'. Although we on the Committee take ourselves very seriously, and our tasks also, we would be too modest to make this claim on our own behalf. Nevertheless, it is very pleasing when the Committee receives such recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that during the year Ministers and other law makers gave undertakings to amend or review no fewer than 54 different instruments or parent Acts to meet the concerns of the Committee. These undertakings are separate from the many other less significant but still important undertakings to improve explanatory statements, provide numbering and citation for instruments, or take administrative action. This represents a high level of commitment by Ministers to the non-partisan parliamentary ideals of personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take just one example, the most important umbrella Act dealing with delegated legislation is the Acts Interpretation Act. The Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, undertook to amend that Act to meet our concerns immediately after the Committee raised a particular matter. That is the kind of cooperation the Committee receives from Ministers. This amendment will have an important effect upon regulations made under all Acts. </PARA>

The ARC is the statutory body responsible for providing advice to the Government on review of administrative decisions. There has already been an interim report on the project and we understand that the final report will go to the Minister this month. That interim report accepted the major recommendations put by the Committee. If these recommendations of the Committee are accepted and implemented it will be the most important reform affecting delegated legislation since the Acts Interpretation Act itself was passed in the first year of Federation. The Committee will report in detail to the Senate after we receive the final thoughts of the Administrative Review Council. I commend the Committee's report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Tindal Speech)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report which I have presented relates to the third stage of the development of RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stages 1 and 2 of the development were the subject of previous reports by the Committee in 1984 and 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of RAAF Base Tindal over the past seven years represents one of the largest and most expensive defence infrastructure developments in Australia's history. What in 1984 was a bare base, located in a remote area with a harsh climate, has been transformed into a modern air force base. It was obvious to the Committee during the inspection of the base that RAAF personnel are proud of what has been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stage 3 will involve the provision of air defence facilities, living-in accommodation, deployed squadron operational and technical facilities, aircraft pavements, aircraft shelters and associated engineering services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposed work is 53.5 million dollars at April 1991 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the works comprising Stage 3 should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Facilities for use by aircraft deployed to Tindal are required because existing operational and support facilities, which were essentially provided for No. 75 Squadron, are inadequate. The Committee therefore concluded that if it is intended to continue the deployment of fighter and strike aircraft to Tindal, adequate facilities must be provided for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, additional aircraft pavements are required to realise the full potential of the master-planned `coathanger' runway and taxiway configuration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also concluded that now is a good time for the relocation of No 2 Control and Reporting Unit from Darwin to Tindal. Facilities in Darwin are inadequate to house replacement equipment which it is proposed to acquire. There would be strategic and operational advantages as well as financial benefits if the unit were located at Tindal and for the relocation to coincide with the delivery of replacement equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would like to mention two matters which generated some local interest at the Committee's public hearing into the proposal. A number of witnesses suggested the scope of Stage 3 development should be extended by the inclusion of a bicycle track from Katherine to Tindal. Some RAAF personnel cycle along the Stuart Highway, a practice which is potentially dangerous because of the heavy traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that a bike track could be constructed linking East Katherine with Tindal, with the Northern Territory Government and Katherine Town Council meeting the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second matter concerns the need for an independent analysis of the drainage pattern of the Tindal-Katherine area. The Katherine Town Council submitted to the Committee that unusually heavy flooding of the eastern side of Katherine had occurred during the 1990/91 wet season. The Council believes this flooding may be the result of the development of Tindal. The Committee has recommended that an independent analysis of the drainage pattern of the Tindal-Katherine area should be undertaken to identify factors contributing to flooding and to recommend realistic measures to minimise it. The analysis should be funded by Territory Government and Katherine Town Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Parkville Speech)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report I have tabled relates to the redevelopment of CSIRO facilities at Parkville, Victoria. CSIRO is proposing to redevelop its Parkville site as a major research complex and to provide the headquarters for the Division of Biomolecular Engineering. The redevelopment will provide facilities for 140 staff and work will be undertaken in three stages so that the site remains operational at all times. The Committee has recommended that the work proceed at a cost of 12.25 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1990, the mission of the Division of Biomolecular Engineering was changed to concentrate on assisting the development of the Australian pharmaceutical and health care industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in direction away from wool technology and agricultural protein research will have a major impact on the nature of laboratory accommodation required by the Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO advised the Committee that the existing laboratories require urgent upgrading to provide facilities suitable for sophisticated computer-based instrumentation and micro-analytical techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued occupation by the CSIRO of the site at 343 Royal Parade, Parkville was strongly opposed by the Parkville Association. The Association fundamentally believes that the location in North Parkville of such a facility is inappropriate, because North Parkville is an area which the Association regards as being predominantly residential and having high environmental sensitivity. The view of the Parkville Association was supported by the Melbourne City Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee appreciates the wish of the Parkville Association and the Melbourne City Council to retain the predominantly residential nature of Parkville, the fact is that CSIRO has been established on the Parkville site in accordance with local planning regulations since 1952.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts the view of CSIRO, which was supported by other research institutions, that the Parkville location of the Division of Biomolecular Engineering is vital to its research program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending that the works proceed the Committee has recommended that CSIRO should provide it with a comprehensive report detailing the energy management systems and energy conservation measures to be incorporated in the Parkville development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern was expressed at the public hearing by the Commonwealth Fire Board and the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade regarding the effects of the `immunity of the Crown' from state building regulations particularly in relation to fire safety. The Committee is still considering the wider implication of this issue and will report to the Parliament shortly. However at this stage the Committee has recommended that consultation with local fire authorities should be undertaken prior to the referral of all projects to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(REVY Speech)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third report relates to the relocation of the Naval Support Command Headquarters from the Remington Centre in the Sydney CBD to two former Naval warehouses at the Royal Edward Victualling Yard at Pyrmont. The proposal is to refurbish the historic warehouses to provide office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed at an estimated cost of 13.4 million dollars at April 1991 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that accommodation occupied by the Support Command in the City is inadequate and very costly at an annual rental of 4.7 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed relocation and refurbishment appeared to the Committee to be the best option examined in terms of capital cost and recurrent expenditure. Indeed, the Committee concluded that the refurbishment offers the Commonwealth the opportunity to capitalise on an existing asset and at the same time provide the Support Command with accommodation in an area with a maritime flavour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two buildings to be refurbished are listed on the Register of the National Estate. The Committee concluded that provided the recommendations of the conservation and management plan and of the Australian Heritage Commission are adhered to, the refurbished buildings will maintain an important part of Sydney's maritime heritage as well as providing modern office accommodation for the personnel of the Support Command Headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also concluded that the proposal represents an ideal opportunity for the inclusion of a state of the art building services system designed to exceed current energy targets, and for the provision of a building services monitoring system, capable of sensing and rectifying air quality as well as temperatures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal is the first occasion in which the Department of Defence has not used Australian Construction Services as its design and construction authority. Instead, Defence will call tenders for a number of contractors to design, execute and supervise construction. Given this change, the Committee has recommended that it be provided with six-monthly reports on the achievement of major milestones in the design and construction of the proposal and the level of expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(SBS Speech)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last of the four reports that I am tabling today relates to the relocation of SBS Radio and Television to premises in Artarmon, New South Wales. The SBS plans to relocate radio station 2EA at Bondi Junction and SBS television at Milsons Point to an existing building in Artarmon. The proposal that the SBS put to the Public Works Committee was for the renovation of an office/warehouse complex for the SBS's use, at a cost of 14.5 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the SBS to have new premises. Its present premises are too small for its requirements and its television service is constrained by the grossly inadequate studio space available to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SBS carried out an extensive search for new premises before choosing the Artarmon site. It found that a new, purpose-built building was beyond its means and opted to adapt an existing building to its requirements. The building in Artarmon will provide the SBS with the space that it needs and, most importantly, with the scope to adapt part of the warehouse in the complex as studios to industry standards. This will allow the SBS, for the first time since it was established in 1978, to extend its television current affairs coverage to panel discussions with more than three participants and with the possibility of having an audience. It will also provide the SBS with the means of making its own productions. With these facilities, the SBS will be better placed than it is at present to serve Australia's multicultural community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some concern was expressed to the Committee about the choice of Artarmon as the location for the SBS's new premises. On balance, however, the Committee believes that the location is a suitable one. It is a cheaper location than the CBD, it is near other television stations and associated services, public transport makes it readily accessible for staff and contributors, and it will prove to be an asset. Furthermore, the building is larger than the SBS needs. The SBS plans to lease out the excess space and use the revenue gained to help finance local productions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Works Committee is recommending that Commonwealth funds be spent on the refurbishment of the office/warehouse complex at 14 Herbert Street, Artarmon to provide accommodation for the SBS's radio, television and corporate services. In making this recommendation, the Committee was concerned about the very tight time frame for the refurbishment and the use of fast track methods of construction. We know that fast track construction tends to be more expensive than normal methods and, if the tight time frame for the project slips, the SBS will encounter additional  costs. Because of these concerns, the Committee has recommended that the SBS report to it every three months on how well the project is keeping to its program and its budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally I will mention that the Committee also made recommendations about energy conservation, parking and transport for shift workers and the provision of child care. In addition, the Committee urges the SBS to undertake more comprehensive consultation with the unions than it has hitherto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend these reports to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee has decided to bring down an interim report at this time because of its concern about the continued availability of unsuitable material on Telecom's 0055 telephone message services. Telecom has requested that the Committee give it some indication of its attitude to the issue of content regulation before the end of 1991, because of the need to regularise its contractual relationship with the information service providers. Therefore, the Committee has indicated to Telecom that it will comply with this request, and is now bringing down an interim report specifically in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was established on 21 June 1991 as a result of concerns expressed by a number of honourable senators about the absence from the Telecommunications Bill 1991, agreed to by the Senate on 17 June 1991, of any provision to regulate the content of telecommunications services. Furthermore, there was considerable disquiet in the community about the content of material carried by Telecom using its 0055 and Discovery services, particularly as to the suitability of the material being transmitted to the family home where it could be accessed by minors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has received 2,242 submissions, many of them signed by or representing more than a single individual. In addition, around 700 form letters, and 40 petitions&mdash;signed by a total of 7,085 petitioners&mdash;have been received. The Committee has conducted three full days of public hearings in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and held a final hearing of Telecom management in Canberra on 7 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has sought to identify the nature of `adult' material being carried by Telecom on its 0055 commercial recorded message service and the measures undertaken by Telecom to ensure the acceptability of that content having regard to community standards for equivalent material available through other media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises Telecom's genuine efforts to respond to community concerns by establishing the Telephone Information Services Standards Committee&mdash;TISSC&mdash;incorporating the TISSC codes of practice into its agreements with the service providers, and appointing a telephone information services arbitrator to adjudicate on telephone messages in the light of the codes of practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Committee is not satisfied with Telecom's response to Federal Government concerns, and, indeed, to the concerns of the Committee. The Committee notes that the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the Hon. Kim Beazley, wrote to Telecom's Chairman in September this year to express his concern to ensure that all `adult' services be removed immediately from 0055. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is also critical of Telecom for its failure to fully respond to the Committee's operations and for having proceeded with certain areas of policy measures which clearly fall within the Committee's terms of reference, while the Committee's inquiry has been still in progress. It is acknowledged that some of these related to long term contractual arrangements, but the Committee was not informed of these in its initial hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim report makes clear the Committee's concern about the adequacy of Telecom's current approach to content regulation and, in fact, commends the approach that Telecom management had originally adopted when the 0055 information service commenced operations in July 1988. The Committee notes that, if Telecom had shown greater concern for the public interest rather than the industry's commercial interest in the early days of the 0055 service, this aspect of the Committee's inquiry would have been unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations contained in the Committee's interim report call on Telecom to adopt a code of conduct which would completely eliminate the carriage of unacceptable sexual material on 0055 where it is accessible by minors. This is in line with former Minister Beazley's request and is the unanimous view of this bipartisan Committee. The industry would then be allowed to cater for this market only through its 0051 closed user access service, restricted to adults who must opt in to the system, but only for material of an equivalence to the M film-video rating. The Committee has recommended that Telecom ensure compliance with this code of conduct by utilising the services of the Office of Film and Literature Classification as the expert and independent arbiter of community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has rejected Telecom's approach to the problem, essentially because it is clearly not working. While a new code of practice, introduced on 22 October 1991, was designed to address the problem of `adult' material being accessible to minors on 0055, advertisements continue to appear in the daily press for such 0055 services. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> as recently as 7 December, some of these services are still being advertised; for example, `Gay Affairs', `My First Time', `What Gays Do' and `Inch By Inch'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendations will work to resolve this issue where Telecom's measures have failed. The principal recommendation of the Committee as to message standard reflects the fact that the submissions and evidence were almost exclusively concerned with sex content of messages on open access 0055 services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's response includes a direct restatement in its recommendation 1(a) of standard 1.1(a) of Telecom's own operational requirements&mdash;issue No. 3 of 31 January 1990 &mdash;contained in an attachment to the 0055 service provider agreement. The operational requirements referred to above contain other standards or codes of conduct relating to content and advertising which deserve to be retained in any new contract or agreement between Telecom and service providers. The Committee did not find it necessary to canvass these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its continuing inquiries next year, the Committee will monitor Telecom's implementation of these recommendations. It will also examine in detail the carriage of adult material on the Discovery service by Genesis Telecommunications Pty Ltd. The Government's announcement of its approval of pay TV on 9 October 1991 and the release of the exposure draft of the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992 on 7 November 1991, by which pay TV services will be regulated, will also be the subject of close attention by the Committee in its continuing inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the secretariat for its energy and commitment in handling large volumes of correspondence and in giving consistent support to the Committee.

<PARA>Yesterday I gave notice of this motion that calls upon the Senate to note the growing concern in the community over the Federal Government's handling of the management of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. The motion also calls on the parliamentary representatives on the ANU Council to support the recision motion before tomorrow's meeting of that Council. Further, it calls on the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) to take no further action with respect to the administrative arrangements of the JCSMR until the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has handed down its report on the matter on 1 April 1992. It is this motion which the Government opposes and I am compelled to speak today in order to try to head off this blatant abuse of power by the Minister and to stop his hidden agenda of intervention in the affairs of universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National University has effectively been blackmailed into abdicating its responsibilities for the John Curtin School of Medical Research to the National Health and Medical Research Council. This action was taken by the ANU Council under duress. In holding the purse strings, Mr Baldwin has attempted to circumvent the will of the Parliament, breach the autonomy of the university and emasculate the authority of the ANU Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANU is established by an Act of Parliament which specifies that there will be a research school in the field of medical science and that it is to be known as the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It also states that the ANU Council should have the entire control and management of the university. It would seem, therefore, pretty much cut and dried that it would be impossible to separate the two bodies. To do so would certainly be against the spirit of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council is, however, able to delegate powers. It will, under the Baldwin plan, hand over responsibility for the John Curtin School to a committee that will be controlled by the NHMRC, with token university representation. Under this arrangement the ANU gives away as much control as it can under the law. The effectiveness of these arrangements will be a factor in the disbursement of funds. This means that, if the National Health and Medical Research Council does not get what it wants, it can ask the Minister to cut funding to the school. This only underscores the fact that the ANU will lose control of the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great majority of the Council members were strongly opposed to the loss of this control. Although the NHMRC has a record of good management, they questioned the wisdom of centralising the funding of all Australian medical research. This goes to show that this Government continues to be deaf to the argument that a plurality of views must be cultivated if the country's scientific enterprises are to remain healthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the questions of how funds are to be administered, representation of academic staff and the relationship with the Institute of Advanced Studies have not been addressed. This is a sign of the haphazard and careless approach that the Government has taken in its rush to dominate and centralise the centres of higher learning in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government interference with and intervention in higher education institutions have been both disruptive and destructive. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. Independence of the education system has had to make way for bureaucratic favours while the Government enforces policy with the threat of withholding funds. Now this ruinous policy has gone as far as threatening the John Curtin School of Medical Research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCSMR is first and foremost an academic unit within a university structure. It has never been a freestanding research institute with a top-down management structure driven by a mission oriented research agenda.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCSMR is a world-class biomedical research institute. Its greatest strength is that it nurtures and tolerates long term research on a diverse range of problems.

It is these commercial results that are so often used in comparing the JCSMR with other research institutions such as the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, which is funded by the NHMRC. These comparisons, however, have very limited validity as the research objectives are very different in nature. </PARA>

As I said, because of that, I do not propose to debate any of the substantive issues that are raised in the motion except to say that it is inappropriate in terms of the way in which the Senate examines things simply to say, `Here are our views as a Senate. We will then go and have an inquiry. The inquiry will come back and presumably find that what we have said today is true or not true'. It just seems to me that, if we are going to have an inquiry and if, as a Committee, the Senate gives us a reference, it behoves the Senate in particular to stand aside from the issue and allow us to look at things objectively. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add two other points. It concerns me that this matter has gone so far via Executive Government decisions when the John Curtin School of Medical Research is mentioned as an integral part of the legislation. The Government is attempting to change the whole character of the school and to place it, in effect, under the control of an outside organisation&mdash;namely, the National Health and Medical Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1951 report of the interim Council of the ANU says that, as far back as 1913, Mr Andrew Fisher expressed the hope that Canberra would become the centre of Australia's learning as well as its politics. Fisher made it clear that Canberra must be something more than the seat of government and that a national university ought to be established here. The university itself owes its birth to discussions which took place in 1943 about the possibility of creating in Canberra a national institute of medical research. Mr John Curtin met Sir Howard Florey, the director of the Sir William Dunn Institute of Pathology at Oxford, whilst Sir Howard was visiting Australia in connection with wartime medical services. Mr Curtin sought Sir Howard's advice, and the initial considerations and difficulties were outlined in the interim council's early report. Sir Howard Florey's proposals became a blueprint for the John Curtin School of Medical Research and that then became part and parcel of the Australian National University Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first heard about what was taking place, I did not take much notice because, as a member of parliament, I thought the Government would have to come to this place if it was going to alter substantially the workings of the John Curtin School and its relationship with the Australian National University Council. In effect, that is what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there has been some disagreement between the ANU Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council over who would undertake certain tasks which the Government wanted undertaken following the release of the Stephen report. Two or three persons were put up. One person, nominated by the Australian National University Council, was rejected by the National Health and Medical Research Council. So the debate went back and forth. Eventually, it was decided that the person put forward by the National Health and Medical Research Council would be the one to undertake this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, ultimately, it should be known&mdash;and ultimately it will be stated&mdash;that that person has some explanations to make. I believe people deserve some explanations from that particular appointee, who was the nominee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. One of the most controversial grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council was a very substantial grant of something like $450,000 for what, in effect, was a project which was not in the nature of a medical project&mdash;it was in the nature of a philosophical project. It ended up in the hands of a particular professor and then went to a Monash group. It related to the development of a utilitarian philosophical approach to experimentations on early human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once all of the information comes out, I think it will support the view that institutions separate from the National Medical and Health Research Council should be supported in their scholarly medical research which is competitive, both nationally and internationally. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point is that there is a real danger that our reporting date of 1 April will be too late to reverse the process, because of the current situation where the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has moved so far down the track towards taking control of this element of the Australian National University. Hence, I have moved this motion to give strength to the very strong views of the Australian National University that this action by the Minister must be stopped. </PARA>

I would like to convey to the Senate the strength of feeling there. It was quite obvious that the 500 academic staff were outraged, and unanimous in the view that the Minister must reverse this decision. The main speaker, Sir Mark Oliphant, made the point very clearly that this Minister does not know what he is doing. He does not have any idea of the history of what has happened at the ANU and the fact that the John Curtin School of Medical Research was a foundation school, that it has contributed greatly to research in medicine in this country and that the very integrity of its work will be greatly threatened by this action. </PARA>

That is why this must be stopped. </PARA>

I would have thought that Senator Aulich would have welcomed this move. The inquiry has a chance to achieve the freezing of the arrangements to leave the John Curtin School under the control of the ANU until our Senate Standing Committee brings down its reports.

Senator Collins has referred to that in answer to a question on the matter from one of his team today. I wish to acknowledge that the information I gave yesterday, in all good faith, was incorrect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact was wrong; the principle was correct. Briefly, I would like to indicate that the Government's wholesale sales tax rates are so confused that they are difficult to understand. For example, commercial air-conditioning in Senator Collins's Darwin office would be subject to a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. Commercial refrigeration in any shop in Darwin would be subject to 20 per cent. Sales tax on air-conditioning in Senator Collins's home would be 10 per cent, as he says. If the air-conditioning happens to be ducted, there is a 20 per cent sales tax on the ducting. That is 10 per cent on the unit, and 20 per cent on the ducting. People who happen to have air-conditioners in their motor vehicles&mdash;which in northern Queensland is fairly common because it is very hot at times &mdash;pay sales tax at 20 per cent, and if they own a luxury vehicle they pay 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My principle is that under the Hewson package those taxes will be completely waived. The cost of goods in north Queensland will be cheaper in any case because the costs of manufacturing those air-conditioners and refrigerators will be so much cheaper. All inputs into business will be waived under Dr Hewson's GST. The freight cost of getting goods to northern Australia will be so much cheaper because there will be no 26 cents per litre excise on fuel. There will be none of the wholesale sales taxes on the vehicles that go there. Generally speaking, most of those items will be considerably cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Senate for allowing me to correct those things and acknowledge that the information I gave yesterday was not correct. The sales tax on commercial refrigeration, commercial air-conditioning and home ducting for air- conditioning is 20 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 is yet another example of the Government not being able to get its legislation right. For example, this is the second package of amendments in as many months to the Pipeline Authority Act which is included in this strange grab bag of Bills. In handling this Bill for the Opposition, let me make it plain that the Liberal and National parties, therefore, oppose the Bill as put forward today. In a second reading amendment, jointly with the Australian Democrats, we will require the Bill to be withdrawn and redrafted according to the guidelines laid down in our amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that, once again, sloppy work by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and his Department has imposed an additional workload on the legislative process of this Senate at a time when we are sorely overloaded and under time constraints to finish all the business before the Senate. We should not be having to sit here and waste our time in tidying up the Government's loose ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what concerns us most is the section of the Bill dealing with the amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, and it is to this section which the Opposition and Democrats amendments primarily refer. The Minister, in his second reading speech, said that the amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act are based on the recent review of the Comcare program which had been envisaged when the program was first set up. What the Minister does not say is that he refused to table the report which came out of that review and that he has refused to implement most of the recommendations made in the report. In fact, the Minister does not say very much at all in his speech, which is really quite inexcusable, considering the scope and depth of the review and its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the Government has taken its usual path of commissioning a review of a government enterprise and then trying to ignore most of the recommendations which came out of that review. What reason does the Minister have for not tabling this report?  Does he think that by not doing so he can blithely ignore its recommendations?  Does he think he can avoid responsibility for the interests of the clients of Comcare?  Why did the Minister not give an explanation as to why he has not accepted the recommendations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has admitted that the review targeted additional areas where effectiveness could be enhanced. I would put it more strongly than that. I would say that the review has identified some very serious deficiencies in the operation of Comcare. More importantly, the report made it quite clear that the recommendations are meant to be taken as a whole. On page 35 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The workers compensation environment is complex and sophisticated and the internal balances are sometimes very delicate and not obvious. To take part of this package and not others could in some cases have consequences that would not be in the best long term interests of the Government or the workers who have compensation coverage under Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA>Why has the Minister chosen to ignore this directive? The consultants who conducted the review of Comcare are clearly concerned about its operation. They recommended some fairly extensive changes to the structure of the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees itself, to its staffing arrangements and to its operations. These recommendations were not made lightly. The review panel was headed by Mr Ron Brown, a former secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, who was unceremoniously dumped from that position by this Government and who is now a management consultant. The review panel comprised representatives from three very reputable consulting firms:  Pappas Carter Evans and Koop, Clayton Utz and Coopers and Lybrand. The panel therefore had a great deal of expertise and extensive resources at its command. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet out of the 15 important recommendations made in the report, all but one have been rejected by the Minister. The one recommendation that he has deigned to implement he has changed to such a degree that it greatly weakens its original intention. I will briefly go through the major recommendations of the report because, clearly, the Minister is not going to. It is important that all of us realise to what extent the Minister is neglecting his duty to the Parliament, the Government and the semi-government clientele of Comcare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation, and the only one which the Government has even attempted to implement, is that the Commission should be split into two parts. One is to be a regulatory commission which will oversee the management and regulatory functions under the new Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. The responsibility for the other part, to be known as Comcare, will be as a service arm managing claims and commercial activities. However, that is as far as the Government is prepared to go along with the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review panel recommended that the regulatory and service arms be clearly separated and that the new structure needed an expanded board with wider areas of expertise. It also recommended that Comcare should have its own board as a subset of the Commission with its own chief executive officer. The Minister claimed in his speech that the Bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the separation of the powers and functions of the current Commission between the new Commission and the new body to be known as Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the amendments do nothing of the sort. They ignore the recommendations for a part time chairman, preferably with a financial or insurance background, and for a separate chief executive officer of Comcare, preferably with a marketing background. Instead, the full time chief executive officer of Comcare will continue to chair the Commission as well, thereby negating the report's recommendation that Comcare be accountable to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the amendments ignore the recommendation to have greater commercial employer representation on the board and instead it leaves the Commonwealth representative as the sole employer representative, while adding another representative of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to the board. Where the report explicitly recommended that the board consists of nine members, the Government has allowed for only eight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vitally important area that the Minister has chosen to neglect is the matter of some 3,000 people on long term benefits who are suffering very real financial and physical hardship as a result of deficiencies in the transitional arrangements made when the current system took over from the previous Commonwealth employees compensation scheme in July 1989.  The review recommended that a fixed sum, a suggested $50m annually, be made available for each of three years on compassionate grounds on a first come first served basis for those people suffering financial hardship because of those flawed transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recommendation was, in fact, a second best suggestion because the panel knew that its preferred proposals would not be accepted by the Government. The original suggestion would have allowed people the option to have their benefit paid out in a lump sum. Although the immediate costs were large, the long term savings were quite substantial. However, the panel considered that the estimated cost of $718m for a total buy out, or $60m for a limited buy out of 700 entitlements, would be unacceptable. As it turns out, the Government apparently does not like any of the options, because it has not done anything at all to alleviate the problems of those 3,000 people who have now been living with inconvenience and uncertainty for more than three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also expressed concerns about the length of time being taken to process some claims, particularly the more complex ones, which is causing undue hardship to many claimants. It therefore recommended that statutory time limits of 28 days for handling primary decisions and 35 days for review decisions should be put in place. As an added incentive to process reviews quickly and fairly there should also be provision for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal immediately a claim is disputed. This would prevent abuse of the system whereby the length of time taken in the review process can effectively block access to the Appeals Tribunal by claimants. Under the present system, claimants must wait until either Comcare or one of the self-administrators, Telecom or Australia Post, review their claim before they can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other recommendations, which the Minister has ignored altogether, were that the Commission become self-funding, which was one of the principal aims of the original scheme; that the Commission be able to offer more flexible packages to its clients, particularly its semi-corporatised clients who now account for 46 per cent of its clientele and 50 per cent of its premium income&mdash;many of whom indicated they would desert Comcare given the chance; that Comcare should be able to seek business in the private sector; that the continuing uncertainty about who is responsible for compensation for defence military personnel be resolved; that, in order to enable greater flexibility and service delivery, the staff employed by Comcare should not be employed under the Public Service Act; and that service standards in the Australian Capital Territory office of Comcare be addressed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of this legislation is that Comcare should stand on its own feet; that it should be self-funding; and that it should operate on a fully competitive and commercial basis. The coalition supports that thrust because it is compatible with our policies for self-determination and individual effort which form the whole basis of our Fightback reform package. In line with those policies, it is the coalition's belief that both the Commission and Comcare, along with many other government enterprises, should be privatised at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the amendments that this Labor Government has put forward, one has to ask just whose interests the Minister is safeguarding&mdash;the Government's, the Commission's, the ACTU's or all three?

They have been seriously disadvantaged by the transitional arrangements from the previous scheme and are losing out on their entitlements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I had concluded addressing my remarks on behalf of the Liberal and National parties to the Comcare aspects of the legislation, and had pointed out the unsatisfactory nature of the legislation from our point of view, particularly the fact that the Bill does not implement the recommendations of the Brown report into Comcare&mdash;a report resulting from an inquiry set up by the Government itself. Not only does it not implement those recommendations but also there has been no explanation from the Government as to why they have not been implemented. Indeed, the Brown report has not even been tabled in this Parliament. I concluded that one really had to ask whose interest the Minister is safeguarding&mdash;the Government's, the Commission's, the ACTU's, or the interests of all three.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had also commenced some remarks on the amendments contained in part 5 of the Bill to the Navigation Act 1912. According to the Minister, they arise `out of the Government's initiative to increase the number of conventions of the International Labour Organisation ratified by Australia'. Yet, the Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general rule Australia does not ratify a Convention until law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions complies with the requirements of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed here are intended to enable compliance with three maritime conventions of the ILO, which will allow Australia to ratify them. However, in this case not all State and Territory jurisdictions comply with the conventions because although they apply to seagoing ships in Australian waters which engage in interstate trade, which comes under the Federal Navigation Act, they do not apply to ships which only come within State or Territory jurisdiction because they do not trade interstate. The Minister confirmed in his speech that the regulations and orders that would be able to be made under the Navigation Act to give effect to the conventions in respect of all seagoing ships in Australian waters nevertheless will not apply, and again I quote the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where any existing or future law of a State, or of the Northern Territory, gives effect to the Conventions. This will ensure that the Conventions are applied to all sea-going ships in Australian waters, while preserving the jurisdiction of the States and the Northern Territory in respect of the matters covered by the Conventions.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears to me that there is a note of inconsistency here. On the one hand the Government has insisted in the past that Australia will not ratify conventions unless, as the Minister said, law and practice at all levels of government comply with them. On the other hand, here we have the Government trying to push through prematurely compliance with three maritime conventions to enable their ratification, even though not all State and Territory jurisdictions comply with those conventions. This has more to do with the Labor Party and its union mates trying to shore up its power and influence in the International Labour Organisation in order to use its backing for instigating resistance to the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties than it has to do with any altruistic feelings towards the machinations of the ILO. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 seeks to amend six Acts: the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, the Navigation Act 1912, the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I wish to question the sense of lumping together what are essentially so many disparate items. Part 2 of the Bill deals with amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, which arise out of a review of the operation of the Acts. I will return to that review shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act, in part 3 of the Bill, relate to chemicals. The amendments to the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act, in part 4 or the Bill, relate to long service leave payments. Part 5 contains amendments to the Navigation Act to regulations concerning medical examinations and accommodation for ships crews and part 6 deals with amendments to the Pipeline Authority Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have no quarrel with the last four parts of the Bill, although some of us might wonder at the Senate's collective competence as a House of review when the amendments in part 6 of the Bill are necessary to correct mistakes in a Bill which we passed earlier this year. That is a matter which has been raised before. If the Senate is to be a House of review, why is it that, six months later, we seem to be reviewing what we have already reviewed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not oppose the amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act. However, we have discovered that, although the amendment is seen as a sensible move, there really is a hornet's nest of unsatisfactory practices in the area of industrial chemicals. I give notice that the Democrats will be looking at the current arrangements concerning registration and data collection. The Democrats see no reason to oppose the proposed amendments which represent the Government's reorganisation of that situation at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of the Bill is another matter; and it ought to be the subject of a separate Bill. In 1988 the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill was introduced to replace the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and to bring in a new scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for Commonwealth employees who were injured at work. The new scheme was to provide more generous benefits for injured employees with a much heavier emphasis on rehabilitation. It was the Government's view that costs of compensation claims had increased too much under the previous Act and that they had to be contained. The way to do this was to adopt a new system which focused on preventing injury, encouraging rehabilitation and providing compensation. This led to the establishment of the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth employees&mdash;the Comcare Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, to its credit, made provision for a review of the Commission's operation after two years. The findings of that review, which has been conducted, are contained in the Brown report. Some of the recommendations of that review have been picked up by the Government&mdash;notably, the proposal to separate the regulatory and service functions currently performed by Comcare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the establishment of a new commission to undertake the regulatory functions and a new body named Comcare to carry the commercial and service functions. By and large, the Democrats will be happy to support that proposal, particularly if the regulatory functions of the commission were considerably enhanced. However, we are by no means convinced that this will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1988 legislation made another important change to the provision of compensation arrangements. Section 101 of the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act enables the Minister to declare a Commonwealth authority to be an administering authority. That enabled selected statutory authorities to administer the scheme themselves&mdash;in other words, in parallel with Comcare. This is precisely where the Democrats have parted company with the Government's present intentions. We are parting company not just in terms of the way this system has worked or has been made to work, or because of the refusal of the Government to enable correction of the abuses which have been and are occurring but, more importantly, because of the future provision of adequate and just compensation for Commonwealth employees. It is our belief that under the misguided deregulatory and market driven imperatives that now so dominate this Government&mdash;making it only a very pale shadow of its past&mdash;continued compensation that is just and equitable will inevitably be regarded as a luxury of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry headed by Mr Brown reports considerable disquiet about the system of self-administrators. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been significant problems with the management of claims by the two self-administrators. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current self-administration arrangements should be ended and replaced with two classes of licences&mdash;for self-insurance and inhouse claims administration&mdash;both subject to an annual fee. Both should be subject to strict entry thresholds and reporting requirements, and should be required to be renewed after 5 and 2 years respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission to the Brown inquiry from the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union and the ATEA/ATPOA is equally blunt. I quote from that submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of the CERC Act, the performance of both the Self-Administrators had not been good. Therefore. . . unless fundamental changes are made to the provision of compensation and rehabilitation in Telecom and Australia Post. . . then self-administration then should be denied to both employers.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If self-administration is taken from Telecom and Australia Post, it is our view that the administration of compensation and rehabilitation should be performed by Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA>In Western Australia an action group within what is known as the Injured Persons Action and Support Association of Western Australia has taken shape. It is comprised of people actively opposed to the way that Australia Post and Telecom have administered or have been allowed to administer the CERC Act in respect of their employees. In the very short time that we have been dealing with this Bill in my office we have been deluged with a truckload of material basically suggesting that, while the intentions of the Act may be commendable, those two self-administering authorities have, in effect, misused and in some cases abused the Act to embark on massive cost cutting exercises at the expense of dozens of injured persons who were employees of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the material we have received, I have been told, says that the rehabilitation and claims management sections of Australia Post in Western Australia received an award for achieving what was called `considerable financial savings' in compensation expenditure. Inquiries that I have made do not enable me to tell you here tonight, Madam Acting Deputy President, whether those savings were from excellent results in rehabilitating people or from a successful strategy of reducing the number of claimants. We will be pursuing that matter because I think it is important to make that distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A moment ago I made reference to the way in which the Act has been allowed to be administered. I invite the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) to take up that point when he addresses this Bill because, despite the Act requiring the Commission to keep a watchful eye over self-administrators to ensure that they are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Commission in the performance of their functions, there seems to be very little evidence of this watchful eye being exercised. Indeed, despite the promise of Mr Howe when introducing the 1988 Bill&mdash;and his promise was that the Commission will be required to report on the operations of self-administrators&mdash;I cannot find evidence that even this superficial requirement has been implemented. Indeed, Mr Brown in his review was moved to point out that `no adequate provision was made for overseeing their performance'. That is not the only complaint. There is a myriad of complaints; so many it is difficult to know where to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An overwhelming number of case studies have invaded my office over the past couple of days. The Brown report itself highlighted some of the problems. We are told that there are significant time delays in handling claims. That is a recurring complaint which concerns the time taken in making decisions at all levels&mdash;at the primary level as well as the review decisions. My colleague Senator Kernot asked a question on this very problem a week or so ago. She asked about the length of time taken for Telecom to reconsider a decision concerning a claim by Mr Edwards. Senator Collins, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A request for reconsideration of the above decision was submitted by Mr Edwards on 13 February 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination . . . was affirmed by Telecom on 28 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>I observe, as everybody would realise, that that is a period of nearly five months. The Minister went on to report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Edwards has unfortunately since died.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have one less complainant. I wonder whether that is why the award for efficiency was given to the Department. Some of those who are now contacting my office are saying that such a tragic story is by no means isolated. I am not suggesting that the decision making process is deliberately being strung out in the hope that claimants will, by one means or another, go away, but I wonder at the reason for such a long process. It does not seem to be justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brown reported on what he euphemistically called `overly enthusiastic use of surveillance' as a tool of management. In this chamber, former Senator Jean Jenkins reported to the Senate over a year ago on several methods of surveillance and harassment used to generate evidence or material that could be used to damage a claimant's credibility, including the planting of eavesdropping devices in claimants' homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a copy of a report of a medical board&mdash;I will come back to the problems of these boards later&mdash;from which I will quote as it brings to light some of the surveillance practices. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board commenced by viewing surveillance film taken of Mr X over a fourteen day period. Mr X was not made aware of the film, but the Board used the information to frame the questions to be posed to him.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that this sort of operation is commonplace. It is a device used to discredit the claims of people seeking compensation. It is pretty obvious that we need guidelines on the type of conduct that is acceptable in these cases. When these boards are allowed to sail off without guidelines, that is the sort of caper they get up to. We need guidelines to be established and monitored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recurring source of complaint concerns the status of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to appeals against decisions made by self-administering authorities. Conflicting advice is coming from the Government concerning this question. In a letter to the honourable member for Canning, Mr Gear, the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Telecom has advised, that although recommendations made by the AAT are not binding, it normally follows the recommendations, provided it is assured that the AAT is fully aware of all available facts and information prior to making a declaration.</PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary proposition that is. The decisions are not binding. Telecom normally treats them as binding, except that where it thinks the AAT was not aware of all the facts, Telecom makes the decision not to follow the recommendations. Nevertheless, Comcare or perhaps the Minister is saying that the decisions of the AAT do not apply to self-administering authorities. Where do we go?  Just what is the status?  What is the basis?  What is the legality of all this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is costs. The intention of the Act was to establish a system that would be affordable, not just to administering authorities. However, the practice of departments and authorities employing expensive, high powered legal representation to defend claims brought before the AAT has obviously imposed a further handicap. Without the availability of some form of legal aid, injured employees are often simply not able to afford matching representation, and they do not bother. That is a pretty old trick, but it seems to work in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vexed area concerns the use of medical review panels or medical review boards. Section 57 of the Act gives power to require examinations by `a legally qualified medical practitioner nominated by the relevant authority'. I notice that that reads exactly: it is `a legally qualified medical practitioner'&mdash;not 50, not even three; just one. This section is being used to set up boards of review. It is not so much the use of boards that is the source of complaint but the way they are apparently being used. They should be either prohibited entirely or set up properly and monitored. Something similar to the boards under the 1971 Act would be suggested so long as the authority is not able to appoint a majority of members having sympathy to one side of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that these boards have been devices by which Australia Post has selected an expert to put its case, to appoint a chairman as well, and then to invite the claimant to also appoint a member. In effect, that means that the claimant's representative, of course, would always be in the minority, with the number of board members. But all these experts sitting around providing expert advice is put across as being fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What nobody seems to be able to explain is why Australia Post has gone down this road when Comcare has not used such a system. It has not been seen as necessary for Comcare to administer the system for itself, but there seems to be an advantage to Australia Post in doing that. It is not to save money. Or is it?  Is it not a case where the operation of the Act by the administering authority is at variance with the way Comcare administers the Act and, therefore, not in accordance with the Act?  I do not know, but it is a nagging question. At the very least, there needs to be established a set of guidelines that I referred to before. We need to know how these boards should be set up and what the recommendations for the methods would be. We need to know whether the claimant might have the right of veto over the chairperson, at least, and whether such guidelines could be monitored by the new commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the purpose of this Act is to set up the framework for a new commission and for the subsequent Acts to operate, then I have a great deal of suspicion at the outset. I am certainly not prepared to endorse the framework that has been described here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another serious problem that occurs with the existing situation is when longstanding determinations are reviewed. In many instances determinations are made to cease compensation payments without the knowledge of the claimant. I do not know how that is defined when the claimant or the person affected is not notified, but the word `equity' comes into it, in my view. I cannot see the equity in that sort of practice, but it appears to be standard practice. It is standard practice to use a variety of techniques to institute reviews without notifying claimants. One of the many examples I have is a letter to<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> a Mrs Clark from Australia Post. In the text of that letter, Australia Post writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 21 April 1989 you have received no additional treatment. Therefore I have determined that Australia Post is no longer liable to pay compensation in respect of incapacity or medical treatment for your claim on and from 22 April 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Clark subsequently appealed. The appeal was disallowed. It is this kind of big brother bureaucratic type of operation that surely the Act was intended to prevent. Instead, we appear to have created a mechanism for despotism, to enable an attitude of cost containment at all costs to develop at the expense of the rights of injured employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as we are concerned, this Bill is simply no way near good enough. It does not properly address the concerns that were raised in the report by Mr Brown, nor the concerns that have been brought to us by a significant number&mdash;and I believe we were looking at only the tip of the iceberg&mdash;of employees and previous employees. If a Bill is to be prepared and brought before this Parliament, then it should at least properly address the priorities that were identified by Mr Brown. This Bill does not. It should be withdrawn and redrafted so as to properly implement the changes identified in the Brown review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told a few minutes ago by the Minister's office that we are all off key, that we do not understand it, that it is all going to be wonderful, and that in the autumn session everything is going to be solved. I am afraid that that advice comes far too late. It comes in the light of the huge amount of information that has been provided to us by the people who have suffered under the present arrangements and who do not see their problems being solved by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the Minister and his office choose to think at this moment, the information that has been provided to us over the last several days, when we have been dealing with it, is not in accord with that and does not show to us that people will be satisfied by what is proposed here. As far as I am concerned, the amendments would go a long way towards achieving that; that is why the Australian Democrats believe very strongly that the only way to deal with the legislation is to take it away, get it right and bring it back when it is right. For that reason, we support the amendment that we are moving jointly with the Opposition. </PARA>

It was a Bill that we passed with some reservations, and at the time many honourable senators indicated that they would be keeping a close watch on how it operated.

<PARA>You may remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, that it became general knowledge that this review was being carried out last year, but nothing was heard about it. In April of this year I asked a question of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) as to whether he had initiated a review; what were the terms of reference; who was conducting the review and what were their qualifications; whether the review was advertised so that interested parties could take part and make submissions; whether the Minister would supply a list of the groups and organisations, et cetera, who had been consulted; and what was the reporting date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same day that I asked that question, the Minister made a response and then replied more substantially the following day. In the Minister's initial response he indicated that he had initiated a review of Comcare. In part, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Those terms of reference would spring from a desire by any government to ensure that the scheme operated efficiently, delivered its benefits to the best level to its members and ensured that rehabilitation was given primacy in the concerns of Commonwealth employees who have suffered accidents. . . The terms of reference reflect an inquiry to see whether they can be improved upon.</PARA>
<PARA>The next day, in a more detailed answer, the Minister tabled the terms of reference and referred to the background and the consultation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of client agencies of Comcare Unions, individual compensation claimants, service providers, special interest groups and others with an interest in the scheme's operation have made written submissions to the Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, consultation with people or organisations with an interest in the program was undertaken by way of a stakeholder survey conducted by Pappas, Carter, Evans and Koop, a management consulting firm. This consisted of interviews with selected clients and a wider survey of client attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were meetings with Comcare's employer consultative group (attended by about 50 employer representatives), and with union representatives (unions representing more than 75 per cent of workers covered by Comcare attended this meeting). There was also a seminar for senior government decision makers involved with Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect to receive the final report of the Review by the end of next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not entirely sure when the Minister received the review, but nothing more was heard of it. I inquired about it at the Estimates committee in the Budget session this year. Subsequently, I obtained a copy of the report, which was dated April 1991, consistent with the answer the Minister gave, but it was some time before other people saw it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all that and as a result of the Minister indicating the depth of inquiry which had been undertaken, the report was anticipated with considerable interest, especially by those who have been involved. Madam Acting Deputy President, I remind you particularly of the members of that group who were severely disadvantaged by the changeover from the old scheme to the new scheme, many of whom I still see and know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review's recommendations&mdash;and I shall not read them all&mdash;covered 15 particular points in some detail. Those of us interested in Comcare were pleased to see the recommendations. Many of them reflected the sorts of things that we believe should be included and which appeared obvious from the way the scheme had been operating over the last couple of years. When we heard that the Minister was bringing in a Bill to make amendments, it was with some anticipation that we looked for those amendments to see what was happening to the recommendations of the Brown report. I have quoted the relevant part of the second reading speech which refers to making changes. Only one of the 15 recommendations that have been dealt with in this legislation has been brought before us, and it has not been dealt with properly either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I will not read through all 15 recommendations, but it is worth referring to some of the things that have not been implemented in this legislation. I ask the Minister: why has he not implemented the report? How much did it cost to go to the trouble of employing Mr Brown and that competent committee to review the operation of the Act and how it was affecting people, get 15 recommendations from it, and then come in here with an amendment to the Bill that picks up only one recommendation? The Senate is entitled to an explanation as to why the rest of the recommendations have been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has ignored the recommendation regarding qualifications of the commissioners. It has added another ACTU nominee to the board while continuing to allow the Commonwealth representative to represent employers generally. It has ignored the recommendation to implement a limited redemption scheme for the estimated 3,000 long term compensation cases that have been adversely affected, some severely by the transitional arrangements between the new and the old compensation schemes. I could give examples of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has ignored the recommendation to impose a statutory time period on the processing of claims and reviews and has ignored the recommendation to expand and restructure the Commission to strengthen its expertise in financing and marketing. It has also ignored the recommendation that the Commission should present the Minister within three months with a detailed strategy for addressing the most important service problems identified in submissions to the review and, within six months, with an implementation report. It has ignored the recommendation to rationalise the position of defence military personnel under the Comcare scheme. It has ignored all but one of the recommendations of the Brown review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of asking an independent body to review an organisation and then treat it with such contempt and not even come here and tell us why it has ignored all the other recommendations or even tell us when they will be implemented? Tonight we are spending time on this legislation which is clearly flawed in that the one thing the Government has tried to do has not been done in accordance with the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody would suggest that any report must be fully followed as to every recommendation. We are fully aware that that is not always possible and would not always happen. Most of these are fairly straightforward recommendations that would improve the operation of Comcare, but they have been not been taken up by the Minister. The Minister has not tabled the report in the Parliament. Why has he not done that? He has not bothered to explain why because, if he did, he would have to answer these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has moved an amendment. I shall not read it all out, but it is before the Senate. It states that the Bill be redrafted to include, amongst others, the following recommendations:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the Minister's answer. When one looks through the list of the people whom he says the Brown review went to the trouble to consult, why does he then ignore the review when everyone possible has had the opportunity to contribute, and has contributed?  As a result of that, the Brown review came up with its recommendation and the Minister now says, `Blow you; not interested. I had the review I said I'd have after two years. I don't care what's in it. Put it in the bin; get rid of it', and to heck with Comcare clients who rely on this legislation for the consequences of accidents which they have had at work. There seems to be no concern whatever for their welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect of the legislation which we would like to see implemented. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the words to be added, add the following: "; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)the Senate declares its belief that both the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees and COMCARE should be privatised".</PARA>
<PARA>It would be easy to speak about Comcare matters for the rest of the time I have available to me, but I believe I have made the point that there is a report before the Government which does set out some of the things which need to be done. The Minister comes in here with a second reading speech in which he claims to be implementing the recommendations of the Brown report, which he clearly has not even attempted to do. I urge the Senate to pass the amendment moved by Senator Chapman relating to that implementation, and I urge the Government to set about bringing in a Bill which will enable that to happen&mdash;and to do it as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA>That is being done in this Bill. The argument seems to be that, because at this stage the Government has gone a certain distance with the reforms suggested in the Brown report but has not embraced all of them, the very good reform that has been introduced should be rejected. That is a matter for the Opposition and the Democrats, but it seems to me to be a very interesting approach to legislation&mdash;that even though good legislation has been introduced, it should be thrown out if it does not go as far as the Opposition and the Democrats think it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no criticism of what this legislation does, that is, separate the regulatory and service functions of Comcare.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does. Senator Reid is absolutely correct. The report goes on to make recommendations for improvements which she says, and properly so, ought to be considered. I just want to put those recommendations in context. On page 28 the report says of those recommendations:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be emphasised that these recommendations should be seen in the context of earlier observations in this report, that overall the scheme has been well designed and has been very successful in achieving the stated objectives of the Government in adopting it;  and that there have been significant management achievements in bringing about the changes from the old environment to the current one.</PARA>
<PARA>When we talk about change we have to talk about it in the context in which the author of the report puts it. It does not do anybody any good to read the recommendations of a report on the basis that they have been ignored by the Government, on the basis that the report is somehow greatly critical of the Government, when in fact it is not. In fact, the report is saying that the Government has acted very well in this area but that there are some improvements that could be made to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is hardly consistent with an amendment that is put forward which says that Comcare and any new body that is set up under this legislation should be privatised. Why privatise it when it is running very well as it is?  That sort of suggestion in the amendment raises the question as to whether this report from Mr Brown has been read properly by those on the Opposition benches and by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the report is critical of self-administrators;  that is, principally, Australia Post and Telecom. Certainly that has to be looked at. It seems to me to be taking surgery to the dramatic stage to throw out this Bill on the basis that it does not deal with self-administration. I am sure the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Kerin) will say that he has concern about the way in which Telecom and Australia Post are self-administering this Act. It is another illustration perhaps of where it is very much horses for courses. People who may provide good telecommunications services and good services for Australia Post are not so apt at providing good service in the rehabilitation and in the compensation of people injured in their employ. I have received a lot of criticism of the way in which Telecom and Australia Post have dealt with this Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. That does not seem to me to justify the throwing out of this very good reform that has been introduced this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also said that there should be provision for compassionate early redemption. I do not think that we  should embrace that suggestion from Mr Brown without looking at it very carefully. One of the problems with some of the rehabilitation schemes, with some of the workers compensation schemes, that have been adopted in the past is that lump sum payments are counterproductive to rehabilitation. It seems to me that to go back to the old way of allowing redemptions is quite dangerous. To simply throw out the Act because it does not accept redemption provisions or does not introduce redemption provisions seems to me again to be missing the point and to be taking, may I say, an almost dangerous approach to workers compensation. That should not be the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read something else to indicate just how well this organisation is running. This is from the Brown report which both the Democrats and the Opposition accept. The report, on page 8, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of benefits,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the amount of money going to injured workers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare's are more generous than in any other State except South Australia. This is particularly evident in relation to long term benefits which fall away dramatically after 26 weeks in the New South Wales system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the Opposition, in rejecting this legislation, is not aiming to introduce the scheme that was introduced in New South Wales by the Liberal Government which makes it a very bad scheme for people particularly those who have to stay away from work for more than 26 weeks. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of costs (premiums), Comcare is well below the levels for comparable categories in Victoria, but slightly higher over the same categories than NSW.</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales, of course, does not provide the same level of benefits. Page 15 of the report, under management performance, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the review by Mr Brown which is the review that is relied on by the Opposition and the Democrats to put forward the proposition that the present amendment should be thrown out&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">concluded that the performance of the scheme's management in achieving the financial results set out in the appendix and in streamlining administrative systems to give a better service both to agencies and injured workers has been commendable.</PARA>
<PARA>Then over the page:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the current performance is much better than under the old arrangements, Comcare is not yet meeting all the performance targets it has set for itself; nor, as we shall see in a later section, is it succeeding in meeting all the service expectations of its customers.</PARA>
<PARA>I take it that what it means by `customers' is the departments which Comcare services. The thrust of this report without any shadow of a doubt is that it commends the Comcare scheme and says that it is a good scheme and that there ought to be improvements but does not, in any way, condemn Comcare in round terms. What it does in round terms is to condemn the self-regulators, at least by inference. Because the report has done that it is somewhat ungenerous of those on the other side to throw out an amendment, which is a good amendment in line with the general thrust of the Brown report, simply on the basis that they do not like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell, for whom I have great respect, says that there are all sorts of difficulties with investigations under this scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this point I do not want to reply to all of the debate . What I want to do, and which I now foreshadow, is in a moment seek leave of this chamber to continue my remarks. I am advised that so doing will have the effect of adjourning consideration of this Bill. I would want to do so on the basis that, having listened to the speeches on the second reading, there are some misunderstandings about the Comcare part of this Bill and, dare I say as well, about the part of the Bill that deals with the application of ILO conventions to the Navigation Act and the position of the Northern Territory. That is a secondary consideration, although I do not wish to diminish its importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do think that there are some misunderstandings. The reason why I would seek leave to continue my remarks, and therefore adjourn this Bill, is to have some discussions with the leaders in this debate from both the coalition and the Australian Democrats in the belief that I can assuage some of the concerns that have been expressed. Therefore, this Bill might proceed next Wednesday, when we meet again, in a speedier fashion. I am advised by the worthy office of the Clerk that I should confine my remarks directly to the amendment that is the subject of, at this stage, a paper majority in this chamber, given that it is an amendment sponsored by both the coalition and the Democrats which as a combined group outgun us in numbers. It is to that amendment, and not the amendment related to the privatisation of Comcare which is an amendment sponsored only by the coalition, that I will direct my remarks. If leave is denied, of course, I will reply to the fuller debate in the greater degree of detail that I normally would want to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those notes of explanation, I turn to what I consider to be some of the elements that are misunderstood in what the Government has done, and the significance of some of the provisions in this Bill which are misunderstood by virtue of the attitudes set down in the amendment to the second reading proposed by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. Section (a) of that amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because of the unacceptable attitude of the Minister for Industrial Relations in refusing to table the Brown report on COMCARE and failing to explain why the Government rejected its major recommendations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to a series of points. I just say to the point about refusing to table the Brown report: I regard the Brown report into Comcare as quite a significant report. It is a report that I am on the public record as saying that we wish to implement. I said that by way of a press release on 18 September this year which was headed `Comcare restructure to further improve efficiency'. On page 2 of that press release I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation will be introduced in the budget sittings of Parliament to give effect to these changes.</PARA>
<PARA>The changes, of course, that I was referring to are the ones set out in the Brown report. I see, as I said in my press release, a number of things that need to occur for those changes to be properly implemented and realised. It is in this Bill that I am trying to move forward some of those things that need to occur for those changes to be properly implemented and realised. But if those positional changes cannot occur in this Bill we are not then in a position to move forward on the timetable that I originally envisaged. That does put back considerably, and perhaps for at least six months, the application of those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that in the speeches which have been made in this chamber, and, indeed, in the amendments circulated, a number of complimentary remarks have been made about the Brown review and its findings, the implication is that the parties here would like to see the Brown review implemented. I draw the conclusion that they would not like to see it delayed but in a non-obstructive and helpful way, I should say, the impact of carrying this amendment would be to delay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the first part of the amendment, which says that I have refused to table the Brown report, I say that I have expressed in press release form my commitment to the findings of the report and my commitment to ensuring legislative passage of those findings. One of the reasons the Brown review has not been tabled, and one of the reasons I think this chamber would respect the Government for not doing so, is that the report contained submissions and information given to the inquirer, Ron Brown, by various of the State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This compensation and rehabilitation authority obtained commercial-in-confidence information from various State authorities in order that the review could be properly conducted. Those State authorities wanted the information they made available kept in confidence. It is for the eyes of the Government but it is not for the eyes of commercial competitors, and it was on that basis that the information was given. I, therefore, do not think it appropriate to breach the commercial-in-confidence undertakings by making public the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have done, though, is, along with my press release on 18 September, released for public information an edited version of the report that excludes the commercial-in-confidence material and sets down the recommendations. So on the first charge that I am refusing to table, as if I am holding back from public scrutiny the findings of this report, the defence is clearly that, first, there are commercial-in-confidence matters; secondly, I have announced my position with respect to the report; thirdly, I have released an edited version of it; and, fourthly, the recommendations are available. I think that is, frankly, a perfectly reasonable and responsible course of action for a government to follow in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (b) of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to include the recommendations of the Brown Report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is something that I have just said I am publicly committed to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">especially those concerning:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment lists seven things that the parties opposite and on the interchange bench would want to occur. The first point that I want to make about that&mdash;and, again, this is in my press release&mdash;is that I have said I want to implement these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to now go to some of the matters that have been raised. Paragraph (b) of the amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)provision for compassionate early redemptions;</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a recommendation of the report that I have rejected. It requires, though, in the Budget context, some consideration of the cost and value of those redemptions. They are not small in money terms and they are not something that I as a Minister can commit myself to without involving the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and other Ministers who are responsible for Government outlays. So on that ground, I am caught within what are the normal strictures of government, whichever party is in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b) continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)setting reasonable time limits for determinations, reconsiderations and reviews;</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is a very important point. I am glad it has been raised and I acknowledge its significance. I should point out that 80 per cent of all of the claims that have been lodged with Comcare are turned around, replied to and settled within 10 days; and 90 per cent of that 80 per cent are settled within two days. Item (ii) of the amendment was not a recommendation of the Brown report. Nonetheless, it is a matter of concern to Comcare. Comcare is now involved in drafting some performance criteria to ensure that it is even more efficient. I think I can demonstrate that quite clearly to the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b)(iii) of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision to the Minister by the new Commission, within a reasonable time, of a detailed strategy for addressing the most important service problems identified in the Brown Review and an implementation report to overcome them;</PARA>
<PARA>That, too, is an important matter but until this Bill is carried we will not be in a position to implement that provision because we need to set up the new Commission, which is the first step towards the necessary overseeing of the implementation of the other recommendations. I say that for this reason: I, as a Minister, could proceed by ministerial fiat but it is much sounder in terms of Government consideration to appoint the Commission that will be dealing with these matters and, with that body, draw up the detailed strategy for addressing the service problems because it will have the responsibility of directing the administration of Comcare, and it is important that it own part of the responsibility for the standards implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while it is true that perhaps I could impose by ministerial fiat, it is my more sober judgment that I should appoint that Commission as a first step and work with it to draw up the implementation of those proposals. That is not a matter that will be greatly delayed, either, because Comcare now is developing a service plan which could go to the new Commission when it is set up. It has already had discussions about the service plan with the inquirer, in this case Mr Brown, and with 30-odd of the major client agencies who are concerned about the strategy for addressing those service problems. So we are not talking about a delay here; matters of administrative detail are being attended to promptly. But as a first step we do need the Commission in place for this to work effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b)(iv), concerning licensing arrangements for self-administrators, has attracted a fair bit of debate in this chamber. We agree to this recommendation but again I want the new Commission to be in place to advise me on it. On the basis of its advice, and after working to settle the terms of the licensing arrangements&mdash;that is also related to subparagraph (vii), having self-administrators' disputed claims reviewed by Comcare&mdash;that is something that we would wish to pick up in the licensing arrangements, but I think it will be picked up in association with the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b)(v) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the appointment of a part-time Chairman of the Commission who is not the Chief Executive Officer of COMCARE;</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed sections 89E and 89G indicate that we are proposing to appoint the Commission and we are proposing to appoint the Chairman. I think Senator Chapman suggested there would be eight members; there would be nine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b)(vi) of the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing disputed claims to be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal before they are reviewed. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is an important matter as well, and it does deserve some consideration. Comcare itself has found that it is cheaper and more effective to conduct the review first, before going to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Clients who have gone through that process get a speedier turnaround and are happier about the outcome. The outcomes are often better. If, then, the matter still is contestable, if it has not been settled, the right to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is preserved. As a first step, it seems a reasonable thing to do in all the circumstances. </PARA>

I say in a non-contentious way, simply to inform the chamber, that there are some reasonable and weighty considerations as to why, in a more raucous debate or a more argumentative setting, some of the arguments intrinsic to the amendments could be attacked. I do not wish to engage in that sort of politics here on this Bill now, but it is reasonable that there be some acknowledgment that prima facie the case I have made is worthy of some consideration and when I do seek leave that leave be granted. We can conduct further discussion and next Wednesday, if the Opposition parties are still of a mind to, they can proceed with their amendment or, if their attitude has changed, we can speedily deal with the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major purpose of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is to implement decisions in the area of aged care announced by the Government in the 1991-92 Budget. The other purpose of this Bill is to make amends for errors and oversights in earlier legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that too often we spend time in this chamber, especially towards the end of a session, patching up mistakes which have been made in legislation from a previous session or earlier in the session which really has not been thought through sufficiently at the time and which, with hindsight, could have been done much better. I suppose that happens because we have rushes, as we did this morning. Instead of introducing the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill into the House of Representatives, as it should have been, to circumvent the time constraints on that House it was introduced here in the Senate. Of course, that means that we have less time to concentrate on the legislation and it is more likely that unintended consequences will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the provisions in this Bill, amending an oversight which occurred earlier, will allow a physiotherapist to refer for certain R-type X-rays. When the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Bill 1990 was passed, it allowed for chiropractors to refer for certain X-rays but the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services had forgotten that physiotherapists, in their normal course of diagnosis, refer for X-rays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Department often forgets about the allied health professions. So does the Department of Social Security. For example, when we were doing the review table for disabilities, I asked which experts had been consulted. Senator Richardson told me that many throughout Australia had been. I discovered that two rehabilitation doctors had been consulted and no-one had thought to consult physiotherapists or occupational therapists, many of whom have expertise in the area of functional assessment. They had been omitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that the Department and the people in Canberra began to look a bit further than the medical model and look towards the allied health professions. In the dining room tonight Senator Zakharov told me that when the new senator for Western Australia arrives&mdash;Mr Deputy President, you will be interested in this, being one of them&mdash;there will be five psychologists in the Parliament. Hopefully, we can draw the attention of the bureaucrats not only to the work that our profession does but also to the work of other allied health professionals and the contribution they can make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, physiotherapists were forgotten in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. Since 1 May, physiotherapists have been restricted in their ability to order <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>X-rays. A GP's referral is needed for R-type X-rays for which a Medicare benefit is payable. Having taught a couple of thousand physiotherapists in the 13 years I was at the Lincoln Institute, they realised that they had someone who knew something about physiotherapy and, as I have said previously in this chamber, they beat a pathway to my door. I have had more letters from physiotherapists than almost any other profession on an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, physiotherapists have been responsible for ordering such X-rays for their patients. Statistics gathered by the Australian Physiotherapy Association showed that a majority of physiotherapists in private practice use X-rays as an integral part of diagnosis and patient care. It might be of interest to the chamber to know that one of my former students and a couple of other physiotherapists undertook a survey of young female students in one of the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. As a community service, they were not paid for this, they surveyed every sixth grade child&mdash;I stand to be corrected; it might have been first-year females&mdash;and detected, by way of X-rays, that a large number of girls had the beginning of scoliosis and referred them for treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These physiotherapists were able to involve themselves in a fairly extensive public health exercise as a service to their local community, free of charge, at their own expense. One of them came to me as he was concerned that he would not be able to carry out such an exercise if he was not permitted to undertake these X-rays. That is another example. It is not just in their day-to-day profession; it is in exercising a community service and a public health service that they were concerned about the omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following points indicate why the legislation should be amended. I have outlined one of them. Physiotherapists are primary contact health practitioners who have undertaken a high degree of educational training which has provided them with specialised skills in diagnosis and assessment. As I have mentioned, X-rays are an integral part of diagnosis and patient care. Under the current arrangements, patients who require X-rays will be forced to make additional visits to a medical practitioner for referral and obtain a radiologist's report. This would ultimately lead to increased Medicare costs. Physiotherapy patients have been required to make additional visits to medical practitioners, which may have resulted in delayed treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following extensive lobbying by the Opposition, the Government has agreed to amend the legislation to allow for physiotherapists to refer for R-type X-rays of the spine and pelvic regions. The Minister said that these amendments would take place as soon as legislation was introduced to do this. That option was not taken up by the Minister. The Opposition decided that the only way to force the Government's hand was to introduce the amendment ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has agreed to support an Opposition amendment to allow podiatrists as well to refer for R-type X-rays of the foot and lower leg. Having taught a large number of podiatrists in Victoria over the 13 years I taught at Lincoln, I saw enormous changes in the education of podiatrists. They moved from being simply chiropodists, as we once knew them&mdash;treating maybe elderly patients for corns, et cetera&mdash;to very professional people looking at patterns of gait and the effects on knees of pronation of the foot. Mr Deputy President, I am sure you will be interested in that as well, as we both have knee problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also very involved in the treatment of preventative disease in young children and the effects of disorders of the foot. So they have really developed a much more professional approach to problems of the foot and of the lower leg. In fact they do some minor surgery as well. In the course of their profession, which has become much more in-depth and much more professional, they need the ability to also refer for R-type X-rays. That is another reason why we have moved that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other area that is covered in this Bill relates to the National Food Authority. The National Food Authority Act was passed by the Parliament in June 1991 and was proclaimed to come into effect on 19 August 1991. The NFA has the responsibility for developing and amending food standards. The Bill permits the National Food Authority to treat applications for the development or variation of food standards of the NHMRC as</PARA>
<PARA>having been made under the principal Act and to omit any of the steps normally required in respect of the development or variation of standards. The amendment overcomes an oversight in the operation of section 71 of the principal Act&mdash;again another oversight. The Opposition will be supporting the amendments that correct the anomalies in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue relates to day care surgery. In 1989 the Government introduced Medicare benefits to encourage day only surgery in hospitals. However, in order to prevent procedures which could normally be done in doctors' surgeries being transferred to hospitals, the Government compiled a list of procedures which could not attract such a benefit unless a certificate was signed by the treating doctor stating that in that particular case the patient required day care admission. Only doctors from private or public hospitals were able to issue these certificates. This amendment fixes this oversight which meant that the certification system was not available to doctors at freestanding day surgery facilities. I believe there are 64 such centres around Australia. One of my former student's husbands actually runs one of these day care centres and when the legislation came through he pointed this out as a matter of concern to him and as an issue that he felt needed addressing. The Opposition supports this amendment to remedy yet another oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have to say that the plethora of oversights that surrounded the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority had to be seen to be believed. I congratulate the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which undertook what I believed would be a very short investigation or inquiry but which turned out to be a very long one, because we have seen the unintended consequences of legislation which has been brought in here and which was not thought through. During that Committee hearing we became aware that the Health Insurance Commission and the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority&mdash;and I do not know where the responsibility lies&mdash;did not set out guidelines for the interim period for the pharmacy restructuring process. I have been to many of the sittings of the Committee and I have seen people whose livelihoods have been either taken away from them or severely affected because nobody really thought through the ramifications of what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the unintended consequences of that legislation was that there was no process of review. So the amendment that is now before us gives aggrieved applicants the right to seek a review of a recommendation from the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. Applicants will be permitted to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision made by the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. Appeals may be made in relation to approval to dispense PBS prescriptions, the payment of essential pharmacy allowances, and the payment of amalgamation or closure packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment arises from an omission in the legislation under which the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority was established. As I said, applicants aggrieved with the decision with PRA found themselves with no appeal mechanism to the AAT. However, there was an appeal mechanism open to the Federal Court of Australia. It seems unbelievable to me that the response was, `Well, you can go to the Federal Court'. We had failed to see&mdash;and I include all of us in this but I basically blame the Government&mdash;the need for an appeal mechanism and for those people the only recourse was to go to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all realise the great responsibility we have here to ensure that legislation that goes through this place does not have unintended consequences which affect the livelihood and the well-being, particularly the emotional well-being&mdash;and we have seen people who have been severely affected&mdash;of innocent people who are the victims of the fact that the legislation was not properly thought through. In its annual report the AAT spent considerable time talking about the problem that had arisen because of this omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with the amendments that have corrected the anomalies, I now address the provisions of the Bill that implement the Budget proposals relating to aged care. Firstly, the Bill enables community care packages to be provided to frail older people who continue to reside in their own home. The Minister has said that surveys of older people show they would prefer to live in their own homes than to move into residential care. I would actually like to see those surveys. I do not think it means that all older people would like to live in their own homes but means that people would prefer to have the opportunity to make a choice. Maybe the Minister means that basically older people would prefer to live in their own homes. But I do not think we could say that all older people would chose to live that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic element&mdash;and what we ought to be about&mdash;is choice. People who would prefer to live in the security of residential care should have that choice and those who prefer to remain in their own homes for as long as possible should also have that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two pioneering efforts that I have seen in my own home State are the Hawthorn program, which comes under the linkages part of HACC, and the Brotherhood of St Laurence program in Geelong, which provides assistance to people with dementia. Both of those programs involve caring for people at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I actually spent some time with people from the Hawthorn Council program. We started off at 7.30 in the morning. The first client we visited was severely restricted in her movement because of arthritis. She was very concerned that the linkages program would not continue and that she would not be able to stay in her own home. That Hawthorn Council program demonstrated, through an evaluation, that 19 people were able to be maintained in their own homes at a cost less than the average cost of maintaining that number of people in nursing homes and hostels. Some of them were assessed by GAT teams as requiring residential care in nursing homes, some in hostels. When that cost was averaged out it was found that Hawthorn program was cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brotherhood of St Laurence program is innovative. People with dementia are cared for in their own homes. Training programs even include taxi drivers who run some of the clients from their homes to various doctors, et cetera. The taxi drivers are encouraged not to leave their clients at the front door of their homes. They are advised to take them inside and to put the front door key exactly where the person will find it. As we know, some of these people have short term memory failure. So that program is even at the level of training taxi drivers who work with these people. Everyone who is associated with those clients is taught and made aware of the special needs of people with dementia. Hopefully, this program will have long term viability as a result of this announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Budget announcement the number of hostel places per thousand people over the age of 70 will be reduced from 60 to 55. As a substitution for the reduction in hostel places, funding will be provided for community aged care service packages. Under the program, financial assistance will be paid to organisations providing community aged care service packages designed to meet individual needs, and I hope this will include organisations such as the Hawthorn Council and the Brotherhood of St Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of packages which will be approved are based on the number of hostel places forgone. As we know, the Government had planned to have 60 hostel places and 40 nursing home places per thousand people over 75. Those 60 places have now been reduced to 55 places. Those five beds are to be over time&mdash;it seems over quite a considerable time&mdash;devoted to these community care places. Approvals are to concentrate on those areas in Australia in which it is particularly difficult to provide hostels due to factors such as cost, lack of population, demand or suitable land. Remote and rural areas are particularly singled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important point to note is that older people to whom these community care packages are targeted will also require other services such as those provided under HACC. Unless HACC is able to meet the increased demand, the success of the community aged packages may be at risk. The Bill also gives effect to restructuring of personal care subsidy. The subsidy is divided into three levels according to the level of dependency. As we know, the Government brought in changes to funding for nursing home residents, bringing in a resident classification index which had five levels. One of the differences between the way in which that was implemented and the way in which this is implemented was that, prior to the bringing in of legislation to this House, the Government had surveyed, from memory, 17,000 residents to develop the RCI and to test it. We were able to read and examine the final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am particularly interested is that Victoria has a distribution of residential care different from any other State. We have fewer nursing homes and more hostel residents. We have twice as many nursing home residents in State-funded nursing homes as any other State. We have a totally different profile, with more small rural nursing homes, to that of any other State. So I have concentrated particularly on that. There were some very grave concerns raised when the RCI was developed. I would have liked to have seen the three-tier system for hostels developed more before the legislation came into this House. It would have been more appropriate to have done the survey and to have presented us with the report, as was done with the nursing home RCI classification index, so that we could examine it and the industry could bring its concerns or its congratulations&mdash;I do not want to be biased in predicting what might happen&mdash;about that distribution: the percentage and the factors that are included to classify people in levels 1, 2 or 3. I have a concern that we should have had that information beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving some amendments, although I am not sure the Democrats will support them since the Minister has given an undertaking to them. We have a copy of that letter as to how that process will be undertaken&mdash;it is currently under way&mdash;but I believe it would have been more appropriate for the same procedure to have been used for the introduction of the hostel classification as was used for the nursing home classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also enables the Government to control the quality of persons operating hostels approved under the Act. In 1989, the National Health Act was amended to be able to control the quality of persons operating approved nursing homes. The Bill seeks to exert the same control over the quality of hostel proprietors as exists over nursing home proprietors. The amendments will make it a condition of a hostel's approval that the person operating or proposing to operate a hostel will be approved as an approved operator. Where a hostel breaches this condition, the Commonwealth will be under no obligation to sustain financial assistance in the form of a recurrent subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to approve, refuse or revoke an approval will be based on consideration of a person's ability to satisfy certain criteria. These criteria will include relevant experience, honesty, efficiency and history in the aged care industry. Also contained in the Bill are some changes in the arrangements for CAM funding for non-government nursing homes. Nursing homes will be able to delay applying for a new classification for a patient whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave. An application will not need to be made until the resident's care needs have been carefully assessed after their return from hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of concerns have been expressed to me as I have moved around Australia, particularly in Victoria, that there have been problems with the classification for CAM funding with regard to people leaving hospitals, and changes in their status. I am pleased to see that the Government has at least responded in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the Bill regarding infrastructure funding follow the recently completed SAM review. Remote homes, whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher because of their location, will receive additional funding of approximately $3 per resident per day. Additional funding will also be provided for residents needing nasogastric feeding or continuous oxygen so that they do not have to pay these costs. That has been a very long time coming as well. It has been apparent that some residents have had to stay in hospitals rather than be moved back to their nursing homes, because hospitals provide a service at no cost. This Bill will allow people to move into a more appropriate type of care rather than being in an acute hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is more than disappointed that there has been no general increase in infrastructure funding. The situation in Victoria is critical at the moment, and it would be remiss of me not to mention this in my speech. The industry has calculated that there is a deficiency as high as $10 a day in infrastructure funding. Since the inception of SAM, the industry has pointed out that there is a major deficiency in the construction of the return on the investment element of the funding package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to some places in the country where the directors of nursing&mdash;who have been in the facilities for a considerable amount of time, and have a great commitment to them&mdash;have been doing loads of washing because they believe there is not sufficient SAM money to employ people to do it. This situation will be critical until it is remedied. In Victoria, 21 per cent of the private sector homes are in or near receivership. If one believed in the conspiracy theory, one would believe that the Government's policy has set out to ensure the demise of the private sector in the nursing home industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition believes that the government of the day should ensure that there is an appropriate and adequate level of infrastructure funding for nursing homes. It seems very odd to us that an ingoing is required for a hostel and not necessarily for a nursing home and, in the same complex, that if a person moves from the hostel to the nursing home the ingoing has to be passed back. Surely the Government can develop flexible arrangements to ensure that the care of, and delivery of service to, our older people is not affected by lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charitable and benevolent organisations have for many years received capital grants to assist them to build new nursing homes or rebuild existing homes. Proprietors who do not receive capital grants will now receive supplementary recurrent funding for 10 years for new homes. The legislation allows the Minister to take into account proprietors' records when determining this additional funding. The Minister said that he did not consider it would be appropriate to encourage proprietors with unsatisfactory records to remain in the industry by providing them with additional recurrent funding for new buildings. The Opposition would have to agree, as I am sure the Democrats would, that anything we can do to ensure that the standard of care is as high as possible for older Australians is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into great detail about nursing homes and hostels for disabled people because the Standing Committee on Community Affairs examined them. The coalition was not convinced by the arguments that were put forward by the Department that the interests of the 17 nursing homes and three hostels that have not transferred under the DSA would be served by the current clauses in the Bill. We are moving a number of amendments which we believe meet the needs of those nursing homes and hostels and which would ensure that until their continued funding is guaranteed, and until the transfer is satisfactory to them, the legislation will not be passed as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we suggest that there should be a deferral of the passage of the Bill until, firstly, appropriate legislation is in place to ensure continuity of the level of funding to the nursing homes and hostels to be transferred and, secondly, proper guidelines are drawn up for the proposed transfer of accommodation services to the States which ensure continuity of funding or complete clarification of the intending relationship between the State and Federal governments as to the funding of accommodation services. Given that the Government is unwilling to do this, I foreshadow that the Opposition, as I said before, will be opposing the relevant clauses in the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 implements a number of Budget decisions, mainly about aged care, most of which are welcomed by the Australian Democrats. Firstly, the Bill allows for organisations providing help to aged or disabled persons living at home to receive financial assistance. This assistance is to be called community aged care service packages and they are a further step towards enabling aged people to stay at home if they so wish rather than be forced into institutional care. I do not think anyone would question that this is a laudable aim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need surveys to tell us that most older people would much rather stay at home in their own localities with friends and neighbours, often in homes that they have lived in for many years, rather than be forced into a nursing home or hostel. Of course, it is not always possible for people to stay at home as they get older and their physical or mental health deteriorates. However, it should be our goal to assist older people to stay at home where it is what they want and where it is possible for them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community aged care service packages will enable people to receive hostel level personal care services in their own homes. They will be directed towards those persons who have a relatively high dependency&mdash;in other words, the ones most at risk of having to move into residential care. Both residential care providers and community based care providers would be eligible to receive funding under this program. I am hopeful, as is the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), that this will lead to increased contact and improved understanding between the two. It certainly has the potential to lead to a more efficient and effective use of resources and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The packages offer a way of giving maximum possible effect to the wishes of an older person and to tailor support programs to an individual's needs instead of just packing the person off to a hostel or nursing home when he or she starts to deteriorate or becomes a nuisance or problem for his or her neighbours or relatives. These packages will undoubtedly prove to be of major benefit to many older people and will be especially valuable to people living in remote or rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, their introduction is also likely to raise a whole new set of problems. I trust that the Government will be closely monitoring the operation of the packages&mdash;and the consequent reduction in the number of hostel places per 1,000 people over 70&mdash;to make sure that they do serve the needs of aged persons in the community. In particular, I urge the Minister to get serious about properly funding the home and community care program in recognition of the potentially very valuable role HACC is likely to play in ensuring the success of these packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also covers the restructuring of hostel personal care funding, which is an attempt to target funding towards residents who are very physically frail or who have dementia. Again, this is a worthwhile objective. Inadequate support for people with dementia has been a cause of concern for some time. While there are still problems with the level of support available, I believe that the new three-tier subsidy structure is very definitely a step in the right direction. Certainly it will mean that more services will receive more assistance for dementia sufferers. However, the phasing out of the dementia grants program is likely to cause problems for the specialised dementia hostels. I ask the Minister whether he can inform the Senate how the Government is planning to address the ongoing needs of these hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate Senator Patterson's concerns about not being able to see the detail relating to the three tiers. As I have said before, this Government is most adept at leaving major issues to delegated legislation rather than including them in the principal Act. This practice is highly unsatisfactory and it is tempting to see it as a way of dodging the processes of Parliament. But, as I have also said before in this chamber, I do not see it as a reason for holding up legislation. I am pretty sure that when Opposition senators find themselves in government they will not be particularly keen on having their legislation delayed because they do not have the relevant delegated legislation completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously not always possible to present regulations or instruments at the time the principal legislation comes up. In this case, under clause 2, section 10 and section 11 will commence on 29 April. I asked for and received an assurance from the Minister, Mr Staples, that relevant guidelines will be tabled by the end of March next year. I seek leave to have his letter dated 12 December 1991 incorporated as it sets out in quite some detail the fact that the instrument is currently being trialled in some 347 hostels and gives details as to the date when the general conditions will be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The letter read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Lees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your expressed concern at the Government's intentions in respect of the conditions under which the proposed new hostel personal care subsidies will be determined and how they will operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware the proposed amendment makes provision for three rates of personal care subsidy instead of one. Further, it allows that the `General Conditions' will be amended to enable the determination of the classification of hostel residents for the purpose of payment of the subsidy according to the classification of the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, substantial work has been undertaken to develop a new instrument to effect the classification of residents. This has been done in consultation with peak service providers, consumer and union groups as well as recognised experts in the field of dementia. All of these have co-operated in this process and the peak service groups, Aged Care Australia and the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association have supported the trial of the instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument is currently being trialled in some 347 hostels, involving some 6,500 residents. The sample has been so structured as to ensure a balanced representation of all hostels by State, metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, size range and focus on special needs groups&mdash;including double sampling of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander hostels and hostels for specific ethnic groups to ensure statistical reliability in the returns. Also, the sample has been balanced to ensure representation of hostels in receipt of dementia grants, i.e., approximately 37 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `General Conditions' will detail the criteria for assessment and the method of classification of people and identify the points scale and cut-offs at which the different rates are applicable. The trial will provide the data to enable the statistical analysis which will determine the weightings to apply to the various questions. This in turn will allow the determination of those factors which will permit the classification of the individual to the relevant group for subsidy purposes. This analysis will be publicly available and the basis of consultation with the industry. I would be happy to ensure you received a copy if you so wished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `General Conditions' relating to the classification of persons will be tabled prior to the implementation date of 29 April 1992 to take effect from that date. They will, of course, be developed and finalised when the results of the trial data analysis and consultations are completed which will be during March 1992. I give an undertaking that the `General Conditions' will be tabled by the end of March 1992. You will appreciate that the General Conditions are a disallowable instrument and as such both Houses should have an adequate opportunity to consider them by April 29, 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that I have alleviated your concerns as to the process and timing of the implementation of these new funding arrangements which are designed to give recognition to the valuable role hostels play in caring for the frail aged, including those with cognitive and behavioural problems, and in ensuring that funding is targeted to those with the greatest need. You will appreciate that extra funding is proposed to facilitate this change and that more people requiring personal care support will now be eligible to receive additional funding to assist in the provision of that support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill also sets up control mechanisms over the operators of hostels similar to those already in place for nursing home proprietors under the National Health Act. I know that there are a lot of mutterings in the aged care industry about too much government intervention and regulation, but the Australian Democrats do not accept these arguments. When someone is operating for profit a service that provides direct care to a group of people who, by and large, are not in a position to push their own interests, then the community, through the Government, has an obligation to ensure these people receive proper protection and are not exploited. This is not an area where we can afford the so-called free market to operate uncontrolled and unobserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is quite clear that the Government's efforts in this field have been instrumental in the industry cleaning up its act. That is not to say that the industry has not done quite a bit to get its own house in order; nor am I saying that there are vast numbers of shoddy operators out there. But it has to be acknowledged that there are some unscrupulous and uncaring hostel and nursing home operators and there are some who simply do not have the experience, knowledge or capabilities to provide a good standard of care to their residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not help to pretend that these people do not exist&mdash;although we also need to appreciate that physical, emotional and financial abuse can, and indeed unfortunately does, occur in the older person's own home. In short, I do not consider that introducing the concept of approved operators into the hostel area represents any great infringement on the rights of hostel owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other changes to nursing home funding arrangements contained in the Bill, including additional SAM funding for nursing homes catering for residents who require nasogastric feeding or continuous oxygen and those homes situated in isolated areas. We support these measures, which are generally welcomed by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the general point needs to be made to the Government that, as long as we are going to have private-for-profit hostels and nursing homes, there must be a recognition of the costs involved in providing an adequate standard of care. I think the industry makes a number of very valid points when it talks about the inadequacy of the present levels of subsidy available to it. I have to say that this issue has been raised with me many times throughout the entire country by various proprietors and service providers, and I am sympathetic to their arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates vary as to exactly what increases are needed to fix the situation, but both private and religious or charitable service providers have told me that they are struggling to maintain a high standard of care under present SAM levels. I think a convincing case can be, and has been, made for increasing SAM levels. This issue of adequacy of SAM funding really has not been addressed properly by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill, the Government has also moved to rectify an omission relating to the payment of Medicare benefits to physiotherapists for certain types of X-rays, and I understand the Government has accepted similar Opposition amendments covering podiatrists. Like many other honourable senators, I have received numerous letters from physiotherapists and podiatrists concerned about the impact of their omission from the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990. We were advised by the Minister early in this session&mdash;I think it was as early as August&mdash;that amendments covering physiotherapists would be introduced before the end of the year. We indicated to all those who contacted us that such amendments would have our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also supportive of the move to cover podiatrists and we recognise the sensible approach being taken by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) in giving effect to these changes. The credit really belongs to the many physiotherapists and podiatrists who picked up the omission and who lobbied so hard to have it recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also provides for the revoking of approvals for 17 nursing homes and three hostels for disabled people to coincide with the Commonwealth-State disability agreements coming into force in each State. These provisions allow the remaining nursing homes and hostels for people with disabilities to be included in the transfer of responsibility for Commonwealth-funded accommodation services to the States. These revocations will take place only when the CSDA comes into operation in each State. I must say that I have considerable difficulty with the premise behind these provisions, but not so much with the provisions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are not big fans of the so-called new federalism. We do not consider that the States have good records in the delivery of human services and we are concerned that the interests of people with disabilities must be protected under any transfer of services to the States. We have put our concerns about handing over services to the States on record on many occasions. However, despite what the Democrats&mdash;and, I might add, many community organisations and service providers&mdash;may feel about the whole new federalism debacle, the Government will be proceeding with the hand-over to the States of accommodation facilities for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was tempted to put a spanner in the new federalism works by delaying the revocation of these approvals. However, I must say that we have now had two very comprehensive briefings from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services&mdash;and I thank the officers concerned, particularly for the very late ones they attended. I really cannot see much point in holding up the process just in relation to these 20 services, especially&mdash;and this I wish to stress&mdash;as it may very well be to the detriment of the residents concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, under the terms of the CSDA, no service will be transferred, including those services mentioned in this Bill, until each individual State enacts legislation complementary to the Disability Services Act. I accept the argument that the residents in these facilities are more likely to receive services that meet their needs under this sort of complementary legislation than under the existing legislation, which is basically directed towards aged care. Furthermore, there will not be any funding gap as a consequence of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the CSDA provides that each State is required to maintain funding for the transferred services at current levels for the first year after transfer. There are certainly problems with three of the services, all in New South Wales, because they basically fall outside the parameters of the CSDA, being primarily for drug and alcohol rehabilitation. However, negotiations are continuing about their transfer. I cannot see that delaying this process does anything much one way or the other for these particular services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the CSDA, the Commonwealth will provide initial funding under a special purpose payment for the first year and is offering the States and Territories $245m over the next five years, with $100m earmarked for growth in the transferred services and $145m for improving existing services. While the Commonwealth is obviously unable to give cast-iron guarantees about funding, it does seem likely that the particular services mentioned in this Bill will get an opportunity to increase their funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further&mdash;and I think this is a very convincing point&mdash;the CSDA obliges all governments and services to enter into service agreements which will specify the outcomes to be achieved and the standards to be attained. At present, the services we are talking about are not obliged to meet particular service standards. At the moment there is still very little control over the services concerned. Further delays could mean that residents in these places may be denied access to the provisions and protections of the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances I cannot see that it makes much sense to hold these particular services back from the CSDA transfer process. It would not be consistent or fair to proceed with the arrangements for every other service and, effectively, leave these high and dry, occupying a little corner all on their own. Then one really would wonder what their future would be. Accordingly, we will not be supporting the deletion of clauses 13, 38 and 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill provides for a Commonwealth benefit to be paid in respect of newly built nursing homes. The Opposition had proposed some amendments relating to an appeal process for ministerial decisions, and I welcome its decision not to proceed with these amendments. We had major problems with these because, effectively, they would have allowed proprietors to appeal against a refusal to grant them a benefit. This could have led to considerable delays and great problems as normally appeals are about eligibility rather than whether the Minister decides, once an application has been accepted, to go ahead and fund the applicant. I will close by simply saying that we are pleased to note that the Opposition has withdrawn those amendments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Bill proposes a significant amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act to enable community care packages to be provided to frail older people continuing to reside in their own homes. I think all honourable senators would agree that it must be a fundamental objective of any aged care policy to try to extend the independence of older people in the community through the provision of home care services. Certainly, it has been my experience, and no doubt that of other honourable senators, that older people do prefer to stay at home and receive care rather than move to a residential facility. The introduction of community aged care services packages is an important step in that process. In so far as this Bill facilitates that, it is certainly to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also, as was foreshadowed in the Budget, following the review of hostel recurrent funding, a decision by the Government to restructure hostel personal care funding. This was seen as necessary to target funding to those residents with high levels of physical frailty and to those suffering from dementia. The restructured personal care subsidy will provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people consistent with the objectives of the aged care strategy. I understand that may be the subject of further discussion during the committee stage. I think some amendments will be moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to revoke approvals to the 17 remaining nursing homes for disabled people and three remaining hostels for disabled people at the time the existing Commonwealth-State disability agreements come into full operation in each State. I recall that that was the subject of some discussion by the legislation committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Bill relating to the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type or referred diagnostic imaging services are designed to enable the payment of benefits of certain imaging requested by physiotherapists.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many organisations have been concerned about the personal care assessment instrument and, as I said, they were concerned about the RCI during its development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest version of the personal care assessment instrument is perceived to have a number of deficiencies, including placing undue demands on hostel management because of documentation requirements to validate assessments and the categorisation of residents, and the resultant funding is not likely to reflect the real costs of personal care for residents who have dementia or some other behavioural disorder. Specialised dementia hostels are not accommodated by the general personal care assessment instrument.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. Let me say from the outset that it serves little purpose to go over all the old ground in detail as to the history of the electoral system in the ACT. It is sufficient to remind honourable senators that after considerable debate, which went on for months, the Parliament agreed to a proportional representation electoral system based on the European d'Hondt system and colloquially known as `modified d'Hondt'. At the first election members of a disenchanted electorate, which for various reasons did not want self-government, set out to protest in the way they voted. Some weird and wonderful parties were registered, such as the Party! Party! Party!, the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party, the Abolish Self-Government Party, the No-Self Government Party and so on. In fact, some candidates were elected from parties with those weird names. When the many independents were added, the ballot paper ended up being a metre long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the hostility to self-government, irrespective of the electoral system in place, whether it had been a Senate type or a modified d'Hondt, the bizarre outcome would have almost certainly been the same. It was inevitable. It is patently obvious that the silly and expensive amendment passed by the Labor Party and the Democrats as part of the recent electoral Bill to send a brochure to every candidate in the next Federal election and to every household in this country has the potential to produce the same result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment as passed when guillotined through this place last week had two major flaws: the candidates would not be known until nominations closed; and the Electoral Commission would then have a maximum of 20 days to receive photographs, CVs and policy statements, incorporate them in a leaflet and distribute them throughout Australia. It is inevitable that in many electorates there will be a plethora of candidates for a variety of reasons. For instance, local business may <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>see merit in nominating. For the cost of the nomination fee they may have their brochure distributed, courtesy of the taxpayer, to every household. Political parties will almost certainly run multiple independents with bizarre policy statements simply to pick up a few preferences which could be vital in a marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me about this is that it has the potential to throw the whole electoral system in Australia into disarray. I fear that what we saw in the ACT election could be extended Australia-wide. This will not do anything to enhance the already low opinion that the electorate has of the Parliament of this country. Perhaps that was an intended consequence of a Labor Government. It seems to me, however, to be yet another example of the actions of an incompetent, tired and stupid government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations of a report on the ACT by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters were implemented by the Parliament some months ago. The original legislation was amended to remove some of the distortions based on the experience of the last election. For example, the coalition insisted that cross preference voting be permitted rather than straight party list voting. It was also agreed that at the time of the next election a referendum would be held so that the people of the ACT could determine whether they wanted the Hare-Clarke system of proportional representation or single member electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a general rule, the coalition supports single member electorates. However, we recognise that the ACT is unique in that it is of pocket handkerchief size, it is the national capital and it is subject to the Burley Griffin plan. For that reason, elected members are required to take a global view of the ACT. The Labor Party, however, is not prepared to take a reasoned view but is driven by the political desire for a one-party government which would almost certainly be the outcome of having single member electorates in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I note the number of occasions on which Senator McMullan has spoken on this matter. So far, I have not seen one cogent reason in favour of the single member electorates. The Minister stated, and we agreed, that further legislation would be introduced to give control of the electoral system to the ACT Assembly after the election. This legislation honours that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that in the committee stage of the Bill the Democrats will move to yet again amend the electoral system to the Senate type system. The Opposition will not agree to that amendment. We ask the question: why, at this stage, impose another system on the ACT which will be there just for one election? Frankly, the ACT has been mucked about too much already and the referendum will, hopefully, determine the future system in the ACT. Even though I have some sympathy with Senator Sowada's amendments, we just cannot see the justification for this less than two months before an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own calculations indicate that the outcome of an election with modified d'Hondt with cross preferences would produce a result which should be almost identical to that achieved under the Senate system. The problem of wasted votes, which is often thrown at the modified d'Hondt, occurs under all systems of proportional representation. There is no perfect system. If there were, I guess we would all have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major parties under a Senate system always distribute their preferences down the line in a way which would not benefit the other party. This can produce some strange results, such as the election of ex-Senator Robert Wood who, in New South Wales, received about 2 per cent of the primary vote and was elected. To argue that the voters of parties whose preferences helped him be elected intended to do so is nothing short of ludicrous. They would have been the most surprised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will be moving an amendment at the committee stage, which I hope has been circulated by now, which will enable the Electoral Commissioner to refuse the registration of the name of a political party which he considers is mischievous or is meant to deceive electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a loophole in the Act which prevents the Commissioner from being able to do so at present. There is no doubt that this has already occurred within the Australian Capital Territory. With the inevitable copycat flow-on, it can be expected to occur in other parts of Australia once the precedent has been set in the Australian Capital Territory. Regrettably, it is not possible in this Bill to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to cover this loophole. We suggest that the Government should seek to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to prevent that from occurring. If not, we ourselves will take advantage of a future opportunity to do so. I point out that the amendment which we will be proposing in the committee stage will not be retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the Electoral Commissioner rule in the future that an application for registration is mischievous or meant to deceive, the applicant under the existing provisions of the principal Act will have the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. When this amendment was moved in the House of Representatives, it was argued that there were problems in legally defining the meaning of the terms `frivolous' and `vexatious' and that it would be difficult to define what the criteria of `vexatious' and `frivolous' would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have obtained an opinion on this matter. It has been pointed out to me that the terms `frivolous' and `vexatious' are longstanding terms at law. They are clearly understood by the courts and are used extensively in the Australian statutes. For example, the term `frivolous' occurs at least 62 times in Commonwealth statutes, and the term `vexatious' occurs at least 77 times. The terms are used in the Federal Court rules, the High Court rules and in a broad spectrum of legislation ranging from the Lands Acquisition Act, the Bankruptcy Act, companies and securities legislation, Defence Force discipline legislation, family law legislation, the Public Service Act, and the Merit Protection Review Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms are therefore widely used and clearly understood. As to the concept of `mischief', this term is used at least three times in the Commonwealth statutes, more particularly in the Federal Court of Australia Act, the rules of the High Court, and the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. I point that out because it makes nonsense of the arguments put in the House of Representatives that there were problems with legal definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not be opposing the second reading of the Bill as it fulfils a commitment by the Government and the Parliament to hand over control of the ACT electoral system to the Assembly. We will, however, as outlined earlier, be moving an amendment in the committee stage. I think everyone in this chamber will be pleased at long last to hand over the ACT electoral system to the ACT Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, a Bill with great ramifications for the future of fair elections in the Australian Capital Territory. We have been given this opportunity to legislate for justice and fairness for the electors of Canberra and surrounds and for an equitable system of elections. The question is: are we going to waste this opportunity?  Legislating for the ACT raises issues of constitutional delicacy and fine judgment. Canberra is the national capital, but it is also the centre of a region which transcends the borders of the ACT, and it is a local community. Developing and applying legislation which acknowledges the threefold character of the ACT and strikes a proper balance between these elements is a complex and important task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst other things, the basic guts of this Bill seek to give the ACT Legislative Assembly the power to make its own electoral laws; that is, the power to determine which electoral system will be used to elect its government. Hopefully, as Senator Parer suggested, this Bill marks the last sorry chapter in what has been a litany of missed opportunities in the quest for a perfect electoral system in the Territory. The Australian Democrats will be supporting this Bill and, in so doing, we will be moving our own amendments to help rectify a major problem in relation to the coming election, which the Government has not chosen to address in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this legislation the Government has made one other move in the right direction: it is modifying the present nitpicking and inappropriate arrangements for Federal control of the number of Ministers the Territory has. This is not to say that the number of territorial Ministers should increase. Whether it is fair to say that the increase is the business of the Federal Parliament is not for us to determine, and this legislation in clause 5 vests that power and responsibility where it rightfully lies&mdash;with the ACT Government. Let it account to its own voters for the number of Ministers it chooses to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra is, amongst other things, the national capital. Basic processes of democracy in that national capital, such as electoral fairness, are of concern to all Australia&mdash;ministerial headcounts are not. The Government should go on to make changes in relation to other matters called to attention over the years by the Australian Democrats, such as the ability of the Federal Executive to intervene to disallow laws passed by the territorial parliament. We must, as soon as possible, proceed to a situation in which, if laws made by the ACT legislature are to be disallowed, the disallowance is by this Parliament and not by the Federal Executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I give notice that I will be addressing the relationship between the two parliaments in a private members' Bill that I will be introducing early next year. However, it is right and proper, after several years of self-government in the Australian Capital Territory, that finally devolving responsibility for the electoral system to the ACT Assembly is actually happening. The matter will be determined by the people of the ACT in a referendum on 15 February to determine which electoral system those voters would like to have. This Bill will ensure, one would hope, that the results of that referendum will be upheld in new electoral laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter which most urgently needs to be addressed is the voting system to be used in the ACT elections due to be held on 15 February next year. The d'Hondt electoral system is a scandal and has brought great discredit on this Parliament. As one of my predecessors, former Senator Jean Jenkins, said at the time it was first adopted, the Government hunted high and low&mdash;mainly low&mdash;to find the only truly objectionable form of proportional representation ever invented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a chance to make amends. We have a chance to tell the long-suffering people of the ACT that the d'Hondt abomination looming ahead and threatening them on 15 February next will be lifted, and that while they choose the voting system to be used in the longer term, a three-quarters good system, the Senate system, with which they are all familiar, will be used on that day instead of d'Hondt. To that extent, I will be moving amendments to this Bill to down load the Senate system to replace the modified d'Hondt for the purposes of the coming election only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be irresponsible not to make this change. Honourable senators should consider just a little of the enormous weight of opinion against d'Hondt. It is not just that d'Hondt is despised by the people of the ACT and laughed at by the media throughout Australia, it is also that the Australian Electoral Commission itself has consistently over more than three years advised against d'Hondt and has even on occasions been led to shed its normal Public Service-like indirectness and to speak about the system in blunt everyday Australian terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Way back in October or November 1988, the Electoral Commission was warning the Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that if there is any suggestion made publicly that consolidated d'Hondt has the Commission's approval, we will be obliged to repudiate it.</PARA>
<PARA>In the years since then the Commission, as the nation's finest specialist in these complex matters, has honourably stuck to its guns. In May this year in a letter to Senator Bell, included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 4 June, the Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter of concern to us that as things stand . . . (a) further election will be held under the `modified d'Hondt' system. The Commission has consistently taken the view that the modified d'Hondt system has been demonstrated both by theoretical analysis and practical experience to be fatally flawed, and that it should not be used again. . . . The defects of the system, which were documented in detail in our Submission to the Joint Standing Committee, include the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   It accepts certain votes as formal even when the markings placed on the ballot paper by the voter are ambiguous and contradictory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   It distorts preferences expressed by the voters, attributes to voters preferences which they did not in fact express, and enhances the relative influence of some electors' votes for no good reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   It arbitrarily excludes from the count candidates who and parties which received less than 5.55% of the vote. The rationale for this exclusion process has never been clear. At the 1989 election, it caused the exclusion at the outset of the scrutiny of the candidate who polled the second highest number of first preference votes given for individual candidates rather than parties, and had a major influence on the current composition of the Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   It offers electors an inducement to vote "strategically", indicating preferences other than those they truly hold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   It is literally impossible to find out from the public record what purpose is meant to be served by the last 3 stages of the scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   The system is complex, is not based on any well-defined principles of electoral justice, and consequently is understood by hardly anyone at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   Because of the inordinate complexity of the system, the scrutiny takes an unacceptably long time to complete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   The legitimacy of the Assembly has been diminished by the general recognition that its members were chosen using a defective voting system.</PARA>
<PARA>Taking all these factors into account, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters agreed with the Commission's view that the modified d'Hondt system was fundamentally defective and should be replaced. The Commission went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be emphasised that the defects of the modified d'Hondt system as set out above (would) not be corrected by the minor changes to the system contained in the Bill (then) before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Analysis and criticism of d'Hondt has not just come from officials and specialists; it has also come from within the Government's own ranks. I will give one of my favourite examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a Senate occasional lecture on 23 September this year, the Leader of the Government in the Senate made his view plain to a packed lunchtime audience. Senator Button was asked by emeritus Professor Arthur Burns whether he would, as a sort of farewell present to ACT electors on his retirement, introduce for the ACT's 1992 election the very same electoral system by which he, Senator Button, had been elected. Senator Button's reply offered some hope to the ACT community&mdash;alas, a false hope, it has turned out. The honourable senator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disgraceful though the situation in the ACT may be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I will repeat that: `disgraceful though the situation in the ACT may be', he was not going to give an answer on the spot but would certainly have a look at the issues raised. Senator Button has now managed to escape this Bill and has gone off to Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much more starkly thrown into relief is the need for change when we recall that the ACT Legislative Assembly, without dissent, resolved to request us to make the very change we are now debating. What could be clearer than the Assembly's message on behalf of the people of the ACT as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Assembly calls on the Federal Parliament to discard the discredited d'Hondt and to provide the Senate electoral system for the 1992 ACT Legislative Assembly election as recommended by the Australian Electoral Commission to the Electoral Matters Committee of the Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>A copy of that resolution was sent to the President of the Senate on 2 December and was tabled in this place. If we have any commitment at all to open government and public processes, and to respecting the will of the elected representatives of the ACT Assembly, it would be unconscionable for us to disregard the Assembly's request. It is simply not a course which would in all honour be open to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, we need to remember that it was the slowness of action at the Federal level, and only at the Federal level, which made it necessary for this matter to be brought before us tonight. Clearly, in its proposals the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters envisaged that a referendum of the ACT people to select a replacement voting system would be completed in time for the outcome to be reflected in the voting system put in place for the 1992 ACT election. It would be nobody's fault but the Government's if this did not happen in good time. The Government should hang its head in shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scandal is that, underlying all this, the Government is probably attempting to deceive the ACT electorate by pretending that d'Hondt has anything to do with the Hare-Clarke option in the referendum. I call on the Opposition to consider seriously its position in relation to my amendments, to consider the need to rid the ACT electorate of a totally discredited electoral system once and for all&mdash;a system that has been widely discredited from many corners, including the Australian Electoral Commission&mdash;and to consider its responsibility to uphold the will of its own party members in the ACT Assembly and support this move. Like the Government, the Opposition has also had the opportunity to respond to the request of the ACT Assembly and to remove the hated d'Hondt system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 to support strongly the words of my colleague Senator Sowada. I do so, not in any sense to elaborate on them, but rather to reinforce them because the sentiments she has expressed have been before this place previously and they have been expressed by the community of the Australian Capital Territory and by the legislature of the Australian Capital Territory. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we are closing our ears to these sentiments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain fact is that d'Hondt will never be used again; if it is used this time in the ACT it will never be used again. It seems that we are facing yet another missed opportunity. We have an opportunity to follow Senator Sowada's suggestions and amendments and to institute in the ACT something which is at least practical and desirable and will be effective in electing a proportional representation of the electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments have been canvassed to some extent that it is all a bit late and a bit hard; that it might be too hard to understand or that it might not work. But all of those arguments have been addressed by the fact that Senator Sowada has done it. The preparations have been made; it is possible. In this amendment we have the vehicle to actually achieve our goal. To close our eyes and ears to that is to deny the people of the ACT the remedy for the despicable d'Hondt system which does not deliver what the ACT people desire to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again: d'Hondt will not be used again. It has been discredited. Another dose of d'Hondt will not satisfy anybody in this Territory; the system will be discarded by whichever legislature is elected. It will be discarded for two reasons. One of those is that the options that are available under the referendum, which will run concurrently with that election, do not provide the opportunity to use d'Hondt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The referendum does not provide that opportunity. In my questioning of the Minister at the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which was dealing with this matter on a couple of occasions, I was quite pointed as to whether it was possible for a newly elected legislature of the ACT to ignore the outcome of the referendum.  While it is unlikely, it remains possible. So there is the possibility that even though at the referendum one of the options of either single member electorates or a Hare-Clark electorate system would be endorsed by the people&mdash;that is only one of the options they have&mdash;it is possible, but as I said unlikely, that the newly elected legislature could ignore that and retain the d'Hondt system. Of course, it will not. We know this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the newly elected legislature could ignore the referendum processes and, given the discredited nature of the d'Hondt system which would now have delivered two doses of elected members to the people of the ACT, there could well be a suggestion that because of the uselessness, the ineffectiveness and the unrepresentativeness of such an electoral system, the people who were elected were not truly representative and, therefore, the decisions they make could be challenged. That is the sort of question that could be avoided by recognising the reality, the wisdom, of what is proposed in the amendments that have been prepared by Senator Sowada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to other senators to listen to the people of the electorate, to realise the distinct possibilities of even greater confusion during and after this next election, and to realise that this legislation offers the chance to deliver to the ACT people a system with which they are familiar, a system which is workable and a system which does not require the people to go through that most unpleasant experience of another election using this most unsatisfactory system. I commend the amendments which have been foreshadowed by Senator Sowada. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason we are here tonight discussing the Australian Capital Territory and its electoral system is that the Government has brought forward a Bill entitled the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, a Bill in which the Government is putting into effect its commitment to hand over to the ACT legislature responsibility for its electoral system in the future and, in addition, to remove the requirement for the ACT to obtain the Federal Treasurer's approval before making certain guarantees. That does not seem to have attracted much attention at all, but the electoral system continues to excite interest all around the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were discussing similar matters in June of this year when we put into effect the fact that the Government has agreed to fund a referendum to take place on the same day as the election next year, namely 15 February. At that time the electoral system itself was capable of being discussed and the Senate left the system as it was, with the d'Hondt system somewhat modified. People have been incredibly rude about the d'Hondt system. It seems to work in other places and I agree that it would be hard to make out a good case for it in this Territory because it has been significantly discredited by a number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we at least had a system where we could vote&mdash;no electoral system is perfect&mdash;and it did provide a result, one that some were not entirely happy with. I fail to see what a Senate type system would do that would be markedly different. If there are to be 117 candidates in an electorate the size of the ACT, a Senate type vote would take just about as long to count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a lot of criticism of the count, the length of time that it took, the nature of the system and the number of parties that stood. Certainly, some of the names of the parties were absolutely ludicrous. Surely, in a democracy, it is better to have a number of people wanting to take part and to be a part of the election than to have none. I find it remarkable that people will be critical of the system because a lot of people wanted to participate. It ought to be the essence of democracy that people wish to participate and feel that they have something to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to concede that a ballot-paper a metre wide was somewhat daunting, but it was fairly clear. I believe that most citizens in the ACT voted in the way they intended to vote on that day the year before last. As I said, a Senate vote also takes quite a long time to count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the question of the referendum, Senator Bell referred to the fact that there is nothing in this legislation which requires the implementation of the referendum. That did surprise me. I find it quite extraordinary. The Commonwealth has gone to the trouble to hold a referendum and to pay for it, but it then seems to say that it does not matter much what happens after that. I would have thought the obvious thing to do was for the Commonwealth to hold the referendum, to enact the consequences of it and then hand the system over to the ACT. But that is not what is to happen. The Commonwealth does not even seem to be concerned about saying that the result of the referendum shall be implemented by the ACT Government. It could well be that we have the result of the referendum and a different group elected who are not disposed to implement it. If that happens, I think it would be extremely unfortunate. It would add nothing to the regard in which politicians are held in this country. I certainly hope that it will not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This incredible suggestion tonight, 12 December&mdash;when the election is just two months away on 15 February&mdash;that we should put into effect yet another voting system from that which has operated in the ACT is quite extraordinary. We have had the d'Hondt system once and we are going to have it again. We are having a referendum on the same day to choose between the Hare-Clark system and single member electorates, yet just two months before that election another idea comes up for a different voting system&mdash;one that is not going to be on the ballot-paper for the referendum on 15 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If somebody were trying to urge a change to ensure that one of those two systems was used on 15 February, one could at least understand that there might be some logic to it. But to suggest now that we embark upon yet a fourth system, a one-off, to be used only once&mdash;in February&mdash;would make the Commonwealth Government look absurd. I cannot believe that is a rational solution to what seems to be a difficult problem for some people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The d'Hondt system has its defects; the Senate system has its defects; the Hare-Clark system has its defects; and single member electorates certainly can be challenged as well. There is no perfect electoral system. Given that it is set that the election in February will be based on the d'Hondt system, which I recognise will probably not happen again, I expect the referendum result to be put into effect. If the suggestion had come up even in June that we should have a different system, it could have been debated and looked at. But if a referendum is to be held for either Hare-Clark or single member electorates, then things should at least be left the way they are for the present if this system is not to be put onto the referendum ballot as well. The Senate system is not one of the options for the referendum and it should not be introduced at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be possible to go on and talk at some length about this and the history of it. It is all well documented. I do not believe there is much more that needs to be said at this stage. I support the amendment moved by the Opposition which Senator Parer referred to in his speech earlier this evening. I certainly will not be supporting the amendments that have been put forward by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points that I wish to put on the record about the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill. This piece of legislation, as is possible in this place now, was referred to the appropriate Senate Standing Committee which, in this case, was the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts covering, as it does, the Territories. At very short notice, the Committee was asked to deal with the Bill as proposed. It was at such short notice that the Committee agreed to proceed to examine the legislation even though we were unable to organise for a Minister to be present&mdash;and I might say that we made considerable efforts to do that. There was a tight time constraint on the Committee to report back to this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take advice or correction from you, Mr Deputy President, but my understanding is that, if a Bill is referred to a committee, that committee's report to the Senate effectively replaces the deliberations in this place on the Bill. That is the purpose of the examination of the Bill by a committee and the committee's report to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is perfectly possible for the Senate or senators to change their minds, but I would like to put on the record what an absolute mockery of the system it is that at very short notice a committee is required to examine a Bill. Having done so and reported to this place, I do not know what arrangements were made earlier&mdash;I was unable to catch that&mdash;to overturn the report from the Committee by way of deliberations. The Bill was referred to our Committee prior to the completion of the second reading stage and that may be, in fact, the exception to the usual procedure in this place, and why a slightly different process has been proceeded with in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hearings on that morning allowed for a curious contribution&mdash;that might be the kindest way to describe it&mdash;from a Mr Mackerras, but it was certainly not something that gave the Committee much pause or contributed to the deliberations on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other point I wish to make is that, when Senator Sowada requested that the Committee examine the Bill, as I recollect&mdash;and I will stand corrected&mdash;I do not believe that proposals for a Senate-type election were even mooted at that time. In some ways it is very difficult for the Senate&mdash;which has referred a Bill to a committee to canvass those sorts of options&mdash;to find that this was done under such time constraints. In trying to meet those needs, we did the best we could. I think we did all that was required of us. We did that thoughtfully. We certainly took the time of officers from the Department and officers from the Australian Electoral Commission. We proceeded properly, despite the difficulties of not having a Minister present. By agreement within the Committee to proceed, we examined the legislation. We heard evidence, principally from one witness. No hard case was made to amend, or recommend any amendment to, the Bill and a proposal for a Senate-type election was not floated at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chair of that Committee, I certainly made it my business to check that Opposition senators who had had an interest in this piece of legislation when it was previously very extensively canvassed were given the opportunity to come to that Committee if they wanted to.

I do think, though, that the process needs to be examined.

It is not possible, and Senator Crowley knows it, for each of us always to be in attendance at each committee hearing. The committee she was talking about spent maybe a couple of hours on the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill.

That intention has been frustrated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came up with a recommendation that there should be a referendum in the ACT and that two propositions should be put&mdash;the Hare-Clark system, and single member constituencies. I personally supported the introduction of the Hare-Clark system. But to suggest that just because this particular measure has to go to a committee, we should not examine and vote upon Senator Sowada's amendments on their merits is not proper and nor does it in my view have regard to the history of this matter. The most recent history of the matter is that the ACT Legislative Assembly wrote to the President and suggested that we exercise our power as a Federal Parliament to ensure that a system other than the d'Hondt system be used. The Assembly called upon us to discard the d'Hondt system and introduce the Senate electoral system. That was a decision of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory, made by the elected representatives of the people of the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have to look at it this way: we might say that members of the Assembly have been elected on the modified d'Hondt system, it is a lousy system and therefore they are lousy representatives. I do not think that follows. I think we ought to have regard to the views of the people who are likely to be candidates at the next election. If this proposal were adopted by the ACT Legislative Assembly, we should have regard to it. I do not suggest we should adopt everything that the Assembly recommends, quite the contrary, but I do suggest it is quite proper for us to consider the amendments to the Bill proposed by Senator Sowada which give effect to that express view of the Assembly. As well, it was the very deliberate intention of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the modified d'Hondt system should go. I will not canvass all of the matters that came before us, because most honourable senators would be aware of them, but one thing is for sure: we do not want to see the modified d'Hondt system used again in the ACT. </PARA>

There is nothing to prevent the proposal being put forward by referendum, as was proposed by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, at that election.

Of course, most honourable senators find out during the week whether they will be required to take part in committee proceedings on a Friday; if they are not, and if they come from a State such as Tasmania, Western Australia or Queensland, they more often than not make appointments in their electorate, be they with their constituents, with their wife and children or with their garden. </PARA>

All of those senators who were involved in the long and vigorous debate on that matter last week knew that there were very many complex matters relating to that legislation that could have benefited from due consideration by the Senate Standing Committee.

So of course this legislation is urgent. The reference of that Bill to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was a matter that did not need to be dealt with urgently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that the people of the Australian Capital Territory make that determination by referendum on 15 February. Certainly at this very late stage, only eight weeks from the election, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia should refrain from yet again imposing another electoral system on the people of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada has foreshadowed that she will put an alternative proposition by way of moving an amendment to provide for the election on 15 February to be conducted in accordance with the Senate process of election. I did not quite understand everything that Senator Sowada was saying. She retreated into quite technical language. At one stage she said that she praised the use of blunt, everyday language, but then went on to say something about down-loading the Senate system onto the ACT. I am afraid that she lost me there. I do not regard that as blunt, everyday language, at least not for somebody of my technological ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental principle to be observed is that on 15 February the people of the ACT will have the opportunity to make a choice between two systems, and that choice has been recommended by the unanimous decision of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I believe that is the way things should go on 15 February. It would be quite ridiculous to suggest that in this chamber on 12 December we should bring about a situation where on 15 February a completely different electoral system would be imposed on the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One criticism of the modified d'Hondt system, which in my observation as a resident, though not a citizen of the Territory, has some weight, is that the results of the last election engendered a lack of stability. I think that we need stability and predicability in the lead-up to the 15 February election. People are expecting the modified d'Hondt system to be employed. I believe that the political system here sorely requires stability in the several weeks that lie ahead as candidates conduct campaigns and the people move to elect their representatives. There are other features of the Bill which enable me to commend it wholeheartedly to the chamber, and I do so. </PARA>

<PARA>I have already canvassed the background to the amendment in my speech in the second reading debate, so I will not go over it in great detail again. It follows on from some of the remarks made by Senator Crowley about why, when a Bill is referred to a committee, subsequently there may be some amendments. In this instance, the reason for this amendment came after the Bill had been referred to the Committee, when an individual in the ACT, running for election, decided to name his political party in a way that I believe would be seen to deceive, mislead or confuse electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This became quite a dilemma for us. We felt that it should be corrected, there was a loophole in the Act and yet we could not be seen to be doing something that was retrospective. My great concern is that, this having happened in the ACT, because of the copycat effects we find in any society, it is almost inevitable that we will see it happen in other parts of Australia. I would like to see the Government at some stage change the Commonwealth Electoral Act to close this loophole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support this amendment moved by the Opposition. Like the Opposition and like the ACT community, I am most disturbed by the wilful and opportunistic actions of Mr Craig Duby in seeking to register the so-called Hare-Clark Independence Party, which is clearly an attempt to confuse voters. In supporting the Opposition's amendment, I would have preferred it to go further to have expressly defined the limits which ought to exist on the rights of a party if it registers its name and it is intended to be confused with an option being put in a referendum held concurrently with an election. That is perhaps a matter which should be taken up by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to be investigated in calmer times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vexatious party names are not alien to the ACT system. Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act a number of party names have been registered which have caused a great deal of concern to a number of parties in this place. I refer honourable senators to the Australian Ethnic Democrats, a party name that was registered via the Commission about two years ago; and the Rex Connor (Snr) Labor Party, a party name registered in my own State of New South Wales, which caused a great deal of heartburn to the Labor Party in Sussex Street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I think the Labor Party attempted to have that issue determined by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was unsuccessful in having that party name overturned. With respect to the Australian Ethnic Democrats, we were also unsuccessful in our appeal to the Commission to have that party name overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of vexatious party names does need to be addressed and the Democrats would certainly support any amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act which cleared up this issue in respect of Federal elections. I think the Australian Electoral Commission could exercise a little more discretion in its acceptance of party names, and a little more judgment as to what is acceptable under the Act and not simply refer to it as a political issue. This amendment has the full support of the Australian Democrats. We would not support any retrospective notion of deregistering the vexatious party that has caused so much concern in this election, given our general opposition to the principle of retrospectivity, but we are happy to support the amendment moved by the Opposition to ensure that this does not happen again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government rejects this amendment. There are great dangers associated with it. It would vest in the Electoral Commission a very wide discretion which would require it to exercise very subjective judgment as to whether a particular name or label to be attached to a political group was, in the terms of the amendment, mischievous, vexatious or likely to deceive, mislead or confuse. It seems to me that the amendment would vest in a non-elected, admittedly independent, group of officials of high integrity, no doubt, a terrible burden in the run-up to an election in the democratic system, to determine where the borderline lay between these criteria that are being put forward as frivolous, vexatious or mischievous, or likely to deceive, mislead or confuse.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has been tried. There were attempts to ask the Electoral Commission not to permit the name `Democratic Labor Party' to be used, possibly on the grounds that it was not really democratic or possibly on the grounds it was not really labour, in the same way that the National Party might not be regarded as truly national or the Australian Democrats might not be regarded as really deserving that title. As for the Liberals, masquerading under a title which has so much honour attached to it in the English sense, I find that something that I would immediately take to the Electoral Commission if this provision were available to allow me to challenge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee should think very seriously as to whether it will put in the hands of the Commission the task of deciding whether a particular label or name attached to a political group is likely to vex. Would it vex citizens, other citizens, some citizens, members of the Commission or the reasonable voter? How does one judge this? There is the question of the term `mischievous'. According to the Oxford dictionary, `mischievous' means having harmful effects. How does one judge whether a particular name has a harmful effect? It is almost incapable of application in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I believe that the disqualification of names which are likely to deceive, mislead or confuse would also be highly uncertain. The Electoral Commission advises that at the moment the provisions relating to confusion have a very precise focus. Confusion must be with the name of a parliamentary party or registered political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the proposed provisions would have no position in their operation. Any name which gave rise to a likelihood of any form of confusion would be prohibited. As I say, just in interjection and in somewhat light-hearted banter, it nevertheless could be claimed, as it was claimed concerning the Democratic Labor Party, that the name is likely to deceive, mislead or confuse. I believe that, as I say, we already have some political history of an attempt to use such a claim to disqualify a major political group which was then formed within the Australian political scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the inherent difficulty of finding precision enough in such an important matter as refusing registration to a group of Australians who wish to put themselves forward to the electors, I also ask honourable senators to think about the way in which appeals to the AAT would operate. They are really casting an impossible burden on the Commission and the AAT in a way which will not in the end serve our democratic processes and which will allow somebody, either the Commission or AAT members, to determine the form of posture in name by which certain groups of Australian citizens present themselves to electors for their consideration during an election campaign. That is a very dangerous power to put into the hands of unelected officials. I certainly urge the Committee to reject this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like briefly to respond to Senator Tate. I am no legal man but Senator Tate is. At the risk of being repetitive, I indicated in my speech at the second reading stage that I had sought some views on these two words, `frivolous' and `vexation', because exactly the same sort of argument was used in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is&mdash;and I am sure Senator Tate, being of distinguished legal background, would know&mdash;that those two words are longstanding terms in the law. They are clearly understood by the courts and they are used extensively in Australian statutes. During my speech on the second reading I gave the example that the term `frivolous' occurs at least 62 times in Commonwealth statutes and the term `vexatious' occurs at least 77 times. So how the Government can take the point of view it has taken is beyond me. I have some great difficulties with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a decision that has to be made by the reasonable people in the Australian Electoral Commission, who are independent.

I did not hook it in directly to referendums because I believed it would have limited it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that we are very familiar with such terms as `the vexatious litigant'. The terms `frivolous' and `vexatious' do occur in many statutes. Of course, these terms are used in the practice of the courts, but I cannot think of an instance where they are not related to behaviour. They are designed to describe a form of behaviour which vexes the court or other persons, or a form of behaviour which is trivial or frivolous. They are not used in relation to names. The honourable senator is saying that a name can somehow be characterised as `vexatious' or `frivolous' and, therefore, ought to lead to a group of Australians who are citizens and who have a perfect right to band together in order to present themselves to the electorate being unable to do so under that name.

<PARA>I have already said quite a deal about these amendments in my speech in the second reading debate and I do not propose to repeat that. However, at this point I would like to pay tribute to those who drafted what turned out to be a most complicated series of amendments to this Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill. I would just like to respond to Senator Reid's comment that we are proposing a new system. We are not proposing a new system;  we are proposing a system that is well-known not only to voters of the ACT but to voters all around Australia and which has been around for a very great deal of time. Everyone understands how it works; it is not a new suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of placing this system into the ACT for this election, my colleague Senator Robert Bell has informed me that he attempted to do this in June this year. It was rejected on that occasion when the Senate had plenty of time before the election to move amendments and to clear up what to everybody is quite plainly a most iniquitous and unfair electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to some of the remarks made at the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on this Bill, I was the one who referred the Bill to the Standing Committee, chaired by Senator Crowley. The timeframe given to us under the Standing Orders of the Senate was very tight and there was only one day on which a hearing could be held before the date to report to the Senate. This was something that was discussed at the Committee hearing that I attended. I do agree with Senator Campbell that it was a very tight time schedule. A number of honourable senators could not attend. It was suggested at the Committee hearing that perhaps the procedures need to be adjusted to ensure that adequate time is provided for notification of Bills to committees so that sufficient time can be set aside for hearings and reporting. I put it to the Committee that that is something that needs to happen arising out of this particular event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator Crowley's remarks that we did not raise the issue of downloading the Senate style system into this Bill at that hearing, that is true, we did not. The Bill itself dealt with the so-called patriation of the system to the ACT and not with this issue specifically. But I make the point that my amendments were drafted upon receipt of notification of the motion moved by the ACT Legislative Assembly on 21 November this year which, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate stage, called on the Federal Parliament to enact the Senate electoral system for the 1992 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we discussed this Bill at the Committee hearing we did not have any idea that this motion had been passed by the Assembly and, as I said, written notification of this was provided to me some several days after the Committee hearing. It was most unfortunate that we did not have an opportunity at the Committee hearing to discuss the wider issues that had been raised by the ACT Assembly. I make the point again that my amendments to this Bill tonight are a direct response to the letter and the resolution of the Assembly and seeks to enact the will of the people as expressed by the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a couple of remarks in relation to the amendments. Amendment No. 2 in relation to proposed new section 20 on page 1 of the circulated amendments essentially seeks to provide that the integrity of the Senate proportional representation system will be maintained and cannot be changed by regulation. The amendment on page 3 of the circulated amendments relating to paragraph 239(1)(b) provides for optional preferential voting to ensure that the minimum number of squares numbered is one less than the number of members to be elected at the election. Given that there were so many candidates at the last election&mdash;some 117 candidates, I understand&mdash;it would of course be very difficult for us to be suggesting to the voters of the ACT that they number all squares below the line, as is currently the case with Senate elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those remarks, I simply commend these amendments to the Committee. As I said, I have already made extensive reference to them in my speech at the second reading stage. I remind the Committee once again that, in moving these amendments, I am simply acting on behalf of the ACT Legislative Assembly which has requested this Parliament, by way of letter to the President, that this be done. I leave it with the members of the Government and the Opposition to go back to their members, their Party members and their own parliamentary representatives in the ACT, to explain why they will not support my amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was trying to put the reasons for opposing the amendment in very short form, having dealt with the arguments at somewhat greater length in my response to the second reading debate. I believe that my remarks as to why this Parliament should not impose another electoral system on the ACT have to be seen in the context of the next eight weeks. In other words, in my more extended remarks in the second reading response, I was relating it to the fact that it is now 12 December and the election is to be held on 15 February.

None of those excuses hold up because the simple fact is that this matter has been canvassed over a period of many months, if not years. But whether such a suggestion about time is an excuse or not, it is not a reason for passing up this chance and ignoring the ACT legislature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several reasons why we should refuse to deliver another dose of d'Hondt to the ACT. They have been well canvassed by Senator Harradine. I refer to the unanimous resolution of the ACT Assembly, and also to the unanimity that was reached in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which again Senator Harradine explained very well to us. Matched to that unanimity, I defy anybody to stand in this place and identify for me an enthusiast, or even an apologist, for d'Hondt. Even Minister Simmons was not enthusiastic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine remembers, I say with admiration, the historical perspective of this matter. I remember the recent past perspective, but enough of it. Getting on for a year and a half ago I remember waiting anxiously for Minister Simmons to deliver the format of the referendum and the style of the election which is to take place in February next year. The procrastination attached to the deliberations of the Minister frustrated me, and I know it frustrated those who wanted to see delivered to the ACT something other than d'Hondt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister himself was not enthusiastic about d'Hondt: he wanted to modify it, he wanted to de-modify it and he wanted to modify it in another way. There were several different versions. The on-again off-again proposals for the legislation went on throughout 1990 and now throughout 1991 we have had a litany of missed opportunities to accept something like the Senate system&mdash;opportunities which were distinctly canvassed and distinctly described in the letter from the Australian Electoral Commission which Senator Sowada referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have no more nonsense about there not being enough time. Senator Harradine's proposal illustrates that the time remaining between now and the ACT election cannot be used as an excuse to ignore the propositions contained in Senator Sowada's amendments. I think people are scared away from the Senate system because it might actually work. The Senate system has worked to deliver senators such as Senator McMullan and Senator Reid to this place. The people of the ACT are familiar with the system; the people of the ACT obviously make good decisions when they are using it. If there is any criticism of the Senate system, it certainly has not reached the Democrats in the way that the criticisms of the d'Hondt system have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fail to see any reasons why the Senate system should not be implemented. The issue of time is a petty excuse; it does not hold up, because there has been sufficient time not only to see the merits of the Senate system, as it could be applied to the ACT, but to actually prepare the amendments. Senator Sowada has caused that to happen. The amendments are here in front of us this morning; they are ready to roll. Senator Harradine has suggested a way of cutting the Gordian knot, which seems to scare off many of those who have spoken. </PARA>

I recall that in 1988 the Labor Party in New South Wales, under Premier Unsworth, enacted some very major changes to the State electoral laws.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pointing out that a political arrangement had been arrived at in late autumn whereby this Parliament determined that on the day of the poll to be held for the second election of the Legislative Assembly a referendum would also be held. The arrangement which Senator Harradine is putting forward would have the effect of vesting power in the ACT Assembly to determine an electoral method without the benefit of the referendum results. Clearly, it was envisaged that the referendum precede a vote by the Assembly on the electoral system which should apply in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further advised, as a matter of the consequential effects of the proposal that Senator Harradine is putting forward, that as soon as the ACT Assembly enacts an electoral law the Australian Electoral Commission loses the power to run ACT elections. Therefore, if the proposal were adopted, the ACT would have to set up an electoral law and an electoral administration in eight weeks. That is why I was trying to relate my perhaps general remarks about democracy and so on to the actual timetable we are facing. </PARA>

So it is a matter of various principles and the timetable and chronology which led me to say that the Government would not be supporting this proposal. That is quite apart from the chaos that would occur in the ACT if the Legislative Assembly at this stage, the eve of Christmas, were asked to sit and devise an electoral system that ought to apply to the election on 15 February. It is a burden that should not be placed on that Assembly. </PARA>

The ACT legislature does not have to sit again. A unanimous resolution has been presented to the Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that the ACT would have to set up an electoral system, an electoral law, without the benefit of the referendum is also nonsense, because that is precisely what we are imposing upon the ACT electorate now. The people have said resoundingly that they do not want it. We are imposing upon the ACT electorate a system which has been discredited, dishonoured, dismissed and is not required by the ACT electorate. Here we are shying away from the opportunity to deliver to that electorate this system which is admired, respected and with which they are familiar. </PARA>

So if we are going to talk about useless exercises, let us look at that and recognise what it is. What is being proposed by Senator Harradine is something with which the ACT elector can identify, something that has been requested, something with which they are familiar, and something which does not have the resounding objection that d'Hondt has. </PARA>

We should at least give it the opportunity, as it has requested in its letter, to determine the method by which members of the Assembly are chosen. The amendments are here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, we will not support this amendment. The reason why we will not support it was spelt out very clearly during the second reading debate. I will just touch on one matter. A couple of months ago we passed a Bill in this place which amended the ACT electoral system. It followed many of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which was chaired by my colleague Dr Michael Wooldridge. Many of the recommendations were taken up and included in that Bill. That was the opportunity for the Australian Democrats to propose that an entirely separate system be introduced&mdash;a system that will last one election. That has been repeated over and over again by honourable senators in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

They come into this place and talk about democracy tonight, but they would sacrifice democracy and freedom of expression on the altar of self-interest. They sold themselves out. They put their hands in the pockets of the taxpayer and in the pockets of the television stations. Everyone in Australia knows that they did it. They come in here and take the moral high ground.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell did not tell us that. He has given the impression that this was a unanimous resolution and he has tried to mislead the Committee in that regard, which is typical of the way he has operated tonight. I refer to you, Mr Chairman, rather than be distracted by Senator Bell and his misleading of the Committee. That motion was defeated and the original motion was carried on the voices. That is the background. It is not as though the Democrats are able to present to this chamber a unanimous resolution of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory, and that is the impression they have tried to give to this Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Sowada obviously was not listening to me when I said that, under this legislation, if the Legislative Assembly of the ACT passes an electoral law, then under other provisions, the Australian Electoral Commission loses all power and cannot be vested with the power to conduct the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada went on about the way in which the Australian Electoral Commission, being conversant with the Senate system, would be able to conduct the election in the ACT by 15 February.

It would create absolute chaos if Senator Harradine's amendment were carried. For that reason, I believe the Committee should reject it. </PARA>

This backs up what the Minister was saying before, and that is that yesterday was an historic day&mdash;the High Court upheld the legitimacy of the transfer of powers to the ACT Assembly. All I am saying is that, if that is the case, let us celebrate the day and provide the ACT Assembly with its full rights as from now. Those rights would include the determination of the type of system that is best suited to the Territory for the 1992 election. It does not prevent the referendum proceeding.

I simply suggest to him that he should go back to his Labor colleagues in the ACT Assembly and ask them, if they objected to this motion so strongly, why they did not call a division and thereby show this Parliament that the motion did not have the full support of the ACT Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, Senator O'Chee is proposing to talk about the summary interim report of the Australian Securities Commission on certain matters to do with Estate Mortgage. The reason why it is called a summary interim report is that it was vetted by the DPP to ensure that there be no prejudice to any forthcoming legal proceedings&mdash;presumably criminal in this case, but there will be civil proceedings also, no doubt. I just ask Senator O'Chee to be exceedingly careful that he does not speculate beyond what is contained in that report and presented to the Parliament. If he does, he may unwittingly prejudice either a criminal trial or perhaps a civil proceeding&mdash;I do not see quite how one could prejudice a civil proceeding, although I suppose it might affect the mind of a judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator O'Chee ought to be somewhat careful because, quite clearly, not only will the question of the trustees but also of the regulatory authorities at the time be the subject of the further full report which is foreshadowed. The interim report is called an interim report because it was thought that those who were meeting today as unit holders to determine the restructuring of the six trusts ought to have as much information as was prudently able to be put before them. I just put in that cautioning note to Senator O'Chee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Minister Tate for that. I assure him that that will not occur, but there are a couple of matters of detail that relate to these matters that need to be discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas that are indicated in the summary interim report is the possibility that the trustees committed a breach of trust in executing supplemental trust deeds in relation to the six trusts, subsequently disposing of mortgage securities previously held by the trust and providing to assignees priority ahead of the interests of the trust. The question has been raised during this day as to how this had the effect of diluting the asset backing of the trust. I shall take only two examples to show how this was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first relates to a company called Janmont Pty Ltd. Janmont Pty Ltd. owns the old Myer building on Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. I understand that, after the execution of the supplemental trust deeds amending the original trust deeds, Mercantile Mutual Insurance received a priority over the trust in respect of $25m loaned against the property. As at 30 June 1991 the trusts were owed $54.5m in principal and interest and MMI was owed $32.5m in principal and interest. I make these comments because they are derived from material provided by the fund managers or trustees and, therefore, are based on documents that are already on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is a company called Ozton Pty Ltd, which holds a number of properties in Sydney. These include 20-22 O'Connell Street and corner Bligh and Hunter Streets, over which the trusts have mortgages. After the amendment of the trust deeds it is believed that Hongkong Bank received the benefit of first ranking charges, securing $40m owed to it. This pushed the trusts into second place. The current trustees expect to write off the total amount owing to them on these properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the overall position of the trusts, the effect was that, in total, as much as $209m of assets may have  been  given  away</PARA>
<PARA>through these deals. This figure is disclosed in material prepared by the new trustees which shows the trusts will receive only $349.9m from the sale of assets, whereas the trust could look forward to recovering $558.4m if the priority interests had not been granted to the banks and other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can see, the effect of these transactions was to diddle, wittingly or otherwise, the trusts by giving certain banks and financial institutions first go at the trusts' assets. There was no way the trusts could stay afloat by diluting the value of the assets they held, and it was foolish to think otherwise. Obviously, it is a reflection not just upon the trustee company but also upon the oversight of the National Companies and Securities Commission in approving the supplemental trust deeds that made this possible. </PARA>
