<TITLE>AIDEX Exhibition</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>  The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>  That attention is drawn to Australia's location and involvement in the Asia/Pacific region where there exists a number of actual and potential conflicts, along with several countries which can ill afford to pay for the importation of military equipment yet feel obliged to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>  That Australia is increasing its role in the arms trade in this region, and in particular, it is supporting and participating in AIDEX `91. The arms trade is detrimental to Australians affected by the diversion of public money away from health, education, social welfare, and is an integral factor in the oppression and poverty of people of the Asia/Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA>  The petitioners therefore appeal to the Australian Parliament to:</PARA>
<PARA>    Stop all military aid and training to governments engaged in repression of their own people</PARA>
<PARA>    Direct those Government Departments participating in AIDEX `91, i.e. Defence, Austrade, Industry, Technology and Commerce, to cancel their bookings for space at the exhibition and withdraw their support for AIDEX `91.</PARA>
<PARA>    Redirect all monies currently being used in promoting the arms industry to socially useful research, development and production.</PARA>
<PARA>    Explore the possibilities of setting up an Agency for the development of techniques for conflict resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>    Increase overseas aid to counteract the reduction since 1983/4.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tobacco Advertising</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:  the humble petition of the undersigned  citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>  That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio.

<TITLE>Medicare:  Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>  Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469,274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Telecom:  0055 Services</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1) Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.</PARA>

<PARA>  That we call upon Honourable Senators to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise electoral material on radio and television, believing such bans amount to a denial of free speech, an unfair advantage to an incumbent government, and a denial of information to print-handicapped and other Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>AIDEX Exhibition</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.</PARA>
<PARA>  And we, your humble petitioners will as in duty bound, ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens shows:</PARA>
<PARA>  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA>    gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association;</PARA>
<PARA>    gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5;</PARA>
<PARA>    fails to recognise the prior right of parents to determine the education of their children;</PARA>

<TITLE>Aboriginal and Islander Housing</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Petition of the undersigned concerned citizens of the State of Queensland respectfully showeth that the report of the parliamentary committee of public works of the forty-sixth parliament concerning its inquiry into Aboriginal and islander housing--the future, should be rejected on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1) The Committee failed to adequately consult the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders people of Queensland in order to obtain their views by failing to advise details of existing guidelines for funding of housing, failing to adequately publicise the committee inquiry through the established Aboriginal and Islander networks.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The terms of reference were unsatisfactory insofar as they do not address the vital issue of tenant ownership which creates no incentive for self-determination and not enough time was given for the communities to study the recommendations of the infrastructure on Aboriginal housing as addressed by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Senior administrators of the Departments of Housing and Local Government will be delegated the responsibility of expenditure of funds, re-enforcing their existing mandate over administration and financial management and vetoing any decisions made by the Housing Advisory Council, who will be responsible to receive and advise policy development and implementation and oversee the menial day to day activities such as:</PARA>
<PARA>    (a)  Rent assessment</PARA>
<PARA>    (b)  Tenancy neglect</PARA>
<PARA>    (c)  Tenancy agreement based on cultural differences between land lord and tenant</PARA>
<PARA>    (d)  Tenant unions</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) No Aboriginal housing trust exists in other States under the Aboriginal Housing Rentals program will mean no economic base or self management for urban and rural blacks and will eventually mainstream tenants and homes, creating further funding under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement and an endless financial resource institution for the Department of Housing and Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Parliament of Queensland will reject the report of the Parliamentary Committee of Public Works and conduct further consultations with the Aboriginal and Torres Islander people of Queensland so that a report may be tabled which genuinely addresses the housing needs of Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA>  (a)  notes that in 1985 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) publicly expressed his commitment to the future well-being of the people of Australia when he made two statements in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>      (i)  `What this country has needed desperately for years now is a Government which is prepared to face up to what has to be done to get this economy in proper shape', and</PARA>
<PARA>      (ii)  `. . . if the broad-based consumption tax is brought in, those increasing numbers of people in the community who by the use of clever lawyers and accountants have avoided the payment of any tax on their income and also in the absence of a consumption tax, aren't paying any tax on the spending of that income';</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  recognises that the mass of Australians, the ordinary taxpayers, pay a far higher proportion of their income in direct and indirect taxation than they did when the Prime Minister first made the statements, resulting in an even more desperate need to get our economy in `proper shape' than it was when the Prime Minister was prepared to acknowledge our precarious predicament in 1985; and therefore</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.17 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Before the adjournment last night I was speaking on the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill. I was saying that the Bill deals with the liabilities of carriers in relation to goods carried at sea. I traced the history of this, going back to the first of the Hague Conventions in 1924, which tried to lay down some conditions as to where liability rested with respect to the carriage of goods.  I said that there had been two amendments to the Hague Convention--the Visby Convention and the SDR Convention. We now have a new protocol before us which, rather than amending the Hague Rules, sets out an entirely new system under which liability will be assessed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I also pointed out that only some of the trading nations have supported the protocols that we have had up to the present. While the present Hamburg Convention has been agreed to for some little while, there is still a great shortage of support in the world community for countries to sign the convention. I wish to develop that theme. I mentioned that the Visby Rules, in 1968, were the first modification of the Hague Rules for some while. They were followed by the SDR Protocol amending the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading which was signed in Brussels on 21 December 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to the relevance of the Bill to Australia. The Australian shipping trade is largely invisible. People know that both passengers and goods move by air and road, but the whole subject of shipping in Australia is a relatively invisible operation. I have a personal interest in shipping because I grew up in small boats and yachts. When I was an undergraduate I worked as a seaman on the coastal trade and used to lump cargo. I think I am the only person in the Australian Parliament today who has actually been a wharf labourer. Some members of the Labor Party may have had union positions in sheds on the wharves, but I used to actually lump cargo. Furthermore, I did it for no pay and was never a unionist--fortunately. I have retained a residual interest in both the maritime trade and the wharf labourers' operations ever since. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are in the carriage of goods by sea some real risks which are not always recognised. Recently the loss of an oil tanker off the Western Australian coast attracted a lot of publicity. Having spoken to pilots on the Australian coast, I know that there is a high level of concern about the standards of some of the ships operating into Australian ports and through Australian waters, and the procedures that the Australian Government has to adopt to supervise and correct those deficiencies. We have always had inspections of lifeboats and lifesaving gear, and many a ship has been failed on those grounds and been denied sailing rights until those deficiencies have been corrected. I think it is proper that we do that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also had a marked concern about the conditions on board ship. Although I sympathise with those crews which are being exploited, I do not believe that it is the Australian Government's business to interfere in the terms and conditions under which crews are employed on overseas ships as opposed to being concerned about the seaworthiness and the lifesaving gear on the ships. My view, having spoken to pilots, is that the inspection procedures in Australia are nowhere near as comprehensive and as rigid as those which the Americans operate, for example in their coastguard, which has power to go on board a ship and demand that it be in a seaworthy state before it leaves port.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am mindful of an incident that occurred in Townsville some weeks ago. A tug skipper complained about hull plating on an overseas ship in Townsville harbour, and the ship was taken to Singapore for repairs before it could be loaded. That illustrates my point that there is room to improve the Australian Government's surveillance capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Lest people think that the recent incident where an oil tanker lost its bow off the Western Australian coast is isolated, I point out that I was reading a publication recently that contained an editorial which began by dealing with a passenger liner off the South African coast. In one sense the incident reported on is quite hilarious. The Greek master of that ship was reported to be one of the first people to leave the vessel. He and his dog got on a helicopter, allegedly on the grounds that when they got ashore he would be able to supervise the rescue facilities even more efficiently than if he stayed on board. It is a creative thought with respect to the responsibility of a captain of a ship. When questioned about this, he allegedly said that the order to abandon ship applied to him just as much as it applied to the passengers, and if they wanted to do so they were welcome to stay on board the sinking ship. Although that is a rather humorous incident, it illustrates some of the variable standards that are applied with respect to the responsibility for the operation of ships. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we look at the Western Australian situation, we find that eight ships have been lost there in the recent past, in fact since July 1988. In July 1988 the Singa Sea, under a Philippines flag, sank with 18 crew on board. Also in July 1988 the Korean Star, under a Korean flag, was wrecked off Cape Cuvier. The Alexander P, a Panamanian ship, in March 1990 sank in the Indian Ocean with 25 crew on board. The Sanko Harvest, again a Panamanian ship, sank off Esperance in February 1991. The Manila Transporter, a Philippines ship, went missing with all its crew in 1991. The Mineral Diamond, a Hong Kong ship, went missing, and then the Kirki suffered a fractured bow. Since then the Dacyang Honey, a Korean ship, in August 1991 went missing off the Western Australian coast. Eight ships have been lost in a relatively short period. This reinforces my argument that not all ships entering Australian ports and harbours meet the standards that we would deem requisite for safety for maritime trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that we have not had any serious accidents with Australian flag ships for many years. I cannot remember when we had the last Australian flag ship incident--it might have been when the Anro went on the sand at Caloundra about 15 years ago, and that was hardly a serious disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is quite a degree of public interest in this. Of course, the environmentalists get into it and worry, with some degree of legitimacy, about what might happen if we had a big oil spill. The classic case of that which is always advanced is the Barrier Reef area. There are good reasons to demand that we have adequate standards of seaworthiness and seaman-like practice in the operation of ships so that we minimise the risk of accidents. We cannot really eliminate accidents. Regrettably, something will happen some time off the Australian coast that will cause us a great deal of damage but, by careful thought and the enforcement of standards, the probability of that happening can be reduced to the absolute minimum. </PARA>
<PARA>  With reference to the Barrier Reef, it is often said by environmentalists that, if ships were sent outside the reef and far to the east, we would not have any problem at all. Anyone who has been in those waters knows that for about 10 months of the year there are 25-knot winds either from the north-east or the south-east. Any accident outside the reef would certainly lead to an oil slick washing onto the seaward side of the reef. In my judgment it would be infinitely better if ships operated in the constricted waters between the reef and the coastline, where the probability is that a slick will go onto the shoreline rather than onto the reef. That is a divergence, but it emphasises the point that I am making that concern for the operation of ships is a necessary duty of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  What are some of the shortcomings of the Hague Rules which have led to the creation of this Bill? Shippers felt that it was necessary to amend them. One of the principal concerns is that the responsibility of the carrier is only tackle to tackle, and that the original carrier is not liable for transhipped goods and is exempt from liability for navigational error, mismanagement of the ship and fire, unless the latter is caused by the carrier's fault. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other criticisms and concerns are that claims are time-barred unless suit is brought within one year, and that fundamental breaches of contract are not provided for--for example, undeclared cargo, unreasonable deviations, gross negligence or wilful recklessness. In particular, the shippers felt that the current rules concerning the liability burden rest largely with the shipper rather than the shipowner, who is the carrier and who provides the service. </PARA>
<PARA>  These matters were addressed by the 1978 United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, which led to the formation of the Hamburg Rules. As I said before, these do not have universal application yet amongst the trading nations. Certainly, none of Australia's major trading partners have as yet acceded to the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's maritime trade is very important to us. We are not one of the great shipowners of the world, but we are still a major player in world shipping. In 1985-86 world seaborne trade totalled 3,385 million tonnes. Only about 8 per cent of this tonnage was in trade to and from Australia. Australian flag carriers represented 0.6 per cent of world tonnage in 1985-86 and carried 4.18 per cent of Australia's seaborne exports and 5.8 per cent of seaborne imports. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the great topical issues at the present time is the balance of payments position, which under this Government has blown out disastrously. We are losing on average $1,500m a month through spending more than we earn as a nation. It is a popular misconception that we are not exporting enough to cover those losses. Looking at the balance of payments figures, in a general sense, imports roughly balance exports. It is true that we might be down a few hundred million dollars one month and up a few hundred million dollars the next month, but the great loss on our balance of payment comes from what used to be called, when I was an undergraduate, the invisibles--services such as insurance, shipping and transport, services which we do not have in this country and for which we have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, one cost that is now of major importance in the invisibles is the payment for the borrowing of money. Something like 20 per cent of our exports now go to pay the interest on the borrowings we have made because of the huge balance of payments deficit that we have. I argue that it is very important for Australia to address the area known as the invisibles and to stop borrowing money in the first case if it is possible to do so, cognisant of the fact that we have to pay our debts at some time. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also important for us in the insurance field, and particularly in the transport field, to retain and maximise Australian ownership. As only something like 4 per cent of Australia's trade is going in Australian bottoms, I think we ought to be working to lift that to as high a fraction as we can. </PARA>

If the Minister agrees with me, I hope he will overcome some of the enormous work practice disabilities, both on the waterfront and in the Seamen's Union, that make it impossible for Australian owners to compete. At the end of the day, the reason we do not own the ships is simply that it is not possible to earn an income out of them. It is only because of the loss-making of operations like the Australian National Line, supported directly or indirectly by the taxpayers' dollar, that we own any ships at all. Let us address the inefficiencies in the labour market which make it impossible for Australian shipowners to earn a living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   There is not much more I would like to say about the Bill, except I would like to make reference to the amendments which were circulated a few minutes before I rose to speak. I indicated at the outset of my speech that I will be supporting the amendments to be moved by Senator Macdonald. I think that the amendment to be moved by the Government, although I have not had time to consider it, goes some way towards meeting the Opposition's proposals. My only comment on it at this stage is that I cannot understand why it is so late coming around, given the fact that the Committee that looked at this Bill made reference to precisely the point that the Government is now moving to amend. At the moment, my view is to support the amendments to be  moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>   In summary, the difference between the existing regimes and the proposals in this Bill is very important. Not everyone in the industry agrees with the proposals in this Bill, but everyone in the industry agrees that something has to be done to change the present situation. This Bill is a significant move down that path to satisfy their concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to address some of the concerns raised in the second reading debate. I particularly acknowledge Senator MacGibbon's very positive contribution to this debate, which I would like to respond to. Senator MacGibbon raised rightly the very serious problem that is alarming world shipping, which is the totally unacceptable loss of large bulk carriers which has become something of an international scandal. The International Maritime Organisation is, in fact, treating the matter with a great deal of seriousness and is conducting research into why we are losing so many of these ships with, as Senator MacGibbon correctly pointed out, a very high loss of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the things that are largely overlooked, certainly in terms of the press reports on these incidents, is indeed that loss of human life. People concentrate, understandably enough, on the very serious problems that are posed to the environment by these incidents. What is often ignored is, I regret to say, that seamen are going to sea in ships--these days, large ships--which are inadequately provided with lifesaving equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator MacGibbon was concerned about the extent to which Australia is addressing the problem of inspecting these ships, and he compared the regime here with that of the United States. We have the same powers as exist in the United States, under the same international conventions to which we are a signatory, to detain ships and to prevent them from sailing or loading cargoes if they are found to be deficient. </PARA>
<PARA>  We carry out inspections on about 25 per cent of all of the foreign flag ships that visit Australian ports which, by international standards, is a very high percentage. However, I take on board the concern that Senator MacGibbon raised because we are addressing the matter of increasing that surveillance. But to do that will obviously require significant additional resources. We are addressing the question of what additional resources will be required and how those resources will be provided; in other words, who will pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are also addressing the question of the actual inspections themselves. Here, as in the United States, the inspections are largely paper inspections. Inspectors go on board the ship to find out whether the ship is carrying the necessary certification from the class societies to attest to its seaworthiness and to have a look principally at the lifesaving equipment on board the ship. </PARA>
<PARA>  I regret to say that, of the 25 per cent of the ships that we have inspected in the last 12 months, we have had to detain 60 per cent for serious difficulties. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I regret to say that Senator MacGibbon's information is correct. Even more regrettable is the very significant loss of human life that has occurred. Hundreds of seamen have been lost at sea in the past two years from these bulk carriers. In fact the last one went down only a few months ago off the coast of Western Australia. Only two of the crew survived and more than 20 seamen died in that incident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If the market worked perfectly, which it never has and never will, these incidents would not happen because the class societies that carry out the inspections on these ships would provide proper advice to insurance companies, which would then either lift the premiums to such a level that it would be impossible for the ship to be covered, or they would simply refuse cover on these ships. </PARA>
<PARA>  Regrettably, what is obviously happening is that internationally this is simply being factored into the equations. The premiums are simply being raised rather than addressing the real problem of trying to correct the serious deficiencies in these ships. One of the real concerns is that half of the 60 per cent of the ships that were inspected and detained in the past 12 months were detained because of failures in the lifesaving equipment on board. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have to say, as I said publicly after the loss of the bow of the Kirki, that it is bad enough for a shipowner to send a ship to sea in structurally deficient condition but it is totally scandalous to send a ship to sea knowing that even if it gets into trouble the basic lifesaving equipment on board the ship is not capable of saving the lives of the people on board that ship. Regrettably, I have to confirm the accuracy of Senator MacGibbon's comments this morning. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is currently awaiting completion of the maritime inspector's report on the Kirki. We expect that to occur within the next month. I am heartened by the concern expressed by Senator MacGibbon on this matter and, upon receipt of that report, I will bring it to Parliament. It will probably be worthy of a debate. We intend to support the actions that the IMO is taking by addressing this matter with the shipowners, the class societies that carry out the inspections, and the insurance companies that provide the cover. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will address the problem on every possible front by whatever means are available to us in order to apply whatever influence Australia can muster so as to redress what is becoming an international maritime scandal. It has almost reached the stage where a latter day Mr Plimsoll is needed to redress the problem. All I can do is express my appreciation to Senator MacGibbon for the comments he made about what is a serious problem and assure him that the Government will act to do whatever is in our power to try to redress it. </PARA>
<PARA>  So far as the Great Barrier Reef is concerned, again I am forced into a position of agreeing with Senator MacGibbon--that is twice in one morning. Options were put to the Government to take ships outside the reef because it was asserted that this would be safer. In fact, it would be horrendously more dangerous to the reef to do so. As Senator MacGibbon has said, it is not only true that the weather conditions are atrocious outside the reef, but also the area outside the reef is largely uncharted and is therefore considerably more dangerous to shipping. The result, as Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, of a major accident outside the reef would be as disastrous to the reef as if it happened inside the reef because of prevailing winds and tides. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rather than accept that option, the Government moved successfully--I think it is the first time it has been done--within the IMO to provide a special classification, under the international conventions for the Great Barrier Reef as a special area, which requires compulsory pilotage on all ships in excess of 70 metres in length and on all tankers, irrespective of their size. That new regime for compulsory pilotage I am pleased to say came into effect on the first of this month. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will now address some of the other matters raised. Senator Powell noted in her contribution yesterday that charter parties are not automatically covered by the construction and jurisdiction provisions of clause 11 of the Bill as they were previously under section 9 of the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924. The reason for that is that the construction and jurisdiction provisions of clause 11 of the Bill have been brought into line with the way in which the charter parties are treated in the amended Hague Rules. Article 5 of the amended Hague Rules provides that the convention is not applicable to charter parties unless a bill of lading is issued under a charter party. Australian shippers have the right--under article 3, paragraph 3, of the amended Hague Rules--to demand and receive a bill of lading. So it is in the hands of the shippers. The parties to a charter party can therefore, at the shipper's insistence, be covered by the amended Hague regime simply by issuing a bill of lading which they have a right to demand under the rules. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Macdonald in his speech yesterday raised concerns about the possibility of significant amounts of insurance--I think the figure he quoted was $80m--leaving Australia and going overseas. It is simply not possible to make that assertion; we do not know whether it will. I, personally, have enough confidence in the professionalism of the Australian insurance industry--which, in international terms, I can assure Senator Macdonald is no slouch when it comes to professionalism--in matching any need to provide a commercially acceptable package under these new rules. Senator Macdonald does not have much confidence in the ability of the Australian insurance industry to do this; I do. I think it has demonstrated its expertise many times over the years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is in fact what Senator Macdonald said, and the Hansard record attests to that; I have it in front of me. I am saying that Australia has to become more internationally competitive in all sectors of its economy. That is something which the Opposition is constantly harping on and the Government asserts that we must do that as well. I can assure Senator Macdonald that that applies as much to the insurance industry as it does to any other industry in Australia. I have no doubt that if the Australian insurance industry finds itself becoming uncompetitive under these changed arrangements then it will adjust its commercial practices to ensure that it can compete with whatever challenge is mounted by overseas insurance companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, the key to this legislation and to the amendment which the Government will move is that, as Senator Powell said correctly yesterday and as Senator MacGibbon has also asserted this morning, we are a shipper nation and not a ship-owning nation. There is no question, or indeed any argument from the Opposition, that it is undeniably to the benefit of Australia that we agree to the Hamburg Rules being applied because they will benefit the shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was astonished to hear Senator Macdonald's last point. He asserted yesterday that I had given a commitment in the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to provide a prescriptive arrangement to act as a trigger for our trading partners. I must have been at another committee meeting because I did precisely the reverse, as the Hansard record of the Committee will show. I refer to the Hansard of the proceedings of the Committee on 22 August 1991 where, in response to that request to put in a prescriptive trigger, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have got a very strong objection indeed to putting in some artificial trigger based on the commercial appreciation we might have today and trying to second guess something that might be the situation three years from now. </PARA>
<PARA>I then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But I am happy to agree to a sunset clause as long as it is in general rather than specific terms. </PARA>
<PARA>I then went on to give an undertaking to the Committee, which I will now discharge. When we agreed that we would not include any reference to the need for consultation in the legislation, I agreed to make a statement on the record as to the Government's intentions in this matter. I formally prepared this statement so I could show it to honourable senators before the debate. I have gone one step further, as Senator Macdonald would note from the circulated Government amendment. As well as making this statement, I have also added clause 6 to the Government amendment, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A Proclamation must not be made under subsection (2) unless the Minister has consulted with, and given due consideration to the views expressed by, representatives nominated by shippers, cargo owners, carriers and ship owners.</PARA>
<PARA>For the benefit of the Senate, the Government will adopt this position: the Bill provides that the Hamburg Rules will be kept under review in order to determine the optimum time for implementation. I want to make it clear that the Government will not be moving to implement the Hamburg Rules until it is in the commercial interests of Australia to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  I cannot be prescriptive about future events, but I can say that there will be no moves towards implementation until the Hamburg Rules have come into force internationally and a sufficient number of our major trading partners have adopted or expressed an intention to adopt the Hamburg Rules as the basis for their marine cargo liability regimes. Any decision on the timing for implementation will also be made on the basis of a broad and comprehensive consultative process with representatives of shippers, cargo owners, carriers and shipowners. Therefore, the decision will not be taken lightly. It will be made after consideration and consultation in order to be in the best commercial interests of Australia. I do not think I could be much more categorical than that. In being as categorical as that and in putting that on the record, I am sure that members of the Opposition will accept that that is precisely what the Government will be bound to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  Reasonably enough, Senator MacGibbon raised at the end of his contribution the question of why the Government had only this morning circulated its amendment. As the Hansard will show, the Committee determined that we would agree to an amendment in the Committee that would provide for a situation where, if no proclamation was made before the expiration of three years, the Parliament would have an opportunity to consider the matter and review the situation and to proceed to ratify those sections of the Bill and put them into effect, or to continue the period of time or to repeal the sections of the Bill if so desired. We drafted such an amendment and circulated it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, under the unremitting and diligent chairmanship of Senator Cooney, brought to our attention a concern that it had. I thought it was a little bit tendentious and pernickety, but that is Senator Cooney; he is scrupulous in these matters. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will not respond to that. He is scrupulous in these matters. I took on board the concerns that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee expressed because I thought they were reasonable. The Parliamentary Counsel had drafted the amendment in strict accordance with the decision the Committee took. I think that is reasonable. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee pointed out that its concern was that there was a discretion provided in the amendment that the Government may consider and do certain things, and that that would leave a non-prescriptive result at the end of the line where something may or may not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I believe that Parliament is very much the master of its own destiny: this House certainly is, and there was no difficulty with that. But, in immediately agreeing to the concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, we redrafted the amendment to provide for a certain outcome, one way or the other, at the end of that period. Senator Powell has already commented on the one fundamental difference between the Opposition amendment and our amendment. The amendments are largely very much in the same direction, as Senator MacGibbon has noted. The difference is that, in the Opposition's amendment, if there is no resolution of the question at the end of that period, the sections of the Bill requiring accedence to the Hamburg Rules will lapse. That is not in accordance with the Government's policy, which is why we do not find that acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>  We assert that Australia should be giving the lead in accepting the Hamburg Rules, and that is precisely why we have put it in legislation. We want to give a clear message to our trading partners and to everyone else connected with this business--and I can assure honourable senators that the message has been delivered--that we do intend, as a shipper nation, to agree to the Hamburg Rules because they are to the benefit of shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am frankly surprised--and I have put this to Senator Macdonald and indeed others in the Opposition--that some people in the Opposition seem to find this matter a difficulty. It is very much members of the constituency that is claimed by the Opposition--certainly rural Australia, farmers and so on--who will be the chief beneficiaries of agreement to the Hambto gloss over this but I know that there are parties that have some objections to this issue. Frankly, I do not think they are objections that they would die in a ditch over at the end of the day, because I think they accept that this move to a better consumer protection is inevitable. Their objections are principally from interests in the insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Senator Powell put it quite firmly last night, this amendment is a policy position of the Government. I am pleased to say, as asserted by Senator Powell of the Democrats, that we will provide this additional protection to our shippers. So the fundamental difference between the Opposition amendment and the Government amendment--which I hope that on reflection the Opposition will support--is that, if nothing happens after three years, under the Opposition amendment the sections of the Bill relating to the Hamburg Rules will be repealed. If nothing happens after three years under the amendment that we are moving, those sections will come into effect. It will take a positive resolution of the Parliament to prevent that from happening. As far as the consumers and our customers are concerned, that is the correct way to go, and I commend that amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I shall assist the Chair by making the Australian Democrats' point with regard to the Opposition's amendments, although it has been clearly articulated this morning by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). Our concern about the Opposition's amendments is that the result of inaction by the Parliament during the next three years would lead to the automatic repeal of part 3 of the legislation, a section which is extremely welcomed by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  From the outset the Democrats have taken the strongest view of all the parties in this place that the Hamburg Rules should be implemented, essentially because we are a shipper nation and we see those rules as most appropriate for our own interests;  hence our concern, particularly as there is to be the opportunity for a change of government between now and the expiration of that three-year period. We want to do whatever we can to cement the present Government's stated intention, as expressed in part 3 of the legislation, that the Hamburg Rules be implemented. Therefore, we are not able to support the Opposition's amendments, particularly in view of the foreshadowed Government amendments which go in the direction that we would want to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-From the outset I must say that what we are trying to achieve receives support right across the spectrum. It is just a question of how it is best achieved. The amendments, which provide that, unless something is done within three years, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill will be repealed, are moved to make the Government do something positive within that three-year period so that the Parliament has another look at the legislation and retains its primacy over this legislation. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills was concerned that, unless some sort of sunset clause was put into the legislation, it could be passed today and go on forever:  it may never be introduced or it may be introduced at an appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will not carry on with this because it is fairly technical, but the debate is: if nothing happens in three years, the Government says that the Bill should automatically start. We are saying that if nothing happens it should be repealed, unless one of two things is done:  first, that it be legislated to commence straight away or, secondly, that it be legislated to go for another three years. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not disagree with what Senator Powell has said. As the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) said earlier, we are in favour of the Hamburg Rules. I mentioned that in the second reading debate. There is no disagreement. It is simply a matter of which is the best way to introduce the legislation.  We believe that it is better this way because it will force the Government to do something positive before that three-year period is up; that is, to bring it back before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government's amendments are passed, it means that in three years--we could perhaps be in an election mode in the four weeks before that time--the legislation will automatically commence and legal rights will change from that point onwards. We may come back a month or so later to repeal the legislation. However, in that period we may have had a different set of rules, different legal obligations, different liabilities. Anything could happen which escapes the notice of Parliament in that time. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government's amendments are passed, it will also raise some very interesting conflict of law questions because the legislation will automatically commence in three years time. There is another provision in the Government's amendments that says that the legislation will not be implemented until consultation has been had with the industry and until it is in Australia's interest, in accordance with the Minister's undertaking. If the three years happens to come up and none of that is done or there has not been consultation, another provision says that the legislation will automatically start. Where that gets the Minister and his draftsmen, I am not quite sure. Why we should bother to try to correct the mess that the Government makes of all these things is completely beyond me. We do it in an attempt to make the legislation better for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I cannot understand the way in which this particular Bill has been dealt with--it is my first experience;  I am only a simple, honest country boy. Yesterday Senator Powell said that she would tell me this morning what she would do about these amendments. I am still waiting to be told. The Minister indicated that he would put forward amendments. The first I see of them is when they are thrown on my table. For the past two or three weeks while Parliament has been sitting I have been dealing with the Minister's office in a completely apolitical way in trying to get amendments drafted, trying to get the matter completed--showing every courtesy in trying to get the Minister's staff to do things. And what happens?  Senator Powell does not do me the courtesy of complying with her undertaking by telling me what is happening; the Minister does not do me the courtesy of showing me the amendments. It just leaves me in some amazement as to how this Government runs its legislative program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let that be a lesson to me. I regret to say that on future occasions I will ensure that all conversations with Senator Macdonald on these matters are made a matter of record. First of all, I reject categorically the outrageous assertions that Senator Macdonald has made about being ignored either by me or by my staff. If that assertion were simply directed to me I would ignore it because, along with all the other personal nonsense delivered in here by Senator Macdonald, it is not worthy of note. But I am certainly not going to have my staff--a very professional staff they are--attacked in this chamber when they are not able to come in here and defend themselves. My staff, as I know that not only members of the Democrats but also colleagues of Senator Macdonald can attest to, are unfailingly cooperative with any honourable senator who contacts my office; whether from the Government, Democrat or Opposition benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Secondly, this is not a complicated amendment. This is not a schedule of 80 amendments that would require days of consideration. As Senator Macdonald knows, this matter was debated at length with him at the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. We have provided this system, which I think is very beneficial, in order to discuss these issues in detail with officers at these committees. The facts are, and Senator Macdonald knows them as distinct from the sophistry he is delivering here this morning, that every one of us in this chamber--Senator Macdonald, Senator Powell, Senator Kernot who had this responsibility before Senator Powell, and myself--completely understands all the issues that are encapsulated in this simple amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Macdonald knows--because we had a discussion about it last night on the telephone, as distinct from his assertion that he had no notice of this amendment--that the Opposition's amendment and the Government's amendment are precisely the same in their effect. The one difference between them is that if nothing happens at the end of the three-year period, under Senator Macdonald's amendment the sections of the Bill will be repealed and under the Government's amendment--now indicated by Senator Powell to have the support of the Democrats, because as a policy position we want to see the Hamburg Rules adopted--those sections will come into effect unless Parliament determines otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the final point, I completely fail to understand the point that Senator Macdonald was trying to make about this amendment being an attack on the primacy of Parliament. That is a complete nonsense. So far as legislation is concerned, Parliament will be in precisely the same position in two or three years time as it is now; that is, it will be the master of its own destiny. If various aspects of this matter are not sufficiently dealt with by the Senate or the House of Representatives, whatever complexion they may have at that time, then the Houses of Parliament will take legislative action, as provided for under this amendment, to ensure that the sections of the Bill are repealed or that the review will continue. The power that Parliament will have at that time will be precisely the same power as Parliament has now. It will do what it determines it will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1991 contains amendments which are before the Parliament largely as a result of the sale of media interests formerly held by the Fairfax group and relates to the consequences of the current proposal for takeover of the group. It is fair to say that the timing of this Bill is quite extraordinary and speaks volumes for the extent to which the Government at all times puts political considerations ahead of the welfare of the broadcasting industry and, indeed, the national interest in terms of the types of arrangements that we ought to have, particularly in the print media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is a notorious fact, which is not disputed on any side, that we currently have an overconcentration of ownership, and therefore control, in the print media. The real question is what ought to be done about that. It is in many respects very difficult to unscramble the egg. The critical point is that we ought to have policies in place which are able to be brought into effect at any time irrespective of particular events. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment we are seeing quite the opposite. The Government, in a very strange exercise of timing, is suddenly putting before the Parliament some amendments which are not of huge significance but which will collectively and fundamentally, in one sense, impact upon the fate of the current bids for the Fairfax group. That is a very undesirable environment. It means that the way in which that bid proceeds, the way in which the ABT is enabled to consider the bid, and the way in which the Government assesses the merits of the bid, will all be affected to some extent by legislation which is before the Parliament at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a very unhealthy situation. It clearly means that there is a lot of jockeying for positions, and attempts somehow to favour one bid rather than another. There has been an avalanche of outpourings from Caucus, particularly its transport and communications committee, which makes it abundantly clear that the Government is preoccupied with picking the successful acquirer which it believes will be most suitable for its political purposes. Broadcasting legislation should reflect what is in the national interest and, in many respects, should try to ensure that there is not editorial intervention and that there are sound and profitable newspapers, not those that are subject to control and influence by those whose commercial interests in and around the communications sector might cause them to act in ways which do not advantage the readership of the newspapers and, in a wider sense, the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth has no direct power over newspapers, as we know, but there are cross-media ownership rules which currently limit an owner, who has a prescribed interest in a commercial television licence, to under 15 per cent ownership of a newspaper which is associated with the service area of the television licence or where the owner is in a position to control more than 15 per cent of the votes at a general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should have been abundantly clear to this Government many moons ago that that was simply an invitation for smart operators to put themselves in a position where they could acquire a significant influence. That is precisely what Mr Packer has done through the Tourang vehicle. The figure of 14.9 per cent is nothing more or less than the maximum to which he is currently entitled under the Act. It speaks volumes for his future intentions, and one would have thought that anyone with the power, motivation and wealth of Mr Packer would probably be doing the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a bit late in the day for us to start hand-wringing and saying, `Well, why do you take 14.9 per cent?  Why do you claim to have a passive investment? Why do you restructure in such a way that you create the appearance of an arm's length vehicle when either you are interested or you are not?  If you are not interested, why do you acquire even a 5 per cent interest, let alone a 14.9 per cent interest?'  If somebody is  wanting to put up that sort of money, one assumes that it is not just for the sake of trying to maximise returns on investments. It is clearly a strategic holding in an industry of significance and sensitivity and one in which very big stakes are being played for. It is against that background that we have to assess this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite clear that there has been a great deal of community concern about the implications of the Government's manoeuvrings, its attempt to advantage one bid or another. At one stage it was thought that most people in the Government and the major players, particularly the Minister, would have considered that Packer was likely to be of most political succour to them. In recent times it would seem that Mr Hawke now thinks that Packer is backing Keating and as a result they have gone cool on that idea. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Absolutely, and I am endeavouring to make that point in showing that the Government is doing the opposite. We have all these stories about Dr O'Reilly being feted at the Lodge, wheeled up by no less a person than the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) who, I thought, would have no responsibilities in this chamber for these things.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-He has, indeed, and one is entitled to ask why and with what in mind. I would have thought that it was abundantly clear, given Senator Richardson's track record, that the word `principle' never enters into his considerations. It is all to do with pragmatism. This is simply another of very many examples where Senator Richardson thinks there is a market niche for the power brokers of the Australian Labor Party, particularly its right wing. Despite the fact that he is at loggerheads with Mr Hawke, he is quite happy to go up to the Lodge and have a chat about media and other matters. It would seem at the moment, given the other derogatory statements that have been made about the AIN bid being an up-market establishment outfit, that the Government is basically hoping that it can advantage the O'Reilly group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  All of that is fairly transparent. What is particularly interesting in this situation is the analysis by Bryan Frith in the Australian of 18 September, in which he describes these current moves as really just for show--in other words, this whole Bill in many respects is a charade. The Tribunal itself through its Chairman, Mr Peter Westerway, has publicly confirmed its concerns about the extent to which it is possible for people to rearrange their affairs so as not to be technically caught by the cross-media limitations. Probably the most recent example of that was the Kimshaw case. The ABT found in June 1981 that the ownership structure of Kimshaw had been devised to serve one purpose only, and that was to preclude a breach of ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Act without affecting the ownership of interests in the 2UE licence. That case centrally involved Mr Packer's interests. We already have a classic example of how it is possible to circumvent the apparent restrictions on media ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>  There have been calls for mandatory pre-notification and pre-vetting, yet all this Bill does is serve up a pretty weak imitation of pre-notification, which leaves it up to the potential acquirer to make its own judgment as to whether it might transgress. That is simply an invitation to restructure, if that is thought to be necessary, or for those, who are not so minded to circumvent, simply to take the view that one is not likely to transgress the limitations and that one should go right on ahead. What then happens is that, having succeeded in one's takeover, one then gets bogged down in a hearing before the ABT, if and when it finally comes on. It is much more difficult then to unravel the deal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is fully aware of all those serious criticisms, yet it has chosen to serve up what Bryan Frith and others would regard as largely a charade designed to create the impression that somehow they are making life a bit more difficult for a couple of the bidders who have foreign ownership and, in Mr Packer's case, cross-media problems. But at the end of the day there is little doubt, I would have thought, that neither of those two bidders will be in any way disadvantaged if this Bill goes through. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our primary concern at this stage is to have the Bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee and for it to be in a position to examine much more closely the implications of the provisions, and hopefully to take the matter a bit further in terms of the most desirable outcome. I would have thought that it was clear that we need to assess the extent to which the power to exercise control should include potential as well as actual control. We should also assess what are the consequences of putting in the associate provisions which apply in other areas of legislation--whether those imputing rights of associates to one another, not only for the purposes of notification of transactions but also for the purposes of the substantive rules, is a matter that should be pursued.   Then there is the question of whether there should be a mandatory waiting period on a transaction once notified. Also, whether the ABT should have more power and not simply given what is clearly a totally inadequate period of some 10 days to assemble all its material, to go to the Federal Court and obtain some sort of injunction, and even then be required to give a surety as to costs if it judges that a potential bidder is not doing the right thing. I would have thought that that is putting the ABT in an impossible position. It may well be that the Tribunal, and indeed the courts, should have wider powers. </PARA>
<PARA>  To the extent that the ABT is susceptible to other influences, perhaps the courts are a better place in which to vest those powers. Certainly, at the present time, there are huge areas of discretion. It is really a matter for personal judgment on the part of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) as to whether he has any problems with the foreign interest holdings of both Dr O'Reilly and Conrad Black. In those circumstances, one can well imagine the sorts of pressures that Senator Richardson and others will bring to bear on the Treasurer if they take the view that one bid rather than another ought to be aided. I would have thought that that was a quite undesirable situation as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment it is only open to the Treasurer to take advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board and to preclude such levels of foreign ownership if he takes the view that it is contrary to the national interest. In recent times we have seen the latest charade by the Caucus subcommittee, which would allow people to have very substantial foreign involvement as long as, somehow, the equity interests do not attract voting rights. We all know that there are plenty of ways in which to exercise influence other than by having one's name upfront on the voting scrip. That is yet another example of those manoeuvrings to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA>  We want the Bill to be referred to the Committee for close examination. We are conscious of the fact that the bids have to be tabled by next Tuesday, but we do not believe that they are likely to be significantly affected even if this Bill goes through, because it is quite easy to drive a coach and four through these provisions. The Tribunal and, obviously, the Receiver will have to make their own judgment about the quality of the bids. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will certainly be urging that any decisions that the Government might make by way of intervention are made on  merit--not simply reflecting the perceived political advantage that might flow from one consortium or another--and that the rules are fixed rather than applied on a case-by-case basis. For all those reasons, as I understand it, we will be supporting the Government and the Australian Democrats in having the matter referred to the relevant Standing Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am interested in this second reading debate on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and have a sense of deja vu, particularly when listening to Senator Alston's contribution. It has been a practice of past times that Senator Alston and I have handled these portfolios in this chamber. To look at this piece of legislation from the point of view of principle comes easily to me, having moved amendments in this place to reinstate the prior approval facility for the ABT--much stronger amendments than those we see before us in the legislation today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is quite clear where the Democrats stand on the question of the powers of the ABT. Indeed, we are disappointed with the scope of this Bill. The aim of these amendments, according to the press release of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), is to strengthen the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to establish the facts on ownership and control of media outlets. As I said, that principle is something for which we have argued for a very long time--indeed, have even put it before this chamber by way of substantive amendments which, of course, have not been supported by either the Government or the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have argued the case since the Murdoch amendments in 1981. It is fascinating to reflect on the fact that a former Liberal government was responsible, via those amendments, for the weakening of the ABT in this very area. I understand from fairly widespread media reports recently that the former Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, has expressed some unhappiness with having presided over that move, as well he might. It puts some of Senator Alston's protestations about the weakness of the Government's actions in this case somewhat under a cloud. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill falls very short of the Government's stated intention as well as falling short of promises made to the Tribunal and the expectations of the Tribunal. Once again, the Government fails to deliver the power that it has promised again and again to the Tribunal. It is important to say how pleased the Democrats are to see some moves, at least, in the direction of strengthening the powers of the Tribunal, even though there is no question that this move is motivated by the situation created by the Fairfax sales. Nevertheless, an opportunity is there, and it is for that reason that the Democrats want to put forward a series of amendments which would give some spine to this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Opposition does fall behind some of the things that Senator Alston and the shadow Minister for communications (Mr Smith) have said, it will have the opportunity to do so as, at least in this chamber, we have the numbers between us. It is not a matter of standing up and making fine statements. It is a matter, as it always is in this chamber when there is a principle to be supported, of putting up amendments--in this case they will be put up by the Democrats--and the principle being put into practice. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would not like to think that this piece of rather weak legislation--albeit motivated by current media machinations of ownership and control--would be all that would pass through this Parliament, but that we would be able to amend it and strengthen it. We will not be able to do that as eight Democrats, we will require Opposition support and that needs to be put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's cross-media ownership laws are perhaps the only significant progressive advance in media policy implementation under this Government, certainly, and previous governments, for a long time. This short history is littered with examples of the Tribunal's powerlessness when faced with ruthless media proprietors determined to be the biggest cross-media owners, take things to the limits and do whatever can be done to circumvent those rules--rules which the Democrats welcomed when they were introduced, rules which are essential in this country to enable the media to be independent and broad-ranging and to contribute to our cultural and democratic processes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Always, however, the Tribunal has been faced with the problem of unscrambling the egg. Senator Alston has already mentioned the example of Kerry Packer's Australian Consolidated Press owning television's Channel 9 and radio station 2UE concurrently, which shows how difficult it is to unscramble a</PARA>
<PARA>transaction after it has occurred, but it is not the only example of areas where the Tribunal has been faced with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  The impending Fairfax sale is a major test of the effects of the cross-media ownership rules. We have heard in evidence given by the Managing Director of Tourang, Mr Trevor Kennedy, at the meeting of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Print Media on 1 October this year, that the amendments, at this point anyway, are totally ineffective and are simply readjusting shareholdings. Tourang has escaped the obligation to provide any information to the Tribunal, despite the number of unanswered questions about the roles of merchant banker, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, and Mr Trevor Kennedy in the syndicates, and the potential control that Mr Packer may exercise through them. All this Bill does is give the Tribunal permission to investigate a possible breach of the Broadcasting Act prior to a commercial transaction taking place, but only if the Tribunal can provide enough evidence to front the Federal Court to argue for an injunction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Tribunal is not being given the right of prior approval on media mergers or takeovers. The Tribunal is not being given the power to sanction or reverse a takeover after the fact. In addition, the Bill gives the Tribunal only a measly 10 days to collect enough evidence to justify an injunction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill is fatally flawed and, therefore, weak to the point of almost being totally ineffective. I intend to move amendments that will rectify what we see as the Bill's major inadequacies. As I say, we look to the Opposition for support for these improvements. One of the irredeemable flaws is that the amendments only deal with shareholding in media companies, yet the Act extensively covers the notion of control by other means; for example, control by directors. It would be commercially idiotic for the Bill to assume that because a person does not have a shareholding that person does not have control. </PARA>
<PARA>   Rectifying this problem is difficult. The Bill needs to be altered to require a combination of shares and board positions to be considered when deciding whether a person has a requirement to notify the Tribunal. The simple alternative, of course, is to lower the threshold which is considered a prescribed interest for the purpose of notification to, say, 5 per cent. A more certain solution would be to require a more general obligation to pre-notify transactions, or, to adopt the simplest solution of all, remove the Murdoch amendments, satisfy Malcolm Fraser perhaps, and allow the Tribunal to have a priori approval of transactions involving changes of media ownership. This is the sort of thing that I have proposed in this place before by way of amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unless suitable amendments are made, unless we can come to some agreement here in this chamber and prevail upon the Government to carry it through in the other place, there seems to be very little point in having the so-called trip-wire for, like the Maginot line, it can be easily stepped over, as we have already seen. It is quite clear that the intention of bidders is there to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Australian Democrats have difficulty in understanding the definition of associates. It is, if you like, a cute definition but it only applies for the purpose of notification and does not change the substantive law relating to ownership and control. The Tribunal could seek an injunction if it believed that there was a prima facie case of a breach. But it would still have to prove that a breach had taken place which, in practice, is difficult, especially with the fetters that have been placed on the Tribunal's capacity to elicit information. The question of the 10 days will be directly addressed by an amendment to be proposed by the Democrats and, hopefully, supported by the Opposition.   Usually, burden of proof requires taking oral evidence from directors of the company, which could be very difficult, especially since the issue of control touches on what can be described as commercially sensitive areas. Why not deem certain relationships to be associates, along the same lines as in corporations law? The proposed definition of associate is too wide to operate as a deeming provision and would be unfair and unworkable. A simple solution would be to introduce reverse onus requiring those who are caught within the definition of associate to demonstrate that they are independent. This would considerably strengthen the chances of the Tribunal making a prima facie case. </PARA>
<PARA>   At this point I feel a little cynical because the Bill appears, in this area any way, to almost directly contradict the Minister's stated intention. The facts of providing a prima facie case would be difficult enough for the Tribunal under any circumstances. But, as I have said, the 10-day period that the Tribunal has under this legislation to gather information and make a decision on a transaction is really an affront. In practice, it is often dealing with complex company structures. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Tribunal requests further information under section 89X, it must wait seven days unless it can prove that it is reasonable to shorten the time. The FIRB, for instance, is allowed 30 days. The Trade Practices Commission has sought 28 days for its pre-notification process. Why should the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal not be allowed a similar amount of time? Again I appeal to the Opposition for support on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats also believe that the public interest is best served by the process itself being public and accountable, with an option for the Tribunal to grant confidentiality where appropriate to protect commercial information. This is the case under the Act as it stands, before this amending Bill is passed. I do not see any reason to change that. In fact, it is fundamental to the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as a public watchdog. </PARA>
<PARA>  We in the Parliament now have a chance because we have an amending Bill before us to rectify the mistakes made by both this Government and the previous Government in the area of media policy. We can now right the wrongs of the Murdoch amendments, and we have the power to embody the original spirit of the cross-media ownership rules into the Act. The original cross-media ownership rules are, as I say, really the only positive move to be made by this Government in media policy. But they have not really been significantly tested until now and, as I have already demonstrated, have not been properly and effectively implemented because the Tribunal has not had the power to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is really the challenge that is before us with this legislation. It goes beyond the simple question of one series of commercial transactions that are being contemplated right now, although nothing could really be more important than the fate of the Fairfax newspapers in this country. I do not want to give the impression that the Democrats do not have strong views about the need for that exercise to be resolved in the interests of a free, independent and Australian print media. </PARA>
<PARA>   Paul Keating's famous dictum, `queens of the screen or princesses of the print', was a vivid acknowledgment of the need for greater competition, Australian ownership and diversity of ownership. At the time that statement was made by Mr Keating, the Minister, Senator Richardson, who is presently in the chamber, and I were serving on what I would call the ill-fated Senate Select Committee on Television Equalisation which, of course, was the Committee which paved the way to hand over our television industry to three network operators. The business entrepreneurs salivated while the Committee sat, and then jumped in; some of them broke their necks on the bottom of the pool. It was the beginning of the breakdown of the Australian media operation, and we are still suffering, both financially and in terms of the media operation itself, as a result of what happened in television equalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I say, the only really positive thing that came out of that, and subsequent Australian Labor Party government media policy, was the cross-ownership rules. We are being tested on our commitment to those rules. Will we give the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal sufficient powers, not just in the context of the Fairfax takeover bids but in the context of our commitment to the sort of media that this country deserves and must have? Or will we allow to pass a piece of legislation which is weak in the extreme and which is expedient? Senator Alston is perfectly correct in stating that this Government's media policy has been a sham, a shambles and an economic disaster, not just for the business enterprises involved but also for our economy as a whole. The ordinary public is still paying, by way of foreign debt and by way of interest rates and so on, for that debacle. Will we let this happen or will we, in particular the Opposition and the Democrats, have the strength of principle to make significant amendments, workable amendments, to this piece of legislation to advance the interests of the Australian community, the Australian media and the Australian democracy as well as our culture by giving the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal some teeth and by backing up those cross-media rules?</PARA>
<PARA>  When the Government implemented the cross-media rules, it was a step away from the media dynasty approach of the past. But the Government now appears to be hell-bent on creating new dynasties. Media ownership in Australia is at a watershed. The Government can either continue to change the rules, shift the goalposts, during the game as it has done through television aggregation and other policies--FM radio conversion and now pay television and foreign media ownership--or demonstrate maturity and commitment in its media policy by giving the Tribunal the power to implement its cross-media ownership rules. That is the challenge we face in this chamber today in the passage of this legislation. We cannot achieve a perfect world, but we can use this vehicle, this amending Bill, to do something positive by confirming our commitment to cross-media rules and to a broad, diverse and independent media in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Now is an opportune time for me to speak to the motion while Senator Coulter is in the process of arriving. The Opposition supports the motion. I do not wish to turn this into another speech on the second reading debate, but there is a massive number of amendments before the Committee, most of which have already been agreed to. There is a further group of amendments foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats, which will be moved in due course by Senator Coulter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology covers fully the discussions and the reasons why these various changes were made. As a result of those amendments, the Fisheries Administration Bill and six related Bills are considerably better than they were when first introduced into the chamber at the end of May. The Opposition appreciates the changes made and agreed to and trusts that discussion on the remaining amendments can proceed in order as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issues that have caused many of the amendments to be put forward relate to the rights of fishermen to the resource. An issue related to membership of the various committees and their make-up from time to time. The Opposition believes that membership should be as flexible as possible and with as little direction as possible. There will be times when views on changes in directors and participants will differ. Accordingly, the membership of those committees should be left in as fluid a condition as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  The environmentally sustainable development aspects have received a lot of coverage and these, too, have caused a substantial number of amendments to be brought forward. That, together with the rights and privileges of commercial fishermen as against the amateur fishermen, will be one of the major items for discussion by the proposed authority. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Fisheries Management Bill caused the majority of amendments to be raised. Both the Government and the Opposition now concede that this Bill will now make the management of fisheries much more satisfactory than it was previously. I believe that we should now proceed to deal with the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today we are debating the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1991, which takes up many of the recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Report No. 3 of the Committee was the result of an inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendum. The amendments proposed to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act 1989 are generally of a non-controversial nature, and as such the Opposition does not intend to move any amendments. However, I would like to speak briefly to some of the proposed amendments, which I understand have subsequently been changed somewhat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I refer to section 44 of the Constitution, which provides, among other things, that any person who holds an office of profit under the Crown shall be incapable of being chosen, or of sitting, as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. I understand from my own discussions with the Electoral Commission that it is not possible by legislation to define clauses in the Constitution. That is the role of the High Court of Australia. However, I am also advised that the High Court has never addressed itself to what constitutes an office of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the years this has created considerable uncertainty for candidates. I myself was a victim of this uncertainty. When I was appointed to the Senate I was the Deputy Chairman of the Queensland Institute of Technology. Notwithstanding that this was a totally honorary role involving no payment, I was advised that it would be prudent to resign, which I did. As a result of that, a clause was introduced to define an office of profit under the Crown. It also proposed that a new clause be inserted to provide that a person who is, at the hour of nomination, an officer of the Crown is not capable of being nominated as a senator or member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had some concern about the definition and the clause. Following our discussions earlier today with both the Government and the Australian Democrats, I understand that the Government will withdraw that clause. However, because of the uncertainties involved, I think an attempt to define an office of profit is worth while. One of our concerns--and this was spelt out by the Committee--involved a person having to resign from a position or office of profit. The definition is very broad and, as far as I can see, it would apply to people such as members of senates of universities and local government councillors or aldermen. Recommendation 11 indicates that the Parliament should legislate to provide that if, people have to resign, their positions will be open to them after they have completed the election campaign and have failed to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition will support the removal of the clause at this time, as I understand the Government intends to reintroduce some sort of definition between now and the next election. I believe that this would remove a lot of the uncertainty that currently exists. The Opposition's view is that as many people as possible should be able to stand for election to either the Senate or the House of Representatives. I understand that, historically--and it is not for me to decide what our founding fathers thought at the time--one of the reasons for this part of the Constitution, concerning offices of profit under the Crown, goes back some hundreds of years. It came about because many hundreds of years ago the king of the day had a habit of appointing his own people to the public service and there was concern at the time that the king's appointees should not be running the Parliament also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is somewhat steeped in history. The Government might look at the British system when it brings this clause back in an amended fashion. I understand that it is fairly prescriptive and actually spells out in detail the types of people who would be required to resign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Clause 13, which substitutes proposed new section 170, has been introduced in an effort to prevent a recurrence of an election result being voided by the courts because of a subsequent discovery that an elected senator or member was not an Australian citizen. Honourable senators will recall the case of Robert Wood. When it was found that former Senator Wood should not have been elected because he was not an Australian citizen, his place was taken by Irina Dunn, who Robert Wood believed would be a caretaker until he obtained Australian citizenship. It did not work out that way because Senator Dunn, once ensconced, decided that she enjoyed the life somewhat and refused to resign. If my memory serves me correctly, at the time Senator Ray said that his `faith in human nature was restored. Self-interest won the day'. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Senator Wood's position as a senator was found to be legally invalid, the Government could have asked him to repay his salary, electoral allowances and other moneys paid to him. This debt was waived although, again if my memory serves me correctly, Senator Ray did pass the remark that it was tempting to attempt to recover the debt. The introduction of this clause will assist to some degree in preventing a recurrence. It could still occur, but it is an attempt to prevent a recurrence. Other parts of the principal Act provide fairly heavy penalties if someone does not tell the truth upon nomination. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 18 enables the use of licensed premises as polling booths, provided that liquor is not available for sale in the vicinity. This is in accordance with the Committee's recommendation that the use of licensed premises was not desirable, except where no other premises were suitable. It makes sense in very remote areas, but it would be absolutely intolerable where other premises were available. I would like an assurance from the Government that that is the intent of the clause. The Committee gave the example of the ski resorts where, because no suitable premises were available, local residents and visitors were required to record declaration votes, and that caused considerable delays and problems. I would like an assurance from the Minister in his response that it is the intent simply to use these premises where no other premises are available. It should only be an exception. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 22 amends section 245 of the principal Act to provide a new infringement notice system to those people who do not vote. It is equivalent to an on-the-spot traffic fine and was designed by the Australian Electoral Commission to reduce the administrative costs of pursuing non-voters. This means that voters are now being invited to pay $20 for the privilege of exercising their right not to vote. In effect, the amendment introduces optional compulsory voting: the choice is either to turn up at the polling booth and register to vote or contribute $20 to the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me at this stage observe that it is apparent that the Government and the Electoral Commission recognise that they do not have either the capacity or the will to enforce a system of compulsory voting. Other comments could be made, but time constrains me from doing so. As all the clauses in the Bill relate to the unanimous support of the Committee, as indicated earlier, the Opposition will not be proposing any amendments either in the second reading debate or at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA>  It is indeed a very necessary part of our scrutiny that we have an opportunity to look at how we conduct our elections and referendum processes. It is helpful to us to have the recommendations of this Joint Standing Committee embodied in the form of legislation before us this morning. Some of the more positive aspects of it that I would like to comment on from my experience as a campaign director are certainly those which facilitate the ease with which candidates can nominate. For example, it seems to me entirely appropriate that we accept facsimiles in the process and that an agent, the registered officer or a deputy registered officer of a registered party can lodge nominations of all the party's endorsed House of Representatives candidates in a State or Territory with the Australian Electoral Officer for the relevant State or Territory up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. That seems to me an eminently sensible suggestion and, as an administrator, one that I really welcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  I guess one issue of concern to the Australian Democrats that I wish to flag, and one which Senator Parer has already touched on, is the office of profit under the Crown. As he rightly said, it has been a matter of contention for a long time. I understand what the Government is endeavouring to do in its prescriptive definitions in clause 4. My concern is that, in making it quite clear that certain categories of people must definitely resign, recommendation No. 11 of the Committee was not able to be included. I would like to dwell on that for a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendation No. 11 of the Committee said that those people affected by the requirement to resign from an office of profit under the Crown before nominating for election to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for which they are subsequently unsuccessful should have their employment and entitlements protected by suitable legislation. While it is now very clear who has to resign and by what time, it is not clear under this legislation whether those people have any rights or entitlements to re-employment. That concerns us. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am grateful for the Government's offer to consider our request to have that section deleted, not because we oppose the definitions but because the end part of the process is not in place when we embark upon the first stage. At the moment, a grey area exists that has worked to the advantage of some people. I would prefer that grey area to remain until we have the whole process in place. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know about people who have been caught up in whether to resign and, if they resign, whether they get their jobs back. I certainly know that in Queensland in the teaching profession it was a real risk to nominate to be a candidate for a political party. I would not want to see us put in place anything that inhibits any citizen from taking up the opportunity to nominate to be a candidate for an election for any party or to nominate as an independent. That is why I will be moving at the committee stage to omit the definition of an officer of the Crown. I apologise that the amendment is not yet formally in front of Senator Parer. Consequentially, I signal that we would then be opposing clause 10. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank Senator Parer and Senator Kernot for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1991. None of the provisions of this Bill are individually earth-shattering. However, collectively they form part of the proper process of continually monitoring, revising and improving the manner in which we conduct elections and, for that matter, referenda in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One very worthwhile outcome of the establishment of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has been this continuing review and refinement. As many honourable senators will know, I have had a bit of involvement in the conduct of elections over time: I have won a few and lost a few. One thing that Australian democracy is enhanced by is the respect which people have for the electoral process. Overwhelmingly they have respect because Australian elections are well and fairly conducted and people are therefore prepared to accept the legitimacy of the process when they are unhappy with the political outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  We continue to do that in many minor ways. For example, Senator Kernot raised points about making it easier for people to nominate and about catching up with the technology regarding the authorisation of electoral material distributed by video. Neither of those changes makes a very big difference, but they are part of the process. When they are put together with the whole series of modifications that have taken place over the years they ensure that the electoral process has the respect of the electors. That is a fundamental prerequisite of a modern democracy. Therefore, it is a Bill which is minor in its content but is part of a significant process that ought to be continued. I thank the Committee for its prior work and the Senate for its support for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>1.   Clause 4, page 2, lines 20 to 39, definition of "Officer of the Crown", omit the definition. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said previously, it is not our intention to leave this matter in abeyance, but rather to assist the Government to bring the matter forward again, and at that time make sure that we have in place some provision that will ensure that those people who have had to resign in order to nominate as candidates for an election will have the protection of their entitlements and employment that they enjoyed before nomination. For us to have done that in the time available today would have been impossible, and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill is not the appropriate legislation in which to do so. We need to go back and amend several Acts, such as those concerning the Defence Force, the Federal Police and other bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I signal that we certainly wish to take that action and that when this Bill comes back before the Parliament, as it regularly does, we will be in a position to pursue this option. Although we understand the Government's intention in categorising and defining what constitutes an officer of the Crown, we think that to do so without having the end process in place is not at all helpful to many people who want to stand as candidates, who will have to resign their positions and run the risk of not getting those jobs back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is quite obviously bipartisan support for the attempt by the Government to define an officer of the Crown. The view taken is that there should be some protection for candidates who do stand for election and are unsuccessful. As I indicated earlier in the second reading debate, I think it is in the interests of the whole community that as many people as possible be given the opportunity to stand as candidates. There should be very few restrictions on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There have been cases where the uncertainty that abounded made people somewhat nervous to nominate because, even if they were successful, in a close election the opposition party of whatever colour could use the constitutional provision of office of profit under the Crown to challenge a person who was subsequently elected. I suggest that a simple way of approaching this may well be for the Government to look at the timing of the resignation. I do not know whether that is constitutionally possible. If people could resign at, say, the declaration of the polls, it would solve the problem. If someone stood as a candidate and was not elected, there would be no need to resign whereas, if that person was elected, he or she could resign at the time of the declaration of the polls. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition will support the Democrat amendment, on the understanding, having had discussions with the Government, that the Government intends to introduce some sort of legislation between now and the election to get rid of the uncertainty that has existed for many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I think has been indicated previously by the Minister, the Government is prepared to accept this amendment. We understand that there is shared concern. I think all the parties and all the people represented here are trying to achieve the same outcome. It is a question of getting the right process. The Minister has advised me that he is happy to assure the Senate that we will come back to this issue as soon as we can to try to get a comprehensive and agreed position that will deal with the issues that Senator Kernot and Senator Parer have raised. I am happy to incorporate those points which they have raised in the discussion on the consideration of how the matter might best be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  An immediate reaction of my own, without advice, is that there is a potential problem in the option which Senator Parer raises, in that we get to a situation where, at least technically, a person who is nominating for a seat is not eligible to hold the seat. That is the contingent problem we have, but it may not be impossible to resolve. That is just a first reaction to a problem that has arisen in the past. It may be that, with ingenuity, some mechanism of the sort Senator Parer suggested ought to be considered. I will certainly raise that point in the discussions we have to try to lead to some agreed outcome on this matter. On that basis, we are prepared to accept this amendment and, consequentially, the amendment to clause 10, to which I will not therefore speak.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to make mention of clause 18, to which I referred during my speech in the second reading debate. It was of some concern to us that there was a possibility that licensed premises would become the order of the day rather than the rarity. I raised the point that the clause is acceptable to us on the basis that it is sensible, even though it is a requirement that no liquor be available within the vicinity of the polling booth, for example, to allow liquor on licensed premises in remote areas. The example given at the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was that of ski resorts where people are required to lodge declaration votes because no other suitable premises were available. I make the point that it would be absolutely abominable and appalling if licensed premises were used when there were other suitable premises available. I would like the assurance of the Government on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Senate is debating a package of six very important Bills relating to the insurance and superannuation industries and, in particular, to the supervisory arrangements and prudential requirements associated with those industries. They are extremely important industries, given the growth in recent years and the foreshadowed growth in the years ahead in the superannuation industry and the superannuation funds available for investment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  During the past decade, we have seen a growth in the assets of superannuation funds from $15 billion or thereabouts a decade ago to well in excess of $100 billion now. On the estimates of some, that figure will increase to no less than $600 billion between now and the end of the decade. Even if that figure is an overestimate--and I think it probably is--there still will quite clearly be enormous funds involved in superannuation over the years ahead, particularly with the advent of occupational superannuation as introduced by this Government--compulsory superannuation contributions--which will impose enormous additional costs on industry unless they are met by increases in productivity by industry or through corresponding wage reductions, in the sense of wage increases being less than they otherwise would, to take account of this increase in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me make it clear at the outset that the Opposition supports the increased coverage of the work force through private superannuation schemes. That is a matter on which there is no disagreement between the major parties. However, we do have a significant disagreement as to whether the increase in superannuation coverage ought to be enforced in the compulsory way in which the Government is currently imposing it on industry. We believe that that is an objectionable way of going about the matter because it will cost jobs. The one legacy of this Government in the last couple of years has been the enormous job destruction and the loss of hope and opportunity--particularly for young people--in the job market that we have observed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today's figures for unemployment, released just an hour ago, show an enormous further increase in unemployment to a level of 10.2 per cent Australia-wide. Virtually every State of Australia now has unemployment officially running at levels of 11 per cent or more. The only two States where unemployment is now less than 10 per cent are New South Wales and Queensland, where the percentages are said to be 9.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  As we all know, those figures are in any event a major understatement of the level of unemployment. The figure of 872,100 for seasonally adjusted unemployed persons at the end of September--an increase of 31,600 in the last month alone-- is an horrendous figure in its own right. It is even more horrendous when it is recognised that it is a major understatement of the level of unemployment in this country. The real level of unemployment is well over one million people. That is the legacy, the absolute tragedy, of the eight wasted years of disastrous economic policy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The subject of superannuation is of great importance. As I say, the coalition is in agreement with the Government that we need to have increased coverage of private sector superannuation schemes because, with the growth in proportion and the absolute numbers of people who will be of retirement age and beyond over the next 10, 20, or 30 years, it is quite clear that the public purse will not be able to provide the retirement income that is necessary in a society such as ours. We will have to rely much more than we have in the past on the growth of private sector savings so that people can provide more for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  In that capacity superannuation is one of the major forms of such provision. Therefore, it is of great importance that the funds that average Australians put into superannuation and savings for their retirement be protected to the maximum extent possible. An important element of the Bills before the chamber today does relate to putting increased supervisory arrangements and prudential arrangements in place so that the safeguarding of those funds can be protected. </PARA>
<PARA>  In passing, I will just say that the growth of superannuation in Australia will raise some fundamental questions as far as the whole role of savings and the different forms of savings in our economy are concerned. That will have enormous economic impacts and impacts on investment and the whole growth of our economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The issue that I want to raise today relates to the tabling in the Parliament of the various reports by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner for the Northern Territory. Three reports were tabled in the chamber this week, but the issue is much broader and reports regularly come before the chamber. This week a report by then Mr Justice Maurice, Aboriginal Land Commissioner, on the Warumungu land claim was tabled. That report was made to the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Gerry Hand, and was dated 8 July 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The second report that I refer to is the report by Mr Justice Olney to the current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Robert Tickner, with regard to the Wakaya-Alyawarre land claim. That report is dated 8 May 1990.  The third report to which I refer is the report by Mr Justice Olney specifically relating to the Western Desert land claim; it was presented to the current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, and is dated 24 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned that the presentation of these reports has been so tardy. In the case of the Warumungu land claim, three years elapsed between the date on which it was relayed to the Minister and its presentation to this Parliament. The other reports were nearly 1 1/2 years old and one year old before their presentation to the Parliament. I find that most unsatisfactory. It does not contribute in any way to the proper administration of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will deal with each of the reports. It is interesting to note their current status in dealing with issues that have been raised and in the determination of land grants for particular people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Warumungu land claim is a very significant one. The relevant land basically surrounds the town of Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. There is immense community interest  in the claim, particularly among the Aboriginal traditional owners of the area. The Northern Territory has acceded to stage 1 of the claim and the Commonwealth has granted two portions of this area. Stage 2 comprises stock route reserves held by the Northern Territory Land Corporation which the Northern Territory Government is willing to acquire to facilitate the grant to claimants subject to satisfactory agreements pursuant to section 11A of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that today the Central Land Council has refused to countenance section 11A agreements notwithstanding that this arbitration mechanism was specifically inserted into the Act to overcome such difficulties. The Northern Territory Government and the Central Land Council have agreed in principle to the grant of the stage 3 area, which involves withdrawal of the claim to the land covered by the Tennant Creek draft structure plan, in return for the acquisition and grant under Territory title of land owned by the lessee of the Phillip Creek pastoral lease and the Conservation Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to the claim in respect of Wakaya-Alyawarre land claim, the offer of Territory freehold title was made to the claimants through the Central Land Council prior to the hearing. This offer was not accepted except by Mr Jack Punch, one of the persons claiming traditional ownership, who wanted to establish an out-station in his country. Mr Punch insisted that the claim in his name be withdrawn in return for assistance with out-station development. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Arruwarra estate of over 5,000 square kilometres was granted as freehold under the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act in December 1989. A large portion of stage A of the claim was not recommended for grant and is now subject to a repeat land claim. That is a separate issue relating to repeat land claims and I think it needs closer attention by the Minister, and certainly, in the future, by the Parliament. It is an issue that I believe the Liberal and National parties would give specific attention to in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  The western land claim area adjoins the Western Australian-Northern Territory border. This area was subject to two land claims. Two large portions were not recommended for grant. As the earlier claim, No. 27, has not been withdrawn, effectively a repeat claim is in place. The Northern Territory offer of Territory freehold to the total area has been repeated since the inquiry but, I understand at this stage, with no response. </PARA>
<PARA>  These reports demand the attention of all people who have interests in these areas. They affect the long term commercial viability of the Northern Territory in many areas of economic activity, be they mining or pastoral pursuits. And, very importantly, they affect the lifestyle of many Aboriginal people and the conditions under which they live in the Northern Territory. I would hope that they will receive attention much more promptly than the Minister has obviously been able to give in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to respond to answers given by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook, to questions about the Robe River Mining Co. and, in particular, its Cape Lambert Services. Firstly, on 5 September Senator Crowley asked a question which was deliberately designed to defame Robe River Mining Co. Secondly, I asked questions on 9, 10 and 11 September 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In his answers, Senator Cook, quite unfairly and without justification, abused and maligned a good Australian company, a company which has lifted its performance to best world standards. In fact, Senator Cook has misled the Senate in his answers. He has not told the truth. This disgraceful episode denigrates the rule of law and demonstrates clearly that he is a puppet of the union movement. He should either apologise, not only to Robe River Mining and the people of Australia but also to the Senate, or he should resign. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has Robe River Mining accomplished? It has lifted its loading rates from 2,000 tonnes per hour in mid-1986 to 5,000 tonnes per hour in mid-1991. The frequency rates for all injuries have dropped from 433 to 268 in the same period. In 1986-87 there were 63 lost time injuries and in 1990-91 there were 12. Ships residence port time has dropped from 173 hours prior to 1986 hours to an average of 74 hours today. Tonnage output per employee for the years ending March 1985, 1986 and 1987 was approximately 10,000. This has risen to a staggering 31,000 tonnes per man, per year at March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rather than criticising and maligning Robe River Mining, Senator Cook should be recognising in a positive and constructive way the achievements of management and congratulating the current work force for their achievements. Robe River Mining has achieved a 400 per cent increase in productivity. This has been achieved by workplace reform. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will rephrase it and say `why I contend that he may have misled the Senate'. On 5 September Senator Cook said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Since 1989, in cases involving the Seamen's Union there have been some eight appeals by Robe River to the Industrial Relations Commission's Full Bench and two appeals to the High Court. The actions have all been about whether or not the same conditions that apply at all other ports in Australia should apply at this particular port, Port Lambert. </PARA>
<PARA>  In essence, the outcome of these appeals has been for the Seamen's Union to be upheld in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, in answer to my question of 11 September, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have the details of the eight appeals here. They start from 13 June 1989--an appeal by Robe River against a Commission decision, dismissed. There was another on 6 September, dismissed; another on 5 October, dismissed; another on 8 October, dismissed; another again on 8 October 1990, dismissed; another on 19 June 1991, substantially dismissed and part of it referred for another hearing; another on 19 June, and the same result for that; and another on 22 July. </PARA>
<PARA>I contend that these statements are totally misleading, that they misrepresent the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first appeal date named by Senator Cook was 13 June 1989. Senator Cook claimed that the case was dismissed. He is patently wrong. The appeal was withdrawn on 26 November 1989, not dismissed. I contend once again that Senator Cook has misled the Senate on the outcome of this hearing. </PARA>
<PARA>  A further appeal by CLS was lodged on 28 July 1989. This one, which Senator Cook chose not to mention, was against an award which was brought down on 21 July. On 26 September 1989, by leave of the Commission and with the consent of the unions, the reinstatement award against which this appeal was lodged was set aside and the appeal then dismissed. Hence, this appeal was in favour of CLS. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second date mentioned by the Minister, 6 September 1990, was in fact a decision and award--the Engagement of Labour (Interim) Award. CLS lodged an appeal against this award on 7 September 1990, not 6 September. On 28 November 1990, the Full Bench issued a formal order quashing the award. In my view, Senator Cook once again has misled the Senate in stating that this appeal was dismissed. In fact, it was found in favour of CLS. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next set of dates nominated by the Minister was 5 October, 8 October and, again, 8 October 1990. Senator Cook claimed that there were three appeals. However, here Senator Cook is double dipping in an endeavour to make up his numbers. There was an appeal on 5 October and this appeal was amended on 8 October. That is only one appeal and not two, as claimed by Senator Cook. There was another appeal on 10 October 1990, which I assume is the appeal Senator Cook referred to as being of 8 October 1990. Both these appeals were dismissed in favour of the unions. However, once again I contend that the Minister may have misled the Senate--there were only two appeals, not three. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next dates nominated by the Minister were 19 June 1991, with the professed outcome of `substantially dismissed and part of it referred for another hearing', and once again 19 June 1991, with `the same result for that'. Once again, I contend that Senator Cook may have misled the Senate. Let us examine the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 19 June 1991, Commissioner Fogarty found a dispute and made the Recruitment of Seafarers Award and the Preservation of Employment (Interim) Award. On 8 July 1991, not 19 June, CLS filed an appeal against the Preservation of Employment (Interim) Award. On 9 September 1991, the Full Bench of the Commission found that there was an arguable case that CLS may have been denied natural justice when the Preservation of Employment Award was made. It directed Deputy President Harrison to make a report on various matters and that the hearing on the appeal continue in the light of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>  I contend once again that Senator Cook may have misled the Senate with regard to the decision on 19 June 1991. There was only one appeal, not two, and that appeal was lodged on 8 July 1991. The appeal was not substantially dismissed and part referred to another hearing; it was referred in total to another hearing. In fact, in the final analysis, both awards--the Recruitment of Seafarers Award and the Preservation of Employment (Interim) Award--were set aside from midnight on 23 September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final date nominated by the Minister was 22 July 1991. The Minister never stated the outcome but inferred that the appeal had been dismissed. There was an appeal lodged on 22 July 1991 which, with the consent of the unions, was adjourned on 3 September. It certainly was not dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In summary, the Minister nominated eight appeals by CLS and the days on which they were made. In fact, only six related to the nominated dates. Only three were nominated on the actual dates, and only two were upheld in favour of the union. </PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to the appeals nominated by the Minister, I believe that the Minister has blatantly misled the Senate as to their outcome. It is a disgrace. The Minister should hang his head in shame. He hides behind parliamentary privilege and slanders the Robe River Mining Co. before the Australian public and the Senate. The Minister should immediately apologise or resign. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister also claims in his answers that the Seamens Union wants the same conditions that apply in all--and I emphasise `all'--other ports in Australia. I contend that this is once again a misleading statement. The conditions vary, in fact, and are not consistent from port to port. The Minister then goes on to claim that CLS deliberately contrived to go into voluntary liquidation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it goes into voluntary liquidation and another company is contrived to take its place and the process commences again. It is not unreasonable either to speculate that should the same processes be replicated with this company, as one would expect they would be, when the outcome is arrived at again and the final appeal source is exhausted, the existing company will go into voluntary liquidation and a new company will start. </PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary, incredible, unfounded statement. It is the statement of a desperate man who has lost his sense of balance, his rational judgment and his ability to be objective. It is a tragedy that a Minister of the Crown who should be setting the example in terms of world best practice should malign those who do. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Cook and his mates are objecting to Robe River contracting out its towing service. Let us examine Robe River's history in contracting out its services--a policy which Robe adopted in 1987. For example, it has contracted out rail haulage, the electrical service, the catering service, on-site shops and plumbing services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The following points should be noted with regard to the contracting out of towing services. Cape Lambert Services does no outside commercial work. Notice of termination of employment was given from early February 1991 for 30 June 1991. The decision to end Cape Lambert Services was no surprise. On 11 May advertisements were placed in the Courier-Mail, the Australian, the Melbourne Age and the West Australian seeking expressions of interest. Eight replies were received, including replies from Brisbane, Perth, Port Hedland, Darwin and South Australia. Westug, which is a privately owned company, was awarded the contract. The savings to Robe are enormous: $1.6m in the first year and $0.6m in subsequent years. Once again, I contend that Senator Cook may have misled this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  Robe River has not contrived a new company. It has rearranged its business and contracted out a service to an independent operator, which is Robe's legitimate right. I repeat the statement that I made at the commencement of this speech: the Minister may have misled the Senate. I believe that he has been dishonest. He has been deceptive in answering a dorothy dixer asked by Senator Crowley on behalf of his mates. He has resorted to verbal thuggery against a company that has had the guts to eliminate weak management and stand up against union thuggery. The Minister has consistently said in this place that the umpire's decision should be obeyed, particularly with regard to the meat industry. The Minister now maligns Robe River for using that very umpire. The Minister should apologise to Robe River. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --This morning I presented a petition to the Parliament from nearly 300 Australian citizens concerning the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. As a result of restructuring within the Organisation, there are some serious implications for engineers that I think should be drawn to the attention of the Senate. I propose to do so today by reading a letter that was sent to me by the professional officer technologists in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation together with the petition that I presented this morning. I do so because not only is it an issue of importance to those individuals--and I sympathise with them in the difficulties that they are facing--but it is an issue of great importance to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are constantly being informed that the way ahead for Australia is that of a clever country. We are being told that science is the way that Australia can develop and grow. But we seem to be neglecting the fact that science is only one part of the equation. Engineers and the technology in which they have great competence tend to be ignored. That is why I wish to read to the Senate the letter from the Chairman of the Professional Officers Action Committee of DSTO. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>A unilateral salary and conditions determination on behalf of the Research Scientists in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation . . . has now created a situation in which the non-Research Scientists are debarred from SES equivalent positions. They are now unable to achieve the more senior levels in the DSTO and the Services will as a result not have access to advice at the more senior engineer level. </PARA>
<PARA>At a recent meeting of over two hundred Professional Officers at DSTO Salisbury, considerable anger was expressed at the effective termination of career prospects resulting from an award in favour of another group of professional staff. This has denied the reasonable career expectations of the majority of the professional staff at DSTO. At this meeting a committee was formed (The Professional Officers' Action Committee) with the purpose of working with the DSTO management and the relevant associations to find a way of resolving this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>A subsequent survey by the committee of Professional Officers within the DSTO has identified a further substantial group with concerns on this issue. There has thus been identified a total of over three hundred non-Research Scientist Professional Officers who are concerned about their career prospects as a result of this award. This is a very large proportion of this category of professional staff of the DSTO. </PARA>
<PARA>The enclosed petition is a result of the outcome of the different paths employed to implement the Structural Efficiency Principle at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, as applied to Professional Officers and Research Scientists. The determination for Research Scientists was brought about by a work value case while the Professional Officer Technologists were not accorded equal treatment under the Professional Officer structure. </PARA>
<PARA>The petition is a register of protest by a large . . . cross-section of those previously surveyed, and indicates the extent of the feeling of these important members of the Defence Community, regarding:</PARA>
<PARA>1)  Loss of career prospects within DSTO for Professional Officers against Research Scientists. </PARA>
<PARA>2)  Loss of salary relativity of Professional Officers with respect to Research Scientists without a demonstrated change in relative work value. </PARA>
<PARA>3)  Diminution of the professional status of Professional Officers through a policy of denial of Senior Management positions to Professional Officers in DSTO. </PARA>
<PARA>4)  Deterioration of workplace relations between Professional Officers and Research Scientists. </PARA>
<PARA>  5) Less flexible working arrangements between Professional Officers and Research Scientists. </PARA>
<PARA>  6) Professional Officers performing work and carrying responsibility at the same level as Research Scientists but receiving a lesser level of professional recognition and remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that a gross misunderstanding of the values of this category of Defence Professional has taken place vis-a-vis that accorded to the Research Scientist category. It has to be understood that a very large part of the acquisition, enhancement, capability improvement and life extension of all the Services' equipment is primarily undertaken by non-Research Scientists. </PARA>
<PARA>What is particularly relevant is that the new award to the Research Scientists was made under the guise of the SEP and, it was claimed, was based on the similar CSIRO re-structuring. In both areas there has been demonstrable misrepresentation. In the first instance there is no way in which the spirit of SEP can have been enhanced by this biased decision and, in the second instance, the CSIRO case explicitly combines the Research Scientists, Experimental Scientist/Officers, Engineers and other professionals in a single structure which recognises skills and abilities, not prime degrees. </PARA>
<PARA>It is noted that the Prime Minister's Science Council has recently considered the state of engineering in this country and what ought to be done about it. That development of a strong engineering base is crucial to the return of a prosperous economy, is internationally acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has for years suffered from an `egg head' syndrome, in so much as this country produces an imbalance of Scientists in relation to Engineers and other Technologists, compared with other developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA>For instance, Australia has three science graduates to Japan's one, Germany's one and USA's one. By comparison, we have one engineering graduate to Japan's five, Germany's three and USA's two. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The policy adopted by the DSTO is to further repress the very talents that are needed both in Defence and in Industry to make this country prosperous again. </PARA>
<PARA>While, in the case of DSTO, senior management positions are denied to Engineer and other Professional Officers, the best interests of the ADF are not being served. That such a unique and valuable personnel resource is being lost to Australian Defence by inept management is unacceptable. Balance between Science and Technology is required to ensure that the necessary breadth of support is available and can be provided to the ADF both in peacetime and in times of National emergency. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Professional Officers want to achieve is:</PARA>
<PARA>  1. An acknowledgment that Technology is equally as important as Science in support of the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA>  2. A reinstatement of not less than previous relativities between Research Scientists and Professional Officer Technologists (viz. Engineers and Experimental Officers). </PARA>
<PARA>  3. The re-establishment of a Professional Officer senior management structure (cf. CSIRO Senior Specialist in attachments) aligned with its own field of responsibility to give proper credence to the term `Technology', in the organisation's title: Defence Science and Technology Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  4. To establish (if required, through the same work value path used in the case of the Research Scientists) the principles and foundation of a balanced structure between Research Scientists and Professional Officer Technologists. </PARA>
<PARA>Your active support in this ambition is sought through this petition. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I would urge you to institute your own enquiries into this situation with a view to correcting the damaging effects it is having on the capability of the DSTO to respond to the needs of the ADF in a time of National crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very glad that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) was here today while I read that letter, because I think it is a very important letter which should be taken into serious account by the Government. I hope that the Minister will do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the restructuring of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation was announced several years ago, the Opposition supported the moves which the Government was proposing to make to give greater emphasis to the scientists and engineers in that organisation and less to the tradesmen, if you like, who were used in the development of projects. The emphasis was--rightly, we believed--on the fact that developmental work was properly and usefully the province of private industry, which could work in cooperation with the DSTO, but that the innovation, the research and early developmental work were properly the province of the scientists and engineers of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I should point out that we have long had great difficulty in retaining scientists and engineers in public employment because of the salary levels which are applicable to such people in the public sector. It has been recognised that, if hopefully we are to retain them, there is a need to put whatever steps we can in place to improve their job satisfaction. The interest of the work, the opportunities to publish and the opportunities to attend national and international conferences go some way towards making up for the disparity in salary levels between the public and the private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I see what is happening to the engineers and technologists in the DSTO, I am concerned that the restructuring may result in our losing even more of these highly qualified people whom we have such great difficulty in retaining now and who are so valuable to both our defence and the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  I therefore urge the Minister for Defence to take this cry from the heart very seriously. We are talking about a substantial proportion of the work force of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and, as such, this matter should not be taken lightly. I would appreciate it if the Minister would take this issue on board and, hopefully, explain to the Opposition, possibly by way of a response in the Parliament when he has an opportunity to do so, why this restructuring at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is being undertaken, bearing in mind the effects which it appears to be having. I would like the Minister's assurances that the interests of the nation and the defence forces are going to be paramount in any consideration of the petition from these employees of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 will be receiving the support of the Opposition. Indeed, if had not been for the Opposition, I doubt that this Bill would ever have seen the light of day. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) may laugh but it was the Minister and his Government that managed to remove the entitlement of these personnel for a war service loan in the first place. It was only after the Opposition pointed this out to the Government and insisted that action be taken that this measure was introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in fact originally denied that such action had been taken. If the Minister for Defence is not aware of the inadequacies of his colleague, let me put it clearly on the record that Minister Bilney claimed to me in correspondence that he was totally unaware that he had in fact allowed the removal of a war service loan entitlement from these people. </PARA>
<PARA>  I debated the question of the defence service home loans scheme the day that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was down on the wharves in Sydney, just before Christmas, farewelling men and women leaving for the Gulf while at the same time taking away their entitlement to a war service home loan. That legislation was then going through this Parliament. The effect of the new legislation was to remove a war service home loan entitlement from anybody who joined the Defence Force after May 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proportion of young people in the Navy is fairly high, as I am sure the Minister is aware. That meant that a high proportion of young people going away in the Gulf fleet no longer had an entitlement to a war service loan. I acknowledge that it had been announced that there would be a waiver of the six-year waiting period for a defence service home loan, but it was not much use to someone who was injured and invalided out, and, if someone was killed and his wife wanted a defence service home loan, it was effectively removed altogether.  Those men and women who went away to the Gulf were the first service personnel since World War I who had served in war but were not eligible for a war service loan. That is the reason we have this legislation before us today. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to read into Hansard something else that the Minister might like to take on board relating to war service loans. On 4 December, during the debate on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill, I pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this legislation will not apply to reservists in the Gulf. Further, this legislation contains reversionary benefits allowing the surviving spouse of a regular serviceman who is killed still to be eligible for the loan calculated on his prospective service had he not been killed. This, it would appear, does not flow on to reservists in the same situation. Why are they so different in what is supposed to be an integrated force?</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, that issue has still not been addressed. It needs to be. </PARA>
<PARA>  Minister Bilney, on 28 May, put out a press release announcing that there would now be home loan assistance for ADF members with Gulf service. That is when finally the Government acknowledged that it had made a boo-boo and that it did need to do something about home loan assistance for the Australian Defence Force members who had served in the Gulf. Minister Bilney trumpeted that he had introduced this home loan assistance but he failed to acknowledge that the reason people did not have the home loan assistance in the first place was that his Government had removed it in May 1987, when it concluded the old scheme. When it introduced legislation for the new scheme in December last year there was no provision for war service loans. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am glad to see that the Government has taken our advice. It is now facing up to its responsibility and has decided to do the right thing by those who served during the Gulf conflict. But at the time when it sent those people away it was not to know that there would be no casualties. It is important that we have in place ahead of time a clear set of guidelines for overseas service, whether it is peacekeeping or war service, so that people know what they are entitled to--rather than having to change things around after the event as we are doing today with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is not the only area where the Government has fouled up on defence service home loans. Just last month I spoke in this place, in debate on a matter of public importance, about a case that was then before the AAT. That is a most unsatisfactory situation: there is concurrent usage by two defence spouses of their dual eligibility. The Government has long administered the home loan scheme so that there is no entitlement to take up that dual eligibility concurrently; in fact, people have been knocked back for some considerable period. What happened was that this year the AAT said that this was wrong and that legally people should be entitled to take up concurrent eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am glad the true legal situation was finally recognised. What is so despicable is that since April this year there has been a continual stream of correspondence between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence about whether they are going to own up to this. I am very sad to say that the Department of Defence was arguing quite strongly that people should not get the opportunity to exercise their lawful eligibility because it would mess up the arrangements which the Government had made with the National Bank for the sale of the defence mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Veterans' Affairs Department, to give it its due, seemed to be pushing to get that opportunity made available to Defence Force personnel, but, sad to say, the matter dragged on and on. I understand that eventually it had to be decided in Cabinet that this concurrent eligibility was to be announced. When was it announced? It was announced on 22 August this year. The interesting thing about that date is that 31 August was the last day on which Defence Force personnel who had this entitlement could decide whether they would stay in the old housing scheme or would revoke that entitlement and go into the new scheme. But in order to make that decision they had to be informed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister's announcement on 22 August gave them eight or nine days in which to make that decision. Unfortunately, many people would not have known about the Minister's announcement in time. In addition, in the months prior to that many people would have been revoking their entitlement. They had the opportunity through the year up to 31 August to revoke their entitlement under the old scheme and opt into the new scheme. In many respects the old scheme is better, but there was one advantage to the new scheme: a couple could exercise their eligibility concurrently and thus make it a meaningful loan on a home at today's high home costs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem that is still facing defence personnel is that there needs to be some legislation produced in this Parliament if those people who have ignorantly revoked that entitlement are to be put back in the situation of being able to exercise the rights which the law says they had all along. I am glad of this opportunity to make it quite clear to the Minister that I will not let up on this and that I hope he will not, either. I hope that very soon we will see more amending legislation coming before this Parliament on the defence service home loans, so that we will put people into the position in which they should have been in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not wish to take the time of the Senate any longer on a Bill which, as I said at the beginning, is coming to this Parliament because we pushed for such a Bill. We are very glad to see that the people who went to the Gulf are going to get their entitlement to a war service home loan restored, but I challenge the Minister as to why this is being limited to people who served in the Gulf. Does it mean that he believes we have reached nirvana and we will never more commit people to a situation where their lives may be at risk in the defence of this country or in pursuance of its interests?</PARA>
<PARA>  If the Minister believes that we are likely to have to do that at some time in the future, why is it that we are not restoring the position where everybody who had served this country in war since 1918 knew that they would have an entitlement to a war service loan? When is the Government going to restore that for those who in the future may have to give their lives for this country?</PARA>

I must say, however, that immediately at the start of the Gulf conflict, when we made a decision to commit several wings of our Defence Force to that conflict, we had discussions in my office with a variety of people to make sure that people's allowances and entitlements would be properly looked after and that if there were inconsistencies future legislation would overcome them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will be brief. I do not wish to challenge the legislation, which seeks to make provisions regarding the honey levy. We have no disagreement whatsoever with that purpose. In line with the user pays principle, the producers of honey, the farmers who collect honey from the bees, are helping to pay for things such as research and development of the industry, and this is fair enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think we should be concerned that a lot of attention is paid to the honey industry. It is important to note that more regard could be paid to the other functions that are performed by bees. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would be aware that bees play a role in the horticultural industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, bees are very much like worms in that they are very effective, if underpaid, agricultural workers. </PARA>
<PARA>  We rely upon bees to fertilise the majority of our horticultural crops. Apiarists are, in fact, contracted and paid to bring hives of bees into fields of broad acre vegetables at the appropriate time to ensure that fertilisation takes place. This, of course, is especially important for crops such as peas, beans and tomatoes. It is also important for crops such as poppies which are grown for seed purposes rather than for their fruit. This process is less important for crops such as corn, which are essentially wind fertilised. But bees are certainly of considerable importance to the Tasmanian horticultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also important, I believe, to recognise that these contributors to our horticultural economy are particularly vulnerable to the aerial spraying of insecticides. There is an incident that I am aware of, again in Tasmania, related to over-spraying. A particular winery in the Tamar Valley was subjected to over-spray in recent months, and not only were the plants injured but the work of the bees was certainly hampered. Attempts are made to justify the practice of aerial spraying, but I want to alert the Senate to the complications and the far-reaching effects which may arise from what may seem to be a simple practice. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not unlike, nor is it unrelated to, what happened last spring on the lawns which cover this Parliament House building. Observant senators would have noticed that sprays were applied to the grounds, ostensibly to rid the place of some sort of pest. I cannot remember what the pest was and I did not even see it. Observant senators would have noticed that the worms were most effectively killed, and that recently extra attention has been necessary to aerate the soil--the job that the worms might have done. I wonder what that has cost. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to make this a big issue, but I think it is important when we are considering such matters that we remind ourselves that we are part of a very complicated set of interrelated and interdependent organisms. To be able to sustain the ecology in which we live and to continue to derive benefit from it, as we do when we derive the benefits from workers such as bees and worms, we should be aware of how our actions affect them. With that contribution to the understanding of the ecology of the earth, I conclude my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA>HONEY LEVY (No. 1)</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1991   This Bill provides for amendment to increase the maximum allowable Honey Levy on honey produced and sold in Australia. The Bill is one of three similar Bills, each dealing with a different way of selling honey, which provide for an increase in the maximum allowable levies or export charge on honey to 0.75 cent per kilogram. The levies and export charge are imposed to provide the basis for funding the Honeybee Research and Development Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the present legislation the maximum allowable levy for research and development is 0.50 cent per kilogram, which is the same as the current operative rate. The operative rate is determined by Regulation on advice of the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Associations, which is the national representative beekeeper organisation, or the Honeybee Research and Development Council. The Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Associations has advised that it wishes to increase the operative rate to 0.52 cent per kilogram from January 1992 as part of its program of progressively increasing the producer contribution to research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  To allow for this increase and any further increases, the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Associations has requested the raising of the maximum rate to 0.75 cent per kilogram. Increasing the maximum rate by 50 per cent will give industry the flexibility to increase its contributions to research and development over an extended period without the need for frequent amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government commends the industry's foresight and support of the need for increased research and development. The Australian honey industry is currently contributing about 0.4 per cent of its gross value of production to research and development. Research and development is a major factor underlying this country's future growth. The Government is committed to continued matching of industry levies for funding of research and development up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. This has continued to encourage rural industries to increase their contributions to research and clearly the honey industry recognises the advantage of this commitment in moving towards the 0.5 per cent target. </PARA>
<PARA>  No additional budgetary outlays will result from the amendment itself. However, this amendment would enable the Government to agree to an industry request for an operative rate increase above the current maximum, which would then generate additional matching budgetary outlays. I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>HONEY LEVY (No. 2)</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1991   This Bill provides for amendment to increase the maximum allowable Honey Levy on honey produced in Australia and used in the production of other goods. The Bill provides for an increase in the maximum allowable levy to 0.75 cent per kilogram. The levy is imposed to provide the basis for funding the Honeybee Research and Development Council. I have already outlined the background to this amendment in my Second Reading Speech on the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  No additional budgetary outlays will result from the amendment itself. However, this amendment would enable the Government to agree to an industry request for an operative rate increase above the current maximum, which would then generate additional matching budgetary outlays. I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>HONEY EXPORT CHARGE</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill provides for amendment to increase the maximum allowable Honey Export Charge on honey exported, but not levied under other legislation. The Bill provides for an increase in the maximum allowable export charge to 0.75 cent per kilogram of honey. The export charge is imposed to provide the basis for funding the Honeybee Research and Development Council. I have already outlined the background to this amendment in my Second Reading Speech on the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The coalition supports the Honey Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill. The honey industry is a small industry in comparison with other rural industries such as the wool, wheat, cattle and dairy industries. However, it still plays a valuable and efficient role within the rural sector. The figures from the 1989-90 annual report of the Australian Honey Board mentions that Australia generally produces 22,000 to 24,000 tonnes of honey a year. There are approximately 800 beekeepers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of this honey production, Australia exported over half, about 12,000 to 13,000 tonnes, which gained an export income of somewhere between $16m and $17m. Those exports went mainly to the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, the United States and Japan. Beeswax was also exported. Even so, Australia is a small producer compared with the worldwide honey industry. The 1989-90 annual report of the Australian Honey Board goes on to say that world production was 690,000 tonnes, with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the largest producer at 225,000 tonnes. China was the second largest producer at 180,000 tonnes. Australia was eighth on this world ranking. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia undoubtedly commands natural advantages over our competitors. There are long hours of sunshine and a wide range of nectar laden native trees, which assist in producing honey that has both quality and flavour just as good as, if not better than, that of our competitors. However, the Australian industry has not been taking advantage of this situation. Consequently, too many bulk products, rather than branded products, have been sold on the open market. The Australian Honey Board believes that the future prosperity of the Australian honey industry lies in its ability to recognise and pursue marketing opportunities when they arise. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australian honey has been valued on colour and viscosity, regardless of source--a practice that ignores many other fine qualities of our honey and, hence, limits the potential to command higher prices and increased consumer demand. Consequently, this has led to a decline in real incomes for Australian honey producers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Due to the fact that Australia commands only 4 per cent of world trade, when honey is sold in bulk it must be sold at whatever the world price is. The Australian industry is not large enough to influence the price. This means that Australian honey producers in the future will move towards a brand product which can maintain a better price in a difficult marketing situation. There is very much a need within the industry for promotion and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the present time, the honey industry is paying a levy of 0.45c per kilogram of honey for research and development. The standard dollar for dollar arrangements have been bipartisan for many years and go back well before the 1985 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year the industry provided $129,000 and that was matched by the Commonwealth. The Federal Council of the Australian Apiarists Association wants to increase the maximum level beyond the 0.5c per kilogram to 0.75c so that it can increase the operative level from the present 0.45c to 0.52c per kilogram in order to maintain the research and development process. This will also get it closer to the maximum set by the Government, which seems to be a sensible goal. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the present time, all of these rural industries have a maximum level of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production, while the actual levy or operative level is about 0.4 per cent. My colleague in the other chamber, the honourable member for Murray and shadow Minister for primary industries, Mr Bruce Lloyd, questioned what research arrangements were best for smaller industries to ensure that the dollar for dollar arrangement continues. </PARA>
<PARA>  I agree with Mr Lloyd. This arrangement is an important one. The industry is contributing to research when many non-rural industries in Australia do nothing about this activity. Therefore, the dollar for dollar arrangement with the Government is a basis for some stability. In good times and in bad, the rural industry provides the money, which is a valuable concept. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the honey industry undoubtedly has a natural advantage in Australia and I can only hope that it strengthens in the future. It should be able to become a bigger and better industry in the sense of not only providing more in quality but also by being able to upgrade its quality image and maximise its return in the market.  The coalition supports this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have repeatedly said in the Senate at Question Time that I was not prepared to forecast in respect of a number of matters including the unemployment figure. As has been pointed out here on a number of occasions, the Government, through the Budget Papers, did make a forecast in respect of unemployment through the year. The anticipation was that unemployment would increase in the first half of the fiscal year 1991-92 and trend downwards in the second half of this fiscal year. I repeat that Budget estimate or forecast. I remind the Senate, in confirmation of that, that unemployment is a lagged indicator of the state of the economy and economic activity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Well, the trend in unemployment from the June-July figures was totally different from the trend, if one could draw a trend, from the August figures. There has been a certain volatility in the figures. It is very difficult to be confident about trends in the unemployment rate over the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are a number of business and other surveys which, I suspect, indicate support for that Budget forecast. They include: the State Bank of New South Wales and Chamber of Manufacturing survey of business conditions which reports the best results in business conditions since before the recession; the National Australia Bank and the Westpac-CAI surveys are similarly positive about business conditions; the Dun and Bradstreet report on business conditions released this morning found that confidence is returning with new orders increasing and the expectation of profits will rise with the fall in interest rates; and the Department of Employment, Education and Training leading index on unemployment has risen for the fourth consecutive month in relation to the month of August. I refer to that material only to support the scenario established in the Budget Papers in relation to what would happen to the unemployment figures during this financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As usual, Senator Kemp is about six years behind the times. I was one who toyed with the consumption tax until I worked out that I could not compensate these people. The difference between those opposite and me is that I stopped when I realised that, whereas those opposite bat on harder because they care so little about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The social security figures show that there are four million adults and 1.3 million children who are dependent on pensions, benefits and family allowance supplements paid by the Department of Social Security. There are some 400,000 to 500,000 adults--with an unknown number of children--who are outside those boundaries, who are earning so little that they are not included but who do not qualify for social security for other reasons. They might be self-employed in small business with assets but they are very income poor. We are talking about a lot of people who have very real difficulties. The trouble is that it is almost impossible to compensate them through the social security system. First of all, those age pensioners who have savings do not get compensated for any loss in savings at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We do not worry about what Senator Kemp thinks because, unlike the rest of the world, no one cares. As far as the Opposition is concerned, no-one is suggesting there should be any compensation for savings. So they just go. The drop in the savings is just forfeited. Those pensioners who saved all their lives so that they could have some little comfort have to understand that they will get absolutely nothing for those savings. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To try to protect social security clients fully, there needs to be some compensation for that inflation increase, the CPI increase, which even the Liberal Party would concede is some 7 to 10 per cent. Obviously, the rate of compensation for pensioners will have to be higher. How one does that I do not know. People with less money--and that means families with children--are the ones that struggle. One wonders just how those who spend the great part of their income on basic necessities also get compensated.</PARA>

There is no plan--not even under consideration in the darkest recesses of the most evil mind--to compensate them, absolutely none. They are offered nothing. Therefore, we have a list of 5 1/2 million Australians, plus some children that we cannot yet count--so let us look at a nice round figure of six million--who cannot be compensated either at all or adequately. They are all people at the lower end of the income scale. More than one-third of Australia will be devastated by a consumption tax and no-one opposite will give any details--not just to us but neither to the six million.

The fact of the matter is that the Government projected at the time of the Budget--with great regret, of course--that unemployment would be likely to rise during the first half of this fiscal year, and that it would improve in the second half of this fiscal year. Those figures were provided in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that we have a situation of unemployment arising from a recession and a high level of structural change in the Australian economy. Those two factors are contributing to the present levels of unemployment. In so far as the bulk of that unemployment figure is concerned, it is dependent upon growth in the Australian economy. I have nothing to add to what I said earlier about the predictions which are set out in the Budget and the various comments I made from independent commentators about a return to growth in the economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would have thought that all honourable senators would have been interested in how the poor in Australia have fared during the course of the last eight years. There have been a few studies which have suggested that the rich got richer and the poor got poorer; some people in this chamber have even chosen to use those studies on occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, I think Senator Maguire is referring to the study by Mark Lombard who looked at this question and came to the conclusion that the poor had, indeed, got poorer. The difficulty was that he looked only at taxable income and that, of course, is a pretty inadequate measure by which to judge any of this. In fact, he qualified his own study when he released it. His words were:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no attempt to assess changes in wealth distribution nor to measure standards of living.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite his own qualification, he managed to make that very same link. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Absent from this study, therefore, are changes in welfare provisions, changes in the taxation on expenditure, the cost of living, et cetera. This study is confined to income distribution in Australia, as measured by taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA>There are so many things outside of taxable income that can measure just how families are doing that it makes such a study virtually irrelevant.</PARA>

Communications with other republics in Yugoslavia are still possible. We believe that most mail is getting through, but some towns and villages in Croatia cannot be reached.</PARA>
<PARA>  To some extent, we foresaw that this predicament might arise if things got serious, as it had also been the problem in other situations, such as Kuwait, where we were caught up with this kind of consular communication issue. The first of two circular letters was sent to all Australian citizens in Croatia suggesting that they consider relocating themselves to safer places. That letter was sent on 1 August, well before communications were cut off.</PARA>
<PARA>  A second letter with similar advice was dispatched on 27 September, and in case some did not reach their destination the message was also broadcast on Bosnia-Herzegovina radio. The second letter was sent to about 2,000 Australian citizens in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and by 7 October only some 20 letters had been returned to the Embassy as being undeliverable. There had, of course, been earlier advice about the security situation in the country through my Department's travel advices, the first of which was issued on 19 April. Given the dangers of travelling to and within Croatia, senators will appreciate that there are constraints on our own staff in Belgrade travelling there at present.</PARA>
<PARA>  As for the very last question about the situation in Dubrovnik, the fact that there are no telephone communications between the Adriatic coastal ports and Belgrade does complicate access to information regarding the latest developments. According, however, to the latest information available--as of last evening, 9 October--from EC monitoring forces present in Dubrovnik, there had been no damage at all to the historic section of the city. We can all only hope that that situation will continue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Land Transport has provided me with a response to Senator Beahan's question. The Minister is aware of proposals by the Australian National Railways Commission to operate the Indian Pacific rail service and that these could only be effectively implemented if the service can be placed under single management. The recent offer by New South Wales to transfer control of the Indian Pacific to Australian National is encouraging and the Minister would urge that the Western Australian Government follow suit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government recognises that airline deregulation has substantially affected loadings on this service and that it is important that some way be found to attract patronage back to the service if it is to survive in the long term. This view is shared by Federal and State transport Ministers, who at the 4 October 1991 meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council instituted a study of the options for the future of interstate rail passenger operations and a report to the March 1992 meeting of the Council. The study will consider the possibility of establishing a national rail passenger organisation and will as a matter of priority consider the Indian Pacific service. The management and operation of the train, however, are matters for the operator of the service and the Government expects that these matters will be satisfactorily addressed once improved institutional arrangements are implemented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I do not think that even Brian Toohey would take any insult over the fact that he has yet to write an article that has ever been complimentary about Australia's strategic outlook or about our defence forces. As usual, when he writes on these matters there is a fair degree of licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  First, Mr Toohey seems to think that because there was a reduction in super-power tension we should be involved in a contraction of the Australian defence forces. He also grossly misunderstands our defence planning. He still assumes that it is based on expeditionary aspirations, and on some subservience to our allies in terms of the equipment purchases that we make. I have to assert that our capabilities are very much tailored to our own needs and not to those of our allies. Wherever we can adopt practices of inter-operability, we do so because it makes sense.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Toohey article is wrong in some of the figures it uses. He asserts that the Oberon standard displacement is 1,600 tonnes compared with 2,500 tonnes for the Collins class. In fact, that figure for the Collins class is the dive displacement figure rather than the standard displacement. The surface displacement of the Oberon is 2,030 tonnes whereas the Collins class is 2,450 tonnes. He continually asserts that the Collins class submarine is much bigger than the Oberon; in fact, it is about a foot less in width, and slightly shorter.</PARA>
<PARA>  Overall, the article lacks any real strategic sense. The facts in the article are grossly wrong. I have to say that this Government, for good reason, rejected the option of nuclear powered submarines, on the grounds of both cost and excess capability. We also rejected the options for smaller submarines because of their lack of endurance.</PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the decision to buy the Collins class submarine has been reinforced in my mind as a correct decision by the number of other countries in the region and also in the Commonwealth that have come to look at the project and to admire and compliment us on it. Virtually universally, they have said that this is the best conventional submarine in the world. That very much reinforces our view of it and, I think, very much runs contrary to Mr Toohey's comment.</PARA>

<PARA>  On the substance of the question, I did see that there was an item in the Australian today which referred to a letter that I had supposedly written to the Prime Minister. Senator Alston does not know much about these things--perhaps he does not know much about anything--but if he read the piece in the Australian properly, he would have seen what the alleged letter was sent to the Prime Minister for. Perhaps he does not understand that.</PARA>
<PARA>  The point of Senator Short's question is essentially about business taxation. The fact of the matter is that this Government reviewed a whole range of taxation issues in 1988, including business taxation. For example, at that time we set a corporate tax rate which was low for the overall OECD group of countries. From time to time, business tax regimes are reviewed. That major review in 1988 is three years old now, and it is appropriate to take stock of business tax arrangements further, particularly given the changes which have taken place in other countries in the intervening period.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, that review process is implemented in light of many taxation reforms that have already been made, such as the introduction of capital gains tax, but the review of business taxation and other forms of taxation is done on an ongoing basis. There will be further discussion of these matters. I confirm that that is taking place as part of the process of government.</PARA>

<PARA>  Opposition senators interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Then we will both bore them to sobs. The report of the UN expert group, which was released on 23 September, makes the following recommendations: states are encouraged to make all their military activities as open as possible; states should ensure that they have in place the legal and administrative machinery for effectively regulating and monitoring their arms transfers; a universal and non-discriminatory arms transfer register should be established as soon as possible under UN auspices, with the specifics of the register to be further developed within that UN framework; states should be encouraged to engage in efforts to achieve regional and subregional measures of transparency in relation to arms transfers; the wider sharing of information on defence might be reflected in the provision of information to the UN or in the context of possible regional measures, or both; and, finally, all states should give high priority to eradicating the illicit arms trade, with the UN having a role to play in this area in increasing international awareness of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As to the second part of the question, specifically in relation to paragraph 148 of the report, it is true that the experts have said that the international transfer of conventional arms should not be primarily driven by economic or commercial considerations. We, the Australian Government, agree with this. But this assertion by the experts needs to be read in the context of the report as a whole, which is focused on restraining excessive transfers of conventional arms and encouraging governments to exercise strict controls on exports. Most significantly, the report does not suggest that exports as such are not legitimate. Indeed, it specifically recognises `the sovereign right of states to acquire arms for their defence', and that `arms transfers cannot be considered necessarily destabilising'.</PARA>
<PARA>  As to the last part of the question, the UN experts group was established to facilitate proper UN consideration of this whole issue. That consideration is currently occurring, with what I am advised are vigorous efforts currently under way in New York in which Australia is actively engaged, to achieve a widely agreed General Assembly resolution on this issue. We hope very much that such a resolution can be achieved and Australia, as it always seeks to do, will observe any obligations which such international action imposes on us.</PARA>
<PARA>  Specifically, finally, with respect to paragraph 152 of the report, Australia, of course, already has a well-established legal and administrative regime to control and monitor conventional arms exports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to see that, in spite of the shadow portfolio changes which have taken place in the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot has picked up the great traditions of her Party articulated by a former spokesman on this issue. I do not know whether Senator Kernot was here earlier when I answered two or three questions about unemployment. First of all, I went through the Budget projections about growth in the Australian economy this fiscal year and changes in the employment figures. I do not propose to do that again because what I said is in Hansard. I do not necessarily recommend that Senator Kernot read that but, if she wants to read it, it is available to her in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   Senator Kernot then took a leap by asking the Government to adopt a more interventionist industry policy. This is something about which I have been questioned by the Australian Democrats over the years, although I have never quite understood what they meant by a more interventionist policy. I hope that now Senator Kernot has become the spokesperson she will be able to articulate that for us so that all of us will better understand it.</PARA>
<PARA>   Let me just say this: in terms of industry policy, let me be quite brutal about it. In 1990, no amount of what Senator Kernot might call interventionist industry policy would have helped companies that were paying very high interest rates. No amount of interventionist industry policy would have helped with those issues. If Senator Kernot looks at the consequences of industry policy in terms of employment, she will see that manufacturing employment in Australia grew by more than 100,000 in the four years to 1990. That was the first time there had been growth in employment in the manufacturing industry sector for year after year, indeed decades, going back to the late 1960s. That happened. In the first quarter of 1990, manufacturing employment in Australia was at its highest level for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, since then there has been a recession. The consequences of the recession have been very bad in respect of employment generally, which is the first part of Senator Kernot's question, and in respect of employment in manufacturing. As the economy comes out of the recession, as I said earlier, the employment position will improve. Whether there are any measures taken by the Government in respect of industry policy which might facilitate areas of particular employment is a matter to be determined. We will let Senator Kernot know in due course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Boswell could be forgiven for saying that it was a great article because when I got halfway through it I actually had to go back to the front cover to see whether it actually had a little note on it to say that it was a paid advertisement for the Federal Opposition. I do not believe that this article--and I invite any reasonable person who has not read it to read it and give his or her opinion; it is a major seven-page article on waterfront reform by the Reader's Digest--reflects well in any way at all on the journalistic standards of such a well-read publication as the Reader's Digest. It certainly does not. The blatant bias in this article is as breathtaking as I have seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   Also, I had to look at the front cover of Reader's Digest to see whether I was reading a five-year-old copy of the magazine because the information in it is so dated and inaccurate that it is simply ridiculous to include it. But I note that it is the most recent edition of the magazine.</PARA>
<PARA>  All of the sources and the information quoted in this article predate the Government's waterfront reform program and include, for example, a study of waterfront costs from 1988; examples of past inefficiencies from the 1989 Inter-State Commission report; anonymous quotes from `former' stevedoring employers--all of those quoted in this article are given anonymous names; there are little asterisks next to their names which note at the bottom of the page `not real name'--and, best of all, a reference to a 1989 quote from that well known expert on the waterfront, Senator Warwick Parer.</PARA>
<PARA>  The reason why it is worth noting this article is that not only is it inaccurate and grossly biased but also it was sent, I assume, to thousands of people, including all members of parliament; the copy sent to me had an accompanying letter from the Editor-in-Chief, Mr Hugh Vaughan-Williams, commending it to me and telling me that he hoped I would find it an informative article.</PARA>
<PARA>  I referred to one quote in the article from Senator Warwick Parer. I have to say, in fairness to the Reader's Digest, that there are only three politicians quoted in this article. This seven-page article on waterfront reform is dated October, this month. Three politicians are quoted: Senator Warwick Parer, John Sharp, the shadow Minister for waterfront reform, and John Hewson. That is it.</PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, John Hewson is quoted with approval by the Reader's Digest. I refer to the statement by Dr John Hewson that troops should be used on the waterfront. Despite the article in the Reader's Digest, which is a widely read magazine, being seven pages long, its description of the Government's waterfront reform program takes three sentences at the end of the article.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, I have seen an article promoting the ideas referred to in this question. It appeared in the Bulletin on 1 October. It consisted of an interview in part with Mr Howard, the shadow spokesperson from the Opposition on industrial relations. As I said yesterday, it again reveals that Mr Howard does know his slogans quite well but he does not know any detail or real background in the field of industrial relations. Certainly he does not stand up to journalistic probing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In this article, he committed, in my view and in the view of the industrial relations community, a major faux pas and destroyed his own credibility when he replied to the question, `If a union takes action to flow-on an enterprise agreement to other workplaces, what will a coalition government do?'. The reply to that question was, `The coalition government will deregister the union'.</PARA>
<PARA>  In this interview, Mr Howard was given several opportunities by the interviewer to get off the hook but he insisted on biting more deeply into the point of the hook and insisted on continuing with this argument that the union would be deregistered. Reading between the journalistic prose of the Bulletin one can see disbelief in the mind of the interviewer about what Mr Howard was saying.</PARA>
<PARA>  A number of questions arise from the assertion that if a union sought to flow on an enterprise agreement in another enterprise it would be deregistered. Assuming that deregistration could be achieved, the first one is: how would it stop leapfrogging from one award or agreement to another? Simply deregistering a union would not stop it.</PARA>
<PARA>  In fact it would put that organisation outside of the Industrial Relations Commission, where the checks and balances exist to direct its behaviour along more reasonable lines. It would put it outside of the law and give it complete freedom to go about doing the very thing that Mr Howard says is reprehensible. Presumably, if it was doing it within the system it would be able to survive outside of the system. Presumably, if it was being preyed on by a government when there are more reasonable courses of action to direct its behaviour, it would command support from other unions. The mere fact of its deregistration would do nothing to prevent the so-called alleged crime and do everything to encourage that type of practice.</PARA>
<PARA>  John should talk to Ian. It would help John Howard to talk to Ian Viner. Ian Viner was Minister for Industrial Relations in the Fraser Government for a short period. Mr Viner tried to talk about and act upon deregistration and learnt that in Australia there are seven industrial relations systems. The Commonwealth presides over one of them but there are six others in the States.</PARA>
<PARA>  If a union is deregistered at a national level there is no reason why that would automatically mean deregistration at a State level. If this behaviour that is complained of is reprehensible, then it can continue at a State level. What Mr Howard is talking about is in no way an antidote for the crime that he perceives to exist.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Section 294 of the Industrial Relations Act requires a Federal Court to be satisfied that a union's behaviour is sufficiently grave to warrant such an action. Looking at precedential law and the activities of the Federal Court in making judgments on these matters in the past, there are no grounds to assume that the Federal Court would hold that such behaviour was grave and warranted the action of deregistration. There is no reason to believe that the Federal Court would share Mr Howard's ideological obsessions as he has portrayed them in the article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I conclude the answer by saying that it is about time Mr Howard and the Opposition learnt that the best way to practise industrial relations in this country is to adopt the cooperative approach of this Government and not try to regurgitate the conflict approach of the Fraser years. He would find that the industrial relations system--if he could at least develop a nodding acquaintance with it --has the in-built checks and balances to resolve the problem, and I recommend he read section 115 of the Federal Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the Government's assurances in the March industry statement and in correspondence to industry bodies that strong anti-dumping and countervailing legislation would ensure fair competition in the domestic market for Australian farmers against highly subsidised imports, and in view of today's announcement that applications have been made to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to import 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes of wheat and barley into Australia--which would be subsidised, as the only countries, other than Australia, that do not subsidise are New Zealand and Argentina --will the Government give an unequivocal guarantee to the already hard-pressed Australian grain grower that he will not be further hit by unfair competition from highly subsidised imports on his domestic market, as he is in the corrupt world export market? Is the Minister aware that our anti-dumping laws will not stop this imported grain as, according to our anti-dumping laws, it takes at least 135 days before duties can be imposed and grain would firstly have to come into Australia and cause material injury before any action could be taken by the industry under the anti-dumping legislation?  Can the Minister tell the grain grower what action his Government intends to take to stop this unfair situation arising?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The advice given to me late this morning by Mr Crean's office is that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has not received any actual application for import permits for wheat or barley. That is not to say that such an application may not be received, but the question is perhaps a little premature in that light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The article in question to which Senator Boswell refers does point to the threat of some possible injury from future imports. It is my understanding that the legislation does allow for anti-dumping applications to be lodged on this basis. Mr Beddall, the Minister for Small Business and Customs, has advised me that he has asked the Australian Customs Service to contact the Grains Council of Australia to provide any guidance necessary for the Council to lodge any application that it might wish to in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>  More generally, the Government is very conscious of the need for timely and effective anti-dumping procedures. Senator Boswell will no doubt recall that in March this year in the course of the industry statement the Government did announce shorter times for the Australian Customs Service to conduct its preliminary inquiries. There is of course an ongoing review taking place at the moment as to some larger aspects of anti-dumping policy.</PARA>
<PARA>  In particular, the Government decided to strengthen those processes immediately by speeding up the processing of anti-dumping subsidisation complaints by Australian industries so that in most cases where there is injury to local producers provisional measures will be available 40 days sooner than at present. Better access to the system has now been provided for Australia's agricultural and horticultural producers--the immediate context to which Senator Boswell referred. Generally, the time taken for the first stage of the process--the prima facie stage--has been reduced from 55 to 35 days. Again, it is intended that there be an overall reduction of 40 days in the time taken to reach a preliminary finding.</PARA>
<PARA>  So Senator Boswell's reference to 135 days is, at least as I understand it, the outside term within which these actions can be effective. Certainly, a number of processes and procedures are in place to enable a faster action than that to be taken if the context so requires it. I repeat:  to the extent that some guidance may be necessary in response to a possible application that may be made to deal with a possible import application that may be made, the Customs Service is willing to provide that guidance.</PARA>

I was unable to answer that question yesterday; I did not even know of this allegation. I understand it came in the course of a royal commission hearing and it is not appropriate for the Government to comment on unsubstantiated statements or allegations which are made in the course of a royal commission hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, I can say that it was a well-known practice of the National Companies and Securities Commission to reach commercial settlements with companies in relation to matters arising from its supervision of the activities of those companies. The lack of enforcement action in relation to corporate law was a key factor in the Commonwealth and the States replacing the old regulatory structure with the Australian Securities Commission, which has as one of its principal objectives the investigation and enforcement of the corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA>  I add that, in a situation in which no one Minister or parliament--that is to say State or Federal--was responsible for corporate legislation, as was the case with the cooperative scheme under the national companies and securities legislation, it is no wonder that the law was not enforced properly. That is the reason why this Government made a commitment and established the Australian Securities Commission which, I have to remind honourable senators, the Opposition opposed.

<PARA>  Bernie McKay and Associates were engaged to carry out a consultancy jointly funded by the National Health Strategy and the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Committee. The consultancy formed the basis of issues paper No. 2 of the National Health Strategy. While Bernie McKay and Associates were the main consultants, the firm led a team including a number of subcontractors. Mr McKay's firm was selected following consideration of tenders from six consultants. The selection was made by the AHMAC working party on health care funding, which included representatives of the States and the Commonwealth as well as the peak public and private hospital organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>  The working party made its selection on the basis of the consultants' understanding of the project objectives, their strategic analysis and reporting capacity, their project planning and management ability, the expertise of team managers and the overall cost and value of the proposals. The proposal put by Bernie McKay and Associates ranked very well on all grounds and the firm was overall considered to be the most able to complete the contract at the lowest price. At $443,000, it was the third most expensive tender in a range from $250,000 to $900,000. After the original contract was let, the AHMAC working party and the National Health Strategy extended the contract to cover some additional related tasks at a cost of a further $85,000, bringing the total contract price to $528,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr McKay was the Secretary to the Department of Health in 1987 until the July 1987 machinery of government changes. The consultancy dealt with issues relating to the access to, demand for and financing of hospital services and had nothing to do with the issue of the $3.50 co-payment for medical services.</PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Herron on 9 October 1991, relating to the National Health Strategy Review. </PARA>
<PARA>The reply stated that the $528,000 consultancy dealt with issues related to access to, demand for and financing of hospital services. Hospital services account for 44 per cent of health care expenditure. The cost of the public hospital sector is increasing at 12 per cent per annum. These costs are related to the growth of medical services over all. In fact, yesterday the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have a problem in the growth of medical services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There was also a recognition that general practice required attention, both in the growth in the number of services in the general practice area and in the deterioration in the quality of the service being provided by general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>That is also absolutely correct. I further quote:</PARA>
<PARA>We have an oversupply of doctors in general practice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. He then went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Our concern is to get to the root of the matter, to develop good policy--</PARA>
<PARA>Note that he says `to develop good policy'; there is no good policy in action at the moment, but he is going to develop one. He has called in somebody for $528,000, or $2,467 per page, to give him a policy. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure that we get a handle on the costs so that we are able to restrain them in the longer term,</PARA>
<PARA>The root of the matter is not cost constraint; the root of the matter is that it is impossible to provide good quality health care with a scheme that is open-ended for the consumers who are bulkbilled at no cost and the provider doctors who bulkbill without constraint. The problem is Medicare itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA>Because we are proud of our achievement in implementing the most stable, efficient and equitable health care financing system in Australia's history--</PARA>
<PARA>Note the word `stable'. Health care costs in this country have been stable for 15 years. They were stable for seven years before this Government came to govern. It had nothing to do with Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister said the system was efficient. The Medicare levy and the amount that it has been bringing in has been dropping rapidly. It has dropped 25 per cent in the last four years. It is bringing in only 18 per cent of health care costs according to the current Budget estimates. The Prime Minister said that it is totally efficient. He also said it was equitable. This system has resulted in a position where quality of health care is available only to those who can afford it, and there are lengthening queues for those who cannot. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened as a result of this system? The use of pathology has increased 42 per cent per patient over last the five years; radiology has increased 26 per cent; medical services used per person have gone up 23 per cent in the last five years; health insurance rates have gone up 100 per cent in the last five years; and the use and cost of pharmaceuticals has doubled in the last eight years. Waiting lists have gone through the roof. Every day, 80,000 people are on waiting lists for elective surgery in this country. The number of doctors has increased by 50 per cent in the last 10 years, and only 23 per cent are practising outside the major centres. The gap between medical fees and the Medicare refund has doubled in the last five years. The demand for screening is increasing. The cost of the public hospital sector is increasing at 12 per cent per year. The level of private insurance has nearly halved. It was 70 per cent in 1983 when this Government came into office and it is now 45 per cent for the whole of Australia. The majority of those people are in the older age groups and are taking more out of the system than is being put in. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister claims that we are proud of our achievement in implementing the most stable, efficient and equitable health care funding system in Australia. He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The major concern has been to ensure that nothing that we do damages the rate of direct billing for general practice services. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very thing that is at the root of the whole problem, and he is going to do nothing about it. What this Government is trying to do is cost containment. Where is quality? It is not mentioned. All that the patient will get under the Government is more of the same--more cost containment, more rationing and more chaos in decision making, just as we have seen occurring at the moment in relation to the Government's small attempt at bringing in co-payment to restrain costs. The system is fundamentally flawed and it will not change until this Government goes out of office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-For the past month we have heard the bleating of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) in an attempt to get him out of the ALP Caucus policy revolt. In his brief to the Caucus subcommittee, set up to examine the original $3.50 co-payment proposal, Minister Howe said that any proposal would have to achieve the same fiscal result for the health area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In a doorstop interview on 3 September, Minister Howe again said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . .and any changes would have to be within the context of the Budget, in terms of the fiscal outcome. I mean we can't consider making changes that would shift the Budget's bottom line. I think the Caucus understands that the first consideration is certainly that the integrity of the Budget be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on in that same doorstop interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have to sustain the package, in terms of the Government's overall bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA>  In case Michelle Grattan had not heard what he said, he repeated that the bottom line had to be maintained and that the Budget should not be changed. The bottom line is that any change must meet the budgetary bottom line. Any change is a good policy and the criteria for good policy is set out in the resolutions. So three times Minister Howe reminded everybody that that was the case. In Question Time yesterday, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's Budget strategy will remain intact. . .</PARA>
<PARA>There we have what the Minister for Community Services and Health and the Prime Minister said about this matter. Mr Willis then got in on the act. Yesterday in answer to a question he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is the Government's objective to ensure that the Budget as announced is implemented and we will do everything in our power to ensure that happens. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have three Ministers--the Prime Minister, Minister Howe and Minister Willis --all telling us that the bottom line was that the budgetary implications would not change. We have all heard those senior Cabinet colleagues consistently maintaining that the bottom line of the Budget proposal must be maintained. But what has happened today? What did we hear today on the news waves? They scattered round last night. It is no wonder Government members were so grumpy in Question Time today. Until 3 o'clock this morning they were coddling together some other proposal to satisfy Caucus. They have come up with a proposal that can in no way preserve the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have done some rough calculations with the figures I have and it looks as though the proposal they are now putting forward would cost $100m. We heard three Ministers yesterday telling us that the bottom line was not going to change. They have been rolled. The Prime Minister has lost; Minister Howe will have lost; Minister Willis will have lost. But the way Mr Hawke keeps his numbers, the Left will have won. Mr Keating will also have lost because Mr Hawke will stay in power for just that little bit longer. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was rather pathetic to hear the Prime Minister yesterday in Question Time defending his ailing health system. Senator Herron quoted Mr Hawke, and I will quote him again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are proud of our achievement in implementing the most stable, efficient and equitable health care financing system in Australia's history--it is a pride that we all share. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Do not let Mr Hawke speak on my behalf or on my colleagues' behalf. We do not share that pride and I am sure it is the royal `we'; I am sure there are some people on the other side of the chamber who do not share that pride when they face their constituents who are waiting on elective surgery lists or who cannot afford to pay their health insurance premiums. I am certainly not proud of the massive waiting lists and all the other degradation of the health system that my colleague Senator Herron ably outlined. How can the Prime Minister make such a claim about our health system?</PARA>
<PARA>  Not only are there noticeable problems in the health care delivery system, but also the whole system has been grossly underfunded by the Medicare levy since its inception. Any members of the Australian public who think that their Medicare levy covers the cost of health care is deluded, misguided and misinformed. Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber can tell the public that that is not the case until they are blue in the face, but the Government is wrong. There is no doubt that the Government has no idea which way to turn to remedy the problems in the health system or, in fact, in our economy. It is fresh out of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the Senate that this ALP Government is divided not only over this issue but also over the leadership--the battle between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. It is divided over the media ownership issue; the third runway at Sydney; at a ministerial level on fast tracking; and now on the Medicare rebate issue. It is divided, divided and divided again on major issues. I remind the Senate, as we have been reminded, and as we have reminded the Government over and over again, of the saying, `If you can't govern your Party, you can't govern the country'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The number of consultants, reviews, surveys and Senate committees that have been set up to look at and try to cope with Medicare is unbelievable. Here we have another one costing half a million dollars. When the Government does know the problems on which it must eventually make a decision, it is just a sheer waste of money. The Government's health policy is a complete shambles. As of today, it has no health policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Two months ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said that there would be a $3.50 co-payment for bulkbilled patients. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) were rolled by their own members. Mr Hawke is a pathetic figure. He has been rolled by his Caucus. He is incapable of making any tough decisions because he is a prisoner of the Keating challenge. He is weak and pathetic and not a leader's bootlace. He cannot stick to a decision that has been made. He has come to the situation where meetings have been held--I do not know how many--and a committee has been set up. It has had three or four meetings, yet no decisions have been taken. At 6 o'clock tonight, there will be another Caucus meeting. Peter Walsh was right when he referred to the Prime Minister as `Old Jellyback'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, Senator Walsh. The whole integrity of the Budget is in a shambles. When do we debate the Budget? We are meant to pass the Appropriation Bills next week. Where are the figures? What will the figures be? We have absolutely no idea what the Government is putting forward. There has been no other time in Australia's history when we have not been able to debate the Budget figures and pass Appropriation Bills, not because of the Opposition taking opposing views but because the Government does not have a clue what to ask us to vote on. When are we getting the amended figures and what will they be?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We noted in the midday news that the Cabinet has come up with a new co-payment figure of $2.50. For heaven's sake, tell me the difference. If the Government is going to make a co-payment, then it has ruined its bulkbilling exercise anyway and it has acknowledged that the Opposition and the AMA have been right from the very beginning--bulkbilling will create overservicing. The Government has stuck by its plan to such a degree that it has created the biggest debt that is possible in the health care system. There are 75,000 people waiting to get into hospitals. The whole thing is a shambles and at last the Government is attempting to back off. But it is not willing to go the whole way. It is not willing to get rid of bulkbilling, except for the pensioners and the disadvantaged who we all agree should have access to bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government wants to give the Bonds and the Packers of this world the ability to get bulkbilling, and now it is saying that it will charge them $2.50 for the effort. The injustice of the whole thing is unbelievable. If the Government continues to tax the ordinary wage earner on $20,000 a year 38c in the dollar and it allows Packer and Bond--`Me mate Bondy' as far as Mr Hawke is concerned--to get bulkbilling and pay only $2.50, then all its credibility is shot. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will give those opposite a very quick run-down on the difference between a State that bulkbills and one that does not. In Tasmania, where we do not have any of those entrepreneurial clinics, bulkbilling by general practitioners amounts to 55.9 per cent of services. In New South Wales, the figure is 74.6 per cent; it has the entrepreneurial clinics. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cost of a doctor's fee per man, woman and child in New South Wales is $250, with 74.6 per cent bulkbilled. In Tasmania, the figure is $191, because only 55.9 per cent bulkbill. If the cost per capita in Tasmania, with our small population, equalled that of New South Wales, an additional $26.6m would be taken out of taxpayers' pockets through Medicare, all because of the Government's ideology. Imagine what the cost of that would be all over Australia. The Government will have to change. It will have to get rid of bulkbilling. For heaven's sake, the Government should have the courage to do it now and not fiddle around the edges, and for once let the Prime Minister show true leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are three members of the Labor Government here today to debate this issue. If one is looking for any symbolism about the lack of concern of this Government for the record levels, the disastrous levels, of unemployment in Australia, this is the symbol. The Government could not care less. It has done nothing about it and the situation is getting worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In Question Time today we saw how the Government had no answers and, in fact, no knowledge of what is happening to unemployment. I asked Senator Button whether he could give us any sort of guarantee, any sort of undertaking, that unemployment would not reach 11 per cent. I asked him that because we all remember the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), whom Senator Button represents in this chamber, giving one of his usual solemn undertakings a year ago that unemployment would not reach 10 per cent. He said, `The truth'--as if the Prime Minister would recognise it if he fell over it--`is this: unemployment will not reach double digits'. The only double digits that I suppose Mr Hawke was thinking of were those gestures made to him as a result of his growing unpopularity, as a result of his total inability to tell the truth. Mr Keating can attest to that. Deals done before witnesses are not abided by. How would we expect a solemn obligation, a solemn undertaking, that there would be no double digit inflation to be true?  Here we have another recklessly made and readily broken promise. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today, I asked Senator Button, as Mr Hawke's representative, whether unemployment would reach 11 per cent. Senator Button could give no undertaking, no guarantees. He was given plenty of opportunity to do so. Senator Alston pressed him about what he was doing, what plans the Government had, what action it would take and what response it would make to the dissidents within its own ranks, such as the Victorian Premier and the former Treasurer, who was discovered busily on the road to Damascus. Of course, Senator Button had no response, gave no undertakings and made no promises. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose one could say that Senator Button was being sensible; after all, Mr Hawke's promises are worthless. Perhaps Senator Button did not want to discredit his own standing. He did not even relay any of Mr Hawke's attitudes on the present situation. The problem is that, if this Government does not know what is happening, has no idea what the unemployment level is likely to be--it clearly has no perception of how to deal with the problem--what hope is there for Australians, the Australians who are out of work,  the 10.2 per cent of Australians who cannot get jobs, the close to 30 per cent of young Australians, when this Government, firstly, does not know what is happening and, secondly, has no plans to correct it, no plans to fix it up? The claim that it has no plans to fix it up is coming from the mouths of the Australian Labor Party dissidents themselves such as Mr Keating, who is calling for action because the Government is not being successful. </PARA>
<PARA>  At this stage all we have in front of us--Senator Button restated it today--is the Budget forecast that unemployment would rise in the first half of the year to 10.75 per cent and ease in the second half to average about 10 1/2 per cent. It is the overwhelming view of economists and business people that this huge unemployment rate will remain for years. That is unlike the 1983 recession when the unemployment level was due to Australia's worst drought in 50 years. When it rained the level of unemployment began to fall. It will take a lot more than rain, or even Mr Hawke's tears, to bring about a fall in unemployment this time. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current situation is not drought induced;  this recession has been engineered by Mr Keating. He proudly said so. If this Government has the capacity to engineer a recession, maybe some people think it might have the capacity to engineer a recovery. I do not believe it has. </PARA>

<PARA>  Just how bad are these figures?  Sometimes I wonder, when the Government seeks to defend them, whether it understands just how bad they really are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, their mates have got jobs and apparently, as we heard in Question Time, they are getting huge pay rises. Here we have a situation where there are fewer than two job vacancies for every 100 unemployed. The number of Australians out of work is 872,100 which, according to the official figures, is the highest in Australia's history. That is up 38 per cent in one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On top of all the official unemployed, there are the unofficial unemployed being hidden in job schemes and funded through various schemes. On top of that again there is massive underemployment. Over the last 12 months, despite this huge rise in the number of people unemployed, there has been an increase of 75,000 people who cannot get full time jobs and can only get part time jobs. These people have been saved from joining the unemployment queues only because they have been able to find part time jobs. So the figure for the total number of people who are employed, in a sense, does not give a clear indication of the collapsing job opportunities; the disaster that is facing so many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the last 12 months 243,000 full time jobs were wiped out. When a quarter of a million jobs are wiped out in a 12-month period, one has to look to see what the Government has done about it, what it is planning to do about it and whether it has any intention of doing anything about it. The main question is: does the Government understand the consequences of engineering that kind of job loss? That is what Mr Keating did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, this is a new definition of social justice. The Government is prepared to weep about the unemployed but not prepared to give them jobs. Of the quarter of a million full time jobs lost, 100,000 were youth jobs that have been wiped out and 200,000 were male jobs that have been wiped out. It is now clear that it is not simply a question--as early in the recession it tended to be--of the majority of job losses being caused by employers not being prepared to put on new workers. We are now getting into the severe retrenchment end--the wiping out of jobs which takes place in a solid, severe recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The current huge unemployment rate--and the job loss, of course--is despite a slightly lower participation rate of 63.4 per cent than existed at the same time last year. In this place we keep hearing this phoney nonsense that the reason behind the high unemployment rate is a high participation rate. It is lower than it was this time last year but Government members still come up with this bunkum--all these excuses--and attempt to play down the reality which is, quite properly, worrying a large sector of their own Party. There are not simply 10.2 per cent of Australians who are out of work; those people looking for full time work represent 10.8 per cent of the Australian work force. Females looking for full time work make up about 11.6 per cent and males 10.5 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I suppose that is a fair point. In Tasmania--a case in point--the unemployment rate is 11.4 per cent. In Western Australia it is 11 per cent. I suppose they are trying to stamp that out--they seem to resolve lots of things by stamps over in Western Australia. In Victoria the rate is 10.9 per cent; South Australia, 10.5 per cent; and, remarkably of course, in New South Wales it is 9.8 per cent, along with Queensland which, until relatively recently had a non-Labor Government. That State is staying alive, I suppose, because of the hollow logs where money was carefully put aside for a rainy day--or, in this case, a very dry day--and has the best result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What is being done to resolve this disaster? This disaster, by the way, extends in a terrible way to young people. Tasmania has a 31 per cent youth unemployment rate, according to official figures. That is despite all the stunts and hiding that has been going on--all the shovelling of young people back to school which, for many, I support because it will give them greater job opportunities and develop their skills; but for many the paying of Austudy is simply keeping them out of the dole queues. Victoria--and this may explain why Mrs Kirner is so enthusiastic for the Federal Government at last to do something about it--has a 32.3 per cent youth unemployment rate. Naturally, New South Wales, the non-Labor State, is down at the bottom of the list. It is still very bad at 26.6 per cent, but much better than the rest. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here we have a situation where the unemployment rate is awful. Senator Button would not rule out 11 per cent. Mr Keating is now determinedly changing his position saying that `the. . . ALP should return to its ``great charter'' of stimulating growth and employment'. There is no doubt that Mr Keating did stimulate growth and unemployment by plunging Australia into the greatest debt we have ever had--increasing our foreign debt from $25 billion to $135 billion, or so. As we can see, all those jobs were so vulnerable because they were bought on hire purchase. The time is up and those jobs are being wiped out. Mr Keating says that Labor was duty-bound to `look after working Australians--give them a job, a piece of the economy'. Of course, it was Mr Keating, with the support of his colleagues, who engineered the recession that wiped out those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here we have a Government which Mr Keating himself says is on the wrong track. He knows all about being on track because the economy was always on track when he was Treasurer. Now it happens to be on the wrong track. Mr Keating is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the balance has now swung back in favour of growth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is the economy now has sunk too far down with too much attendant damage to confidence and psychology. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not the Liberal Party talking; that is Mr Keating, the man who engineered the recession and who is now asking to be trusted to try to engineer a recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here we have a situation where Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner say that the Government is wrong, that it has no policy and it offers no hope. It is so divided that it cannot act. It has no economic policy and no answers to these problems. It is leaderless and we cannot get any undertaking from it that the figures will not get worse and worse. We have no undertaking from the Government that unemployment will not reach 11 per cent. We never get any undertakings from Senator Button that the Government will resolve--or has any proposals to resolve--the disaster of unemployment which it has now pushed this nation into. It is a tragic situation. That is why I moved this urgency motion today and I urge the Senate to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Baume has just concluded his address on the urgency motion which he moved. The motion states that the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Hawke Government's failure to provide positive policies or hope for any significant reduction in September's disastrous official Australian unemployment rate of 10.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The operative words in that motion are `failure to provide positive policies or hope for any significant reduction'. I want to maintain those operative words at the front of the brain of the Senate for a few minutes. It is said that sometimes the worst place that anyone can have a serious debate about serious matters is in Parliament because participants in a serious debate will exploit arguments for political purposes, rather than go to any considered analysis of the issues and contribute across the chamber helpful or constructive argument in dealing with matters of great national importance. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that the level of unemployment is a matter of significant national importance. It is a level of unemployment that the Government takes no comfort in. The Government has no policy which intends to sustain that level of unemployment. In fact, the Government's policy settings are to reduce it. It is not to be a permanent feature of our economy. By the fact that it exists, it is a concern and a worry. This Government shares the concern and worry of those who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a debate put forward by the Opposition in words of its own choosing--`positive policies or hope for any significant reduction'. What did we get in this debate? Did we get any positive suggestions from the Opposition as to what it would do? We did not. Did we get any reasoned argument as to what policy settings should be put in place to resolve the problem? We did not. We got an argument about what Mr Keating may have said, an argument about a divided party and an argument about lack of leadership in the current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to make this point quickly, because there are a lot of meaty things that I want to refer to. What the Opposition has said today is no substitute for debate. This is a serious question. If the Opposition wants to be regarded as serious, it should act seriously, bring forward serious argument and explain to the Australian people how a 15 per cent consumption tax and the consequence of super charged inflation will help the unemployed. It should explain that. The Opposition should explain how its unclarified policies on labour market change will help unemployment in this country. It should explain that. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are policy issues fundamental to a consideration of where the Opposition stands and what the Opposition offers as a course out of these circumstances. The fact that no constructive Opposition policy has been put forward to deal with this matter indicates only that the Opposition has none. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a serious and earnest critic of this matter of significance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The participation rate--those people participating in the work force--was referred to in Senator Baume's remarks. He took comfort in the fact that the participation rate is lower now than when it was at its peak--and certainly it is. The participation rate was at its peak in July 1990--which was a record for Australia--under the Hawke Government. The participation rate was 64.2 per cent; it now stands at 63.4 per cent. The participation rate in the last year of the Fraser Government was 60.3 per cent. If we had the same participation rate as in the last year of the Fraser Government, unemployment in Australia would not be 10.2 per cent; it would be 5.5 per cent. It would be 5.5 per cent if we had the Opposition's record of the number of people who are in the work force. The fact that we have enlarged the work force to near record levels means that the percentage of unemployment is higher. That is a criticism of success in getting people in work. If we were to rely on the performance of the Opposition, the unemployment level would now be 5.5 per cent. That is a significant figure in this context. </PARA>
<PARA>  Dr Hewson recently went to the National Press Club. He never told the assembled press of Australia what his policies with respect to a consumption tax were, how it would adversely impact on the earnings of wage and salary earners and how it would supercharge inflation. He never told them any of that. One of the snippets that he dropped in his contribution to the debate there was that `an acceptable level'--his words--`of unemployment' is around 6 per cent, maybe 6.3 per cent. I make the point in passing that, on the performance during the Hewson years or the Fraser years, when Dr Hewson was the chief economic adviser to the Fraser Government, the level of unemployment now is lower. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to dwell on those figures because anyone can play with figures to make a case. We can make a case for far better performance than the Opposition, but that is not of any great interest to unemployed people. They want to know what is being done to deal with the situation. Many things that are important are being dealt with in the present circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that we have the basic policy elements that will restore sustainable growth and thereby sustainable and secure job growth. We are now a low inflation country. Make no mistake: the maintenance of low inflation is critical to achieve sustainable job growth into the future. Inflation distorts investment decisions, significantly reducing the incentives for productive job-creating investment. Our inflation rate at present is 3.4 per cent. It now stands below the 4.3 per cent of our major trading partners in the OECD. We are doing better in terms of inflation than our major trading partners in the OECD. For the first time in a generation this country has the opportunity to make that low inflation outcome a permanent feature in the economic landscape.</PARA>
<PARA>  The commitment we have received from our accord partners, to work with us in keeping Australian inflation at levels comparable with that of our major trading partners, is a key element in our strategy for sustainable growth. That is an important thing. Not only have we achieved a 3.4 per cent inflation rate, but the Budget Papers suggest an inflation outcome this year of 3 per cent and we have a commitment on the wages policy front--something that the Opposition cannot deliver--that we will keep inflation locked in at around that level. That will be a very positive achievement to ensure that job growth follows because of the non-distortion of investment decisions that that will bring. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has made the Australian economy more competitive than the one we inherited in 1983. Restructuring has not just been talked about; it is being achieved now. The performance of our manufacturing sector, competing on world markets, attests to that. Over the period of 1983 to 1991 the value of exports of machinery, transport equipment and other elaborately transformed items increased by 220 per cent, involving growth in volumes of 149 per cent. Over the last two financial years, the volume of these exports has grown by an astonishing 57 per cent. The result has been a dramatically improved balance of payments. The balance on goods and services is forecast to be in surplus this financial year--for the first time in over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  These figures are a remarkable indication of the effectiveness of the restructuring that we have undertaken in the economy. The fact is that in the past 8 1/2 years the Government has instituted a program of economic reform unprecedented in the history of this country. Never has the pace been faster than in 1991 when, through the March economic statement and the processes set under way by the Special Premiers Conference and the Budget, we can see the evidence of fundamental changes that we are now working to bring about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our recent Budget served two fundamental purposes in setting the parameters for sustainable economic and job growth. First, the structural integrity of the Budget was preserved. The offsetting of all new spending initiatives with Budget savings will ensure that, as the economy recovers, public sector savings will again make sure that there are sufficient savings to fund new investment. Secondly, we increased expenditure on labour market and training programs by 50 per cent in real terms to make sure that those caught in this downturn can equip themselves for a return to employment. Because of the training component it is constructive employment, employment that does not just offer a job but a career. Such expenditure will help to ensure that skill shortages do not emerge during the recovery phase. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also strengthened our assistance for the unemployed by reducing waiting periods for rent assistance. For those in extreme financial crises we have allocated an additional $3.5m this year for emergency relief. We have both responded to the immediate problems created by the recession and laid the foundations for a sustained and durable recovery. Unlike the Opposition, our concern for the unemployed is real and, of course, we are doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  One point should be made clear; that is, the coalition's policies would lead to much higher unemployment than Australia experiences at present. What else could be the outcome of a policy package of a consumption tax while at the same time slashing government expenditure to obtain a balanced Budget? A balanced Budget, as demanded by Dr Hewson, would require spending to be slashed by $3 billion in key areas such as income support, education and training, health and other vital areas of government support. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Murphy economic model, which is a model that the Opposition relies on, itself shows that the direct effect of such cuts would be a net loss of nearly 50,000 extra jobs. There would be a net loss on the economic model as a result of the Opposition policies amounting to an extra 50,000 jobs. We know one area where the Opposition plans to save money. We know that Opposition members intend to throw unemployed people off unemployment benefits after nine months. Even their own grassroots supporters in the Liberal Party are concerned about such a draconian policy. We have seen the impact of it in New Zealand where a permanent underclass has been created in society. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's consumption tax would increase inflation. High inflation is not consistent with long-term sustainable job increases. The coalition has no way of bringing inflation down, no way of controlling wages, and no way of minimising industrial disputation other than through high unemployment. The obvious conclusion to draw is that a coalition government would mean higher sustained levels of unemployment than those endured currently. </PARA>
<PARA>  Conversely, our policies are focused, and will continue to be focused, on a sustainable recovery in both the economy and employment. While the unemployment figures for September are disappointing--and we take no joy in them--trend figures show that the large falls in employment are now behind us. The Department of Employment, Education and Training's leading indicator of employment suggests that employment will soon begin to rise. We are confident that the pick-up in activity foreshadowed in the Budget is now becoming apparent and that we will see sustainable employment growth by early 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are signs as well that a recovery in employment is occurring. The trend employment level increased in September. The underlying movement in employment is no longer falling. Trend estimates for full time employed males continued to decrease, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent months. For full time employed females the trend estimates have been increasing since June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The signs that the recovery is under way, which is the key achievement of the settings that we have put in the economy, are manifold and I shall refer to some of them. The current account deficit for August was $575m in seasonally adjusted terms. This was the smallest monthly deficit since January 1988 and the second smallest deficit since April 1984. In August the balance on goods and services was $696m, the highest monthly result on record. This is in line with the Budget prediction that the balance on goods and services is expected to be in surplus this financial year--the first surplus in 12 years on that account. The trend estimate for the current account deficit was $848m, which was the ninth consecutive fall in the trend estimate and the lowest result since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>  The building industry is now showing signs of recovery. In July the number of dwelling units for which housing finance was provided increased by 8.1 per cent over June 1991 in seasonally adjusted terms and 36 per cent over July 1990. They are quite important upward movements in the amount of finance being approved for dwelling construction in this country. </PARA>

<PARA>  Let me turn to another indicator, motor vehicle registrations. I find that it too is showing positive signs of improvement. In July motor vehicle registrations increased in seasonally adjusted terms by 3.6 per cent over June this year. That is a positive improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish now to refer to some industrial relations reforms and how they are playing an important role in creating the foundation for further employment growth. The fundamental reforms that we have undertaken in pursuing award restructuring and the structural efficiency principle provide a strong basis for the creation of more secure and rewarding jobs in more efficient and productive workplaces in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The focus has been on skills development, training and efficiency. We have moved from a task-based taylorist focus on workplace organisation to a wages system based on skills training and competence. The changes have enabled workplaces to become more efficient and more productive. This has been done in many cases by rewarding and recognising skills and training, and by the removal of the outdated work practices and restrictive work practices that have applied in the past. Demarcation disputes have been reduced, and union amalgamations have reduced the number of unions in the Australian workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Multiskilling has enabled workplaces to be more flexible and responsive to change. Better training and multiskilling enable higher quality products and more efficient methods of production. Companies are thus enabled fully to utilise all the skills of their work force and the total sum of human resources. This includes proper recognition of skills of workers from overseas and the skills of women workers. The strategy enables companies to develop secure and long-term markets, to which they supply quality competitive products on time. This means more secure, rewarding employment and, more importantly, a strong basis for employment growth which will be sustained and secure. </PARA>
<PARA>  This will be further assisted by the move to workplace bargaining, which will further encourage companies and their work force to develop arrangements which best suit their needs and will enable them to increase their productivity and profitability and create long-term, secure and rewarding jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a recent copy of the British magazine the Economist there appeared an article by a group of distinguished professors commenting on the labour market. The September copy of the magazine contained an article referring to a book entitled Unemployment: Macroeconomic Performance and the Labour Market. The authors are Richard Layard and Richard Jackman of the London School of Economics, and Professor Stephen Nickell of Oxford University. The point that the authors make in their survey of labour markets is that a highly significant result of this study is the relationship between wage bargaining, unions and unemployment. The study shows that for any given amount of union power, unemployment is lower if unions and employers coordinate their wage bargaining either across industries or nationally. What works worst of all is strong but uncoordinated unions, which is exactly the situation that the Opposition's industrial relations policy seems to invite. What we have with an accord is the coordinated approach which the authors of this economic study say works best to create employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me look at the record of employment growth, out of the 1982-83 recession, under the accord in this country. We found in a rapidly expanding economy in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 that wage outcomes were moderate, that employment growth was high and that industrial restraint and disputation were low. We had a coordinated accord approach. Living standards did not fall because tax cuts were given and Medicare was introduced as part of the social wage. We had a coordinated package through the accord which enabled investment to be created. Unfortunately, as the stock market crash in 1987 showed, a lot of the investment that had been created was lost in speculative takeovers and did not go to investment in productive industry in this country. We will again deliver that type of wage outcome. We have, through the existing accord, an ability to achieve high job growth coming out of this recession, moderate wages outcomes and a generation of income in the form of profits for investment. One hopes that the captains of Australian industry will have learnt from the experiences of being burnt in the speculative orgy leading up to 1987, and this time invest in productive areas of the economy which will generate long-term employment. That is our expectation and I believe that it can be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA>  I conclude by saying that nothing has been put here this afternoon by the Opposition which shows an alternative policy. Questions on the consumption tax and how it will impact have not been answered by the Opposition. In the absence of that, this motion should be defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I understand that Senator Lees and I will have 10 minutes each in which to speak, so I ask the Clerks to adjust the clocks. At lunch time today I went outside the ministerial suite and observed the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, addressing the media on this subject. He, like many other spokespeople on the economy and many economists, spoke as though the economy was a disembodied thing separate from the deliberations of this chamber and the deliberations of Parliament; as though it was something which went on quite divorced from the individuals who are properly elected by the people to determine the shape of and relationships in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We hear expressions such as, `When the economy recovers we must be in a position to take advantage of it': `The economy'--something out there. During Question Time Senator Button was asked a question by Senator Kernot, and in the course of the reply said that he did not know what `interventionist policies' really meant. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened to the Australian economy is that this Government has pursued deregulatory policies. It has gone back to the old idea of laissez faire--leave it to the market; let the market determine. It has deregulated banking, it has removed the limits on borrowing and it has allowed borrowing overseas to skyrocket. This has led directly not only to the very large level of unemployment which we are discussing this afternoon but also to a massive increase in foreign indebtedness. It has led to an enormous movement of capital from real productive enterprise into speculative paper shuffling. It has led also to a very significant and continuing shift of income from the poor towards the rich--a very significant increase in the inequity and injustice which that implies in this country. In addition, and partly as a consequence, it has led to the increase in unemployment we are discussing this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Cook in his speech said rather coyly that this Government, his Government, had been responsible for an economic reform program without precedent in Australia's history, to which I responded, `Hear, hear!'. That economic reform program which this Government has imposed on Australia is precisely the economic reform program which has produced all these adverse effects, one of which is the unemployment problem that we are discussing. It has led also to the use of extremely crude tools in an attempt to control the economy. The substantial increase in the interest rate not only has sucked into Australia more foreign speculative investment--and continues to do so--but also keeps the exchange rate high, and makes it extremely difficult for Australian industry effectively to produce the goods and services in this country which, again, would help the employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a shorthand term for this approach to economic management and it goes by the name of economic rationalism. Economic rationalism is neither economic nor rationalist. We as Democrats have to say that the Opposition no less than the Government is pursuing those same policies. The Opposition in power probably would have made the situation worse because it would have gone further and harder with precisely the same deregulatory policies. For those reasons, at the end of my speech I will move an amendment which simply adds the words `and the Opposition' after `Government'. The motion will read, `the Hawke Government's and the Opposition's failure to provide'. </PARA>

As Senator Baume's own motion reads, it is the provision of positive policies or hope that is lacking, and the Opposition is providing neither of those. It is one respect in which Senator Cook was absolutely right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Many people have said that the one thing we learn from history is that we do not learn from history. We have been in this deregulatory situation before. We were in this deregulatory situation in the 1890s--100 years ago. Society substantially learned of the necessity for a hands-on approach to the economy--for the elected representatives to make the economy a creature of their activities and to make it an economy which serves the interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we heard today from Senator Baume particularly made it sound as though Australia is in a unique situation with respect to this level of unemployment and the other economic problems which I have outlined. There is nothing unique about Australia's situation at all. If we look at other countries in the world we find that every country that has pursued these same policies of so-called economic rationalism is in the same situation--America, the UK and, of course, New Zealand. There are lessons to be learned, but neither the Government nor the Opposition is prepared to learn them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The economist model of the market does not accord with the real world. The market does not accord with real human nature. It does not accord with the way real, decent human beings relate to each other or the way in which decent people in a decent society wish to behave and wish to relate to each other. Yet we hear from the Government and the Opposition, `Leave the economy to the market; let the market determine'. When the market determines that the economy will recover then we, as disjointed and disempowered spirits, will be in a position somehow to exploit that recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has proposed a consumption tax. The consumption tax is a direct extension of that same economic rationalist thinking. In addition, I would like to mention two specific objections to the consumption tax which relate directly to the motion before us this afternoon. The consumption tax, because it is a tax on goods and services at the point of consumption, implicitly means a tax on the labour component of goods and services. The Democrats consistently--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is not wrong. Every good and service contains two components: the resource component and the labour component. Anybody with half a wit would understand that. I am sorry that Senator Knowles does not understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Democrats would support a tax on resources and have always supported the idea of a resource-use tax. Putting a tax on the labour component of goods and services, which the consumption tax does implicitly, would simply drive down the ability to provide more employment. Moreover, the consumption tax is a tax on value adding. I simply ask the chamber and anybody else who is listening: does it make any sense, at a time when we need to encourage the maximum degree of value adding in Australia's production, to tax the very thing--value adding--that we want to encourage?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition and the Government have also been encouraging the fast tracking of industrial developments. Indeed, in the Minister's press release today we see those projects that he might encourage--the magnesium metal project; the aluminium smelter; the mini steel mill at Gladstone in Queensland; new port facilities; and a ferronickel project in Western Australia. All, by their very nature, are exploitative of natural resources; all, by their nature, are very capital insensitive; and all, by their nature, are not very productive of employment. They are not the sorts of things that are going to address the serious unemployment problem that we face. </PARA>
<PARA>  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>  That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Coulter moving an amendment to the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have all heard the figures today again and again from each speaker: 10.2 per cent now unemployed; some 100-odd people looking for every two jobs that are actually available; 872,100  officially unemployed; and 718,748 actually receiving unemployment benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is far more than just about statistics. Unemployment is actually about people. While travelling with the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, we heard in Queensland from the Queensland Department of Family Services. We were inquiring into the employment of people with disabilities. Something the Department said struck me as going to the heart of this debate. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The significance of employment in our society cannot be overestimated. It is frequently viewed as the primary measure of an individual's personal and social worth. For those who have the opportunity to participate, paid work can be an important source of self-esteem and economic independence. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that does not just cover those people with disabilities, but applies indeed to all Australians. The process of defining identity and self-worth in terms of paid employment is deeply ingrained in the Australian culture. Employment is not just about having a job, it is about fitting in. It is about the very fundamental right to actively participate in our society. If we accept that employment goes to the heart of our ability to function as human beings and to participate in society, then at least some one million Australians are now being denied that opportunity. That is the real tragedy of these unemployment statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tragedy confronts us with some fundamental questions about our notions of work and the way in which we organise our society. It confronts us with a crucial question: if we are not going to pursue and actually achieve full employment--a goal which I believe is both desirable and possible--how are we going to deal with the disastrous fall-out of continuing high levels of unemployment? That question throws up many challenges. One of the greatest of these is actually finding the jobs--of job creation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats reject the current hands-off approach, as Senator Coulter has outlined. We reject the view that the community, through government, cannot protect the interests of its members by ensuring that the economy serves the needs of the people and that we do not have effectively what we have now, which is a system working the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just today, in response to these appalling figures, we have had John Dawkins arguing that there were inherent difficulties in forcing the pace of the job market. When the Government, under some pressure from within its own ranks, decides to dabble in job creation, it is apparently unable to come up with anything new or anything that reflects a community commitment to an economically and environmentally sustainable future. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Democrats believe employment creation requires government commitment. But, first it requires denouncing the current irrational path of economic rationalism--zero protection, deregulation, level playing fields, these are all the buzz words of economic rationalism. There is no human face. There is no recognition--or, one suspects, no understanding--of the high economic and social costs associated with the relentless pursuit of economic goals. Community or government intervention in the operation of the market is seen as distorting efficient outcomes and is, therefore, bad. This, as Senator Coulter has already said, the Democrats reject totally. </PARA>
<PARA>  The economic rationalists are happy to hand over the determination of national goals to the market. But the market is not some mythical, pure notion. It is, of course, full of unequal power relationships. There is no equal access, for example, to information and resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Australia the financial market is dominated by foreign speculators. While we account for about one per cent of world trade, we have the fifth or sixth most traded currency in the world. Productive Australian companies and individuals are being manipulated by speculators moving hot money in and out of our country. Successful economies, such as Germany and Japan, have built their economic independence by controlling the flow of capital in and out of their countries, by restricting foreign investment and by boosting internal savings through incentives or regulation. The Government and the Liberal Party have abdicated their responsibility to manage the economy and have chosen the free marketplace to determine Australia's destiny. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to deal briefly with the notion of the level playing field--the nonsense, perhaps I should say, of the level playing field. Rural families are at the moment experiencing the results of the economic rationalists' obsession with this notion. Not only is there little practical support for our farmers in the face of subsidised competition from overseas, but also the prevailing view is that we should press on with dismantling all our support systems. Protective barriers are being torn down, despite the fact that we already have the second lowest level of effective agricultural protection in the world. At 11 per cent protection, only New Zealand is below us. If we look at our major trading partners, such as Europe at 48 per cent, the United States at 30 per cent and Japan way up at 68 per cent, we certainly see that we are the agricultural odd couple. </PARA>
<PARA>   The same forces which are destroying rural communities are now being set loose in our urban areas--set loose in suburbia. It is all very well for Senator Baume to come in here and condemn the Government's policies, but the senseless destruction of Australian jobs which has begun under Labor would continue under the coalition's plan to eliminate all industry protection by the year 2000. That is only eight years away. </PARA>
<PARA>  Economic rationalism to date does not exactly have the runs on the board. From the perspective of ordinary Australians, the results so far have been massive job losses and an unprecedented transfer of national income--firstly, from wages to profits and, secondly, from the poor to the rich. The transfer of income and profits was agreed to by the ACTU in the original prices and incomes accord because it believed that would be used to finance productive long term investment that would mean jobs in the future. It was, unfortunately, sadly mistaken. What happened instead was that these profits were squandered in speculative investment--the boom made possible by financial deregulation. It seems that no mechanisms are going to be put in place to prevent that happening again. Rather than investment in long term productive enterprises, that portion of national income has been squandered by the same irresponsible people now clamouring for further deregulation and, indeed, further cuts in government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this destruction of future jobs was going on in the 1980s, there was also a massive redistribution of personal income. That certainly was not in the direction of the poor. Australians need to understand that the practical results so far for the economic rationalists can be summed up in one statement: the rich have got richer, the poorer have got poorer and unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The time has come to seriously challenge the prevailing theories and to start raising some alternatives and discussing them. It is time to start being creative about alternative approaches to unemployment--and here I mean investment in industry that actually is labour intensive, and not in some of those projects that have been suggested which are, in fact, capital intensive and provide very few jobs, if any, in the long term. Such approaches require a discussion of concepts currently not on the public agenda, concepts such as guaranteed minimum income, permanent job sharing, education and training guarantees for our young people. But there is a wealth of evidence around about the economic benefits of these alternatives, just as there is a wealth of evidence around indicating that, if we continue on our present course, we are heading for a dangerously divided society. </PARA>
<PARA>  The evidence is clear. As a community, we have to spend in vital areas in order to reap the economic benefits later on. There is no doubt that we underspend in vital areas now, yet the economic rationalists clamour for further expenditure cuts. Unless we are going to permanently consign hundreds of thousands of Australians--indeed, at the moment, over a million--to the unemployment scrap heap, we need to take a good, hard look at some alternatives. We must start measuring the health and well-being of the nation by the health and well-being of the people. Economics is a means to an end, not an end in itself. It is time the Government and the coalition woke up to that fact. </PARA>

I will make a speedy response to the extraordinary contributions by the Australian Democrats and the quaint remarks by Senator Cook on behalf of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This pretence that the coalition has no response and has put up no proposals is one of the greatest farces of all time. The Government and the Democrats are so well aware of our package of radical reform that they spend most of their time in this place condemning it. To pretend that it does not exist is one of the most extraordinary bits of double talk, double standards, I have ever heard. They say it is a disaster and a disgrace. But today they have said, `The Opposition has put up no solutions to the problem'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our solutions are so well known, because they are subject to continual and irrational attack in this place, that it is almost unnecessary to repeat them yet again. But, for the benefit of the Australian Democrats and Senator Cook, let me restate them. The coalition is proposing radical reforms: total reform of the labour market; total reform of infrastructure, particularly transport and shipping; and getting rid of the inhibitions on development and on job creation that this Government has fostered, in most instances, at the insistence of and as a result of doing deals with the Australian Democrats, whose continual policies in this place have been to destroy job creation opportunities. We must have radical reform of the tax system by reducing the ludicrous concentration and unfair and excessive dependence on income tax from an unreasonably small proportion of the Australian population; that is, the people who have to pay it because they are paying pay-as-you-earn income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not true for people to say that Australia is heavily taxed as against the rest of the world. The problem is  the incidence of taxation--where it lies--and how so many people can evade it under this Government, which claims to have knocked off tax avoidance, tax evasion. The black economy is about $20 billion, according to many academic estimates, and others say more. It is unfair and unreasonable that so relatively few Australians have to carry such a huge burden as a proportion of the total tax bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  Without these radical reforms, we have no hope. We have no hope under this Government. Look at what it is doing. Mr Keating says the Government is on the wrong track. What sort of hope would we have under the garbage we hear from the Australian Democrats? All their policy solutions are the policy solutions that sent Argentina down what Mr Keating refers to as the Argentinean road. The policy solutions of the Australian Democrats are those that destroyed South America and most of the tin-pot countries that at one stage were comparable with us. The Australian Democrats are the Argentinean road people, and it is intolerable for them to come here with this pious garbage. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Cook should not pretend that we have no policy solutions, that we have the only answers. The Government has no answers and no leadership. The Government is a divided party that has no idea what it is doing or where it is going. Not even after its members stay up until 3 o'clock in the morning arguing amongst themselves to try to resolve the latest split can it come up with any coherent answer. I stress that the coalition does have the answers. It provides Australia's only hope. So long as the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party combine to ensure that those rational and coherent policies are not introduced, we will continue to have no hope. </PARA>

<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr President, I seek leave to table the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the Development of the Senior Executive Service. That report was tabled in the Senate on 18 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>  As you will be aware, the report is primarily a review of the Senior Executive Service as a professional cadre and the structure of the senior administration of the Australian Public Service. It does not focus specifically on the issue of remuneration for the Senior Executive Service, although it has looked briefly at performance pay. However, I am aware that in the current climate almost any discussion of the state of the Australian Public Service will inevitably raise the issue of productivity based bargaining in the public service. Before proceeding any further, I would like briefly to affirm my strong awareness of the role of the Senior Executive Service in achieving ongoing commitment to productivity improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Productivity bargaining is going to be a central feature of Australian industrial relations. I believe that it has important benefits for both workers and industry, and I believe that members of the Australian Public Service should, like workers in other industries, receive the benefits from demonstrated increases in productivity to which they have contributed. I am fully aware of the crucial role that the Senior Executive Service will play in changing the workplace culture in the Australian Public Service and achieving ongoing commitment to productivity improvement, both as a management corps and through the performance of its individual members. I am aware of the challenges it offers them as managers and leaders. I am also fully aware of the importance of ensuring that Senior Executive members receive a fair share of the rewards of productivity gains through an appropriate remuneration package. This will include performance pay, which will be introduced when the timing and details of the implementation are settled. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am also, of course, aware that productivity improvement in both the Senior Executive Service and the broader Australian Public Service also depends to a very large degree on the opportunities available to individual officers to develop management expertise and to broaden their career experiences. Later in my statement, I will be spelling out in detail the new Senior Executive Service career development initiatives which the Government has agreed in the areas of inter-agency mobility, individual external development and executive search. In adopting these initiatives, the Government has taken account of the concerns and issues raised by the Committee's report. It has also taken account of the advice of the Public Service Commission, based on that organisation's research into and experience with the management and development concerns of the Senior Executive Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  I should also mention that the issues and concerns surrounding productivity improvement in the public sector have been canvassed extensively in the discussion paper which has been prepared for me by a Committee of Heads of Australian Public Service agencies, and which is now publicly available. This discussion paper is an important contribution to ongoing consultations which will form a basis for Government decisions on how productivity and agency bargaining might be applied in the Australian Public Service. I commend it to your attention. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having clarified my approach to productivity bargaining and the Senior Executive Service, I will now proceed to the main issue of the report which, as I indicated above, is the development of the Service as a senior management structure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The seven years since the Senior Executive Service was set up by this Government in September 1984 have seen very significant changes in the management and administration of the Australian Public Service, and a study of the development of the Senior Executive Service is very timely. Let me begin by briefly reviewing the origins of the Senior Executive Service and the main features of the Government's administrative reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Origins and Philosophy of the Senior Executive Service</PARA>
<PARA>  The Senior Executive Service developed out of the proposals of the December 1983 Government White Paper "Reforming the Australian Public Service." Briefly, these recommendations called for the establishment of a unified, cohesive senior staffing group with general leadership and management skills which could effectively be assessed and flexibly deployed in accordance with the requirements and priorities of the Service. Positions were to be open to outside competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  An essential element in this concept was the centralised management and development of senior leadership. The former Second Division was managed more or less discretely by individual Departments and agencies. Under the new arrangements, the then Public Service Board was given responsibility for approving selection, redeployment and retirement of Senior Executive Service officers. It was also to take a greater role in managing their training and development. </PARA>
<PARA>The New Administrative Environment</PARA>
<PARA>  Since 1984 the Government has instituted a number of administrative and organisational reforms to meet the changing economic and managerial environment in which the Australian Public Service operates. The main effect of these reforms has been the devolution of many managerial and operational responsibilities from central authorities to individual Departments and agencies. The reforms of the Australian Public Service announced by the Prime Minister on 25 September 1986 gave greater responsibility to chief executive officers in individual departments and agencies for the management of their human resources. The major changes to the structure of Commonwealth administration announced by the Prime Minister on 14 July 1987 were aimed at reducing the number of Commonwealth departments to achieve administrative efficiencies and savings, better policy co-ordination and improved budget processes. These changes incorporated the recommendations of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit for the abolition of the Public Service Board and the creation of the much smaller Public Service Commission responsible for the policy aspects of human resource management. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a separate development, the application in 1989 of the Structural Efficiency Principle has resulted in the replacement of the six specific levels of the Senior Executive Service with three broad bands within which Secretaries may determine the salaries attaching to individual positions to reflect their relative job weight. The overall effect of all these changes has been the establishment of a much more devolved and flexible senior structure in the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The period since 1984 has also seen the implementation by this Government of important management reforms designed to improve the effectiveness of the delivery of Government programs and Services. The Financial Management Improvement Program, which introduced Program Management and Budgeting, now enables managers systematically to link resources and programs to overall objectives and to measure their effectiveness and efficiency against these goals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the Structural Efficiency Principle negotiations in 1989-90 also saw agreement on performance pay. Like performance appraisal, performance based pay is intended to complement the thrust of the other changes in Commonwealth administration over recent years. It would require managers to develop and negotiate performance agreements consistent with program objectives and key results. This will reinforce corporate planning and program management and budgeting. The link established between pay and performance would also enhance personal accountability. Performance based pay would also provide devolved wages flexibility consistent with the existing flexibility held by Secretaries to determine Senior Executive Service salaries within bands which I referred to above. </PARA>
<PARA>The People Element</PARA>
<PARA>  I think it important to recognise and acknowledge that these significant administrative changes have placed considerable pressure on the Australian Public Service in general and on the Senior Executive Service in particular. People have had to adapt rapidly to change, and to take on new and increased responsibilities. I record here that the Government recognises the excellent contribution which the Senior Executive Service has made in difficult and changing circumstances. But while the intensity and complexity of work at Senior Executive Service level has increased, and while officers have shown a high level of dedication and professionalism, their personal development may have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has supported reform packages such as the Financial Management Improvement Program which have given greater value for money, but it has also become more than ever aware that money management is only part of the equation. The Government is now looking at the development of a human resource management framework which, through providing Departments and agencies with a systematic approach to better training, development and personnel management, will enable our people resource to reach its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  The release of this report has been a valuable and welcome stimulus in focusing attention on human resource management issues in the Senior Executive Service, and its conclusions and recommendations have been studied with care. I would like to take the opportunity at this point to emphasise the importance which the Government attaches both to the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and to reports of this nature which provide both the Government and the Australian community with a broader perspective on the state of Australian public administration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Main Themes of the Report</PARA>
<PARA>  The report has reaffirmed the vision of the Senior Executive Service adopted by this Government in 1984. It believes that this vision remains a valid model for the senior management of the Australian Public Service. Its main concern, however, is that the model has been in practice eroded by the management changes of the 1980s, and that the practical initiatives identified in 1984 as essential to its realisation, particularly in the areas of career development, staff mobility and personnel management, have never been fully implemented. It envisages a greater role for the Public Service Commission both in reviving and pursuing the 1984 initiatives and in assisting individual departments and agencies in their management of the Senior Executive Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report's specific recommendations for "fine tuning" the Senior Executive Service are grouped into three broad categories. The first group is aimed at improving the accountability of Departmental secretaries for personnel management of the Service. The second group of recommendations centres on developing the scope for common services provision in the personnel management area, and the third set aims at encouraging leadership and entrepreneurship in personnel policy development and implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's Response</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr President, the Government agrees that the original vision of the Senior Executive Service as a unified leadership group for the Australian Public Service remains relevant. The particular characteristics and responsibilities of public administration at the federal level require senior management which shares a common administrative culture, which has similar generalist skills and competencies, which shares training and development experience, and which can be deployed across the Australian Public Service in response to changing Government priorities. The Government of course also recognises that the particular tasks and responsibilities of some agencies require the services of high level professional and specialist officers. The category of SES (Specialist) has been created to ensure an adequate career path for these officers. It is important to remember, however, that the SES (Specialist) category is a component of the broader Senior Executive Service, and its members need to share in the overarching administrative and management culture. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government also believes that the elements of central management of the Senior Executive Service established in 1984--selection, redeployment, retirement, career management--need to be retained if this model is to be preserved. However, to implement effective and practical strategies and programs for the maintenance and development of a Senior Executive Service, it is important to be sensitive to and take account of the realities of the devolved management and administrative structure of the Australian Public Service today. This structure is not a managerialist fad. The Government believes that it is essential to the effective present and future administration of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1983 White Paper, which established the concept of the centralised management of the Senior Executive Service, emphasised that this responsibility "should be used sensitively, both with respect to the interests of the individuals concerned and to the primary management role of Department heads." These considerations are even more important in the l990s, when the responsibilities of Departmental managers are much greater, and I have kept them carefully in mind in my examination of the individual recommendations of the report. In seeking leave to table the Government's response to these recommendations, I would emphasise that while it is happy to agree to many of them, it has had to look very carefully at those which would require a significantly greater degree of central control. </PARA>
<PARA>Career Management</PARA>
<PARA>  A main element of the 1984 reforms was the requirement for a greater degree of management leadership in the career development of Senior Executive Service officers. In reviewing the progress of the reforms, the report emphasises the need for more proactive career management strategies for the Senior Executive Service, and notes that "The plans for greater central involvement in the career development of officers have mostly not been implemented or been abandoned" (para 3.36). Interestingly, the results of the 1989 Jans/Frazer-Jans survey of Senior Executive Service career perceptions, which have been published in the Public Service Commission Senior Executive Staffing Unit Occasional Paper number 10, Careers and Culture in the SES, make a similar point. While the Senior Executive Service officers who responded to the survey indicated a high degree of morale and job satisfaction, there was also a perception that career management and career development were neglected by management. </PARA>
<PARA>  Effective career management is important not only for individual development, but is central to the maintenance of a unified, professional and flexible Senior Executive Service. In a devolved management environment, the development and dissemination of career management strategies, opportunities and programs which have demonstrable mutual advantages for management and individuals is probably one of the most effective means of encouraging Senior Executive Service officers to think of themselves as members of a unique professional group. While I have reservations about some of the specific proposals put forward in the report for the mobility, placement and training of Senior Executive Service officers, they have stimulated the Government to think carefully about career management. </PARA>
<PARA>The Public Service Commission</PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the recommendations for strengthening the role and function of the Public Service Commission focus on the more effective monitoring of personnel management in the Australian Public Service (para 10.16). Some of these proposals can be implemented without difficulty, although it needs to be borne in mind that gathering statistics about, say, redundancies by agency (rec 9) may tell us more about the external pressures those agencies face than about their management failings. I am less convinced by the proposals (recs 7, 8) for a significantly more interventionist role by the Public Service Commission in Senior Executive Service selection and deployment. These are no longer consistent with the devolved management culture of the Australian Public Service today. </PARA>
<PARA>  I welcome the proposal that the Commission "take a leading role in personnel management in the Australian Public Service and, in particular, develop strategies to deal with the issues of concern identified in the PSC publication APS 2000" (rec 36). Before the report's release, the Public Service Commission had been restructured to enable it to give greater attention to the provision of human resource management guidance and advice to Departments and agencies. This has involved the creation of a new First Assistant Commissioner position to head a Human Resource Policy Division and the establishment of an SES Career Management Branch within the Management Selection and Development Division. The Commission's work will be focusing in particular on the development of the human resource management framework. It is also reviewing the development needs of Senior Executive Service officers in the light of recent evaluations it has undertaken, and is making changes to its development programs to ensure their continuing relevance and quality. I have asked the Commission, as part of its human resource development work, to give particular attention to the development and provision of principles, guidelines and advice to managers of senior human resources to enable them to identify and assist with career planning and development strategies and opportunities for Senior Executive Service officers. I am also aware of the potential importance of effective performance appraisal as a means of identifying human resource development and career planning options, and I endorse the continuing role of the Public Service Commission in the development and dissemination of effective performance appraisal techniques. At the same time, I would emphasise that effective career management is more than simply a matter of the provision of opportunities. It is important that Senior Executive Service officers themselves give time and attention to their own development. </PARA>
<PARA>  In endorsing the Public Service Commission's role in supporting care management the Government is, of course, aware of the excellent work already under way in several departments, particularly in the area of intra-agency and inter-regional mobility. I have asked the Commission to ensure that its work in career management is compatible with and takes account of these agency initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Mobility</PARA>
<PARA>  Inter-agency mobility was a central element in the development of a management cadre as envisaged by the 1984 reforms. I agree with the report's conclusion (recs 1 and 2) that central to a discussion of mobility in any Senior Executive Service model is a data base which gives current levels and trends. The Public Service Commission SES data base established after the 1984 reforms already has most of the necessary information, and a review and upgrading aimed at facilitating, among other things, the better manipulation of this data is already under way. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also recommends that the Public Service Commission "reinstitute a program of temporary assignments of SES officers along the lines trialled in 1986" (rec 6). I agree that effective inter-agency mobility is a central element of Senior Executive Service career management. It broadens the skills and outlook of individual officers and facilitates the flexible deployment of Senior Executive Service resources. The relatively young average age of the Senior Executive Service today will inevitably restrict job turnover, and thus lessen opportunities for inter-agency movement through promotion. Improved lateral mobility will become increasingly important in the maintenance of job variety and experience. I have therefore asked the Public Service Commissioner to implement a new mobility program for Senior Executive Service officers. I have asked him to look carefully at the reasons for the failure of the earlier scheme as set out in the evidence to the Committee, and to ensure that the new program has proper selection processes and takes full account of overall service needs, the developmental requirements of participants and their long term career interests. </PARA>
<PARA>  In considering the issue of more effective mobility, I have been aware that the report has made a number of valuable observations about the different cultures and experiences of the central and regional offices of the Australian Public Service, and has articulated the concerns of officers in the regions that their management problems and experiences are not fully appreciated at the centre and that promotion and development opportunities are fewer. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would tend to agree with the report that the problem of inter-regional mobility may not be amenable to any complete solution, since it is to a large degree the product of the structure of Commonwealth administration and the different managerial and operational priorities in the regions. I am aware, however, that some Departments, such as the Department of Social Security, have adopted innovative regional structures which provide greater opportunities for Senior Executive Service regional experience. It remains an issue which needs to be confronted in the development of effective career management strategies, and I have asked the Public Service Commission to bear it in mind in implementing its mobility program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The willingness of Senior Executive Service officers to move from region to region is closely related to conditions of service which ensure that they will not be financially disadvantaged. In response to the recommendations of the report, I have asked the Department of Industrial Relations, in consultation with the Public Service Commission, to undertake a review of relocation assistance and other conditions of service which affect inter-regional mobility. </PARA>
<PARA>Recruitment and Selection</PARA>
<PARA>  A major initiative recommended by the report is the use of "team recruiting" to the Senior Executive Service. This arose from the suggestion (para 6.58) that "it might be possible to recruit for Senior Executive Service positions in an agency twice or three times a year rather than as each vacancy arises" so as to improve the efficiencies of the recruiting process but also to tap broad community skills and to make the composition of the Senior Executive Service more representative of society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>  The bulk advertising and filling of large numbers of positions may attract broader fields and may facilitate the matching of the individual skills and experience of applicants with the varying requirements of particular jobs. Many agencies do advertise in bulk when setting up new organisations or undertaking new functions. However it is clearly an impractical option for operating agencies who need to fill vacancies as they arise to maintain their effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the other hand, the report canvasses the advantages of executive search techniques, and recommends (rec 19) the establishment of an experimental unit. There is an emerging interest in improving processes to supplement selection fields, for identifying officers for development opportunities and for finding jobs for displaced officers. </PARA>
<PARA>  A modest Senior Executive Service executive search capability utilising the current data base, which might include people outside the Australian Public Service who have expressed an interest in being considered for senior executive service positions, and which would respond to requests by Departments and agencies, is an option worthy of further consideration. I have asked the Public Service Commission to develop this capability. I would emphasise that this system will be compatible with the principles of open competition and merit selection, and take account of privacy concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>Training and Development</PARA>
<PARA>  The main new initiative in the area of training and career development suggested by the report centres on the requirement for increased access by Senior Executive Service officers to post graduate courses in public administration and public policy, possibly through a staff college. While I agree that formal post graduate study is one option for professional development, I think that the report's focus on it is a little narrow. The Government takes the view that there needs to be a range of development options available to Senior Executive Service officers, which are of high quality and relevant to dealing with contemporary issues. These options include the many management training courses now being developed and provided by tertiary institutions and other providers as well as the programs of the Public Service Commission which are continually being reviewed and upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA>  One promising new Public Service Commission initiative is the Senior Executive Leadership Program (SELP) which first ran in September 1990, and which is aimed at meeting the development needs of Division Heads. Feedback from the first three courses has been most encouraging. However, I would emphasise once again that the development of a suitable range of options for management training is only one element in addressing this issue. The Human Resource Development Survey conducted by the Commission for 1989-90 revealed that the service-wide training rate for Senior Executive Service officers was only 3.59 days per person, which I regard as being somewhat on the low side. As with career management, effective training is dependent to a large degree on individual officers and their supervisors planning workloads to take advantage of career development opportunities, and the development by the Public Service Commission of career management guidelines should help here. In considering new directions in senior management training, I am also mindful that there is extensive and relevant management and administrative experience within the Senior Executive Service itself, and I would like to see this resource further developed and utilised. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the need to broaden the range of training options in mind, I have asked the Public Service Commission to implement an external development scheme for individual SES officers. This will encompass a broad range of development opportunities which might include visits to or placements with academic institutions, short development courses at post graduate management schools or assignments to develop and conduct seminars on "case studies" of difficult policy, administrative or management issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr President, the issue of the development of an appropriate senior management model for the Australian Public Service in a changing world is a difficult and complex one. In its report, the Committee has raised a number of important issues and has made a number of interesting suggestions for reform. Some of these the Government has had no difficulty in accepting. Others, while not perhaps as practical in a changing managerial environment, have given us much to think about and have stimulated investigation of new avenues for the more effective administration of the Senior Executive Service. I will ensure that the new initiatives which I have announced in this statement are implemented as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1--Enhancement of PSC SES data base to provide mobility statistics</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1 proposed:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner arrange for the existing database on the educational qualification of SES officers to be expanded to record basic information on work experience and that the expanded database be structured so as to allow easy access to aggregate data on staff mobility. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The PSC SES database already contains much of this information, and is being upgraded to enhance access to and manipulation of the data. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2--Introduction of procedures for monitoring and publishing mobility trends</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2 proposed:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner establish procedures for routine updating of the database and for publication in his Annual Report of aggregate data on mobility trends drawn from the database. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The SES data base is constantly updated as a result of selection and placement action. As part of the data base enhancement program the PSC is developing strategies to enable agencies more effectively to advise it of internal movements. The PSC will publish data in its annual report on inter-agency mobility, but believes that it would be more appropriate for figures on intra-agency mobility to be included in the reports of individual agencies, and will propose that this be incorporated into the Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3--data base coverage of "feeder groups</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3 proposed:</PARA>
<PARA>  That arrangements be made for the coverage of the database to be extended to the feeder groups for the SES by the end of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed on the understanding that for the purpose of this recommendation the feeder group is to be defined as those non-SES officers who have demonstrated through the selection process their aptitude for the SES; details of these officers are currently maintained in the data base. It is not practical or realistic to maintain this data on all members of the Senior Officer group and its equivalents. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4--review of Interchange</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4 proposed:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner review the operation of the interchange scheme by departments and publish the results of the review in his next Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. However, given the current devolved nature of the scheme, it is more practicable for departments and agencies to review their experiences in their own Annual Reports. The revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports include a requirement to report on the Interchange Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5--PSC to facilitate Interchange activities</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5 proposed:</PARA>
<PARA>  In the event that the review shows a significant decline in activity under this scheme since responsibility for it was devolved to departments, the Committee recommends that the Public Service Commissioner become involved in the program to the extent necessary to ensure that activity returns to at least the former level. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The Public Service Commissioner will write to departments and agencies encouraging its development and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6--re-institution of a TAP mobility program</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6 proposed:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner reinstitute a program of temporary assignments of SES officers along the lines trialled in 1986. The program should be kept sufficiently small as to be manageable by the Commissioner's office. The Commissioner should consider beginning the program with projects under his own control in the area of personnel policy, including projects which might arise out of the recommendations in this report. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The PSC will implement an inter-agency mobility program, taking into account current levels of mobility. The PSC is concerned to avoid the problems of the TAP by ensuring that suitable participants are properly selected, that their development needs are taken into account and that they are properly placed or reintegrated on completion. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7--nomination of mobility candidates for vacancies</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner use his power to nominate additional officers for consideration for particular vacancies where he considers that such action would meet the mobility objectives of the SES. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. However, before resorting to the Commissioner's formal powers, the Government would prefer in today's devolved environment to encourage Departments and agencies to approach the Commissioner to seek advice on suitable officers to supplement fields. The development of an executive search capability will assist this process. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8--PSC review of "spills"</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That each future decision by a department secretary to "spill" SES positions in any part of his or her department should be reviewed by the Public Service Commissioner with the outcome of the review to be published in the Commissioner's Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The PSC will ask agencies to include information on "spills" in Annual Reports, noting that there is already a general requirement in the revised Guidelines for Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports for departments to provide information about staffing including the requirement to provide a summary of significant developments in relation to staff management issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Any further PSC involvement in senior staffing arrangements within departments and agencies would not be appropriate in the current devolved management climate. The PSC already monitors merit and equity concerns through its involvement in approving recommendations for appointment or promotion, and redeployment and retirement action, which may result from "spills". </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9--publication of statistics on redundancy</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner provide in his Annual Report statistics on all redeployment and redundancy action detailed to agency level and showing comparative performance of agencies over time. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed in respect of those displaced officers who cannot be placed within their own Departments or agencies. The PSC would, however, wish to make it suitably clear in the promulgation of these figures that redundancies occur as a result of a variety of factors, many of them outside the control of individual departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10--that agencies meet all costs of redundancies</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner charge agencies for the full cost of all redundancy and retrenchment action undertaken by his office. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. Agencies already meet the costs of benefits and advisory and counselling services to displaced officers. It would not be practicable to charge other costs to agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11--outplacement counselling as a right</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That all displaced staff subject to redundancy action be entitled to counselling and related services as of right. Access to such services should be through the Public Service Commissioner with the full costs being charged to the agencies from which officers have been displaced. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The nature and extent of the counselling would be dependent on the particular circumstances of the officer involved. The full costs of counselling services are currently, and will continue to be, met by the agencies from which the officers have been displaced. The PSC has, however, no objection to departments and agencies arranging their own counselling for their officers provided that the officers themselves are agreeable and that the level and range of counselling is the same as that organised by the PSC. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12--increased specialist positions</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Department of Finance review the feasibility of allowing increased numbers of SES (Specialist) positions in agencies or parts of agencies that are competing for similar skills as private sector professional officers. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. Published SES (Specialist) guidelines already provide that "positions of SES (Specialist) should be established only where requirements for high level expertise in a particular field clearly justify a dedicated position for this purpose, having regard to labour market factors and the capacity of the APS to recruit and retain specialists in that field". </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13--PSC block advertising</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner arrange for a simple, weekly advertisement in appropriate newspapers, listing all SES vacancies advertised in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the week in question and providing contact information. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is not agreed. This method was tested for some years, but departments wished to run their own advertising and recruiting campaigns. Block advertising would duplicate the efforts of individual departments and agencies at considerable cost with little advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 14 and 15--reduction of deadlines for SES recommendations</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 14 and 15 propose:</PARA>
<PARA>  That, in the case of SES vacancies advertised in the press, the deadline for submission of recommendations for promotion or appointment to the Public Service Commissioner be reduced immediately from six to three months. </PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner investigate the feasibility of similarly reducing the deadlines for submission of recommendations on all other vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recommendations 14 and 15 are not agreed. While the PSC will continue to encourage agencies to complete SES selections in a timely manner, it does not believe that three months is a realistic period for the completion of an effective and equitable selection. Agencies failing to meet the deadline would under current arrangements be required to readvertise, and this would ultimately increase both the cost and the time of the selection process. SES staffing decisions are of vital importance, their consequential effects are long lasting, and an adequate time needs to be taken in considering the judgements involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16--PSC guidelines for vacancy inquiries</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner develop and issue guidelines for procedures to be followed by departments in dealing with inquiries generated by press advertisements for SES vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The PSC will prepare a kit for agencies which covers the job advertising and customer information process. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17--revision of SES selection reports</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner be alert to the risks involved in permitting revision of the reports of SES selection advisory committees and that recommendations for appointments or promotions to the SES continue to be rejected in any case where the Commissioner is not satisfied fully of the integrity of the selection process. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The Commissioner seeks and will continue to seek further information and advice from agencies where, on the basis of the material available to it, he is not fully satisfied with any aspect of a selection process. Any subsequent action must always be dependent on the information which is forthcoming in response to such a request. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18--publication of recruitment statistics</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner compile at least the following information on SES recruitment action and publish it in his Annual Report: for each agency, the number of SES vacancies by state; the average number of applicants by gender, state, and whether employed in the APS; the average time taken between advertising and filling of positions; and the number of successful applicants by gender, state and whether employed in the APS. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is not agreed. The overall value of the provision of this information is not justified by the resources which would be needed to obtain it. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19--Executive search capability</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner establish a small, experimental executive search unit, staffed at SES level, to test the effectiveness of executive search techniques in filling SES positions. To the extent that the unit seeks candidates from outside the APS, it should be permitted to work through private executive search firms but should also seek to develop its own pool of persons inside and outside the APS who might wish to be considered for employment in the SES. Particular attention should be given in this regard to possible candidates currently employed in the non-profit and voluntary sector. If the unit operates successfully during a trial period, payment by departments for its services could be considered. The Commissioner should consider the establishment of the unit as a possible project under a revived Temporary Assignment Pool as recommended in paragraph 4.39. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The Government is interested in executive search techniques for the more effective recruitment, selection and placement of SES officers. The Public Service Commission will establish a modest capability utilising data currently held by the Commission, which might include people from outside the APS who have expressed an interest on being considered for SES positions, which will respond on request to Departments and agencies seeking assistance in the recruitment and deployment of SES officers, and which will safeguard privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 20 and 21--promotion of team recruiting</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 20 and 21 propose:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner actively promote the concept of team recruitment for SES vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA>  That in cases where the team recruitment approach is adopted, particular efforts be made to ensure that intakes are balanced as to skills and other characteristics and that these efforts be described in the selection documentation available to the Public Service Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>  These recommendations are not agreed. While team recruiting may have advantages in matching the particular skills and experience of individuals to the overall corporate requirements of an organisation, to actively promote it would override and ignore the important practical requirements of Departments to fill vacancies as they arise. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22--funding for regional positions</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That each new SES position created outside the ACT during the next three years be counted as only half a position for the purpose of Department of Finance SES profile controls and that departments be permitted to fund fifty percent of the salary costs of those positions from outside the SES salary budget, subject to a reasonable cap on the total increase in positions. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is not agreed. Ample opportunity exists for sympathetic consideration to be given to departmental proposals for augmentation of SES resourcing outside the ACT, without resort to special devices of the sort recommended. The status and quality of work offered by regional SES positions will, moreover, not be enhanced or even maintained by debasing their value through an artificial increase in numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 23 and 24--term appointments to regional positions</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 23 and 24 propose:</PARA>
<PARA>  That departments which fill their regional SES positions on a term basis be prepared to negotiate with applicants on the initial term of appointment and provide for the possibility of renewal of appointments up to a total term of, say, six years. Allowance should also be made for longer terms in special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner actively promote arrangements to facilitate transfers between departments of officers at SES and feeder group level within each region as a partial alternative to the present practice of filling many regional SES positions by ACT-based staff on term appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>  These recommendations are noted. The Government has asked the Public Service Commission to keep them prominently in mind in its consideration of the central/regional aspects of mobility schemes. It is, however, important to remember that many if not most Departments already staff senior regional positions on rotation, and that any schemes to increase regional/central mobility will be dependent upon the work priorities, needs and structures of individual departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 25--Commonwealth/State Exchanges</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 25 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner actively promote arrangements for an increase in opportunities for staff exchanges between the APS and State public services under the interchange scheme as well as under staff development schemes operated by his office, including the Executive Development and Senior Women in Management schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. As part of its action to encourage agencies to develop and maintain interchange, the PSC will emphasise movement between State and Commonwealth authorities. As part of its ongoing consultation and interaction with State Public Services, the PSC circulates information on its training courses and makes places available to State Public Services. EDS and SWIM participants may undertake rotations in State organisations, but opportunities may be limited by personal factors affecting inter-State movement (see response to recommendation 26). </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26--development programs and the regions</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26 proposes that:</PARA>
<PARA>  . all appointees to ACT positions in the Graduate Administrative Assistant or equivalent programs be required to undertake at least one posting to a regional office during their training program and all appointees to similar regional positions be required to undertake at least one posting to the ACT;</PARA>
<PARA>  . all participants in the Executive Development Scheme and the Senior Women in Management Programs who are employed in the ACT be required to undertake at least one posting in a regional office unless they have substantial previous regional experience and all regional participants be required to undertake at least one posting in the ACT unless they have previous substantial work experience in the APS in Canberra;</PARA>
<PARA>  . all departments should examine the feasibility of promoting staff interchange between their central and regional offices through short-term postings to undertake particular projects or simply for development purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The Public Service Commission will continue to encourage regional movement as an element of developmental schemes, but it is impractical as a mandatory requirement, and of little relevance to those agencies or programs that have no or little regional presence. Officers with family commitments have found it difficult to move outside Canberra when interstate postings were introduced in these schemes in the past, with the net result that the number of participants, including female participants, in some schemes declined. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Public Service Commission will write to Departments encouraging them to promote central/regional staff exchanges. The Commission will also be asked to keep regional mobility prominently in mind in its examination of assignment/rotation options, and encourage departments to recruit graduate administrative assistants directly to their regional offices. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27--relocation assistance</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner examine relocation assistance and other conditions of service that would assist in promoting inter-regional mobility and the recruitment of high quality people from outside the Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. These conditions were reviewed and enhanced for the SES at the time of its formation, but an examination by the Department of Industrial Relations, in consultation with the Public Service Commission, is now timely and will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 28--reporting on progress</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 28 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Commissioner report on the result of his examination in his 1990-91 Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. As indicated in the response to recommendation 27, the Department of Industrial Relations will manage the review. Progress will be reported on in the Department of Industrial Relations' 1991/92 Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29--reporting on performance pay</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Department of Finance publish details annually of performance payments made in each agency. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is not agreed. The Government is strongly in favour of preserving confidentiality of individual performance payments, and neither agency nor DOF reports will allow payments to any individual to be identified, identifiable or capable of simple estimation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports include a requirement to report consolidated statistics on performance payments where they have sufficient eligible staff (three or more) to preserve individual confidentiality. The Department of Finance will report annually on Service-wide statistics aggregated across agencies, by SES Band and by the percentage of maximum permissible pay received. Consideration is being given to the addition of the aggregated statistics by gender. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 30 and 31--verification and evaluation of performance based pay</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 30 and 31 propose:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Government response to this report specify verifiable targets for the costs and benefits of the introduction of performance based pay in the APS. </PARA>
<PARA>  That the evaluation of appraisal schemes proposed by the Public Service Commissioner for 1992 be expanded to include an evaluation of the operation of performance based pay. </PARA>
<PARA>  These recommendations are noted. It is agreed that agencies, when introducing performance-based pay, should identify the goals and objectives to be achieved. These goals and objectives will then be used and\or developed to evaluate the effectiveness over time of each scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, any such assessments will be largely qualitative. Therefore the setting of verifiable targets and attempting any detailed cost benefit analysis is not considered practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32--outside participation in evaluation</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the evaluation team include at least one representative from outside the APS and that its report be published in the Annual Report of the Public Service Commissioner for 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. Such issues will be addressed leading up to the evaluation of performance-based pay schemes in 1992, with a view to results being published in or before the 1992/93 Annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 33--evaluation of EDS</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 33 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the next full evaluation of the EDS program include an assessment of the success of participants in the program in subsequently achieving promotion to the SES. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The PSC has recently reviewed all its development programs, and the EDS 90 program has undergone evaluation by management consultants Ernst and Young. The evaluation confirmed the value and high standard of the program and the quality of the participants but indicated that it was not seen by agencies as a program aimed primarily at officers with SES potential within the relatively short term. The objectives of the program have been revised to remove the link to SES promotion but to continue to meet the need expressed by agencies for a high quality "experiential" mobility program for individuals of potential who need some broadening in skills, attitudes and experience. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34--professional development in the SES core criteria</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the extent of an individual's recent efforts to develop and maintain professional skills should be included in the core criteria for SES appraisals and selection. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The recently revised core skills now include criteria that look at an individual's recent efforts to develop and maintain professional skills. The individual's ability to seek additional training or experience to overcome deficiencies forms part of the Self Knowledge/Management criteria. The PSC approach to performance appraisal includes assessment against the SES core skills for the purposes of providing opportunities for professional development and training. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 35--post graduate training for the SES</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 35 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner explore methods of improving access by SES officers to postgraduate courses in public administration, public policy or other areas of likely benefit to the APS. The Commissioner should give attention to the possibility of making special arrangements for such training with existing educational institutions. Consideration should be given to funding increased levels of assistance for postgraduate study from reduction in funding for short courses by the Public Service Commission and by departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recommendation is noted. The Government takes the view that there should be an enhanced range of personal development opportunities available to SES officers, and the Public Service Commission will take account of the accessibility and relevance of various post graduate opportunities as part of its external development of management training initiative. However, it should be borne in mind that the allocation of resources to post graduate study in specific areas of professional development is more one for individual agencies to consider in terms of their particular staff development strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 36--PSC role in personnel management</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 36 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Public Service Commissioner take a leading role in personnel management in the APS and, in particular, develop strategies to deal with the issues of concern identified in the Public Service Commission publication APS 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is agreed. The Commission has already been restructured on this basis, with the creation of a First Assistant Commissioner position to head a Human Resource Policy Division and the establishment of an SES Career Management Branch within the Management Selection and Development Division. The Commission's work will be focusing in particular on the development of a Human Resource Management framework for the APS and on the development of guidelines and procedures to help Departments and SES officers to take advantage of career management strategies and programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 37--activities of MAB</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 37 proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provide more details of the activities of the Public Service Management Advisory Board in its future annual reports. Minimum reporting should include a listing of all matters considered by the MAB, of all decisions or recommendations made by it and of the outcome of any recommendations. The first full report on the operations of the MAB should provide such information for the period since its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recommendation is noted. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, in its Annual Report, will continue to provide an account of the activities of the Management Advisory Board including a history of the key issues considered by the Board. Those issues will generally be the subject of a published paper--or otherwise will be the subject of an appropriately detailed report by the executive agency with primary responsibility for the issue concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Senator Cook) for tabling the Government response to the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the development of the Senior Executive Service. Most of the Committee's work on the report was undertaken in the last Parliament when the Committee's membership was different. In fact, I am the only current member of the Committee to have been involved in the evidence gathering or in much of the Committee's internal debate on the draft report. However, the other members of the Committee will join with me in welcoming a serious and well-argued Government response to a major committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is not to say that I welcome all aspects of the response. As the response notes, the specific recommendations in the Committee's report were largely directed to finetuning rather than fundamental change. However, as a package, the Committee's recommendations were consistent with an underlying philosophy that is quite sceptical of many of the claims of the so-called managerialists. By contrast, the Government response accepts those claims uncritically. </PARA>
<PARA>  The pattern of acceptance and rejection of particular recommendations reflects a sizeable philosophical gap in the Committee's position. That is still accepted by the Government. The differences are most clear in relation to performance based pay. Despite the Committee's criticism of the performance pay proposal in two reports, the Government remains committed to the introduction of performance based pay for the SES, and equally committed to not setting verifiable targets for the change and to not evaluating formally its costs and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are told on the one hand that the effectiveness of senior public servants in their policy advising and managerial tasks can be assessed with sufficient precision and objectivity to allow fine judgments to be made between individuals. But, on the other hand, judgments about whether performance pay as a system will actually pay for itself `will be largely qualitative' and the `setting of verifiable targets and attempting any detailed cost benefit analysis is not considered practicable'. There seems to me to be a fundamental inconsistency here. </PARA>
<PARA>  The whole approach is inconsistent with the logic of the recent Public Service managerial reforms in general. The excuses for the foreshadowed decision not to evaluate performance pay would not be accepted in relation to any other expenditure proposal. I find it disturbing that senior executive pay alone is to be free from the intense pressure for reporting on every other aspect of public sector performance and from the requirement to justify in detail every item of government spending. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note and endorse the comments in the response on the case for returning to members of the SES a share of the rewards of productivity gains. However, I believe that the Committee's two reports on this matter showed conclusively that performance pay is not an appropriate way of doing this. There are strong theoretical grounds for believing that the system will not work in the way intended because of a total absence of successful models elsewhere in the world, despite many experiments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Performance pay is only one example that illustrates philosophical problems that many of us have with recent changes in the way in which the public sector operates and sees itself. The Committee's report noted in passing the risk that a particular ideological viewpoint might become dominant within the Public Service. The problem is not politicisation in the party political sense, but rather the pervasiveness of a particular view of the world--a view which is narrow and potentially destructive of much that we value in our Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The stress throughout the Government's response on the devolution of management responsibilities ignores this risk. Devolution of senior personnel decisions in the way still proposed by the Government is likely to strengthen the self-selection process that has entrenched particular viewpoints in the senior ranks of the Public Service. A crucial purpose of centralised career planning mechanisms, as the Committee's report argued, is to preserve diversity in the SES as well as to ensure that selections are made on merit. Central guidance and leadership are not the same as central control. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee was told early in its inquiry that the form of SES adopted in the Australian Public Service was less managerial than that adopted elsewhere, especially in New South Wales and New Zealand. Subsequent developments have shown that to be no bad thing. The risks faced by governments that fall naively for the extreme managerial rhetoric are becoming clearer by the day throughout this country and New Zealand. The New South Wales case is particularly instructive in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  But although I am disappointed at the extent to which the response reaffirms what I think to be a dubious doctrine, I am happy with the responses to many particular recommendations. The Government is proposing to produce better data on mobility trends in the higher Public Service, to experiment with executive search techniques and to encourage senior staff interchanges with the State public services and the private sector. More information will be available on staff redundancies and redundant officers will have an entitlement to counselling of the type that, until now, has usually been supplied on an ad hoc basis. The Public Service Commissioner will act to improve the quality of follow-up action to vacancies advertised in the media. Relocation conditions are to be reviewed. Officers' own efforts to develop and maintain their professional skills are to be included in the core selection criteria for SES positions. </PARA>
<PARA>  More important than this finetuning, the Government has accepted that the Public Service Commissioner should take a leading role in Public Service personnel management. The Commissioner's office has been restructured with that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many of the Committee's more wide ranging comments have been noted in the response in a way that seems positive. The effectiveness of action in the areas of concern flagged by the Committee will depend on the quality of the administrative structure that supports central personnel management. The response gives rise to some hope in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  I read the response as indicating that the more extreme effects on personnel management of the 1987 machinery of government changes have been recognised. I hope that the next few years will see a greater recognition of the unique and important role of the public sector and of the importance of leadership in public sector management. At least the general tone of this response has not discouraged me in that hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I shall be brief, as was Senator Watson, because I have yet to exercise my membership of this Committee. Nevertheless, I have read with interest this Government response. I find the recommendations to be most interesting and I hope to see some results brought about from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I found some extra information after I asked some of the staff of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Senator Cook) to explain part of the response to me. I was interested in some of the information supplied that relates to the section on recruitment and selection. While I was pleased to learn that 25 per cent of the women who apply for senior executive positions are now successful, it is still a disappointment that only 12 per cent of managerial positions are held by women. </PARA>
<PARA>  Within the same section I found that, although attempts are made to recruit from outside the Public Service, only 10 per cent of those who apply from outside the Public Service are successful. This suggests to me that it is still difficult for those who have had some sort of career break--be it involved with raising children or, as I said to somebody earlier, to become an olympic athlete or to pursue a career in private enterprise and become a millionaire--to return from that break and re-enter or become eligible for a position in the Senior Executive Service. Obviously it seems to be a difficult path to follow. I am pleased that, from this response, we can see that the Department is taking seriously the challenge of recruitment based on merit and merit only and not necessarily being a career public servant, which has led to the sorts of criticisms which probably generated this service anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was not pleased to see in the response under the heading `Training and Development' that the service-wide training rate for Senior Executive Service officers was only 3.59 days per person. I agree with the statement in the response that that figure is somewhat on the low side. It is disappointing. If that is a description of the present situation, we hope that lateral thinking is applied to the methods by which that amount of time can be increased. We are told in the response that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . effective training is dependent to a large degree on individual officers and their supervisors planning workloads to take advantage of career development opportunities. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a fancy way of saying that many people for whom training might be suitable consider themselves too busy to take advantage of it. That is probably a common fault of managers, whether they be in private enterprise or the Public Service. Planning to take opportunities for learning or updating skills is required. People suffer too readily from the `I am indispensable' syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA>   The response gives a hint about what would solve this problem, the possibility being to broaden the range of training options. It is important to take note of the possibility that there could be options for external studies which do not have to be attended at a specific time and do not necessarily require absence from work during the day. I trust that this is the sort of option which this response was alluding to. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was pleased to see the suggestion in recommendation 18 which, on the surface, proposed that the Public Service Commissioner compile at least a certain amount of information about the recruitment statistics. I will not quote the recommendation, because it is not important to do so. I am pleased that the principle was not followed that, because it seemed to be useful information, it would be compiled at all costs. The response said that the overall value of the provision of this information would not be justified by the resources needed to obtain it. While that is very interesting, it is obvious that that sort of information could be compiled from other sources and that to provide it as a matter of course is one of those good ideas which to me seem to be a waste of both human and financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  Similarly, recommendation 13 suggests that block advertising be arranged for all of the SES vacancies to be placed in regular insertions in appropriate newspapers. It might sound efficient, but we can easily see that such a method would be wasteful; it has been tried before. Now that we have flexibility and individual accountability of departments, the departments are running their own advertising as and when it is necessary and in the areas in which it is most appropriate. This method is obviously less wasteful. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although on the surface some of the recommendations seem to be reasonable, I am pleased to see that the response indicated that potentially wasteful practices would not be followed. I look forward to seeing the implementation of these recommendations and support the response that we have been given today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have just seen the Government's response, so I am not in a position to comment on it greatly. I notice that throughout the response terms are used which raise a number of questions in my mind. These particularly relate to human resource management frameworks. On pages 4 and 5, the response states that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government is now looking at the development of a human resource management framework which, through providing Departments and agencies with a systematic approach to better training, development and personnel management, will enable our people resource to reach its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? I invite the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Senator Cook) to look in on some of the Senior Executive Service courses that are being undertaken. He would see what the thrust of those courses is: whether they are simply a vehicle for the economic rationalists to promote their view of the SES, to promote their consideration of what ought to be the objectives for a particular department; and whether, inherent in that approach, is the evil of the suggestion that if people do not perform or happen to fit into the hole made for them we should get rid of them. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a real problem in the SES at the moment. Many honourable senators will have seen the responses given by a majority of SES officers who were interviewed about their economic views. It would be disconcerting, to say the least, if such a philosophy--an economic rationalist philosophy, which does not have a human face--were to be the norm which was pursued and promoted in SES courses. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suggest that the Minister also look at whether sufficient attention is paid in these courses to the question of accountability or whether that just means money. One can count money, but that is not what accountability should mean in the SES. In terms of today's rediscovery of ethics in public administration, I support Dr John Uhr's view that:</PARA>
<PARA>The real heart of administrative ethics is the ethics of public accountability. . . accountability to the "authorised scrutineers", i.e. the elected representatives of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>Public servants carry a heavier responsibility, especially when they work on policy issues. They are accountable to the Minister, but they also carry a broader accountability to the Parliament and the Australian people. This is particularly the case where the policies have long term or irrevocable repercussions--</PARA>
<PARA>As many of the policies inevitably do. Dr Uhr goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Public Servants are clearly not employed to pursue their own narrow interests, in a policy sense or in any other way, at the expense of the human rights and interest of the people they serve. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that because it is important for the Minister and, indeed, the Government to keep an ear to the ground to make sure that they know what is being promoted in the training and development programs for our Senior Executive Service. </PARA>

<PARA>  The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS ENTITLED `UNAUTHORISED PROCUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION'</PARA>
<PARA>On 5 June 1991 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs tabled a report entitled `Unauthorised Procurement and Disclosure of Information'. This report stemmed from a reference to inquire into `whether there are effective legal and administrative deterrents to prevent the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information, as discussed on pages 14 to 16 of the Privacy Commissioner's 1989-90 Annual Report.'</PARA>
<PARA>In its report, the Committee noted the concerns which had been expressed by the Privacy Commissioner, and stated that it sought to amplify those concerns. The Committee made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the government provide as a matter of urgency its response to the action it has taken, is taking or intends to take in relation to the matters raised in this report, in particular:</PARA>
<PARA>  . sanctions against public servants who disclose personal information held by a government agency without authorisation;</PARA>
<PARA>  . the criminal law as it applies to those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency; and</PARA>
<PARA>  . the coverage of the Privacy Act in relation to the Privacy Commissioner's power</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  to investigate the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of personal information held by a government agency; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  to award damages to those who have been harmed by the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency. </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated by this response, the government accepts this recommendation, and agrees to provide an outline of its activities and intentions in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Sanctions against Public Servants</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the first particular matter identified by the Committee, it appears that the Privacy Commissioner was essentially concerned about the range of disciplinary measures available against public servants who had been found guilty of disclosing--without authorisation--personal information held by a government agency. The Commissioner had stated that officers found guilty of misconduct may be fined up to $500, but then the next penalty is dismissal. He suggested that a wider range of penalty options would help to avoid the impression that corrupt disclosure cases are not dealt with strongly by tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting from the outset that the range of penalties which are available in these circumstances is not simply confined to a $500 fine or dismissal of the officer. Subsection 62(6) of the Public Service Act presently provides for seven different classes of disciplinary measures, including admonishing the officer, deducting up to $500 from the officer's salary, reducing the salary payable to the officer, transferring the officer, dismissing the officer, or a combination of these sanctions. Prior to the commencement of section 51 of the Public Service Legislation (Streamlining) Act in 1987, the maximum financial penalty which could be imposed under subsection 62(6) was $40. In addition, there are a number of criminal penalties which may be applicable under various secrecy provisions in Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the action taken by the Government in relation to this matter, the Public Service Commission is presently conducting a review of the disciplinary provisions which are contained in the Public Service Act. In the course of this review, the Commission has circulated a discussion paper to Commonwealth agencies and has received a number of submissions in response to that paper. The Commission is now in the process of developing a strategy for the reform of the disciplinary provisions, and is preparing to consult further with the bodies which would be affected by such reforms. One of the issues being considered in that review is the adequacy of the disciplinary sanctions available for misconduct under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Criminal Law</PARA>
<PARA>The second matter identified by the Committee concerns the application of the criminal law to those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information. The Privacy Commissioner told the Committee that such persons are not always "easily able to be effectively prosecuted". The Government recognises this concern and, as was acknowledged in the Commissioner's 1989-90 Annual Report, the Social Security Act was amended in 1989 in order to enable the more effective prosecution of persons who solicit the disclosure of information concerning a client without lawful authority. Since then, similar amendments have been made to other legislative provisions governing the disclosure of personal information, including those contained in the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA>As to the Government's intentions for future amendments to the criminal law, the question of applying criminal sanctions generally to the unauthorised procurement of personal information held by government agencies will be further considered following the receipt of a report of the Gibbs Committee on the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law on provisions of the Crimes Act which deal with disclosure of official information. As noted by the Senate Committee, the Attorney-General's Department is also undertaking a review of secrecy provisions in Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Act</PARA>
<PARA>The final particular matter identified by the Committee concerns the coverage of the Privacy Act. In both of his annual reports, the Commissioner had recommended that the Government consider amending this Act so as to empower him to investigate the entire circumstances in which unauthorised disclosures of personal information occur, and to impose liability in damages upon those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information. As recommended, the government has considered the desirability of such amendments. At this stage, however, such amendments are not regarded as being appropriate, for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>The main reason is that such amendments would not be consistent with the essential role of the Privacy Commissioner, which is to oversee the collection, handling, use and disclosure of personal information by Commonwealth agencies. That role does not extend to cover the actions of individual officers taken beyond the course of their official duties, except in so far as such actions may be attributed to the failure of agencies to comply with the storage and security standards set out in Information Privacy Principle 4 of the Privacy Act. This was recognised by the Commissioner in his evidence to the Committee, when he described the Act as "basically administrative law legislation designed to discipline the conduct of official administration. . . ". </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the current policy of the Privacy Act is that, where the Privacy Commissioner suspects that a tax file number offence against the Income Tax Assessment Act may have occurred, he must refer the matter to law enforcement agencies (s.49). There is no requirement for him to refer any matters concerning unauthorised procurement or disclosure of personal information to law enforcement agencies, although there is nothing in the Privacy Act that would prevent him doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that the unlawful disclosure of official information by individual officers is a matter which would be more properly dealt with by the appropriate law enforcement agencies or disciplinary bodies. Should the Commissioner become aware of such activities, he may advise the relevant agency under paragraph 27(1)(a) of the Privacy Act. In such circumstances, the Chief Executive Officer of the agency would have the authority to refer the matter for investigation by the relevant law enforcement agency. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the extension of the Commissioner's powers to enable the award of damages against individuals, given his role with respect to the administrative practices of Commonwealth agencies in their handling of personal information, would create substantial problems. It is not supported. The awarding of damages for some activities which may under existing legislation be criminal offences would create problems of equity of treatment for alleged offenders as well as problems in determining whether a particular incident should be dealt with administratively by the Privacy Commissioner or instead, by the criminal justice system. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from these policy considerations, there are constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth's ability to vest what may amount to judicial power in the office of Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>General</PARA>
<PARA>The Government remains sensitive to the concerns which the Committee has expressed in relation to the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of personal information, and is seeking to address those concerns in a sensible and consistent manner. On behalf of the Government I thank the Committee for its report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to say something about the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information and the pertinent and quite brilliant speech that Senator Harradine has just given, which has provided a context in which to make my remarks. The report to which the reply is given looked at the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information and it arose from a motion moved in this place by Senator Patterson on 7 May 1991 which read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before 30 September 1991:  The question of whether there are effective legal and administrative deterrents to prevent the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information, as discussed on pages 14 to 16 of the Privacy Commissioner's 1989-90 Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter was considered by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which showed concern for the unauthorised leaking of information, and the Government has replied. The reply comes from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who is a man very much noted for his concern not only for privacy but also for the civil liberties of people generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  Terrible disasters can happen and great unfairness can be done to people when information is wrongly leaked. There is a need for the public servants to be accountable, as Senator Harradine was saying, not only for financial affairs but also for other matters. I thought it most apt that this matter should come on in light of an article I read this week in the Sydney Morning Herald where a Mr Phillip Smiles, who is the Assistant Treasurer in New South Wales, had to face a leak about a matter with which he was concerned and which had been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Sydney Morning Herald report concerned a person who, as I understand it from the report, had a most legitimate difference of opinion from that of the Australian Taxation Office, and which difference of opinion he intended to test in the usual way. However, it was leaked that the matter was being given to the Director of Public Prosecutions, without any notice or warning of what was to be done. Of course, the first that the person heard about it was when it appeared in the media. </PARA>
<PARA>  Reputation is a thing that we all value very much. We might value our reputations in different groups in the community but, nevertheless, there would be very few people who do not value the reputation that they build up. To have that reputation hurt in the way in which Mr Smiles's reputation was hurt on this occasion through a leak is, in my view, very reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA>  We, in this place, have discussed the right to privacy over the years. I think that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as chairman of a committee that dealt with the proposed Australia Card, had much to say about the right to privacy. The sorts of statements that you have made since then indicate your attachment to that principle. It is a principle that I think lies very much at the heart of things and, indeed, imprisoned in the hearts of us all, no matter how cynical we might be at times, is the feeling that there ought to be a right to privacy. Fortunately, more and more of that feeling is becoming liberated and more and more people are expressing the need for that right to privacy. Unfortunately, that appetite, that feeling, for the need for the right to privacy is coming at a time when the build-up of information by more and more agencies is becoming a matter of considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is often said, particularly by the media, that there is a right to know. I am not quite sure what that means. Is there a right to know about everything that everybody does or should a right to know be confined to those matters which have a legitimate public interest about them?  I think that the right to privacy is very much akin to the right to silence. That right to silence is something that has been treasured in our system for many generations. The right to silence is there to preserve the proposition that no person should be found to be guilty out of his or her own mouth. No one should be subject to imprisonment because of what he or she may be forced to say. </PARA>
<PARA>  The right to privacy protects that reputation that, as I said before, we all treasure. It would be my proposition that nobody's reputation should be taken by their being forced, either physically or as is done through leaks, fraud or otherwise, to surrender that reputation or any part of it. It is in those circumstances that people very much want to preserve that right to privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the laws we make, as we do in this chamber, are circumvented, in the terms of this inquiry, by people who have access to information through their position within the Public Service, if they give up that information about others to the media or elsewhere, much harm can be done, as was the case in Mr Smiles's situation. There are many situations in which privacy should be preserved, whether in the confessional or in what we tell our doctors, our social workers or even those we associate with in this chamber. In my view any system which allows those sort of confidences to be betrayed should be very much circumscribed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The leaking that goes on, the revelation as to what we do, is put out on the basis that if we have nothing to hide why should we mind what is said or what is revealed about us. The simple answer is, of course, that it may be one thing if those facts that we may want to keep private are interpreted by somebody who is all knowing and all powerful--the only person who fits that description is the Almighty--but it is another thing when those facts that we want to keep private are revealed and are usually interpreted most wrongly, most unkindly and in a much biased fashion by people who take possession of them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulty with things leaked about people is that they are interpreted by those who publish them in a way that is all too often untrue, unfair and most harmful to people's reputations. Those who reveal facts, those who want to tell us all about other people, and those who want to take on board--only in the proper sense--the facts and revelations about others do so on a basis that is very suspect. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is often said that truth is all; that everything should be done in the name of truth. I wish to quote from a High Court judgment in the case of Bunning v. Cross and in particular from the judgment of Mr Justice Stephen, who later became a most eminent Governor-General of this country, and Mr Justice Aickin, who unfortunately has since died. They quoted another case called Pearse v. Pearse. The judge in that case was Vice-Chancellor Knight Bruce, who had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of courts of justice;</PARA>
<PARA>I might add to the words of Vice-Chancellor Knight Bruce the media and bodies like ICAC, the NCA, parliamentary committees or royal commissions that investigate us all and the community in the name of truth. The judgment goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination . . . Truth, like all other things, may be loved unwisely--may be pursued too keenly--may cost too much. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we are in danger in this modern age, with the advent of all sorts of technology and the advent of all sorts of committees which investigate us and our neighbours, of our pursuit of truth beginning to cost too much. </PARA>
<PARA>  As we go around pursuing those who we say do or act wrongly, there is a proposition that everybody is in need of the redemption that was proclaimed 2,000 years ago. It was right then and I think it is right now. In any decent society there is a give and a take, an expectation that we will be able to preserve our liberties, our reputation, and our right to face our friends and those with whom we associate without what can only be described as a sneaking, snide revelation being unfairly given to others so that it may be published. </PARA>
<PARA>  May I finish by expressing my sympathy with Mr Smiles, who seems to be the latest victim of this sort of action. If, as it seems to appear from this article, it was leaked by the Australian Taxation Office--which is what Mr Smiles seems to think happened--we do have a problem. Therefore, the motion moved by Senator Patterson, the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the reply of the Government are most timely. Senator Harradine talked about the economic rationalists in terms that were not altogether flattering. May I also talk about the `truth seekers' who would go to any length--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I regret somewhat that Senator Cooney did not address in detail the Government's response to the report entitled Unauthorised Procurement and Disclosure of Information made by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I would have appreciated the benefit of his advice much as I enjoyed the erudite rendition of matters that are of concern in the privacy area. The response is an extremely disappointing one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The matters that were addressed by the Committee, and which the Committee requested the Government to address, included:</PARA>
<PARA>  sanctions against public servants who disclose personal information . . .</PARA>
<PARA>  the criminal law as it applies to those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information . . .</PARA>
<PARA>  the coverage of the Privacy Act in relation to the Privacy Commissioner's power</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  to investigate the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of personal information held by a government agency--</PARA>
<PARA>and, incidentally, to refer directly to law enforcement agencies any transgressions that are discovered and, finally:</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  to award damages to those who have been harmed by the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept that there are constitutional difficulties on the last point. However, that is about the only valid excuse which the Government can offer for the total lack of action on the matters of concern that were raised by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the matter of sanctions against public servants, the Government does set out a more detailed gradation than witnesses made available to us. However, there is clearly further reform work to be carried out. We are told that the Public Service Commission is presently conducting a review of the disciplinary provisions which are contained in the Public Service Act. I would have appreciated receiving information on when that review was started and, perhaps more importantly, on when that review is expected to be completed so that some decisive action can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>  We then have the matter of criminal law and the application of that law to those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information. We have heard from the Privacy Commissioner that persons who transgress these provisions are not easily able to be effectively prosecuted. The Government has taken some specific action in the Social Security Act, the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act. However, no attempt has been made so far to consider the application of the criminal law in general terms. Very clearly, the disclosure of private information potentially covers a very wide area and is not limited to those particular Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are told that the Government's intentions for future amendments to the criminal law will be considered further, following the receipt of a report of the Gibbs Committee on the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law on provisions of the Crimes Act which deals with disclosure of official information. Once again, the Government shirks its responsibility and shoves off to yet another inquiry any decision to take effective action. Once again I, and I am sure Senator Patterson, would like to know when that report will be available and when the Government actually intends to take action. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next matter relates to the power of the Privacy Commission to investigate the entire circumstances of disclosure of private information. This is perhaps one of the most important matters on which, once again, the Government has decided not to take action. The specific matter that the Privacy Commissioner asked to have addressed is the circumstance where a person outside the government agency bribes a public servant to provide private information. Obviously, such a person, in many ways, is the real culprit, yet the Privacy Commissioner is prevented from following through and investigating fully that particular transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the same vein, we have the failure of the Government to address the question as to whether the Privacy Commissioner may, in individual instances of transgressions by public servants and, of course, by people outside the government agencies, refer them directly to law enforcement agencies. I believe that section 27(1)(a) of the Privacy Act does nothing of the sort. The section states that the Privacy Commissioner may:</PARA>
<PARA>investigate an act or practice of an agency that may breach an Information Privacy Principle and, where the Commissioner considers it is appropriate to do so, to endeavour, by conciliation, to effect a settlement of matters that give rise to the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>These words do not, in my view, give the Privacy Commissioner the power or authority to refer the matter for investigation by the relevant law enforcement agency. These words do not read that way. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a matter of great regret that the Government has seen fit to duck the issue of adequate enforcement provisions in our privacy legislation. Heaven knows, as Senator Cooney has demonstrated, it is very necessary and not before time that the Government decided to take some action to remedy the obvious shortcomings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am moved to speak on the Government's non-response to the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That is all that I could call it--a non-response. First, I register my appreciation to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for the time and effort it put into investigating the issue that I put forward in the Senate, addressing the matters of concern and putting forward its report. I am not as grateful to the Government for the answer that it has given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Spindler has outlined some of the concerns, and I will reiterate some. My concern was precipitated by a number of events where information about people, held by Government agencies, was being made available for a purpose other than that for which it was obtained. That is the issue that we are looking at--information that is held by an agency being given for a purpose other than that for which it was obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the concerns that the Privacy Commissioner expressed was that there were not adequate financial penalties that could be levelled against a person or a public servant who gave out unauthorised information illegally. The response from the Government says that there is a range of penalties other than the $500 fine. It refers to subsection 62(6) of the Public Service Act, which provides for seven different classes of measures, including admonishing the officer, deducting up to $500 from the officer's salary, reducing the salary repayable to the officer, transferring the officer, dismissing the officer or a combination of these sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a case where the information has been embarrassing or damaging to the person, it seems to me a rather puny punishment. That is what the Privacy Commissioner said--that there were not penalties which were sufficiently severe to deter public servants from disclosing information for their own financial gain. It is a very serious misdemeanour or crime. The disclosure of information has the potential of, in fact, damaging someone for life, yet the deterrent is not very great. But we get no answer, cold comfort, for the Privacy Commissioner in the reply that we got from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reply says that there have been changes to, for example, the Social Security Act, the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act to prevent the solicitation or the procurement of information by third parties. As the Privacy Commissioner has pointed out, those third parties cannot be investigated by him. In fact, some of the information which is held by government departments has enormous commercial value and there is pressure upon public servants by people who want to procure that information for insurance purposes, for the purpose of blackmailing or whatever else. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amount of information that the Health Insurance Commission holds would be useful for a company wanting to know of, for example, all young men under 30 years of age who were taking a drug for hypertension. That has enormous potential for a company involved in actuarial projections and wanting to know whether someone is a risk. Perhaps someone has had an HIV test. There is a huge amount of information with commercial value. The Privacy Commissioner cannot investigate a person who bribes a public servant. He has asked for this power to be reviewed and the Government is saying no. I am sure that the Privacy Commissioner will be interested in the response to this report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report says that the Social Security Act, the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act have been amended, as I said. But there are other Federal agencies which have been implicated in the New South Wales ICAC investigations. They include the Immigration Department, Customs, the Australian Taxation Office, Telecom and Australia Post. There would seem to be an overriding need to amend the legislation which governs these agencies, as well. Senator Cooney referred to one instance recently where an agency--it may have been the Taxation Office--released damaging information. I do not think the Government can rest on its laurels by saying that it has amended the Social Security Act, the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. It needs to redress these other Acts as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would be very interested to know what is happening with respect to the Gibbs Committee on the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law and what it is doing in relation to breaches of the Crimes Act, which deal with the disclosure of official information. I think that many of my colleagues in the Senate would be very interested to see a copy of that report. In fact, I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) whether it would be possible for us to see the terms of reference of the Committee and be advised when it will be reporting. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has been undertaking a review for four years and still it drags on while technology increases and while the amount of information stored on Australians increases. I would have thought that the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs may have stimulated the Attorney-General's Department to at least get on with a report--if not a final report, an interim report--on what it has been doing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Considering that the Government has rejected all of the Privacy Commissioner's recommendations in relation to strengthening his legislation to allow him to deal with the unauthorised procurement of Government information, it seems appropriate, if he had the opportunity under the Privacy Act, for him to furnish a report to the Parliament in response to the Government's response to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  I shall be interested to hear what the Privacy Commissioner has to say. I think that it would be appropriate for the Senate and for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to have an official response from the Privacy Commissioner to the Government's response. More and more I am convinced that the Privacy Commissioner needs to be independent of the Government. He needs to be appointed independently so that he is not gagged or restricted in what he says. There is more and more evidence to suggest that the way in which the Privacy Commissioner's role was set up needs to be reviewed, so that he can be appointed much more independently and therefore can protect our privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I had the opportunity of meeting M. Foveaux in France in the middle of this year and I spoke to him about privacy issues. France has had a privacy commissioner for 15 years and he is appointed independently. An independent body is appointed from which the commissioner is elected. The commissioner is totally independent of the government and is able to comment freely without fear or favour. I believe that public interest is served much better because of that independence. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, it would seem that in Australia the Privacy Commissioner's role is to investigate any breaches of people's privacy that relate to information that they have provided to government agencies which has later been used for purposes other than that for which the information was originally supplied. It seems quite ludicrous that no breach of the Privacy Act occurs simply because the information is unlawfully disclosed by an officer of the agency when acting outside his or her normal duties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Privacy Commissioner in his annual reports has raised a number of issues that should be of great concern to all colleagues in this House and to members of the public. Some of us are concerned about privacy issues and we will pursue them. I believe that this will become a greater issue as technology changes and as the ability to store information in greater amounts is integrated in very different ways. This requires us to be eternally vigilant to ensure that it cannot be abused or misused. As Senator Cooney said, the ends should not justify the means in terms of the way in which information is gained. We shall need to address this issue into the 1990s and, indeed, into the next century. We want to ensure that socially we are on top of this matter in our ability to examine it. We must not leave a mess for the next generation. We do not want that generation to say, `If only they had been more aware at the time of the problems associated with information storage and retrieval'. </PARA>
<PARA>  This response by the Government does not satisfy the Committee's concerns. I shall be interested to hear what the Privacy Commissioner has to say, and it is to be hoped that we shall have access to his comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I table the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia, during January and February 1991. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a report of the delegation's visit to Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia and includes a report on our visit to East Timor. Unfortunately, there is not the time today to go at length into the various issues I want to raise on the report, but I wish to make some comments about the few days that we spent in East Timor. The delegation spent three days in East Timor from 7 to 9 February inclusive. Two days after our visit to East Timor, we also had the opportunity to visit Nusa Tenggara, which is commonly known as West Timor.</PARA>
<PARA>  First, I wish to thank the Indonesian Government for its courtesy, for the arrangements it made and for the general itinerary that was organised in cooperation with our Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of East Timor, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to some of the good points that I noted on my visit. For example, it was very clear that since 1975 there has been some significant improvement in a number of areas in East Timor. For example, there has been a significant increase in the number of medical personnel. In 1983-84 there were 63, and there are now 2,376. The number of high schools has increased from the figure of seven in 1975 to a figure of 33;  the number of high school teachers has increased from 105 to 675. The number of high school students has increased from 1,713 to 11,828. The number of asphalted roads has increased from 20 kilometres in 1975 to 680 kilometres. Those are the sorts of statistics that we were presented with, and at face value there appears to have been a significant improvement in those areas, including the area of agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, there were a number of matters which I consider to be the bad side of the visit. In terms of the economy as a whole, East Timor is the most underdeveloped of the Indonesian provinces. There is little private sector investment at all, let alone any jobs in any industry outside agriculture. There have been disputes about land ownership due to the significant shifting of the population during the military actions of the Indonesians. There is a general fear that East Timorese are becoming second-class citizens in their own province. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Indonesian Army presence is heavy, obvious and overbearing. It was with very great regret that I obtained the view that it is an army of occupation. This contrasts particularly with the situation in West Timor, where the military presence was negligible. If we are to accept the Indonesian Government's assertion--and I have to say that I do not--that it is not an army of occupation and is simply there on manoeuvres and normal duties, I simply pose the question: why is there such a heavy military presence in East Timor and not in West Timor?</PARA>
<PARA>  Regarding human rights, I draw the attention of the Senate to a number of paragraphs in the report including our recommendations in paragraphs 3.10 and 3.12. I would like to quote very briefly from those sections of the report. Paragraph 3.10 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Delegation is aware of a number of international reports outlining human rights abuses in East Timor. A majority of the Delegation believed that some or all of these can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 3.12 states:</PARA>
<PARA>It became evident that Timorese, even if they could, did not feel secure enough to talk freely. Many members of the Delegation were struck with the sense of sullenness of the local people. On the few occasions some members took the opportunity to walk in the streets of Dili, when passing, people rarely engaged in eye contact and it was only when contact was initiated with a smile or hello did they respond themselves, often with open and warm smiles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is not part of their culture. If Senator Watson had a gun shoved in his face, he would have his head down as well. That is absolute nonsense. I also draw the attention of the Senate to recommendation 3.19 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Delegation, in noting the widespread Indonesian Army presence throughout East Timor and the effect its presence has on the local people, considers the East Timorese People would be encouraged to become more active in their own affairs if there were fewer soldiers and the number of combat to civil construction soldiers reduced. The Delegation was concerned that the heavy concentration of combat troops could lead to the inference that they were necessary for the central government to maintain control. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with regret that I draw the attention of the Senate to those features of the military's presence. </PARA>
<PARA>  We indicate in our recommendations that we believe there should be very careful handling of the economic development of East Timor; that there should be an encouragement of private sector investment; that the air link with Darwin should be re-established; that, hopefully, some sort of special economic agreement will be developed in order to foster economic development in East Timor; and that, hopefully, the benefits of the Timor Gap Treaty that was signed at the end of our trip will accrue to the people of East Timor. Also, there should be a significant increase in aid to the education centre. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have already contrasted the situation in East Timor with the situation that existed in West Timor. In terms of the future, I draw the attention of the Senate to a minority report signed by three members of the delegation which appears on page 140 of the report. There are only two minority recommendations which were endorsed by me, Mr Garrie Gibson and Mr Allan Morris, members in the other place. The first reads:</PARA>
<PARA>That a conference, convened by the United Nations, consisting of all parties involved in the current dispute including the Governments of Portugal and Indonesia, be held as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The second minority recommendation, entitled `Australian Government', reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government should directly pursue the recommendations as outlined in this report with the United Nations and the Indonesian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I owe it to my two other colleagues to give a brief explanation as to why we presented a minority report on our visit to East Timor. It will be a brief outline of our reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that if we are to endorse such ventures as our military presence in the Middle East, as we did earlier this year, we need to be consistent in our approach to military aggression wherever it occurs. It is no good Indonesia claiming that East Timor is simply its own internal affair. Hundreds of years of history of a different culture and of ethnic, social and economic divergence deny Indonesia that claim. There are special and unique problems in East Timor that require special and unique solutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other countries around the world have had, and continue to have, a solid working relationship with Indonesia despite strong differences on the issue of East Timor. I believe that Australia can have a solid relationship with Indonesia. However, if we are to be consistent in our foreign policy approach, the issue of East Timor and the various resolutions in the United Nations that have been passed on this issue need to be addressed. Australia needs to be at the forefront, as it has been in other areas, of ensuring that those United Nations requests are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to see a strong and effective working relationship between Australia and Indonesia. Certainly, Indonesia is a country that cannot be ignored. It is probably one of the most important countries for our future. It has a population of some 285 million. It had an economic growth rate of 8 per cent last year. Only last week, an Asian studies conference which I attended in Tasmania concentrated on Indonesia. After attending that conference and visiting Indonesia I believe that, clearly, much of our future lies with that country, so it is with regret that I make my remarks about the Indonesian presence in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I would like to thank the other members of the delegation who accompanied me. It was my first delegation. I enjoyed their company greatly, and they were of great assistance to me on this trip. I also thank the secretary, John Dyer. I have already mentioned the Indonesian authorities, but I would also like to thank the officials in Singapore and Hong Kong who assisted us during the trip, particularly our Australian Embassy staff. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to give considerable credit to the Governor of East Timor, Mario Carrascalao, and the military commander, Brigadier-General Warouw, with whom we spent quite some time. There is no doubt that these two individuals have made a very determined and conscientious effort to improve the situation in East Timor under their jurisdiction. I give them considerable credit for their openness and frankness in discussing with us the problems in East Timor. Obviously, we saw many other people in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is very important that the issue of East Timor is addressed and that the improvement in our relationship with Indonesia continues, despite this outstanding very serious problem. I hope that we can look forward to an improved relationship with Indonesia in the coming years. There are a number of other aspects of the report, such as the education office, our visit to the ship HMAS Success and other aspects of the delegation's trip to Hong Kong and Singapore that I will speak on another time. </PARA>

<PARA>  I also pay tribute to the Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong, the High Commission in Singapore and the Ambassador's office in Jakarta and Indonesia for facilitating our visits to those particular places. I also pay particular tribute to the governments, officers and officials of the three nations we visited for their very considerable assistance in facilitating our delegation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Time is too short to comment at any length on any parts of the report. It is quite a lengthy report. I commend it to anyone who is interested in those particular affairs. The report goes into some detail on various recommendations--there are quite a number of recommendations--and there are also quite significant facts and reports that support those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I briefly mention a few parts of the report and of our particular delegation. I was terribly impressed with Hong Kong as a vibrant, bustling city, one where the inhabitants are keen to work. They have a real initiative and incentive to work. They get out, and they have a sparkling, bustling economy that we in Australia could learn much from. I was terribly impressed with the way Hong Kong, without any natural resources, has progressed as much as it has. There is some concern about the 1997 reunification, or re-incorporation, with the People's Republic of China. My general impression was that people in political life were a little concerned about it, a little hesitant, but that the business community was generally looking forward to it. The business community was welcoming reunification and was certain to cope with it very well. As I say, the business community was looking forward to coping with it. </PARA>
<PARA>   Another aspect of the Hong Kong trip that particularly struck me was the Vietnamese boat people. Hong Kong, a very small and not terribly wealthy nation, is making an enormous contribution to the Vietnamese boat people. It is not getting a lot of support from any of the major Western countries or any other countries at all, but it is doing a marvellous job itself in looking after the Vietnamese boat people at their first port of call. It is an enormous strain on the Hong Kong economy. In an economy where the inhabitants themselves are pushed for land and pushed for resources, Hong Kong has set aside quite a substantial part of land and resources to look after the people who are trying to escape. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 1.17 of our report in which we urge the United States and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to reconsider their opposition in principle to involuntary repatriation. That is a matter we could talk about at length, but it is something I draw the Senate's attention to. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Singapore, we were again privileged to meet with many government officials. We spoke with the Institute of South-East Asian Studies, a vibrant academic organisation, one that Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Liberal Party in Australia, has spent some time at. One cannot help be impressed by the vibrancy and the free economic thought of that particular study group and of its leader, Professor Sandhu. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was interesting to see that, although we Australians at times think we are fairly good, the Singapore people shook their heads with dismay that a country as wealthy and with all the resources that Australia has did so little with them. The people made it very clear to us that if we are to succeed in Asia we have to be competitive in quality and prices but, more particularly, in reliability of delivery dates. There was quite a lot of talk about our unreliability and the trouble we have on our waterfront and in getting trade moving to those areas. </PARA>
<PARA>   Because of the Gulf war, we were prevented from going to Thailand and Pakistan, which was originally part of our itinerary. But it did bring one benefit; that is, we were in Singapore when HMAS Success, one of the ships from the Australian Navy that had been in the war, was returning from the war zone for the first time. We were very fortunate to be able to meet up with the ship in Singapore and to go on board. We spent a very pleasant afternoon on board as guests of the ship and its captain. We had a very interesting time there. </PARA>
<PARA>  Time does not permit me to recount at any length. But I was pleased to meet Oscar, who happened to be the ship's dummy but who is someone who I had been corresponding with. I had been requested through this Parliament to write to our sailors in the Middle East. I had been writing to this ship and had been getting a response from a person named Oscar. When I asked to see Oscar, and when we coincidentally and quite by accident ended up on the ship, there was some embarrassment, but eventually Oscar was brought out to meet me. It was the ship's dummy that was thrown overboard to practise lifesaving techniques. That was quite an interesting aspect of the tour. It is recounted in more detail in our report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Indonesian experience was enormously beneficial to me. I was particularly impressed with the sincerity and high regard of the Indonesian officials whom we spoke with. I was particularly impressed with its national creed of Pancasila by which the country operates. Pancasila is five principles which are very important. I mention briefly the five principles of Pancasila which all Indonesians are familiar with and are made to learn as young children. They are: firstly, belief in one god; secondly, a just and civilised humanity; thirdly, unity; fourthly, democracy; and, fifthly, social justice. The tenets of Pancasila are what guide the country and impressed me very greatly. </PARA>
<PARA>  We were fortunate enough to have an audience with President Suharto, a very wise and worldly and very experienced world leader. As I say, we were particularly privileged to have an audience with him. The President mentioned that Indonesia loves peace and independence and it does not want to do anything to jeopardise the independence and sovereignty of other nations in its region. The President--I am fairly certain it was President Suharto--did also, very politely though, indicate that, whilst he did not want to interfere in anyone else's affairs, other nations should adopt the same sort of principle. I must say, particularly as it relates to some of the things that some of my colleagues spoke about in Indonesia, that I supported the principle and the gentle urging by President Suharto of us in that particular way. </PARA>
<PARA>  I found Indonesia, what I saw of it, to be a vibrant, bustling country; an economy where people want to work, where there is incentive, where they want to get ahead. I feel that in the not too distant future Indonesia will be one of the major trading nations of Asia and, in fact, the world. It is working very, very hard to get to that category. </PARA>
<PARA>   We were one of the first foreign delegations in recent times to enter into East Timor. There had been some prohibition on free access into there, but it had been lifted. We were fortunate to be one of the first groups there. When we went into East Timor there was, again, an abundance of Australian press. There was certainly no indication that it was an area under military rule or an area where there was censorship or inhibitions on freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not particularly agree with all the recommendations in the report. Senator Sherry mentioned some; I also wish to refer briefly to some of the recommendations and make my own comments on them. One recommendation that I certainly agree with was that there should be more bilateral exchanges between Indonesian parliamentarians and Australian parliamentarians. I hope the Government will take up that recommendation and introduce a scheme whereby there is much closer and more regular contact between Australian parliamentarians and Indonesian parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was particularly pleased to be able to raise the question of Garuda Airways coming into northern Australia. I am pleased to say that in recent times the Indonesian airline, Garuda, has announced plans to fly into Townsville and Cairns. The report talks about the armed forces and urges greater cooperation between the Indonesian armed forces and the Australian defence forces. I agree with that and ask the Government to pursue it further.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are recommendations on aid, particularly in East Timor, and the water supply for Dili. I support those recommendations and urge the Government to consider them seriously. There is a series of recommendations on human rights in East Timor. There were some that I did not agree with. My impressions of East Timor were that it was a country that had had an internal problem since the Portuguese left the area many years ago. But by a lot of hard work and positive and committed action, the Government had increased the infrastructure, schooling, health services, water supply and roads. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a large military presence but I disagree that it is overbearing. At one of the outstations we visited I was approached by a number of the military people. I did not understand what the different uniforms meant but many of the people in uniform under the control of the Army were territorials. I spoke to a lawyer and a doctor who were in uniform and who were students from the Jakarta University; they were working to assist the people in these more remote areas of East Timor. One was doing medical work and I think the lawyer was doing farm work. They are part of the territorial forces which are there to benefit the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our report says that many members of the delegation were struck with a sense of sullenness on the part of the local people. There may have been many members of the delegation who gained that impression, but I was not one. I thought the people were very friendly. They were shy, but there are many indigenous peoples around the world who are shy in the presence of strangers. I did not take that to be sullenness. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a comment about the delegation visiting a local market, the delegation's visit not being pre-arranged and the sudden appearance in the market having the effect of stopping all activity with people nervously standing around. I do not agree with that aspect of the report. I walked through that village, through the markets. I bought some things. Again, the people were shy and hesitant but when one talked to them, when one got to know them and when one smiled at their children, they were no different from people anywhere. They were interested in the delegation, which in their eyes was obviously high powered. But I did not perceive that in the way that some of my colleagues did. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were some comments in our report about the widespread Indonesian Army presence. I agree that as soon as the Indonesian Army can remove as many of its people in uniform as it can the local people will feel a little happier. But I did not think the presence was overbearing. </PARA>
<PARA>  I emphasise that we spoke with Brigadier General Warouw, the military commander in Dili. We were all impressed with his sincerity, his understanding of human rights problems and his absolute commitment to deal with abuses that he was made aware of. Undoubtedly there are human rights abuses in East Timor, but there are human rights abuses right around the world. Even our nation is not free from human rights abuses. </PARA>
<PARA>  At times I was concerned that as a delegation we were not seen as three-day experts; we had walked into what has been a very difficult situation in East Timor and did not want to become three-day experts and then presume to go out and give advice to the military commander and Governor Carrascalao, whom we were also privileged to meet. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Governor was a well-educated, humane and compassionate man who comes from that part of the world and was doing an absolutely mighty job in East Timor in difficult circumstances. The whole delegation was impressed by his commitment to the people and by his wish to make their lives better. He was especially concerned about unemployment and the lack of employment opportunities. That is something we are all very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA>  My colleague Senator Sherry referred to the increases in health, welfare, roads and education facilities in East Timor since the arrival of the Indonesian Government. East Timor has received a disproportionately high per capita amount of money from the central government compared with other areas in Indonesia. This has all been part of a deliberate attempt to try to lift the lives of the people in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Governor explained the history of East Timor, where some years ago the Portuguese simply walked out and left the locals and different groups to themselves. Civil strife then occurred where people were killed and rival factions fought with each other. There was a real threat of a full-scale civil war and the Indonesian Government entered that vacuum. Whilst some people think that East Timor should be independent, it seems to me ridiculous to even suggest that; it is a small nation, it has no inherent wealth and it simply could not exist as an independent nation in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are a near neighbour of East Timor. One of the local villagers told us when we were in the mountains that from the top of the mountain one could see Darwin on a clear day. I think there was a bit of local rumour in that. Still, it is very close to us. I should like to see the Australian Government and the Australian nation put a special effort into increasing contacts with East Timor. There is already a lot of contact between parts of Indonesia and Darwin and Western Australia. I should like to see closer and more regular visits to East Timor from Australians so that we can try to get some industries going. I am not sure what could be done. Those sorts of things would be particularly beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA>  Overall the visit was especially helpful and beneficial to me and all members of the delegation in getting a closer contact with all of those areas we visited. I again thank the governments of the other nations that we visited for their courtesy and congratulate all of them on their attempts to increase the welfare of their own peoples. I thank the Parliament for giving me the opportunity to participate in that delegation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This document contains the resolutions of the sixth meeting of the Australian Soil Conservation Council which was held at Nelson in New Zealand on 15 February 1991. Three items were on the agenda and there were three resolutions to these items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first item considered by the Council involved options for improving the coordination and integration of natural resource management policies and programs. The second item referred to the implications of sustainable agriculture in the decade of the Landcare program. The Council resolved that the decade plan should focus on the control of land degradation, but should also remain responsive to developments in the areas of sustainable development and sustainable agriculture. The last item considered by the Council at this meeting was a review of the progress of the Decade of Landcare plan. This is the most important section of the report as it provides information about the actual progress and action taken to date. </PARA>
<PARA>  A body called Landcare Australia Ltd has been established. Its role is to raise public awareness of and encourage corporate support for Landcare activities. Landcare has increased the demand for soil conservation advisory and technical services and although the rural recession has reduced the scale of soil conservation work, it has not reduced the commitment of land holders to Landcare. However, resources available to soil conservation agencies remain limited, so it is necessary to give priority to servicing existing Landcare groups, rather than the establishment of new groups. </PARA>
<PARA>  The review of the Decade of Landcare plan also notes that the plan will have to be flexible so that it can respond to changing needs and priorities. In order to do this, it is proposed that the plan will continue to be reviewed throughout the decade. The Australian Soil Conservation Council must be applauded for these resolutions, but I am concerned that the Council, the responsible Ministers and the Federal and State governments continue to pass motions in Australia and review plans but fail to take urgently needed action before it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the mid-1980s, Government experts have been warning that agricultural production in the Murray-Darling basin, for instance, was in peril unless hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to control the risk to the soil posed by the salinity problem. At risk then, and now, is the salad bowl of Australia--a one million square kilometre basin covering one-seventh of the land area of Australia. It is the most valuable one-seventh because it produces almost half of the nation's agricultural products. It supports half of Australia's sheep and a quarter of its cattle. Directly or indirectly, this area supports two million people. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1986, Dr Alastair Grieve of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture reported that this valuable area of Australia was dying. He said that a quarter of the region was already affected by salinity; trees and crops were dying in approximately 5 per cent of the region; and many farms were reaching only 50 per cent of their potential output because of salinity. He went on to warn that:</PARA>
<PARA>In another 20 years, the problem will have become very much worse and will be virtually beyond our control. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now five years since this warning was given and if there are only 15 years left before the problem of salinity is beyond us, then the time for talking is over. Now is indeed the time for urgent and immediate action. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate is considering the Australian National University annual report for 1990. It is a very comprehensive report of all the activities of the two parts of the university: the Faculties and the Institute of Advanced Studies. I will mention only those sections of the report which I feel the Senate should be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Page 4 of the report refers to recurrent funding for the university as a whole. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1978, the purchasing power of recurrent funding has declined . . . expenditure on buildings and . . . salary increases . . . have increased to the extent where total staff numbers funded from recurrent grants have declined since 1977 by 19 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This reduction in the purchasing power of funding has serious implications for the academic integrity of the university which is trying to cope with a very large increase in the number of students and a declining number of staff. </PARA>
<PARA>  Page 8 of the report refers to the very serious problem which faces the university as a result of the relative funding model. Changes in funding under this model will have their full impact in 1995, by which time the faculties will be teaching 500 more students with $2.1m less in funding than they have in 1990. Despite these difficulties, the faculties of the ANU have undergone a major restructuring, including the inauguration of a campus-wide graduate school with over 30 graduate school programs covering nearly all of the university's research and teaching fields. The graduate school is forming a bridge between the two parts of the ANU: the Faculties and the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Page 11 of the report refers to the review of the role and standing of the Institute of Advanced Studies conducted under the chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen. The Committee broadly endorsed the role of the institute and found that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in most respects the Institute of Advanced Studies has met outstandingly well its charter of engaging research and providing advanced training at the highest international standard and in areas of national importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommended that the institute remain a constituent part of the ANU and that it continue to be funded by a block grant and be responsible for establishing its own priorities. I take this opportunity to inform the Senate that, since the publication of the ANU report for 1990, this recommendation by the Stephen Committee has been totally disregarded. The Federal Government is determined to involve the Australian Research Council in the review process and funding recommendations for the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA>  In response, the institute has made very strong recommendations to Minister Baldwin that the involvement of the ARC will signal a further erosion of the independence of all Australian universities. The institute has argued that the ARC should not make recommendations on levels of funding for the institute, nor should the Government specify allocations to individual schools within the institute. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Stephen Committee made a specific recommendation concerning the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It recommended that it should become a separate institution with its own governing body, wholly funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and affiliated with the ANU for academic purposes. In the report which we are considering this evening, the ANU indicated that it disagreed with the proposal to excise the John Curtin School from the institute. The institute is opposed to any transfer of funding from the John Curtin School away from the education portfolio because it threatens the autonomy of the ANU by reducing its power to manage the entire university. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such a move would make strategic planning involving the John Curtin School and other parts of the university more difficult to administer and would centralise the funding of medical research in Australia to an unacceptable degree. The threat of forced amalgamation with the University of Canberra continues to haunt the ANU. The latest development in that saga is a resolution by the ANU that it does not consider it appropriate to contemplate the Minister's proposal for a federated model of amalgamation. The Hawke Labor Government is destroying the academic integrity and autonomy of our universities. I urge the Senate to take careful note of all reports relating to higher education and to take every action to prevent this erosion of integrity occurring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are discussing the Australian National University annual report for 1990, and Senator Tierney has spoken to the motion that the Senate take note of the document. I also wish to speak briefly to that document. Mr Deputy President, you might also wish to do so, being a distinguished member of the ANU Council, but are perhaps precluded from doing so because of your present position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As Senator Tierney pointed out, the document refers to the funding arrangements for the university over recent years. He, too, referred to the pressure on staff--I think that was the phrase he used. While the document is totally comprehensive about the financial matters affecting the university and the implications for the students because of their numbers and the reduced number of staff, it does not, in a sense, deal with the personal impact that this has. </PARA>
<PARA>  On this occasion I wish to pay tribute to those members of the staff of the Australian National University who over these recent years--which I regard as very difficult years for them--have remained totally dedicated and committed to their undertaking to teach students at the university. I believe that they have been placed under great pressure not only from the financial implications which are apparent from the document but also by reason of the fact that at the same time they have had to put up with the determination by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) almost to destroy the institution, it seemed to me, through his insistence upon amalgamation with what was the Canberra College of Advanced Education and is now the University of Canberra. This has gone on for some years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Tierney referred to the review conducted by Sir Ninian Stephen. I want to remind honourable senators of the subsequent document that was produced by Professor Chubb. It was said at the time that Professor Chubb was appointed that he was to look at the ways of implementing the review of Sir Ninian Stephen. But it seemed to me that the report that Professor Chubb finally produced bore no resemblance whatever to the recommendations of the Stephen report which preceded it. So the saga has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although amalgamation no longer seems to be pressing, it seems to me even now that there is still a tax on the university, and that is destabilising for the students and the staff. I wish that the Government would leave the institution alone so that it can get on with the job it is supposed to be doing of teaching students and be able to retain the very high reputation that it has. </PARA>

This is an appropriate occasion to commend the Institute of the Arts for what it has achieved and for what it contributed to students in the years it was a school.

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This document contains the report prepared by the Schools Council for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on the operation of resource agreements for both the government and non-government school sectors. However, because of the development of a process of annual national reporting on schools in Australia, the public sector area has really been subsumed in the operation of resource agreements in a separate way. The report that we are dealing with today focuses on the operation of resource agreements for the non-government sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report is really just a letter from Ms Lindsay Connors, the Chairperson of the Schools Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Ms Connors claims that her report on resource agreements for the non-government sector is based on data on outcomes received and analysed by the schools and curriculum division of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and its summaries of those outcomes provided for the Council. That is where any useful information in this report comes to an abrupt end. </PARA>
<PARA>  This report is, sadly, all too typical of reports on education matters provided by or for this Government. It is very short--four pages in all--and totally devoid of any useful information. There is no information on the data of outcomes received and analysed by the Department, there are no details about the summaries provided to the Schools Council and there are no particulars about any of the resource agreements. Yet this document claims to be a report on the operation of resource agreements for the schools sector as required under the Employment, Education and Training Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The four relevant paragraphs in the report contain vague and generalised information which is virtually useless. The first of these paragraphs indicates that there are initiatives to achieve objectives under the agreement. The second paragraph merely states that there are programs and initiatives to achieve the objectives and there are methods to evaluate their effectiveness. Paragraph 3 proposes that further consideration be given to the development of a comprehensive and cooperative national system of monitoring and reporting on schools. One wonders what the Schools Council has been doing if it has not been doing this already. The final paragraph notes that the National Board is undertaking a study of cross-sectoral resource allocation which includes consideration of accountability and how this might best be linked to resource mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Where is there any information about resource agreements in the non-government sector in this report? Where is the analytical or statistical information--or any information--about what is contained in the summaries of the outcomes? This report reveals two things, both of which I find very disturbing. Firstly, schools are providing information to DEET on resource allocation, but that information is not being processed to provide precise and detailed data for this Parliament. It appears that either DEET is not processing the information which it receives adequately or this is just another attempt by Minister Dawkins to conceal information in an excess of generalities which reveal nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, there is the disturbing hint in this report that non-government schools are about to be subjected to the increasing administrative burden of providing even more information to the Government under the proposed national system of monitoring and reporting--more information from DEET which it will probably fail to process. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is typical of the Hawke Labor Government to provide resources to educational institutions with the one hand, and then demand that the institutions waste their meagre resources on providing information to the Government which is never properly processed or passed on to users or to the public. This report is one of the worst examples of a waste of resources on totally inadequate information. I cannot recommend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note  of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I am a member of the Advisory Council on Australian Archives, as a representative from this Senate. There are two or three matters in the report which I wish to specifically draw to the attention of honourable senators. On page 8 of that report there is a paragraph relating to electronic records. The purpose of retaining records is that in the future people will be able to have some understanding of their history and their heritage and the way things have developed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The number of records which are now being kept in electronic forms of one kind or another is a new development in the area of record keeping. We are faced with the dilemma of knowing how these records can be preserved. We may in fact keep a whole lot of floppy discs or such other things, but in many years to come how will we play them back if we do not preserve all the relevant hardware to do so? That is a very simplistic way of referring to what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Archives has reported to us that it has commenced a long term project to develop and implement guidelines for the management by Commonwealth agencies of the increasing volume of electronic records being generated by those agencies. There is the question of records and records which have been changed with updated information. If they are on paper, we would have the original copy and the subsequent copies. In some instances, they themselves would tell a story about how they developed and emerged. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report of the Archives Council states that the longer term aspects of access and preservation in particular are major issues which need to be addressed. It may even mean that funds need to be made available to see that adequate research is able to be undertaken to see that we can keep records. There are splendid records of this country available now from many years gone by and they are of great interest. It would be a pity if we did not get right the current electronic use for storing records. I urge the Senate and the Government to take note of that as a very important issue for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  Related to this is the question of preservation and the use of permanent paper. So much paper that is used now is loosely referred to as `acid paper' which will deteriorate. Some records even now are deteriorating. In my own family photograph albums, I noticed recently that some photographs taken in 1973 have significantly deteriorated, whereas photographs discovered in my mother's house, when it was packed up a couple of years ago after she died, which were many years older than that--from the 1920s--were in very good condition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, I do not have an ageing painting in the attic, as far as I know. It might be ageing, but not in the attic. The question of acid paper and the impact on records is important. I really believe that these records are part of the national heritage. It is important that we leave our history to Australians who will be here long after we have gone. I urge the Archives to take these matters seriously, as they are doing, and I urge the Government to listen to the recommendations it hears from the Archives relating to materials and practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy President, as you will have heard often before, the Archives wants its own building in the Parliamentary Triangle. I totally support this. I hope the building will be there long before the centenary of Federation. I will be a bit shattered if it takes that long. We will have a place in the old Parliament House, but that does not replace what is needed for the display of the material which the Archives has. Referring to the centenary celebration, the Archives should play a very significant role in plans for that because of the material it has and is able to present. I hope the Government will increase its interest in setting up the necessary mechanisms to see that the centenary is celebrated as it should be and that the Archives will be a very important part of that. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate--</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  notes that the Government is considering the creation of a special committee of Ministers to speed major projects as a result of the disastrous situation Australia has reached in the development of mineral resource projects;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  condemns the Government for its ineptitude which has allowed so many mineral projects around Australia to be either totally stopped or delayed, and for eight years of lost opportunity on these projects; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  calls on the Government to ensure that projects already cleared by mining and environmental authorities proceed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>As part (a) of my motion indicates, this Government is considering the creation of a special committee to fast-track certain projects. I consider this to be a total admission that these projects have been slow-tracked all along. I will leave it up to the imagination of honourable senators whether they were slow-tracked or were allowed to be slow-tracked. I believe they have been sidetracked at a remote siding and forgotten about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has reached the bottom of the pit in economic terms. Even this Government, which is responsible for putting us in this position--as well as putting one million Australians out of work--is obviously starting to see some daylight. The time we spend on the bottom of that pit depends on how quickly we can get Australia's export earnings going again. Those increased export earnings will not come from the agricultural and manufacturing centres in the short term, let alone in the long term. In fact, the agricultural sector export income has halved in the past 12 months: it is down to a figure of $3.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  That leaves only one sector--the mining sector--to assist in our economic recovery. We would not have reached such depths in economic terms, even allowing for the recession that we had to have, had the mining sector not been so fettered since 1983 or frustrated at every attempt to get new projects off the ground. In some cases even extensions to existing projects were not given approval. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am afraid that Australia has been living on the developments that were put into action in the 1960s and the 1970s without starting new ones to replace them. We now have to mortgage the next generation to be able to get ourselves out of the problems that we are in. The Government did this by selling out to the radical groups in the environmental sector and in the Aboriginal sector time and time again. This was most evident in the 1990 election when the Government bowed to every lobby group in existence to secure the very few votes to enable it to hang onto power. But what has it cost the average Australian for Mr Hawke's grab to remain in power?  We will never be able to work it out. </PARA>
<PARA>  That figure could be calculated by dividing the amount of revenue and capital investment that has been forgone by the population of Australia to obtain a per capita figure. We will never be able to calculate that figure. Not only have we forgone the revenue and capital investment of each program but we also have to look at a lot of the downstream advantages obtained from developing resources. The only tangible evidence that we have of the fettering of those industries is the Government's policy which has brought about one million unemployed Australians, the death of country and remote towns, discouraged people, record bankruptcies and idle machinery that could be producing export income. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most outstanding fiasco was the precedent that was set at Coronation Hill which was used by other lobby groups around Australia. This Government allowed Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to spend $13m on exploration but then denied BHP the fruits of its labour to the detriment of the Jawoyn people and to the rest of Australia. At least at Coronation Hill the Jawoyn people have now elected a leader who is more interested in mining. Hopefully, we may see a reversal of the Hawke-Green sell out at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>  As alluded to in my motion, at long last we now hear Senator Button and Mr Griffiths speaking of fast tracking some projects in an attempt to reduce unemployment. Or is it the case that these two Ministers and the whole Government are preparing their Green mates for the big letdown of promises that is about to come?  Even this Government has seen fit to try to turn around the unemployment situation which has been created in the life of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask: where were those two Ministers when the coalition was calling for the opening up of these projects?  I do not know where they were. To Senator Button's credit, a secret letter that he sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), which finished up in the Sydney Morning Herald, shows that he has probably had some concern for quite some time but, unfortunately, he was not able to convince others in the Cabinet to do something about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government was able to carry on with this sort of sell out to every Green lobby group, black lobby group, come what may group in Australia while we could afford the luxury of doing so. The primary industries--the wheat and wool industries--and, to a certain extent, the manufacturing industries were supporting Australia. Unfortunately, the Government thought that would last forever and that it would be able to remain in power forever. We then had the downturn in the agricultural sector, with the wool industry reaching the worst position it has been in for about 30 years. On top of that, we have taken a hiding in the grain industry from the trade war between the United States and the European common market. We may see a slight turnaround in the wheat industry, but we will not see it in wool for five years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's luxury of tapping into every lobby group has now passed. So it is back to basics. The only basic principle we have in Australia is to start developing mineral resources and to get them producing. The Government stands condemned for sitting on its hands while project after project has been delayed. Let us look at Western Australia's forgone opportunities. There are at least 10 projects that could have been under way but have suffered significant delays. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first is the rare earths project proposed by Rhone-Poulenc at Pinjarra which was delayed by difficulties in gaining EPA approval for the project. The project has been deferred indefinitely. The cost to the State, and to Australia, in lost investment was $150m; the revenue loss would be $100m per year. The silicon smelter development advanced by the Barrack Group, now SIMCOA, was delayed because of the location being changed several times for political reasons. The cost to the State was the delay in a $100m investment. The coal mine and related power station proposed by Canning Resources at Hill River--I remember that one very well--was initially delayed by sectional groups and the Government's indecision. It is now proposed that part of the resource be quarantined in a national park. Detailed exploration and feasibility studies cost the company $30m. The proposed investment was $1.5 billion, which is one-third of the amount that went into the gas project on the north-west shelf. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Yakabindie nickel mine, proposed by Dominion Mining, is subject to continuing delay because of disputes over Aboriginal heritage matters within the project area. Feasibility studies to date have cost $10m. If the project does not proceed, capital investment of $350m as well as revenue of $250m per year will be lost to the State. The Marandoo iron ore development proposed by Hamersley Iron is subject to continued delays because of disputes over Aboriginal heritage matters. If the project does not proceed, a capital investment of $500m will be lost to the State and, of course, also to Australia. The Beenup mineral sands project undertaken by Mineral Deposits Ltd has been delayed because of lobbying by the environmental community over road and power supply routes. The project has now been deferred for 12 months with a cost to the State in deferred investment of $135m. I suggested that the road should link up with the nearest railway line. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition 900 applications for exploration licences--497 on private land, let alone public land; 173 on conservation estates and 235 on Aboriginal land or on land considered to be environmentally sensitive--are currently delayed. Some applications have been pending for five years. The total cost in lost capital investment amounts to $2.5 billion. The total annual revenue of these projects would probably be about $1 billion per year. And that is only in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The two Western Australian resources that stick out most in my mind are those at Marandoo and Yakabindie. I will expand on those two projects. I visited Marandoo only about two weeks ago in the company of a few of my colleagues. The idea at Marandoo is to produce 10 million tonnes of ore per annum by the year 1994. The mine is not a stand alone project. It is being developed to supplement the depleted iron ore deposits at Mount Tom Price. Mount Tom Price, which works in conjunction with the mine at Paraburdoo, is running down. We have had to have a secondary deposit to replace the grade of ore at Mount Tom Price so that in 1994, when the mine at Mount Tom Price runs down, it will be able to use the ore at Maran</PARA>
<PARA>doo for blending. Otherwise the whole concept will fold</PARA>
<PARA>  It will cost $500m to get the project up and running, with $400m to be spent domestically. During the construction phase 4,000 jobs will be created which, incidentally, is 5 per cent of WA's current unemployment level. If we get 20 of those sort of projects going, we will wipe out the current unemployment in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It will also lead to further development of other deposits which go down to Mount Newman in the Pilbara area. Mount Tom Price is railed into Dampier; Mount Newman goes into Port Hedland; and Robe River goes to Wickham. That part of the mighty Pilbara forms a big triangle which is actually about the size of Victoria. Anyone who has not seen the Pilbara area, which has put so much into Australian pockets since 1966 or thereabouts, should go and visit it. So that honourable senators can see the layout of the Pilbara in Western Australia, I seek leave to have a locality map of the Pilbara iron ore industry incorporated in Hansard. I have spoken to the Minister about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The point about Marandoo is that the objections are not spiritual in an Aboriginal sense but archaeological. It is not like the Bula at Coronation Hill. This deposit, which is the subject of so much worry, lies in Hamersley National Park. It is actually part of the old Mount Bruce cattle station, which was abandoned in 1946 because it could not make a pound. At that time the station went back to the Lands Department and, for want of something better to do with it, the Department turned it into a national park. It had nothing to do with its beauty. The fact is that the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia visited the area and asked the people of Hamersley Iron what was so great about this national park. He was told that the only thing great about it was the iron ore body they were standing on. I can tell the Senate that it is certainly not an area of great beauty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That area was also cleared by a tribal elder by the name of Jerrywing whom I had the pleasure to meet. Jerrywing is now aged 92. The day we were there he was on site with three jeep loads of Aborigines who were having another look at the site and watching the archaeologists who were trying to find more sites. It is quite a funny story. Here were those 30-odd Aborigines all sitting around the jeeps and the only person working was the archaeologist who was climbing up and down a gorge. Jerrywing, this 92-year old, was actually helping a little. In 1977 the site was cleared as having nothing to do with the Aboriginal culture. Jerrywing said, `You can have them' and other colleagues were with me as witnesses to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hamersley Iron employs 3,000 people in Western Australia. It has constructed three Pilbara towns--Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Port Dampier--and has also initiated the regional town of Karratha. All told about 22,000 people live in the area and rely on this project. It will take two years to build Marandoo. As I said before, 1994 is very important because it must be done on time or the whole concept dies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will give the Senate some brief details on the economic impact of Hamersley Iron, which is the company seeking permission to proceed with this project. I will outline what that crowd has done since the inception of this project. In 1990 alone, Hamersley has earned $1.2 billion in export income; paid $190m in taxes--Federal, State and local; paid $64m in royalties to the Western Australian Government; contributed $262m to CRA; directly employed over 3,000 people; indirectly employed a further 12,000; and exported 41 million tonnes of iron ore. I heard Senator Coulter say today that iron ore mines do not create very much employment. I wish that he and the other Democrats would go up there and take a look for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  I just want to expand on the Yakabindie project at Wiluna, which is another opportunity going begging. Yakabindie is a nickel project that is proposed by Dominion Mining. It requires capital investment of $350m and annual revenue of $250m. It is the subject of continual Aboriginal heritage matters, even though it was cleared by three reports as way back as 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>  The hold-up here is caused by two people. The first person is Robert Bropho, an Aborigine who lives in the city and who has never had any connection with that area. Even the local Aborigines have told him that he has had no connection with them. In fact, he was born in Queensland, whereas Yakabindie is 800 kilometres from Perth. That is the situation. The other person is a `white Aborigine' called Peter Muir, who calls himself an Aborigine, who lives in a two storey mansion in Leonora and has made a fortune in pegging and selling off mineral leases. But he then stirs up trouble to prevent mining companies from getting a fair return on their investment. That is the hold-up in Yakabindie, Mr Deputy President, and let no-one tell you anything different.  That is the story of opportunities which have gone begging in WA. Later on my colleagues will no doubt speak about other projects and other mineral deposits around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major problems in Western Australia are Aboriginal related problems. However, there are other factors outside of the Aboriginal heritage problems and the environmental green problems which tend to hold projects up. Briefly, these factors include Federal departments being slow; State departments being slow; even local government departments being slow to a certain extent, although I doubt that because local government usually gets to work on the projects much more quickly; and, of course, the Foreign Investment Review Board and other such bodies. Even the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence, said on 18 June last--and it is not very often that I quote her:</PARA>
<PARA>It was totally unacceptable to the Government that important new projects representing hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs were being delayed, sometimes by vexatious claims made on behalf of Aboriginal groups. </PARA>
<PARA>She did not say `by Aboriginal groups' but `on behalf of Aboriginal groups'. I normally do not read too many articles written by Labor members of either House but I did read Senator Walsh's Cassandra article in the Australian last week about where opportunities have been lost. I certainly thank him for being the only one on the Government side in either place who is game to tell his mates and his colleagues where Australia is selling out and going backwards because of that reason. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a fundamental principle that minerals belong to all Australians--that was built into legislation so far back it does not matter--and should be harvested for all Australians. The Australian Government is paying out some $2 billion a year to the Aboriginal people. It is time those people appreciated that and allowed industry to proceed and help pay some of the bill. There is no better way to help an Aborigine--for that matter, no better way to help anyone who is not employed--than to give that person a job. That is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a recent survey in Western Australia it was found that 90 per cent stood for the principle that no individual or group should have greater control over land use than other members of the community. In other words, the survey showed that those minerals are there for everyone. No-one should have greater control than anyone else. The Government has to stop sitting on its hands in this matter and get these projects going. If it is to jettison the radicals that it sopped to during the last election, the sooner the Minister does it the better. The future of Australia is greater than the whims of those self-righteous, self-indulgent, self-smug econocrats. I hope that the Democrats will support us later on this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In a recent address, Dr Hewson referred to the red tape, the green tape and the black tape that was tying up Australia. I think the comparisons that Dr Hewson drew on that occasion are very apt for consideration in the debate tonight. Senator Panizza's motion puts forward a number of very salient points. Firstly, it notes that the Government is considering--I emphasise that word--the creation of a special committee of Ministers to speed major projects. After eight years in office we have a Labor Government that is now coming forward thinking that it might need to do something about speeding up something.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Eight years in inactivity, as Senator Knowles said. Senator Button in Question Time today accepted the fact that the special committee of Ministers that was supposed to have been set up after the 12 March industry statement--six months or so ago--has not yet got itself into gear. He was not even able to acknowledge whether it had met. He said that there had been some activity around the fringes. The fringes of what, I would like to know. Probably the curtains in some boudoir somewhere, because it certainly has not carried through to anything meaningful in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Yesterday Senator Collins stood up in the Parliament and said that the North Australian Development Unit of the Department of Social Security had been taken out of that Department and seconded as a new and special vamped-up organisation to be put into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appears to be nothing more than an octopus, spreading out with great new tentacles into new areas--whether it is the environment, Aboriginal reconciliation or, now, a special unit to sustain Senator Collins as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  We hear that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is about to establish a branch office in Darwin. Why has that happened after eight years in Government in a re-organisation? It is because the Northern Territory Government for the last five years has established new and special relationships with its near-neighbour Asian countries and has been far more successful than has anything done by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Suddenly that Department thinks it has to catch up on the action and get involved. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second part of Senator Panizza's motion condemns the Government for the ineptitude which has allowed so many mineral projects around Australia to be either totally stopped or delayed and, in effect, has resulted in eights years of lost opportunities. Senator Panizza very aptly illustrated that particular argument. I will return to it soon with respect to other areas in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, Senator Panizza called on the Government to ensure that projects already cleared by mining and environmental authorities proceed immediately. How many of them are shelved? How many of them have been approved by the processes? The best example that we have had in recent times is, of course, Coronation Hill--a project in which this Federal Labor Government encouraged the mining development companies to spend some $14m on all of the stages of exploration and advance planning, following which at the last minute, it castrated the entire project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Prime Minister certainly gave them a letter of commitment as to where they were going. Today Senator Macdonald and I met with some executives of Mount Isa Mines Ltd who were in this building. Some very salient points came out in the course of that discussion. The executives told us that, of the current exploration activity of Mount Isa Mines, 45 per cent was now to take place offshore. Seventy per cent of the exploration activity of BHP is now to take place offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If we took a broad-brush approach to many other companies, we would find that 50 per cent of Australian-based mining and resource companies are now aiming their exploration activities offshore. Why? Because, essentially, there are three criteria by which those companies have to judge how they are going to carry out their activities. What are they looking for? They are looking for a stable government, for an economic climate and, of course--and probably I should have said this first--for mining prospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of these companies can establish that in Australia and its close waters there is mining prospectivity. It is only on the other two issues that all of these companies are now judging their involvement and their criteria and are having to move offshore.  That is, there is not a stable political environment or government in place that can give them the guarantees that they want, and there is not an economic climate in which any of these companies can operate with any confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to recent reports of major resource companies in Australia. The Comalco report was tabled on 22 February 1991. In the Chairman's statement to that report, Mr J. T. Ralph states:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the urgent need to devote more of Australia's resources to the tradeable goods sector, this remains difficult to achieve. Established and prospective exporters face continued constraints in the domestic operating environment, particularly those relating to an inflexible labour market, poor productivity, excessive Government charges, inefficiently operated infrastructure and uncertain and cumbersome regulatory approval processes. </PARA>
<PARA>What a damning statement from Comalco. I turn to the CRA report of 19 March 1991. The Chairman, Mr Uhrig, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The present methods of gaining community approval for new projects tend to be slow, cumbersome and unpredictable. They vary from state to state and are subject to a growing level of federal involvement. For companies like CRA they can be a threat to much needed new investment. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to the 1991 exploration report by the Directors of Renison Goldfields Consolidated, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Group has previously reported that the discovery of new orebodies is becoming more difficult, particularly in Australia, due to the increasing importance given to alternative uses of land and to environmental considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>They are three very major and significant companies. Add to that the known factor relating to exploration activities where the major companies of Australia are now having to find their investments to protect their shareholders' interests, who are Australian citizens in the main. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a Government that is now preoccupied. Anyone who closely followed the discussions in the consideration of the estimates of DASETT and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would find that reams and reams of paper are now flowing with regard to the studies of ecologically sustainable units. Some 11 working parties are reporting to the Prime Minister's Department and it is doubtful whether, after almost a year of operation and millions of dollars in consultants' reports, they will have an agenda that can be presented to the November Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>  Anyone who carefully read the barometer of what is happening in that area would note that the Labor Government is succumbing to the radical green agenda and the radical political agenda. There will be no decisions in the November Premiers Conference because the Prime Minister will ensure that no decisions are taken and that it will be another ongoing talkfest so that he can attempt to bring it back, probably, to another special meeting next March or the routine May Premiers Conference next year. Then, of course, it may get bogged down in next year's Budget as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we go back to 25 February 1991 and look at the Industry Commission Report entitled Mining and Minerals Processing in Australia, we see some very interesting statements. Let us look at the area with which we are very familiar--the red tape that constantly ties up these matters. I quote from that report:</PARA>
<PARA>Lengthy delays in gaining approval for mining, particularly once exploration funds have been committed, represent a costly burden on the mining industry. Delays in gaining government approval arise for two main reasons. One is procrastination over whether mining or environmental interests should have access to land. The other is overlapping responsibilities between government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Many commentators attribute the decline in mining activity in Victoria to the regulatory process in that State. However, there is hope for a better system as the changes in the South Australian approval system illustrate. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope that we see a concentration in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report of the Industry Commission goes on to illustrate amply the dilemma that is facing not just mining companies but also so many other agencies in our community. I refer to the exploration budgets and how they are put together. For example, in referring to the BHP gold exploration budget of about $10m a year, I point out that about four years ago the company began allocating about $1m a year to Victoria but found that the regulatory system imposed a two and a half year wait before a company could drill a test hole. Four projects were drilled with results that were technically interesting, but the company declined to begin any new work because of the delays. I quote from a company officer:</PARA>
<PARA>The straw that broke the camel's back was a project where we wanted to test some Creswick tailing dumps. Everyone was in agreement, the landowner, local government and all the State departments. In November last year we planned to use Ballarat students during their Christmas vacation, but getting the exploration permits signed took us five months, and by that time the students were back at college. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for helping youth unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission report has also highlighted the need in so many other areas. The situation that is familiar to me in the Northern Territory is the area relating to Aborigines. Again let me quote from the Industry Commission report of 25 February 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>  Granting land rights to Aborigines may well have restricted exploration and mining in the Territory, relative to levels which would otherwise have occurred. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to conclude from this that, as a consequence, land and sub-surface resources are not being devoted to their socially optimal use. However, current arrangements for distributing royalties (strictly speaking royalty equivalents) from mining to Aborigines in the Territory reduce the incentives for any one group of traditional Aboriginal owners to agree to exploration/mining on their land. This situation represents an impediment to the efficient development of mining and mineral processing in the Territory. The efficiency objective would be more effectively served if the share of royalty equivalents received by traditional owners were to be increased. In the Commission's view, the share of royalty equivalents currently earmarked for the administration of Land Councils should be paid to the Aborigines on whose land mines are established. This would increase their share of royalty equivalents from 30 to 70 per cent and the Commission is confident that this would go a long way towards providing more appropriate incentives for traditional owners to make the `best' decisions from their own and the nation's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission can see no reason why the ability of Land Councils to fulfil their statutory obligations--such as identifying who the traditional owners of particular tracts of Aboriginal land are, and assisting in land claims--should depend on the level of royalty equivalents (which in turn reflect the level of royalties paid by mining companies in the Territory). Land Councils--as statutory bodies with functions and responsibilities conferred under Commonwealth legislation--should be funded from the Commonwealth Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen time and again those sorts of situations constantly arising. There are substantial costs and inefficient allocation of resources where the inevitable outcome of this uncoordinated, inconsistent and sometimes outdated confusion of regulation is so apparent. Time and again--whether it is the Green agenda of the current Labor Government, whether it is the objective of many radicals in the community who do not wish to participate in a forward-looking environment that creates jobs for our community--we really need to look at the detail. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier I mentioned Coronation Hill--a very sad saga in the decision making processes of this Parliament, and particularly of the Labor Government in this past year. The capital injections that would have stimulated the economy and flowed right throughout Australia are inescapable to any decent person who is reviewing that area. I refer to the hundreds of jobs that would have been provided on site and the effects that would have flowed to many Aboriginal families who want to see that project proceed. The environmental considerations and Aboriginal considerations have been addressed time and again. But no, for a political agenda, the Labor Government stood back, put on the brakes and changed things because it was courting the votes of marginal seats in Sydney and Melbourne where Labor believed that its seats were at stake. Therefore, Labor was not considering the national economic agenda or the development of remote and rural Australia, which are so very important. There are many projects that attach to this. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can also look at Jabiluka and Koongarra uranium projects that have been begging for development in the Northern Territory for 10 years or more. But the Federal Government has been jellybacked, a phrase used earlier today. Those developments have been held back because of market changes, and opportunities may well have been lost because of delays. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned earlier the bureaucratic delays that often arise from Aboriginal considerations. In the Northern Territory we are particularly constrained by the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which imposes heavy and detailed bureaucratic considerations. Let me illustrate that by saying that, since the introduction of that Act in 1976, there have been 472 applications for exploration licences in the Northern Territory. Of these, 104 have been withdrawn, refused or amalgamated prior to the appropriate consent of the Northern Territory Minister. Eight are still pending the Northern Territory Minister's consent. Therefore, 360 have been issued with consent to negotiate by the Northern Territory Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  Where are they today, statistically, relating to those 360 applications for exploration licences? Well, 22 relate to applications to lodge a proposal with the relevant Land Council; 76 have been withdrawn or refused subsequent to the Northern Territory Minister's consent; and 122 of them have been vetoed by the land councils. Furthermore, 108 of them--and this is going back to 1976--are currently being considered by the land councils. They are bogged down in the bureaucracy and bogged down in black tape. Six are pending a grant to be consented to by the Federal Minister, and 26 have been granted by the Northern Territory Government; I emphasise 26 out of 472. The statistical appraisal of the sort of obstruction that totally frustrates the exploration activities in that area is similar to what I described earlier. Because of the political and economic climate, we see a disastrous situation when we consider the proper national agenda of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Several years ago, when Senator Evans was the Minister responsible in the resources area, he agreed to make amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in order to facilitate certain changes that would help this process. The Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, who has since taken over that portfolio, made very positive statements following the recommendations of the Industry Commission last year. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened to the recommendations now?  They are bogged in a joint consideration by a special working party of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which Minister Griffiths administers, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Goodness only knows how long it will take for that working party to report to the Government--and then what sort of process will we see?  Again, the chicken-hearted, lack of decision resolve of this Labor Government will mean that consideration will be bogged down in so many of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I notice that Senator Panizza outlined earlier a number of projects in Western Australia. There are so many projects on the prospective or proposed lists. We need to ask why many of these projects are not proceeding and why they are bogged down. The proposed Stuart oil shale plant near Gladstone could possibly cost $100m. Alpha oil shale, Condor oil shale, Rundle oil shale and Yaamba oil shale are other proposed projects. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Northern Territory, prospectivity was firstly highlighted by the possible advantages of Coronation Hill and the El Sherana area. Why were those projects taken off the rails? At Jabiluka there is the largest low grade deposit of uranium in the world. At Koongarra there are reserves of 14,500 tonnes of uranium oxide. Why is that project bogged?  It is because of Commonwealth uranium policy. McArthur River has the world's largest reserves of zinc, lead and silver. At Mount Wells there are tin reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>  Various gold projects have not got off the ground. Where is the prospectivity in north Queensland? I have a list of at least six major goldmines that cannot proceed. There is copper in many areas. In base metals, there is a wide number of projects. North-west of Mount Isa there is the Century project run by CRA, where a vast infrastructure will be needed. In the last year we have seen that this is one of the projects that are very questionable because of the activities of government, radicals or other people trying to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many areas of mineral sands reserves, including Byfield, Shoalwater Bay and Rocky Point. The projects that the mining companies have identified go on and on for pages and pages but, either because of the economic climate or because of the bureaucratic constraints of a government that is preoccupied with a marginal seat strategy, they cannot be developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet we have a government that in the Budget this year put $100m on the table for bigger, brighter, more beautiful and better cities somewhere between Newcastle and Geelong. What a front! When we dig deeper into the Budget, what do we find? We find about $50m in this year's Budget--and probably the same for next year. Given that the Labor Party knows that it is out the back door at the next election, that $100m will not go to any major projects for bigger, brighter, more beautiful and better cities in Australia; it will be going to shoring up the marginal seats of the Labor Party in Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong, Melbourne and Geelong--a hundred million dollars worth of wasted taxpayers' money that should be used to facilitate jobs and major projects and programs, particularly in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and north Queensland. There dozens of projects are waiting to go and there are job opportunities for thousands of young Australians who want to live a different lifestyle, participate in the economy of this nation and not be statistics--part of the 30 per cent figure that we saw presented today of youth unemployment, youth being those people under 25 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can address environmental problems; we can address Aboriginal problems. They are just administrative issues. The challenge is to work with the companies that can develop and participate in international trade and get this country back to where it should be. I thoroughly commend Senator Panizza's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The attitude expressed in and the assumptions behind Senator Panizza's motion are about what one would expect from the coalition--that is, the attitude that resources are there simply to be exploited for profit, to be dug up and shipped away, and that all mining is good by definition. It seems that the coalition is particularly anxious to encourage this mining. It cannot wait to get its hands on anything that will bring profit to the exploiters. Why is that? Why is there this anxiety? Is the Opposition afraid of a realistic appraisal of the value of Australia's resources, something which is long overdue and which would bring an enlightened approach to the use of our resources? While that appraisal would not guarantee the wise use of our resources, it should assist in the careful appraisal of projects before they are eagerly undertaken. This eagerness would be discouraged by such an appraisal of the value of Australia's resources.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am very pleased about that, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is about time that profit seekers recognised that the very community which provides consumers of resources provides the very means by which profits are made. It follows, of course, that without the community there would be no profits to be made from resources or any undertaking. Therefore, the community deserves recognition for its role in this process. The community deserves to be richly compensated for that role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What do we have in the motion in front of us? There is no mention of the potential community benefit to be derived from this. We heard much made of it during the speeches, but within the motion there is no mention of any community benefit to be derived from rushing into the projects that the motion mentions. Perhaps that is because it is embarrassing to consider what little real community benefit we will derive from `dig it up, ship it out' developments. That can be development only in inverted commas, because digging it up and shipping it out cannot be development in a real sense. Such activities are notoriously capital intensive, with limited labour input. That means very few jobs per dollar spent. The dollars spent are of little value to Australia, with most mining equipment being built overseas and a considerable amount of the profit being expatriated. </PARA>
<PARA>  It might be a different matter if we saw in this motion some mention of the concept which seems to have unanimous support in this chamber and throughout Australia--that is, the concept of value adding or further processing of our resources before we send them over the horizon, selling them not as raw materials but rather as processed products. Such production would be of real benefit to Australians. Selling our raw materials in an unprocessed fashion is tantamount to selling Australian jobs overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can guess why there is such anxiety to stoke up this little job exporting exercise and so little enthusiasm for establishing any further processing in Australia. I can guess that the real reason is that the coalition proposes to tax value adding. That is its stated proposition. It wants to discourage value adding and further processing. Here we have an anxiety to get into a few mining projects, dig a bit of stuff up and flog it off overseas before the coalition's very own tax could apply. It wants to discourage further processing. It wants to tax value adding. Here we see a proposition to stoke up the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition's proposition is entirely inconsistent with any incentive to develop employment. Senator Panizza mentioned the export of 41 million tonnes of iron ore and the employment of some 3,000 people. I do not dispute those figures at all. What I suggest is that it is self-evident that this activity cannot be described as development. It is depleting, it is spending, it is squandering our resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us have a look at those figures which sounded quite big. The export of 41 million tonnes for 3,000 people employed equates to 13,500 tonnes for one person employed. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you are reminded, as I am, of the traditional song which captures the spirit of those people who realised the futility of digging up and shipping out. That old song--which I will not sing because I know Senator Macdonald would probably join in and then we would all have to leave--has the lines: `. . . sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt'. The refrain of that song continues: `I owe my soul to the company store'. In terms of the traditional song, 16 tonnes a day for 365 days a year works out at around 5,840 tonnes a year. I am not even impressed by the productivity of the mining industry which Senator Panizza quoted because it has only doubled what would be derived from the traditional method, the hand method, of mining. It is exploitative at the best and inefficient at the worst. </PARA>
<PARA>   I was very pleased to hear Senator Panizza say that minerals belong to all Australians and that they should be harvested for all Australians. The demonstrated history, of course, of the sorts of projects that Senator Panizza mentioned is that a few people prosper, other Australians receive a pittance when their minerals are spent.  If we valued these resources properly, we would not be so eager to dig them up and ship them out. We would see more propositions for integrated projects to process our materials and our resources here to create things of necessity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whatever we do, however huge the resource is, as soon as we have mined it, we have lessened it and we become the poorer for that. The nation then owns less. Surely it is obvious to all people that the only wise thing to do is ensure that we extract the maximum value from every resource we exploit. We can ensure that by discarding the concept of taxing the value added and by understanding the commonsense behind placing a realistic tax on resources. Such a tax would discourage the cavalier anxiety that Senator Panizza has to dig it up. Such a tax would also increase the value of waste material. Waste recovery, secondary resource utilisation--or recycling, to redefine either of those previous terms--could shed the wimpish image with which the big tough guys of the mining industry have liked to label recycling. They have tried to saddle it with that image. Let us face it, miners have a vested interest in resource wastage. The more we throw away, the more they can flog. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is time to stop this nonsense. It is time to treasure our resources and cynically evaluate each and every proposition to deplete them. In doing that, we should reject any proposition that we need to proceed immediately with the sort of undue haste that is suggested by Senator Panizza. </PARA>

He defines astrology as being `the art of drawing up the Democrats' economic policy'. That is what Senator Bell and the rest of his crew do when they talk about economics. They are pure stargazers. They have no idea of the realities of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  They often criticise us for having no policies. Quite rightly, this afternoon the Government was roundly criticised for its policies which have brought about the massive unemployment in Australia at the moment. We do have policies to correct that sort of thing. Dr Hewson will, very shortly, be announcing one of the most radical rearrangements of the Australian direction with our policies of what is needed to get Australia going. Some of those policies include giving the incentive to people to work, the incentive to Australians to produce and to export overseas. One of the ways we will be doing that, contrary to Senator Bell's understanding, is to take away taxes on inputs into anything that is to be exported. We will be encouraging exports and, in doing that, creating a better Australia and providing better jobs and better job prospects for the almost one million Australians who are currently out of work, principally as a result of the actions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>   On a day when the unemployment figure has passed the 10 per cent mark for the first time since 1983, and when almost one million of our fellow Australians are unemployed, the motion moved by Senator Panizza tonight could not have been more appropriate. Senator Panizza's motion notes that the Government is considering setting up a special committee of Ministers to speed major projects which is indicative of the disastrous situation Australia has reached in the development of mineral resource projects. The motion goes on to condemn the Government for its ineptitude in allowing so many mineral projects to be either totally stopped or delayed right around Australia and calls upon the Government to do something, to take control of the situation, by giving the immediate go ahead on projects right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  My colleague Senator Tambling has mentioned just some of the many projects that are waiting to go ahead and which, if they do go ahead, will provide enormous job opportunities for our fellow Australians. Yabulu, the nickel refinery project near Townsville where I come from, is a perfect example of a major project in jeopardy. That particular project employs about 1,000 people. But if this Government continues on its way and does nothing, as it is so prone to doing, then there will be one million plus one thousand people out of work because that project will have to close down unless the Government is prepared to take some leadership role in it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The nickel from Greenvale just in the hills beyond Yabulu runs out in about 18 months' time. Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd, the operators of the project, which I might say is 30 per cent owned by the Queensland Government, wanted to import nickel ore through Halifax Bay adjacent to the Yabulu refinery. That nickel ore was to come in from New Caledonia and Indonesia because we have run out of high grade ore in Australia. But the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the local Green movement vetoed that proposal and now the company is forced to waste months and money with an appeal against that decision in the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that apart from diverting the attention of that company to keeping the jobs and getting things going, it is also costing that company in total more than $1m in legal costs to argue about these sorts of things. This situation has the potential to put Queensland's second biggest export earner and the second largest nickel refinery in the world in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because of that, I was pleased to see that Senator Button had included Yabulu on the so-called secret list of projects he hopes to fast track, a list that is supposed to be secret but so secret that it has been widely circulated for publication in the press gallery. If something is not done soon, this company may have to downgrade its activities, consider lesser grade ore or close down completely, and none of those options is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wrote to Senator Button on 20 September asking him to clarify what he meant by including Yabulu in the fast track proposal. I asked him to outline what he intended to do to fast track the problems that were being experienced in that area. It might surprise honourable senators to hear that I have got no response. I have not even had so much as an acknowledgment. So much for putting these projects high on the priority list!</PARA>
<PARA>  Either Senator Button did not know what he was going to fast track or he is afraid to tell us. Perhaps he is proposing something that Senator Richardson's Green people might not like. He is very reticent about what he proposes for the projects that he wants to fast track. Maybe he is waiting until the Government's major projects group, which was established as part of the 12 March industry statement, meets for the first time before he tells me what is proposed. The group has not met for some seven months. As I understand today's press, the Government is now toying with yet another committee of senior Ministers to look at the same sorts of proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  All these committees on committees are typical of what is wrong with the Australian economy and the way the Government is attempting to manage it. The Government never does anything. It just sets up more committees, gets more bureaucrats involved and throws around a lot of ideas. Nothing happens. I look forward to seeing how the views of Mrs Kelly, on the one hand, and Senator Button and Mr Griffiths, on the other hand, will be resolved, particularly when it seems that their views are diametrically opposed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although I could not get a response from Senator Button, I was, fortuitously, able to read in today's Australian what Senator Button is proposing. I am grateful to the Australian for telling me what Senator Button would not tell me. According to the Australian, Senator Button says that the Queensland Government has sought Commonwealth funding for the project to use the Townsville Port Authority, that the matter has been the subject of correspondence between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Queensland Premier and that we are still waiting for a response. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not know yet whether the New Caledonian and Indonesian ore is to come in. We are still waiting while the Labor Premier and the Labor Prime Minister write back and forth to each other and see what they can do. Of course, Mrs Kelly has some views on it. She says that the ore cannot come in through Halifax Bay because of environmental problems. She talks about the appeal to the AAT. Then she says that maybe a Commonwealth decision needs to be made in relation to the upgrading of the port of Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>  What the Queensland Government is proposing is a pretty simple solution. It is saying, `Well, Dallhold Nickel or Queensland Nickel, the way for you to get your nickel ore is to bring it through the Townsville port, but we do not want you to use the existing facilities; we want you to spend $90m to build a new outer wharf at the Townsville port so you can bring the ore in there'. For the privilege of keeping the refinery going, keeping people in jobs, the companies have to build another wharf at a cost of $90m. That is the ridiculous proposal that the ALP is part of at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are numerous other projects where the Commonwealth should be doing more to get moving. The Queensland Metals Corporation's magnesium metal project at Gladstone is an example where a decision by the Government would prevent any further delay in the start to the project. The initial stages of this project await Cabinet consideration on a proposal from the company, and that is the last hurdle. </PARA>
<PARA>  This project could see the eventual development of a world standard magnesium metal plant which would have enormous benefits for Australia in the medium to long term. Currently we import all of our 10,000 tonnes of magnesium metal each year and the development of the appropriate technology by the Queensland Metals Corporation would almost certainly lead to a complete replacement of magnesium metal imports and create exports of up to 60,000 tonnes of magnesium metal each year, worth something like $220m. </PARA>
<PARA>  The market for magnesium metal is not huge at the moment, but, with the increasing importance of lighter metals in cars, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the potential for the use of magnesium in cars in the next 20 years is massive. Furthermore, value adding to these industries, particularly in die casting and alloy production, is almost certain to follow in central Queensland, especially with the presence of the aluminium industry in that central Queensland region around Gladstone and the supply of natural gas to that region. The starting gun for this project is in the Government's hands. I would encourage it not to hesitate in making a decision but to get on and do something about it. I read in the Australian today that Senator Button also seems to be urging for something to be done about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I do not know where he was 12 months ago. Obviously he has at last come to the conclusion that we must have jobs here in Australia. He sees these things, quite properly, as the way to get jobs and the way to get Australia going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Fortunately, Mrs Kelly's confidential response to Senator Button's confidential letter was also printed in the Australian. Mrs Kelly talks about a magnesium project, but she has the wrong project. She is talking about another one at Kunwarara, which is north of Rockhampton, not in the Gladstone area. I only mention that because recently I inspected that plant. It is a very fine plant that will do a lot for Australia's export industry. When showing me around, the project manager said that he had to get some 67 separate government approvals from State, Federal and local governments and authorities to get that plant operating. I am telling some secrets that I should not, but at the time I was talking to him he said that he got to 64 and gave up. He said that if they wanted to they could shut him down then. The plant was almost built then, and I am sure by now he has the rest of the approvals. </PARA>
<PARA>  I repeat that he had to get 67 separate approvals before getting a very fine export plant going. People ask what is wrong with Australia, why we cannot create jobs and why there are one million unemployed. Requiring 67 separate approvals is the sort of attitude that creates lack of confidence, lack of investment and the resulting lack of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The $600m Byfield mineral sands project, also near Gladstone, could also use some swift Federal government action. The company, RZ Mines, has put in a mining lease application to the Queensland Government, but it could use a coordinated approach between the Federal and State governments so that it could prepare an environmental impact statement which satisfied the requirements of both the State and Commonwealth rather than wasting time and money, as so often happens, in duplicating work on two separate environmental impact statements. </PARA>
<PARA>  This sort of rationalising of environmental regulation would be of great assistance to numerous projects and would not require much work on the part of the Commonwealth. The Byfield mineral sands project has faced continuing opposition from extreme radical sections of the environmental lobby who have not even waited to see the environmental impact study. The project was delayed for over a year by the Queensland Labor Government's coastal study, even though the obstacles to progress on the coastal study related to Aboriginal and environmental concerns on Cape York, whereas this project is in central Queensland. This project offers some 400 jobs in the region and there would be a natural flow-on effect. The Federal Government must do all within its power to see that the process is not unduly long. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are numerous similar examples of where the Federal Government could assist. The Shoalwater Bay sandmining proposal is one. Negotiations between the company and the Government have proceeded smoothly to date. However, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories must take care that when it receives the company's environmental management plan it is not hijacked by the attitude of the ACF, which has pledged to wipe out all sandmining in Australia, regardless of individual circumstances. I hope there will be no repeat of Coronation Hill, where the Government sponsored the ACF to prevent a project for its own shabby political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>  I read in the Australian in relation to the Shoalwater Bay project that some leases and the Commonwealth's part of the project are now the responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services. If we have to wait for Senator Bolkus and his Department to do anything about those matters, we can be assured that there will be no progress on that project for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA>  The list goes on. I am again indebted to the Australian for pointing out some other projects in my State of Queensland which are related to the mining industry. Senator Button has proposed that something be done about the Boyne Island power station, which the Queensland Government proposes to sell to Comalco. But the Queensland Government is haggling over the price and holding back an enormous project which could provide a lot of jobs. The Queensland Government has said to the Commonwealth, `Give us the extra money that you'll get because we are going to privatise this power plant. You will get tax revenue from the private company that runs it and we want a share of that tax take'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Button seems to be a little in favour of that proposal. Apparently a precedent has been set in the State Bank of Victoria case, so maybe it will proceed. But it needs to proceed now because the one million people are unemployed now. We have to do something about those jobs now, not in two or three years time. Mrs Kelly's confidential response to Senator Button in relation to this matter says--and the first two words worry me a bit:</PARA>
<PARA>To date, there has been no Commonwealth environmental involvement in the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that does not mean that at some future date there will be because, if that is the case, this project is also likely to founder. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am again indebted to the Australian for information about another Gladstone project. I might add in passing that Gladstone in central Queensland is a community which encourages development and industrial projects. In that city and in that community there is a culture of encouraging development and encouraging jobs. Unemployment in that area is lower than it is elsewhere because Gladstone has embarked upon this project to create jobs and to create wealth for Australia. The $750m special steel project is proposed for that area and it could be announced early in 1992, according to Senator Button's letter. I wonder whether that means that there will be an election in early 1992. Maybe Senator Button has learned from the old Bjelke-Petersen days that when an election is due one starts announcing such projects. But I do not mind if he wants to do that because it would be good for Australia and good for Gladstone. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to Senator Button, we are waiting for some Australian Industry Development Corporation assistance. I urge it to get on with making some decisions. Again, I am a fraction concerned by Mrs Kelly's confidential response to Senator Button's confidential letter. The Australian tells me that Mrs Kelly has said that, `the project has not been designated at the Commonwealth level as yet'. Again, I worry about the words `as yet' because maybe she will somehow be able to stick her nose into that, and if that happens we are in for a long wait. As I have said, the list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will mention in passing a couple of other instances where the Government could show some leadership and get some projects going which would create jobs and wealth for this country, and in the process create a better Australia. Although it does not involve mineral matters, I bring to the Senate's attention the space base proposal for north Queensland. With a bit of leadership and some infrastructure support and encouragement from Senator Button and this Government, that project could go ahead and supply the north of Australia with some 3,000 jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Parer is quite correct. They would be good jobs, jobs for the future, in an industry with a technology that would take Australia into the next century. But what happens? Again, the Government vacillates, dillydallies and shows no leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Then I refer to the Tully-Millstream hydro project, which could go ahead and create many jobs in north Queensland. If it were developed, it would also supply power that would ensure that industry in that area could continue to operate efficiently and effectively for many decades. But what has happened with Tully-Millstream? The Queensland Government instigated a report to end all reports--the ultimate report--to incorporate environmental matters, economic matters and every other matter. After a lot of money and a lot of time the report came out. It was in favour of the project, so one would think, `You beaut, away we go. Let's get some development going. Let's create some jobs and reduce the unemployment lines in north Queensland'. But what happens then? It has to go to the Commonwealth Government. It then dillydallies around. I will say in the Commonwealth's Government's favour that it claims to have been stalled on that project by the ALP Government in Queensland. But here we have two governments fiddling around and stalling each other, and sending it to another group of bureaucrats for another report. So the story goes. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Gladstone there is a sodium cyanide plant. It is a tremendous plant, built by ICI, which is replacing imports of that material. What does this Government do about it? It does not help. That plant, which was so expensively built and has produced an excellent product which we will be able to sell to the world, has been attacked by overseas interests dumping the product into Australia in competition with the local product. They will ruin that industry if something is not done about dumping. </PARA>
<PARA>  The money has been spent and an effort has been made to pass anti-dumping legislation but, because of the antiquated and almost irrelevant anti-dumping rules and procedures which this Government continues to promote and protect, that plant is in real danger of a difficult future. If this Government had any leadership it would do something and fix up the anti-dumping rules so that that plant could continue to compete, and compete fairly. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today it has been revealed that the Government's own industry Minister, Senator Button, has told the Prime Minister that he doubts that our tax system is internationally competitive. I do not know that that is such a profound statement, but it is profound coming from someone on the Government side. His so-called confidential letter, which I have quoted from at some length by kind favour of the Australian, is like all that seems to happen in the Government at the moment: it plays out its internal factional differences on the front pages of the newspapers via leaked documents. In that letter, Senator Button is asserting that the antiquated tax system is holding up development almost as much as environmental and Aboriginal concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Button also told the Prime Minister in this secret letter that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia is investing too little to sustain adequate growth and that unless manufacturing and mining output increase substantially, the country faces a prolonged current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, has similar concerns. This was pretty well illustrated in his speech to the Labor Party's annual talk-fest, which was held in Mount Isa recently. He said that people were sick of projects being tied up in the bureaucracy and the paralysis of analysis. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We need a philosophy of how projects should proceed rather than whether they should proceed. This is what integration of environmental and economic objectives was supposed to be about. </PARA>
<PARA>But, in yet another display of the complete disarray in which this Government now finds itself, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly--or at least some of her departmental mandarins--rejected out of hand the notion that environmental considerations were holding up resource projects. It is no surprise that the confidential letter and the confidential reply to the confidential letter have ended up emblazoned all over the front and middle pages of today's Australian. It is an absolute joke. </PARA>
<PARA>  I return to where I started by saying that we need look no further than the Yabulu nickel project to see that the Commonwealth environment hurdles are holding up that particularly major and important project. The Government has consistently failed to encourage investment in this country by streamlining the development procedures for major projects. It has been tinkering on the edges with all this rhetoric about fast-tracking committees and major project groups, and it deserves the condemnation of the Senate for its continuing failure to act in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today's unemployment figure has passed 10 per cent and a million of our fellow Australians are out of work. If this Government fails to act now, as Senator Panizza's motion calls upon it to do, it will further squander the future of ordinary Australians. I urge all honourable senators to support Senator Panizza's motion and to give Senator Button support to try to do something towards getting these projects on the way, so that we can create jobs for our fellow Australians who are currently languishing on the unemployment heap. </PARA>

<PARA>  I have to say that I part company with him in respect of one matter, in that a generous interpretation of his words could lead one to believe that he thinks Senator Button has a strong, long-lived view which has now simply surfaced in the mayhem of this Government. The truth of the matter is that this recession has been with us for two years; the economic indicators have been with us for 18 months; the misery index has been present and obvious to ordinary, decent Australians for a very long time; but it takes Senator Button to find a new reason for disagreeing with his colleagues and to be seen to be expressing a view which has been known to the rest of the community for the better part of a decade. </PARA>

He was well hidden behind the door, unlike Senator Collins, who understood the absurdity of the situation and was not simply prosecuting an argument for his Aboriginal constituents. </PARA>

Seven per cent of the Australian work force found a green notice in their pay packets last year. Every day this figure is increasing and compounding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When the situation gets into the political red, when the lights go on that say it is politically dangerous, that is when the Government changes its mind--not when it matters socially, not when it matters economically and not when it matters compassionately. When the barometer moves into the politically dangerous area, then we find a government of this colour that is prepared to dump its previously welcomed, squalid little radical minority groups. The truth of the matter is that this Government has always been subject to three colourful votes, as we all know--black or red or green, never true blue Australians. This Government has always been prepared to do a deal with the Aboriginal leaders. It has not cared about the overwhelming majority of Aboriginals; it has been concerned with doing a deal with the radical Aboriginal leaders. </PARA>
<PARA>  One project that it knocked off that Senator Collins would know all about was the Koongarra project. That project would have provided revenue of $256m in royalties to the Aboriginal community. The Government could not even treat that community decently. The ratbag lunatic left-wing fringe has held the Government to ransom while it has been paralysed for the past week over its health problems. It is not the ordinary, decent, caring Australian who has an understanding of and empathy with the environment, but the fringe lunatics who use the environment as an excuse for having absolutely no development, no growth, no improvement in wealth, no improvement in standard of living and no improvement in quality of life. The sadness is that whenever these minority groups hijack a government, those who are hurt first and those who are hurt most are the good decent blue-collar workers who are the traditional lifeblood of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason that those on the other side of the chamber are now panicking--and paralysis is moving into panic--is that they know their traditional base is being hurt most and being hurt first, and it is going to move away from them. If there were an election tomorrow, those opposite would be dead ducks in the water. Of course, we all know that, whenever the election is going to be, they will be dead ducks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As Senator Collins is locked in an internecine conflict with his colleagues, he has probably not been keeping up with the motion I am discussing. This debate is about the billions of dollars of resources that are locked up in Australia because of the myopic, blinkered, bigoted attitude of Senator Collins' Government and the attitude which Senator Collins, from time to time, with respect, has had the courage to stand up and disagree with. The three-mine policy in the Northern Territory is a very good example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am not going to argue whether it is $30 billion or $70 billion locked up in Kakadu. We can pick whichever we like. It is a substantial figure. It represents tens of thousands of jobs. It represents an improved standard of living for a lot of Australians. Why is it locked up?  Could somebody on the Government side of the chamber stand up and give me a cogent, coherent, intelligent explanation, which is logically compelling, as to why we should have two uranium mines in this country, plus one that produces copper and gold?  There is absolutely no explanation whatsoever. We only have that because, if I remember rightly, that was in the days of Don Dunstan in South Australia, and we had to get up Olympic Dam before the election; that is why we got it. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is not an economically rational Minister who seeks to justify that policy. Why do we have it?  We have it because prior to the last ALP conference, when this matter was likely to come to the surface, to bubble up as an issue, the Prime Minister was paralysed with fear and opposition and paranoia. He said, `I will diffuse this by selling out logic and rationale and ordinary decent Australians by saying that I will take it off the agenda so I do not have to deal with those ratbags from the Left and the few lunatics that belong to the Centre Left'. The tragedy is that that is the price that Australia pays for having this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am tempted to be deflected from this matter by saying that one cannot blame these minority groups for exerting their muscle. They have been able to do so simply because they have had a compliant and weak government. It is no good blaming the Aboriginal Legal Service that blows tens and thousands and millions of dollars a year of decent taxpayers' money up against the wall when the instruments it uses were created by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was looking back through the Hansard a few moments ago at the speech I gave on the Aboriginal heritage legislation. I am reminded that I quoted the Minister who said that the Bill had been prepared in response to requests from Aboriginal people and following consultation with them. What is absent from that comment?  There was no consultation with the mining community or with the wider community; just consultation with the Aboriginal community. Of course, the Government has given the Aboriginal community enormous muscle. The injustice of its compromise is perhaps best articulated by the penalties which apply.  Entry onto declared land is now constituted an offence. The penalties are up to five years gaol or a $50,000 fine for entry onto what might be perceived as an Aboriginal site. That is five years in the Johnny slammer. If a person desecrates a church of my faith, the penalty is $500. Is there any doubt as to why these groups have muscle when they can get legislation of this nature through this Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA>  In reality, nothing has changed philosophically or economically or socially in recent times that provides for a change in the judgments the Government is making in respect of these projects. The political climate has changed and this Government is in political trouble.

<PARA>  That comes, essentially, from the fact that one million people are unemployed. As has been said before, the only job that this Prime Minister worries about is the job that goes with a bed at the Lodge. He is not worried about a million workers. He is not worried about those white collar, 55-year-old, middle class, suburban accountants whose skill and qualifications are the knowledge that they have gained from the company for which they have worked for 20 years. He is not worried that if they are taken away from that environment that skill falls to zero, and that if they walk out of that building because they are retrenched they cannot get another position anywhere else because that knowledge and skill cannot be transferred and translated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister does not care about those people who might have a mortgage and three children at a private college, or even high school, and who are paying for the second car. The Prime Minister is not worried about the fact that they will never recover from the emotional and social scars, and that they will probably never get a job commensurate with that which they have been ignominiously dumped from because the boss can no longer afford, not them, but this Government. </PARA>

In mining and minerals processing, $1,220m is locked up, whether it be in Byfield minerals, Brockman rare earths, Clinton mineral sands, the rare earth plant at Pinjarra or the titanium oxide plant. That group accounts for lost foreign earnings of $500m.</PARA></TALK.START>

One has to think of the number of noughts to get the dimension of it. We talk about billions without understanding how much that is. My dear colleague Senator Macdonald talked about the Cape York space station. That investment is, what, $600m?  I ask Senator Button whether that is wrong. It has a foreign exchange earning of about $170m. Is that an unfair comment to make? Other projects are worth about $40m. That is about $8.2 billion--about $8,000,000,000. It is a lot of noughts. The total foreign earning loss would be $2,920m. I conclude by saying--</PARA>

It requires about $300m to develop it. Several hundred millions of dollars in royalties would have gone to the Aboriginal community.

They thought it was a whole bunch of nonsense, to be quite honest. Because of white advisers, because of minority groups, the leases for Coronation Hill were frozen and we had the inquiry by the Resource Assessment Commission. Ultimately, this Government, like the Nazis, has appropriated the mining leases and put them into Kakadu National Park. No compensation; no reward; no justification.

It has all the elements of what happened to the former Labor Government in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The mineral industry contributes over 50 per cent of the revenue that is obtained from Australia's exports. I would like Senator Bell to listen to this because he got up before and flippantly said, `They dig it up and ship it out'. If only it were so easy to find the darned stuff in the first place. I see Senator Collins nodding; he knows about this. Senator Bell says that we need more value added; everyone agrees with that. That is an idea I have been promoting since the days I was heavily involved in the resource industry. I pushed and pushed it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Every time a feasibility study was done--the position has not changed because of the economic conditions imposed upon us by this Government; in fact they have got worse--it was found to be uneconomic. Senator Bell might say that that occurs because people are seeking a profit. He is still living in the days when `profit' was a dirty word, not recognising the fact that decisions are and always will be made in shareholders' interests. If they are not, the management of a company which does not use that as a guide is not looking after the interests of its shareholders. If Senator Bell has a superannuation investment or he has a share in a company, that is what he would require the operators of that company to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I indicated, I was in the resource industry for many years. It is an area in which I am very proud to have been involved. Right from the word go, I was involved in the major developments in the Bowen Basin. Senator Bell asked, `What is the return to Australians?'. Just let me give the Senate a little example. During the period from 1968 to about 1983, in Queensland we built four major ports and six towns, all with underground power, sewerage, primary and secondary schools and all the other things which go with it. We provided water, power and telecommunications. We built railway lines and purchased the locomotives and rolling stock at not one cent's cost to the taxpayers of Australia. Having done all that, the railway lines and the rolling stock were then taken over by the Queensland Government, and a charge was made back which, in fact, represents a royalty. The claim is made--it has been made for many years and I think it is still the case--that the charge made was extortionate. I believe it was extortionate because all governments went through a phase of saying, `Let's jump on the band wagon'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let me tell Senator Sherry the background to this. A Labor government in Canberra, when it could not take over the industry and when it stopped projects, decided that it would impose a tax on exports, and that tax still exists. At that time it was $6 a tonne and it nearly put the industry in New South Wales out of business. The tax was subsequently amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I have said, I was involved in the early days. I can recall being bogged in four-wheel drive vehicles in dry dust in the Bowen Basin as we drove around areas that previously had been virtually untouched. I would presume that we would be prevented from doing that today because someone would decide that brigalow country should not be touched, notwithstanding the fact that the clearance of brigalow was essential for the development of the cattle industry in that part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  We built a mine in 1968 at Blackwater; in 1971 at Goonyella; in 1973 at Peak Downs; and in 1974 or 1975 at Saraji. The then Labor Government--the present one has all the same earmarks; we have different people but they are of the same tribe--decided that it would stop some additional projects. The reason the Government gave was that there was an oversupply. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Government--that same tribe--now saying about uranium?  The reason the Government will not move from its stupid three-mine uranium policy is that some clowns on the other side are saying that there is an oversupply. After the Whitlam Government was thrown out in 1975, the mines took off again. We had the development of Norwich Park, Oakey Creek, Newlands and Gregory. If the Labor Government had remained in power, there would be some $600m or $700m of coal not now being exported out of the Bowen Basin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to comment briefly on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters relating to the Aboriginal and Islander electoral information service. I particularly wish to comment on the minority report tabled by Senator Kemp and Mr Cobb. I note with some concern that the dissenting report suggests that the program was commenced due to a perception of low turnout and high informal voting amongst Aboriginal people. The minority report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is evidence that informal voting is not statistically different in Aboriginal communities than in the broader population. The Committee chose not to adequately consider this evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>That concerns me. I am also concerned that this program apparently involves some 13 officers and support staff and support facilities. The report does not seem to contain any details of funding for the program, but my guess is that the cost of that program would easily be $1m. I wonder whether it is necessary to have this Aboriginal and Islander electoral information service in existence. </PARA>
<PARA>  In raising that question, I refer to some of the Aboriginal and Islander booths in the seat of Leichhardt in the last two elections. When one sees these figures one would wonder why the Aboriginal and Islander people need any assistance, any education and any help on how the electoral laws and the electoral and voting system work. </PARA>
<PARA>  My experience with these communities is that they are very well listened--not read so much. They follow the ABC very closely, they listen to radio reports very closely and they watch television news. My impression has been that they are very articulate and very well aware when it comes to matters of public interest, matters of electoral interest and matters that affect their community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will cite some statistics, Mr Deputy President, which I am sure you will find interesting. On Coconut Island in 1987, there were 21 votes for the ALP, 37 votes for the Liberal-National Party and one informal vote. With one informal vote, one would not think that they need much tuition. Three years later, in the 1990 election, in the same booth, the majority that the Liberal-National Party had--37 votes to 21 votes--had changed and there were 70 votes for the ALP, only 13 for the Liberal-National Party and four informal votes. These people had had the benefit of the electoral information service in that time. There was one informal vote prior to the introduction of the service and four after it was introduced. The voting had turned around quite remarkably so that the ALP had about 90 per cent of the vote. You, Mr Deputy President, would be the first to agree that people voting like that probably do not need any extra assistance; that they are already voting fairly well. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to Darnley Island. In 1987, the ALP got 32 votes, the Liberal-National Party got 67 votes, and there were seven informal votes. Three years later, with the benefit of this program, that had also changed around, surprisingly. There were then 77 ALP votes and only 34 for the Liberal-National Party, but the informal votes had, I must confess, fallen from seven to three. That is still not a large amount. </PARA>
<PARA>  On Mabuiag Island in 1987, there were 78 votes for the ALP, only seven for the Liberal-National Party and five informal votes. In 1990 there were, would you believe, 92 votes for the ALP, only two for the Liberal-National Party and four informal votes. I wonder why these changes occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to Yam Island. In 1987, there were 29 votes for the ALP, 47 for the Liberal-National Party and only three informal votes. Three years later, with the benefit of this program there were, would you believe, 77 votes for the ALP, only 21 for the Liberal-National Party--that is a remarkable turnaround--and five informal votes. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will look quickly at Yorke Island. In 1987, there were 86 votes for the ALP, 13 for the Liberal-National Party and one informal vote. Three years later, there were 83 votes for the ALP, nine for the Liberal-National Party--it has still gone down--and five informal votes. </PARA>
<PARA>  There seems to be a very low informal vote. There seems to be a very astute and articulate expression of opinion by these people. It would seem that it is not necessary to educate these people in the way of voting because they already seem to be very well aware of it. That is also my experience. I believe that they fully understand the system, they know what they want to do, and I would not think that they need this assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  If $1m has been spent on this program--I have guessed that that is what it might be; I do not have any figures--I suggest that that $1m would be far better spent on 10 houses in those communities than on employing 13 or so public servants to run around trying to explain to them something that they already do very well. Can we not allocate those resources to something that would really benefit Aboriginal Island people, such as housing in those more remote communities, which give them a direct, real and lasting benefit?</PARA>

I have an obligation to do this as Chairman of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  An article that appeared in the Canberra Times dated 7 October 1991 was brought to my attention on Tuesday of this week at a meeting of the Committee here in the House. The article was headlined `Whitewash feared from Family Law Inquiry' by Michael Bachelard and was accompanied by a photograph of a Mr Ian Monk. The allegation of whitewash, together with a number of other allegations reported by the newspaper as having been made by Mr Monk, reflect on the integrity of the members of the Committee and on its independence. On behalf of all members of the Committee, which is bipartisan, I completely reject the allegations as having any substance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, Mr Monk has cast a slur on each member of the Committee. No member of the Committee objects to Mr Monk having the right to express his concerns freely on the matter into which the Committee is inquiring by making a submission to the inquiry. However, despite the agitation that the Committee has witnessed in respect of Mr Monk from regional New South Wales and metropolitan Sydney, Mr Monk has not felt it necessary to address a submission to the Committee on the wide terms of reference that the Parliament has given us. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is bemused that Mr Monk has consistently claimed credit for the establishment of the inquiry into the Family Law Act. Requests for such an inquiry have come from a number of sources, as members from both sides of the Parliament will attest. No individual has the right to claim to be responsible for the establishment of this or any other inquiry established by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is particularly concerned that the Canberra Times, a reputable newspaper, should publish offensive and defamatory allegations about the Committee and its members. This has been done without even speaking with me as Chairman or with any other member of the Committee, of which there are 10 in number, including myself. Those concerned have not even spoken to the very efficient secretariat that serves the Committee. This is inexcusable for a reputable newspaper such as the Canberra Times. </PARA>
<PARA>  The simple expedient of contacting any of the Committee members would have revealed to the Canberra Times the following information. The Committee, which was only established earlier this year, has so far received close to 1,000 submissions. The Committee, apart from concluding its consideration of the term of reference concerning the retiring age of judges, has barely commenced the investigatory stage of the inquiry and to date has held public hearings in Canberra and Sydney only. The Committee will not be in a position to formulate a view in relation to its other terms of reference until after an extensive and thorough examination of all the evidence presented to it by way of submission or the public hearings that we intend to hold. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee over the next six months will be holding public hearings in every capital city in Australia and in a number of regional centres. In a couple of weeks time we will be having a two-day public hearing in the city of Adelaide, and next month it will be Townsville's turn for one day and Brisbane's for two days. The Committee is developing a seminar or workshop program to facilitate further public consultation. The Committee has commenced and will continue an extensive process of inspections of, and discussions with, facilities and personnel connected with family law in Australia. The Committee will not be reporting to the Parliament until August next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also point to the inaccuracy of some of the reported statements in the Canberra Times in relation to the recommendations of the 1980 review of the Family Law Act. The majority recommendations in this report did not recommend the abolition of the Family Law Council or the Australian Institute of Family Studies. </PARA>
<PARA>  It appears from this article that Mr Monk has certain views on certain aspects of the Family Law Act. Many of those who have made submissions to the Committee would support some of the suggestions for reform attributed to Mr Monk, just as many do not. Recommendations on issues such as joint custody, an issue which has been raised by Mr Monk, can only be made after the Committee has examined the various viewpoints presented to it and should not be predetermined. The Committee is extremely careful not to predetermine any of the reference points that have been given to it prior to a full and detailed examination. It would seem that it would come as a surprise to Mr Monk to learn that some parent organisations do not support his views on this particular question. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is involved in a serious examination of the issues contained in its terms of reference. The inquiry will involve the most rigorous assessment of the Family Law Act yet undertaken. Neither the Committee nor individual members, other than on the question of the retiring age of judges on which the Committee has already reported to Parliament, have determined a view on any of the other issues with which it is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whereas the Canberra Times has reported on the personal views of one individual, the Committee is committed to an objective evaluation of all the issues that relate to its terms of reference. Mr Monk's assertion that the Committee has failed to see that the Family Court system has not succeeded is totally unfounded and, indeed, presumptuous. If such a conclusion is warranted, it will be made only after a proper assessment of the facts. The attack by Mr Monk on the Committee and its members, which the Canberra Times has uncritically reported, is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Monk has commented on the Committee's refusal to invite an American consultant on family law issues to Australia to give evidence. The Committee is of the opinion that sufficient evidence would be available in an Australian context without calling upon any number of possible experts from other countries. Indeed, the Committee has no intention of visiting other countries to see what happens in relation to family law there. Mr Monk has attacked some individual Committee colleagues without actually naming them. He is reported in the Canberra Times as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . several lawyers on the parliamentary committee and a lot of lawyers in Parliament are making it difficult to change the system. </PARA>
<PARA>As Chairman of the Committee, I refute in the strongest possible terms the assertion that Mr Monk is making here. There are a number of people on the Committee--and I am proud to serve with them--who have had legal training. I do not think any of them could now be described as lawyers. It would be more proper to describe them as parliamentarians who have legal training. It is unfortunate that Mr Monk chose to single out some individual Committee members. </PARA>
<PARA>  On previous occasions I have made the assertion that at times this chamber and the other place can be a coward's castle where individual honourable members and senators can make attacks on individuals who do not have the same rights as we do--that is, parliamentary privilege. I have restrained myself very strongly in speaking tonight and have not perhaps been as forthright in my criticism of Mr Monk as I would have liked to be. I do not want to abuse the privilege that I have available to me in this place as a serving senator in the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Monk has been in constant contact with a number of members of the Committee at various times and with the secretariat on a regular and frequent basis and yet, despite all his contact and his reported interest in the subject matter the Committee is inquiring into, he has not seen fit to address a submission to the Committee. I dare say that this will not be the last occasion on which the Committee or, indeed, the Parliament hears from Mr Monk.</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, on behalf of the Committee I have addressed a letter to the Canberra Times indicating our objections to the manner in which it published the comments by Mr Monk. I have expressed our view that it is unfortunate that it did not seek to consult us. I have also taken the opportunity to make contact with the individual reporter, Mr Michael Bachelard, to give him of a copy of the letter. I informed him that I would be speaking here tonight and I have indicated that he will be provided with a copy of the Senate debate after the pinks have been checked for accuracy. That is something that the Canberra Times, the individual reporter and Mr Monk have not sought to do for us. </PARA>

<TITLE>Taxation:  Self-Assessment</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1866" SPEAKER="Watson Sen J.O.W." NAMEID="VJ4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time to discuss the need for access to accountants' papers under self-assessment to be legally confidential. One of my major concerns since the introduction of self-assessment and other major changes within the Australian income tax system has been the protection of the taxpayers' rights. Tonight I refer to the fact that, under a system of self-assessment, a taxpayer's discussions with his tax agent are not formally recognised or enshrined in law as being confidential. This is in direct contrast to the situation of a taxpayer discussing his affairs with a solicitor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The law as it presently stands recognises that confidentiality exists between a solicitor and his client, but not necessarily between a tax agent and his client. In Australia at the moment we have over 27,000 registered tax agents, who prepare over 70 per cent of all non-company tax returns and generate 55 per cent of the income tax collected annually. In relation to company returns, the proportion is a lot higher. Therefore, the significance of the role played by registered tax agents in the efficient administration of the income tax system and of the support role they play can readily be seen. </PARA>
<PARA>  In order for self-assessment to operate satisfactorily, taxpayers need to be able to approach their tax advisers--primarily accountants who are registered tax agents--secure in the knowledge that they can fully disclose to those agents all of the circumstances involving income derivation, expenditures and other possible deduction entitlements. At the same time, the taxpayer needs to be able to obtain confidential advice from his agent which is protected from disclosure to the Australian Taxation Office in circumstances similar to those applying to a lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under full self-assessment, all taxpayers will be obliged to prepare returns based on the advice obtained from their tax agents on the basis of a full disclosure of their affairs to the agents. Even though only a small number of returns lodged would be subject to an audit in a particular year, taxpayers still need to be confident that the advice obtained will cover</PARA>
<PARA>all the advantages and disadvantages and that the arguments are protected from disclosure. Unless this is the case, a full and frank discussion cannot occur. Further, clients when contacting their agents intuitively act on the assumption that the communications with their accountants are confidential. So the relationship of trust and mutual respect is vital to a tax agent discharging his duty in the same way as in the relationship between a client and a solicitor. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not wish to condemn the Government completely because much has already been done. As a result of lobbying in November 1989 by various organisations representing accountants, the ATO has issued a set of accountants access guidelines. These guidelines, which continue in force, recognise that in normal business dealings taxpayers are able to consult their accountants on a confidential basis. Their basic reason for existence is to limit the exercise of the Commissioner's access powers under sections 263 and 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Unfettered use of the powers under section 263 would permit access by the Commissioner and his officers to all documents prepared in the course of an agent's work. However, let me say again that these are only guidelines. They do not have legal status. </PARA>
<PARA>  These accountants access guidelines were to be reviewed in November 1990, but in the initial discussions of the review the Australian Taxation Office has decided that confidentiality could not be extended should a taxpayer wish to exercise his or her rights of review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts. Confidentiality was assumed in 1989 to extend to the litigation process but the adoption of the stance of the Australian Taxation Office on the lack of confidentiality in the courts has called into question for a  time the workability of those guidelines announced in 1989.  However, the AustralianTaxation Office has now relented and has agreed that the access guidelines should apply subject to certain qualifications in the course of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA>  What I am concerned about is that all these guidelines have only ever been guidelines. There is nothing enshrined in the statute books as to the confidentiality of the process between the agent and his client. To ensure taxpayers' rights and to restore taxpayers' confidence in their agents in that relationship, the Government should consider enshrining in law the confidentiality of discussions between tax agents and clients. I seek the support of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

This is evidenced by the recent invitation from WHO for Australia to participate in an international review of implementation of the Code, on the tenth anniversary of its ratification, together with three other countries in the Western Pacific Region. The chief purpose of the review is to provide advice and experiences from countries where infants are primarily breastfed and infant health morbidity and mortality are low, to those countries where the WHO Code could be implemented more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>  The review should provide a useful analysis of government and non-government strategies used in Australia to promote breastfeeding and to implement the WHO Code.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) (a) is more important. The nutritional, immunological and other unique benefits which human milk confer to both mother and infant are well-recognised and the NHMRC and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services recommends exclusive breastfeeding as the optimal method for feeding infants for at least the first 4-6 months of life, where this is possible.</PARA>
