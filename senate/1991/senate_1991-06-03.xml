<PARA>. . . we are all in a position of service, responsibility and duty to the nation where there is a fundamental requirement for integrity, probity, the ordinary decencies of public life and honourable conduct.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate knows, Mr Keating is now a backbencher in the House of Representatives. As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, the Prime Minister has on numerous occasions made statements about appropriate standards of government and has adhered to them. The reason why the Australian people should look to this Government for leadership in the future is that it has a leader who has been immensely successful and will continue to be so. The reason for that is not only the policy superiority of this Government but the intellectual leadership which this Government has had over many years and will continue to have into the 1990s. The Opposition really should not today try to take too much comfort from a temporary discomfiture in the Government as a result of the speculation and so on which went on over the weekend prior to the ballot which took place for the leadership today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a great tendency amongst Opposition senators to count their chickens before they have hatched. They have done that before as they have watched the unemployment figures rise; they have got excited and started to count their chickens. They did that in 1990; they tried to count their chickens before they were hatched. Mr Greiner did it in New South Wales. Members of the Opposition have done it in almost every conceivable election in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA> As Mr Wal Murray said last week, the Liberals think they are God's gift to the political world. Opposition members may think that, but there are a lot of very important issues facing this country and many difficulties for this Government at the present time. Those issues will be dealt with. I would not get too excited about today's events in the light of the question which has been asked.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to the ministerial statement on defence policy delivered by Senator Robert Ray on 30 May. In that statement, Senator Ray referred to the outcome of the review of the guidelines on defence exports and noted that existing foreign policy criteria for considering applications for exports had been strengthened. Can the Minister provide more detail with regard to these new guidelines and their operation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to spell out a little more detail on this subject in response to Senator Childs's question. Prior to this year's review, the foreign policy component of the guidelines referred only to the non-export of relevant goods `in particular cases where specific foreign policy interests outweigh export benefits'. That kind of language was clearly only a very general criterion. Therefore, it was thought desirable to provide the relevant interdepartmental committee with more specific examples of those situations where foreign policy considerations needed to be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Four specific examples have been identified and are now part of the guidelines. They are as follows: first, where Australia's foreign policy and trade interests could be adversely affected by the reactions of third countries; secondly, where the proposed country of destination is involved in internal or external conflicts or there is a state of tension which indicates conflict is likely; thirdly, where exports could potentially contribute to destabilisation in the region concerned; and, fourthly, where the country is acquiring non-conventional weaponry in contravention of Australia's non-proliferation interests.</PARA>
<PARA> I should stress that these guidelines are just that; guidelines for the interdepartmental committee in its consideration prior to making recommendations to the Minister for Defence, whose responsibility for final decision making all this is. They are not intended to be precisely prescriptive and will obviously need to be taken into account and applied on a case by case basis. However, they do represent a clear and, I hope, unambiguous statement of the Government's concern to ensure that important strategic, external policy and human rights considerations are not prejudiced by the defence exports policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister seen reports that the Shepparton Preserving Co. Ltd (SPC) has decided to restore to its employees the conditions they had agreed to give up in order to help the company through its economic difficulties? Are these reports correct? If so, can the Minister advise the Senate whether this development vindicates the Government's reform of the system which was designed to encourage workplace level bargaining, with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission mediating between management and workers in the interests of fairness?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4074" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has happened at SPC has been interesting and important. The Opposition got a lot of comfort out of the problems at SPC earlier in the year. Dr Hewson even made a visit to Shepparton to try to capture some credit, as it were, for what had taken place at the SPC plant. What took place at the SPC plant in Shepparton was a result of negotiations between management and the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that when one looks back at all of that, one sees that the successful achievement of change and productivity gains had nothing to do with the Opposition's policies, despite its attempts to claim these events as its own. In the absence of any realistic industrial relations policy, I suppose it was inevitable that the Opposition would do that. But the productivity gains arranged and negotiated at SPC are the product of a section 115 agreement negotiated in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume is up to section 45d of the Trade Practices Act. These gains were negotiated under section 115 of the industrial relations legislation. If Opposition senators have any doubt about that, Mr Corboy, the Chief Executive and Chairman of SPC, said on 3 January:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The proposals the Commissioner has put forward cater for all the conditions the workers have put to us as far as the company is concerned. We have everything we asked for. I think it is a very practical solution and it demonstrates that the system has the flexibility to help companies like ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, Mr Corboy, as Chairman of SPC, spoke to the Prime Minister about this quite recently. In the course of that discussion they covered a range of issues. It was clearly the view of Mr Corboy that tapping the willingness of Australian employees to work was the key to improved productivity. That is, I must say, a distinct difference of emphasis from the Opposition's policies, which seem to believe that these issues can all be dealt with by waving a big stick in the industrial relations field. That is not so; Senator Zakharov understands that is not so and that is why she asked the question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister responsible at the Federal level for the multifunction polis (MFP), I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the report MFP-Adelaide, People, Technology and the Environment released one week ago and accompanied by press releases from both the Minister and the MFP management board. I would remind the Minister that the report says, inter alia, that South Australia's gross product in the first 20 years could be boosted by between $1.6 billion and $10.8 billion and the extra direct income to the State by between $320m and $2.1 billion. Both of these estimates range over a factor of seven between the lowest and the highest. The report then goes on to state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The development of the Gillman core site is commercially viable and can offer a rate of return of approximately 24.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>And I stress 24.3 per cent. How is it that with a sevenfold uncertainty in the main estimates the management team can be so certain that the rate of return will be approximately 24.3 per cent and does not stating such spurious accuracy indicate that the management team knows nothing and cares less about the presentation of accurate and reliable information? Does the Minister not agree that the management team has failed to come to grips with the community's concern over the MFP and has attempted yet again another wordy snow job on the public?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always known Senator Coulter's view about this issue because he formed his view before there was any material to consider. Let me just make a few points about it. Any figures or estimates in the management board report will be dependent on the rate of investment and the rate at which the MFP site and investment are developed. I can only make that by way of comment. But let me also say that, as far as the Government is concerned, we have to respond to the management board report. I am certainly not going to respond to that report on the basis of some selected figures taken out of it. We will respond to it as a whole in due course and then, in a month or two, Senator Coulter will be able to question me about the Government's response rather than words in the management board's report itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, I am not going to endorse Senator Coulter's view about the competence or integrity of the management board. I certainly will not do that. We look forward to dealing with the issues which are raised in that important report. When we do that we will make a response as a government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of a report by International Data Corporation that spending on information technology over the last 18 months has slowed as users question the value of what they are buying? What is the Government doing to encourage Australia's businesses to become better users of information technology?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4076" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important issue. Information technology has been a high growth industry in Australia, higher than in most of the rest of the Western world, if I can use that old-fashioned expression, but certainly in the Anglo-Saxon world, and I am fully aware of the report to which Senator Crowley refers. Many aspects of the information industry strategy adopted by the Government are directed at the business sector. For example, more than a third of $35m devoted to information research and development (IR&amp;) support will be directed into the areas of information and communications technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is because it is a very important enabling technology across all industries in Australia, not just the services sector or manufacturing but agricultural and mining industries as well. All sectors benefit from a healthy information industry, in terms of both its production and it users.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government's initiative on IR&amp; is targeted at major businesses, especially major finance and services companies, because their efficiency in terms of the use of information technology underpins the performance of the whole economy. These businesses have to make a strategic approach to the use of these technologies whether they are banking, insurance, transport or manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a body in Australia called the Information Industries Round Table, a private sector body on which some government instrumentalities, at both State and Federal levels, are represented. The Information Industries Round Table is chaired by Mr Ashley Goldsworthy, a businessman, and now an academic, with a long association with the use of the information technology industry in Australia. He also happens to fill one or two other minor positions in the country, but perhaps his most important role is as Chairman of that organisation. That body gives particular attention to the interests and concerns of users of information technology.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as research in the information industry is concerned, many of the nation's major companies have good ideas for new products or services which might form the basis for collaborative projects with top information technology research organisations in Australia, and they will be encouraged by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the information industry in this country is in the areas where it is most likely to grow-indeed, is growing very rapidly-that is, the provision of computer services of one kind or another, particularly systems integration. That industry in Australia is very strong and is deserving of support.</PARA>

<PARA> Australian robotics was selected as one area for such cooperation. The objectives of the program are to encourage development of these systems that can dispense with human work for difficult activities in harsh, demanding or dangerous environments. Many countries are involved including Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United States of America and the European Commission. Research activities of the program cover elemental technologies such as systems architecture, sensors and intelligence; and applications areas include agriculture, mining and tunnelling, space, civil engineering and construction, underwater operations and manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that Australian industry and research organisations have access to these latest developments in research overseas and the opportunity to participate in international collaboration projects. Membership of the program will achieve this, and I am pleased to say that already some international research and commercial cooperation have resulted from this program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne should not get excited; it leaves us still in government with a better record than the people on his side of the chamber had on a lot of this. The return to a merchandise surplus means that we are more than paying our way for imports over this period, and most of the current account deficit is now the result of debt repayments, which also appear to be stabilising. The current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product will be at least one per cent lower than for last year, 5.9 per cent on the latest estimates. A further indication of the trade turnaround can be found by looking not at the figures for one month but at the national accounts figure.

In the past 12 months this contribution of net exports has totalled a huge 3.7 per cent and has been responsible for keeping economic growth positive in the last two quarters.

I note that the Minister in his response said that the Government will meet its Budget forecast for the balance of payments outturn in 1990-91. Does he not agree that, given the collapse of the Australian economy since the Budget and its economic forecasts were framed, the balance of payments outturn for 1990-91 should be immensely better, or less bad, than the Government forecast at Budget time, but that that will not be the case?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not agree with that at all. Only part of the improved trade performance can be attributed directly to the recession. There has been very strong growth in non-rural exports, particularly in manufactured exports, which have increased by 17 per cent in the 10 months to this date. That excludes the exports of second-hand aircraft, which are sometimes poked into the figures. This improvement in manufactured exports continues the trend set well before the onset of the recession. In fact, real manufactured exports grew by an average of 10 per cent annually in the seven-year period to 1989-90. That has all taken place at a time when there has been some volatility in the Australian dollar, some uncertainty about international markets and, of course, a decline in our major primary industry export product-wool. So I do not agree with the conclusions in Senator Short's supplementary question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. As the Australian Government has, on several occasions since February 1990, said that it is willing to assist materially in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the devastated island of Bougainville, can the Foreign Minister state when Australia will actually live up to its promise? Does this emergency situation not warrant assistance such as that which Australia has recently given to the Kurds and to Bangladesh? Is it true that Australia has not responded to urgent requests from Papua New Guinea (PNG) Ministers Somare and Momis for emergency relief supplies for Bougainville, despite the Honiara declaration, which removes the last hurdle to sending urgently needed aid to stem the endless toll of human life on Bougainville, which is now agreed on all sides to be thousands of lives, and which continues to this day unabated?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4079" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vallentine is quite correct in her assertion that Australia has made it very clear that it is prepared to help in any practical way in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville when a political settlement is achieved. She is wrong in her claim that we have not responded to the humanitarian situation on the island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is this: immediately following the conclusion of the Honiara declaration in January this year, the Government publicly-and to the Papua New Guinea Government-said that it was prepared to assist with the re-establishment of telecommunications between Port Moresby and Bougainville and to facilitate contact between non-government organisations (NGOs) and the PNG Government. We also said that we were prepared to undertake a survey of the rehabilitation needs of the island.</PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that even before this, in November last year, contact between Australian NGOs and the PNG Government was facilitated by my own intervention in this matter and we have been actively pursuing and supporting that contact since then. In other respects, though, it remains the case that the Papua New Guinea Government has not yet taken up the specific offers that we have made about surveys of rehabilitation needs and resumption of telecommunications links.</PARA>
<PARA> We have subsequently funded visits to Port Moresby and Bougainville by Australian NGOs coordinated by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) to develop some proposals to assist in the rehabilitation of medical conditions on the island. We have also helped in the transporting of medical supplies through the use of the Royal Australian Air Force and we recently announced, in that respect, a contribution of $100,000 to the Red Cross Appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, with the Papua New Guinea Government having re-established its authority in Buka, we have confirmed our readiness to assist in restoring services there. Also, last week we were able to make available some funds-in part through the High Commissioner's direct aid program-for three portable sawmills which will provide employment as well as materials for the rebuilding of houses and schools. All that, of course, is in addition to the $275m worth of direct budgetary support which we give each year to the Papua New Guinea Government and some $322m worth in total of aid to that country, quite apart from the defence cooperation program.</PARA>
<PARA> We do remain prepared to respond to a request from the PNG Government to participate in the rehabilitation of the rest of the province once a settlement is reached. In the meantime, I am not aware of any urgent requests from Ministers Somare or Momis, to which I think Senator Vallentine referred, although we do continue to be in close contact with Papua New Guinea authorities and we keep them aware of the assistance we are prepared to offer as well as that which we are providing.</PARA>
<PARA> In due course, I will be happy to table the report of the ACFOA group when it is received. At this stage, we have only received a draft report on its first visit; we have yet to receive any formal report on its second visit. I think that covers the ground that Senator Vallentine asked me about. If she requires any further information, I will be happy to try to supply it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have previously commended Australia's participation in the international satellite based search and rescue system. Recently, New Zealand expressed interest in joining the network. On 23 May the AMSA Chief Executive Officer, Mr John Spencer, and the New Zealand Secretary of Transport signed an agreement which permits the linking of a local user terminal in Wellington to the Australian control centre in Canberra. This is the first time in the system that a terminal in one country will be operated by another. New Zealand is providing the receiving and linking equipment, and Australia is providing the controlling equipment and the watch keeping staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be advantages to Australia when the New Zealand terminal commences in December this year.

Those are three tiers of services that we have a commitment to enhancing in the interests of improving the lot of rural women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the information and counselling level, the Government has developed a number of programs to improve access to government services through the provision of greater access to information and counselling. For instance, the countrylink program provides access for rural people to information about Commonwealth Government services and programs through a number of mechanisms such as shopfront travelling, publications and the 008 countrylink answer line. As an indication of the Government's commitment, we have expanded our funding in this area by at least double over the period from 1989-90 to 1990-91; that is, from $400,000 in the first year to $900,000 in the second.</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned to ensure that counselling services are also available. The rural counselling grants program, which assists rural community groups to employ counsellors to provide financial and other advice to farm families, is also of assistance to women.

<PARA> Senator Foreman also asked about training programs. Rural women have benefited from the jobs, education and training program, as well as the innovative rural education and training program.

<PARA> Senator Foreman also asked about government services. In that respect we must mention the enhancement of opportunities under child-care, the number of child-care places and the extended fee relief provisions. Those programs will enable rural women to take advantage of educational and training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot complete this question without mentioning a number of health related areas. The program for early detection of breast cancer as well as the rural health support education and training program for the development of training initiatives for rural doctors and other health workers in rural areas are obviously important in this respect. As an indication of the Government's commitment, I point out that $1m in 1990-91 and $5m in each subsequent year have been allocated for this program.</PARA>
<PARA> I could go on to the Government's commitment in the area of domestic violence education programs, which have had moneys allocated to them this financial year as well as the provision of assistance through rural access programs. The latter program has been allocated $1 1/2m for each of the next three years, which is not a waste of time or money. For its part, the Government's plan is to help rural communities and groups affected by the current downturn in farm incomes. Of that $1 1/2m, at least $500,000 will be reserved each year for rural women's projects-an increase of $300,000 per annum on existing programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 May, Senator Coulter asked a question relating to motor vehicle emissions, prompted by a BMW advertisement, and a supplementary question concerning the car plan. I undertook to provide a detailed response as soon as possible. That information has been provided by Mrs Kelly and I can now provide it. It is, however, a six-page answer and I would seek leave to table the document and have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Before considering the detail of Senator Coulter's question some comments should be made regarding the nature of the BMW advertising feature that prompted it.</PARA>
<PARA> BMWs are impressive in terms of the low level of their emissions from their engines, as are the products of several other car firms. The existence of such vehicles indicates what can be done and counters the claim sometimes heard that environmentally protective standards and controls are too expensive to meet. In fact being able to meet the most stringent standards applicable anywhere in the world can give companies enormous sales advantages, as well as benefiting the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it should be noted that not even BMW claims it can meet standards 20-30 times as stringent as Australian ones, as Senator Coulter suggests. The BMW advertisement actually states `in general terms BMW engines improve on the lax Australian Standards by between 10 and 20 times'.</PARA>
<PARA> The simplest interpretation to put on this claim is that it means the emissions of particular pollutants is at one tenth to one twentieth, in grams per kilometre terms, than is required by the Australian standards. There is no reason to doubt the claim. It would ensure that BMW meets the latest 1990 USA Clean Air Act amendment motor vehicle emission requirements, essential for a company with the USA as a major market.</PARA>
<PARA> This being the case-and turning to the detailed response-the answer to the fourth part of Senator Coulter's question must be that the Government does not consider the advertisement to be misleading in a legal sense and will not be taking action on it.</PARA>
<PARA> While BMW should be applauded for producing vehicles with such low emissions, the advertising feature that Senator Coulter has drawn attention to is somewhat overblown in its assertions regarding Australia's environmental laxity for reasons that will become apparent in the answer to the first part of the question regarding emission standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The first part of Senator Coulter's question asked how many countries have standards more stringent than Australia. The first point to note is that in some respects Australian vehicles are as low polluting as any in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> New petrol driven vehicles in Australia have had to run on unleaded fuel since 1986, cutting lead emissions from such vehicles to minimal levels. The European Community first regulated for unleaded petrol in 1989 and this has yet to be adopted by all countries in the EC. Furthermore the amount of lead permitted in Australian unleaded petrol is 0.013 grams per litre. Only one country in the world, Japan, has unleaded fuel with a lower lead content.</PARA>
<PARA> Motor vehicles release pollutants to the atmosphere from the exhaust system but also, in the case of hydrocarbons, from the evaporation of fuel from various parts of the fuel system and, at least when the vehicle is new, from losses by evaporation from sealants and plastic materials. Australia is one of four countries in the world that sets standards for evaporative hydrocarbon emissions from vehicles. The others are Sweden, Norway, Canada and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore apparently in the area of vehicle exhaust emissions that BMW bases its claims of easily exceeding the requirements of Australian emission standards, and this is the area the rest of the response will concentrate on.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult to give a precise figure for the number of countries which have standards more stringent than Australia's. There is no internationally accepted standard for motor vehicle emissions and it is difficult to compare figures because of the different test cycles and methods of expression used, nor is there a simple way of converting test results into equivalent values.</PARA>
<PARA> Canada, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia use variations of the USA Federal Test Procedure, other European countries use the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE Geneva) test cycle, while Japan has its own unique tests. Furthermore the last two years or so has seen many changes and the literature is not always up to date. In the case of the European Community (EC) and ECE regulations it is not always readily apparent which member states have adopted recommendations in full or in part.</PARA>
<PARA> The picture prior to 1989 was clearer. Australia was then among the world leaders in vehicle exhaust emission control. From the figures available it appears that five countries-USA, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Norway-had more stringent emission standards than Australia. Since then there have been significant tightening of emission standards in some countries. The latest USA regulations following the Clean Air Act amendments in 1990 will further increase the stringency of their emission standards from 1994 on. Sweden, Norway and Canada often adopt the US standards and are likely to do so in this case, though the exact timing is not known.</PARA>
<PARA> New exhaust emission limits more stringent than Australia's were adopted by the EC in 1989 and these are to become compulsory throughout the Community. Under the latest EC regulations the level of evaporative hydrocarbon emissions remains unregulated and the lead content of the unleaded fuel-and hence lead levels in exhaust emissions-remains higher than the Australian standard. The attached table summarises the position.</PARA>

<PARA>0.63</PARA>
<PARA>* Emission standards vary with engine capacity</PARA>
<PARA># Engines 2000cc capacity and above (levels less stringent for smaller engines)</PARA>
<PARA> In summary the tightening of EC regulations would suggest that a total of in the order of 16 countries now have, or will have in the near future, vehicle exhaust emission standards more stringent than Australia's.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator Coulter's question asked that if it is possible to meet standards 20 to 30 times more stringent to those now applying in Australia, why has the Government not mandated tighter controls.</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly possible to meet emission standards more stringent than current Australian vehicle emission standards, though 30 times more stringent is exceedingly optimistic. Ten or even in some cases 20 times as stringent is possible. In fact many of the new vehicles sold in Australia today have low emission levels, often considerably less than half of the maximum levels specified in ADR 37, partly because many manufacturers are standardising engines and components to meet US emission requirements. Consequently the actual tail pipe emissions in Australia of the new vehicle fleet, both locally produced and imported, and certainly not just BMWs, are considerably lower than specified in ADR 37.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not yet mandated for tighter controls because the range of possible options are still under consideration. Emissions from vehicles are controlled through the Australian Design Rule process. Commonwealth, State and Territory transport and environment officials are involved in developing new ADRs, under the auspices of two Ministerial Councils, the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council. Australian Design Rules are called up as Regulations to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989 which is administered by the Department of Transport and Communications.</PARA>
<PARA> The latest developments in vehicle exhaust emission standards in Europe and especially the USA are being examined by the bodies named above with a view to the modification of existing ADRs and/or the promulgation of new ones.</PARA>
<PARA> To justify the introduction of more stringent standards the Government would need to be satisfied that the resultant improvement in air quality is such as to warrant the changes and manufacturers would need to be given sufficient lead time to adopt the new requirements with minimum cost.</PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the question asked by Senator Coulter concerned environmental impact as an element in the car plan.</PARA>
<PARA> The Passenger Motor Vehicle Assistance Arrangements were formulated with a view to increasing the industry's efficiency so that it could compete with imports at lower levels of Government assistance and provide Australian consumers with better quality cars at more affordable prices.</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent formulation of the Motor Vehicle Assistance Arrangements is that given in the industry statement Building a Competitive Australia 12 March 1991. Environmental issues are not directly addressed in the arrangements. The Motor Vehicle Assistance Arrangements build on the recommendations of the Industry Commission inquiry into the automotive industry tabled earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission Act 1989 obliges the Industry Commission to report on the environmental implications of its recommendations. The specific terms of reference for the 1990 Industry Commission inquiry into the automotive industry did not include consideration of the environmental impacts of the industry. Following the requirements of the Industry Commission Act a very short discussion of some environmental aspects was included.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories input to the inquiry into the automotive industry pointed out the importance of environment matters and how these might be tackled in terms of the Industry Commission terms of reference, for example by using differential tariffs to encourage less polluting vehicles and other ways in which financial measures could be used to encourage the development of more `environmentally friendly' vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> These arguments were not taken up in any explicit way in the resulting Industry Commission report, although it could perhaps be argued that an implicit assumption of the report and of the Motor Vehicle Assistance Arrangements is that modern cars will have to be cleaner and safer as a matter of course.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter's supplementary question concerned the role of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in setting environmental standards with respect to the car plan.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is involved in the setting of vehicle emission standards through the Australian Design Rule process already described. The Department provided a submission on these issues to the Industry Commission and provided advice to Ministers when the decisions on the Motor Vehicle Assistance Arrangements were being taken. The Government is conscious of the need to pursue the question of reducing pollution generally in respect of motor vehicles. This is one of the issues for the Ecologically Sustainable Development working group on Transport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Women's refuges are funded under the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) which is a joint Commonwealth/State program. SAAP is administered on a day-to-day basis by the State Governments while the Commonwealth is involved in joint priority setting exercises, joint approval or revoking the approval of projects and other policy aspects aimed at improving program efficiency and service quality. However, as States have the responsibility for administering the program, it is their responsibility to investigate any allegations of misconduct in any service, including women's refuges.</PARA>
<PARA> The press article in The Australian to which the honourable senator refers discusses the under-reporting in our community of child abuse by mothers. The article does not say that child abuse by women is any higher in a women's refuge than in the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA> Should any cases of child abuse, or the abuse of any SAAP client, come to the attention of the Department of Community Services and Health, officers would be most vigilant in ensuring that the State Government instigated any such investigations. As Minister responsible for SAAP, I would be keen to ensure that natural justice prevailed and that should any improper behaviour or abuse be detected in any refuge (including a women's refuge), then I would trust that justice would prevail through our legal system in the same way that it would for anyone in the community. Should it be found that any practices of abuse also reflected the attitude of the service, or were condoned by that service, I recommend to my State counterpart that the approval for that service be transferred to a more appropriate body to ensure that a service for women in crisis continued to be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the officers of my department to once again raise this issue with their State counterparts to reinforce the need to regularly review services and to follow-up any complaints of infringements of rights of SAAP clients.</PARA>

<PARA>I am advised that the Family Court has no direct statistics on the incidence of allegations of child sexual abuse in proceedings before the Court which involve children.</PARA>
<PARA>However between 1 April and 30 June 1987 a nationwide survey was conducted by the counselling services of all registries of the Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia. The survey included all new cases where an allegation was raised. Counsellors recorded cases not previously seen in court counselling on where, if previous contact existed, there had been no allegation during counselling interviews.</PARA>
<PARA>The survey showed that allegations of abuse were made on average in 1.6% of all cases opened by the counselling services during the relevant period. Although accurate figures on the number of cases opened during that period is not available the figure is approximately 6100. In most cases the allegations were made against the father and in circumstances where the custodial mother was opposing access orders sought by the separated father.</PARA>
<PARA>It must be emphasised that the figure of 1.6% relates only to cases opened by the counselling services and not all cases involving children before the Court. In some cases allegations of child sexual abuse are not made to counsellors but are made in Order 24 conferences before Registrars and even first raised in defended hearings before Judges.</PARA>

<PARA> We took advice from a number of sources.

The matter was referred to an advisory group of senators and members for consideration. That group also recommended the adoption of a no smoking policy for Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> Our decision, therefore, was based on the common law duties of employers towards their employees, the provision of the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 and the provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.

<PARA>SMOKING IN PARLIAMENT HOUSE</PARA>
<PARA>In your minute of 30 April you have sought further advice for the Presiding Officers on their legal position relating to tolerance of smoking in the bars and corridors.</PARA>
<PARA>This advice has been developed following consultation with the Department's Legal and Occupational Health and Safety Advisors.</PARA>
<PARA>The legal responsibility of the Presiding Officers in respect of occupants of and visitors to Parliament House is based on the common law duties of employers towards their employees, the provisions of the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 (s.6) (see attached) and the provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, a failure to limit employee exposure to smoke could be a breach of an employer's duty to ``take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employer's employees'' (sub section 16 (1) (attached) of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991).</PARA>
<PARA>Smoking in bars</PARA>
<PARA>There are two groups of people who may be affected by smoking in bars-clients and staff.</PARA>
<PARA>The risks to staff have been discussed in previous submissions (see Minute attached).</PARA>
<PARA>Clients (or visitors) under the OH&amp; legislation are also owed a duty in that when at, or near, a workplace under the control of the employer they are not to be exposed to risk to their health or safety (s.17).</PARA>
<PARA>There are two factors which would probably limit the effectiveness of an action by a client or visitor. Firstly, there is no compulsion for people (other than employees) to enter the bar areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The second factor is that the claimant would have to establish that the conditions in a Parliament House bar caused the injury. It is hard to envisage that casual users of the building could succeed with a claim. In addition, if that person were entering a number of similar environments, with similar frequency, it would be difficult for them to point to one particular location as being the cause of their injury.</PARA>
<PARA>Corridors</PARA>
<PARA>For smoking in corridors the factors outlined above also apply. Smoke generated in corridors would be subject to a greater dilution rate than that generated in a bar. This smoke, however, has the potential to infiltrate into more workplaces and cause exposure to a greater number of people. The `voluntary' entry aspects of a defence cannot apply in these circumstances. In some cases a corridor may constitute an individual's workplace. These employees, in being restricted to a workplace, generally have a longer term exposure with a consequential increased risk of injury or disease.</PARA>
<PARA>There should be no impact on members of the public as smoking is not permitted in areas accessed by this group. For `official' visitors the exposure would be limited and again that person would have to establish a causal relationship with the smoke inhaled at Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>Tolerance of smoking in the bars and in the corridors makes no difference to the Presiding Officers' legal position. The Commonwealth and the Presiding Officers may still be liable although the risks of a successful court action by occupants or visitors to Parliament House are minimal. With regard to bar staff where the risk is higher because of their higher exposure to cigarette smoke the Department is continuing to monitor any changes to industry standards.</PARA>

<PARA>1 SMOKING IN PARLIAMENT HOUSE</PARA>
<PARA>2 FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA-AUST. FEDERATION OF CONSUMER ORGANISATIONS v TOBACCO INSTITUTE OF AUSTRALIA, 7 FEBRUARY 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The impact of the above decision has been considered in relation to Parliament House and outlined below are some general comments and responses specific to the information you requested in your Minute of 11 February 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA>In a recent decision of the Federal Court of Australia Morling J found that the Tobacco Institute of Australia had contravened the Trade Practices Act 1974 by publishing newspaper advertisements which misleadingly stated there was ``little evidence and nothing which proves scientifically that cigarette smoke causes disease in non-smokers''.</PARA>
<PARA>In the decision Morling J said that there is ``more than a little evidence, and indeed scientific evidence'' that cigarette smoke caused diseases such as lung cancer and respiratory problems, and caused some people to experience asthma attacks.</PARA>
<PARA>The decision is significant because it is one of the few occasions world wide that a link between passive smoking and disease has been established in a court of law.</PARA>
<PARA>The decision highlights a duty of care to non-smokers which an employer would owe to an employee in respect of the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA>An employer would only be negligent if it has breached the duty of care. The duty will only be breached if the employer has failed to take reasonable steps in all the circumstances to safeguard employees from risks.</PARA>
<PARA>* Effect of the decision</PARA>
<PARA>For the management of Joint House Department the decision will be of limited effect as you have recently issued an instruction to provide a smoke-free work environment. This will protect most employees except PCS and Functions staff where their workplace may be areas where smoking is permitted. (This latter aspect is further discussed in the Agenda Paper for the Presiding Officers' Advisory Group-Smoking in Parliament House).</PARA>
<PARA>The Presiding Officers pursuant to s. 6 of the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 have a responsibility to provide for the health and safety of persons legitimately within the precincts. (This issue is discussed in another Agenda Paper for the Presiding Officers' Advisory Group-Parliamentary Departments' Interim Occupational Health and Safety Plan and associated submissions).</PARA>
<PARA>* Potential risks</PARA>
<PARA>Morling J held inter alia that the overwhelming preponderance of scientific evidence is that passive smoking is dangerous to health. The context in which this finding was made can be used to restrict its ambit.</PARA>
<PARA>In any subsequent actions plaintiffs will still have to prove that in the circumstances of their cases a causal relationship exists between passive smoking and their injuries.</PARA>
<PARA>Within Joint House Department PCS and Functions staff could be more able to prove such a causal relationship than other staff due to their greater exposure to the hazard. It is unlikely for the Department to be found to be in breach of its duty in any other areas of the Departments activities as long as the smoke-free work environment policy is enforced.</PARA>
<PARA>The Presiding Officers responsibilities are noted previously and in that context the comments made above directly relate to them as the employer and additionally in controlling and managing the Parliamentary Precincts.</PARA>
<PARA>The onus now appears to fall on employers and managers of facilities to take a more positive role in protecting non-smokers. A strategy to implement this role in Parliament House is outlined in the Advisory Group Agenda Paper Smoking in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA>* Presiding Officers' Advisory Group Agenda Papers</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday last, 30 May 1991, I made a statement in response to a request by Senator Lewis on 29 May that I consider certain remarks made by Senator Cook in answer to a question. While Senator Cook was answering the question, Senator Knowles was required to withdraw an offensive remark. Senator Lewis suggested to me that Senator Cook's remarks may also have been out of order. In my earlier statement I indicated that Senator Cook's remarks were not out of order. I took Senator Lewis's point to be that Senator Cook misinterpreted the views of Senator Knowles and I indicated that that was not a matter of order but a matter for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to Senator Lewis's further request, I have again closely examined Senator Cook's remarks. Senator Lewis suggested that those remarks may have been contrary to standing order 193 (3) in that they contained a personal reflection on a senator. I have again concluded that there was nothing disorderly in Senator Cook's remarks. To attribute views or actions to another senator which that senator subsequently denies is not the equivalent of making a personal reflection on the senator. As I stated earlier, if senators' views or actions are misinterpreted, that is a matter for refutation during debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to the following motion: That the Senate condemns the Prime Minister and senior members of the Government for their demonstrated lack of integrity and disregard for the responsibilities of Government at a time when Australians suffer the impact of the worst recession in over 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in particular, the motion that I am seeking that the Senate debate this afternoon is that the Senate condemns the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and senior members of the Government for their demonstrated lack of integrity and disregard for the responsibilities of government at a time when Australians suffer the impact of the worst recession in over 60 years. Mr President, let me remind you of the words of aspiring Prime Minister Keating just a short time ago on Special Broadcasting Service television when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think loyalty is the stuff of politics. Political parties are built on loyalty . . . Loyalty is the common thread, I think, which runs through the political organisation and organisation matters. It matters to me. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, it might be that Mr Keating was referring to the fact that he would be loyal to his mates but certainly the Prime Minister was not loyal to him. But what is more important is that neither was loyal to the Australian people because what occurred, we now learn, is that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, agreed to a secret deal. It was agreed that, at some time during the course of this term, the leadership and the Prime Ministership, if they still had it, would be passed over to Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of being frank about that to the public, being frank about it to the Caucus, and being frank about it to the Cabinet, it was kept secret and the Prime Minister went to the Australian people undertaking that, if he was re-elected, he would serve out his whole term knowing, of course, that he had this secret arrangement that he had made with Mr Keating, an arrangement seconded and agreed to by witnesses to the deal Sir Peter Abeles, who has been mentioned a number of times in Question Time today, and Mr Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke clearly lied to the Australian people in that instance and has lied subsequently about his intentions. This special relationship which he claims to have with the Australian people-this relationship of trust-is but a fraud. The other part of the arrangement is that Mr Keating corroborated in this lie. He is as much a party to that fraud-that misrepresentation to the Australian people-as the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not long after that that they did it to the Australian people again. That was after the then Treasurer's now notorious speech to the National Press Club in December 1990. After that speech, with Senator Richardson involved as usual, the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer got together-apparently the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and Senator Richardson were watching through some electronic system to see the looks on their faces-and came out of their meeting saying, `We have made up, and the Prime Minister will, of course, remain in office until the end of the term'. That was rapidly changed to `until the end of the following term' when it became politically embarrassing. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that that was a fraud also because that was not what was intended. What was intended was that at a convenient time there would be a changeover to Mr Keating pursuant to the agreement that had been reached earlier. It was not going to become public until Mr Keating finally realised that Mr Hawke had reneged on the deal. Then, of course, it was Senator Richardson-the mate of both sides-who had to come in again and say to the Prime Minister, `Look, you can't do that, Bob, you have got to keep to your deal'. Mr Hawke said, `I am not going to keep to the deal because Mr Keating has been treacherous-the speech at the Press Club was an act of treachery'. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not what he told the Australian people. After that, he said to the Australian people, `I am not, as distinct from some other people, one who carries bitterness because I regard bitterness and jealousy as the most corrosive elements in personal and public life. I appreciated the fact that Paul understood the hurt and damage that had been caused, he apologised unreservedly and I accepted it'. </PARA>
<PARA> What did he say last week? He said, `Mr Keating was treacherous and that enables me to breach the deal that I had; the deal that I kept secret from the Australian people that I would let him take over-not because he deserved it, not because he would be a better Prime Minister, but because it was his turn'. It would be his turn to take over-part of the spoils of office. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is the way the Labor Party has to operate. It operates on factions, where factions join together to share the spoils of office, and it became Mr Keating's turn. What we have seen over this last weekend and today is another effort to share the spoils in a different way: the Centre Right joining with the Centre Left to take the spoils, this time, away from the Right and, of course, the Left, which deservedly has got its share. </PARA>
<PARA> Ask Mr Keating what he thinks of the Ministers of the Left. He knows why they are there. They are not there because of their ability, they are there because, apparently, they are entitled to a share of those offices because they have the numbers that make up Mr Hawke's future. It was a realignment of the shares of the spoils of office that this was all about, and nothing else. That is why, on behalf of the Australian people, we should be able to debate this motion today. </PARA>

<PARA> When there are many difficult issues facing this country, and many difficult issues about which we are seldom asked at Question Time, Senator Hill gives himself away in what is perhaps his most political speech in the Senate-a highly politicised speech seeking to take advantage of some discomfiture which the Government has had over this particular leadership issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday night the Senate got up and honourable senators were able to go home, when it was well known that the Government had to deal with its business last week if possible, and it has to deal with it today. In that environment this censure motion is launched with all sorts of abuse of individual members of the Government, and so on, in Senator Hill's remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the difficulties of the current situation, with the greatest respect, it is not a matter that is going to be solved by debate in the Senate. Clearly, if the remarks that Senator Hill has made are any indication, we will simply have a diatribe from the Opposition against members of the Government and the former Treasurer, Mr Keating. Apart from the normal lack of courtesies in this matter, what is the point of serious politicians in this place, people who have serious views about the issues confronting this country, debating this sort of issue, interrupting the business of the Senate at this time with this sort of motion? I hope that the sensibly and moderately minded people in this chamber will understand and reject this sort of gutter approach to what are, admittedly, difficult issues. Nothing will be solved by such debate. The Liberal Party will not be advantaged by anything that takes place here today and the Government Party will not be damaged by anything that takes place here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not support the motion to suspend Standing Orders moved by the Opposition in this case. Last Thursday night, when this opportunity was also sought by the Opposition, I made the position of the Australian Democrats quite clear: we did not see the Senate as a forum for political opportunism to be exercised by the Opposition over a matter involving personal power plays by leading figures in the Government in the other place. The Democrats' position has not changed today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today is the beginning of the second last scheduled week of sitting for this chamber, a chamber which came back to sit this year two weeks earlier than on previous occasions. This is a chamber which has not yet passed the full Appropriations; where major telecommunications legislation has yet to be dealt with; where social security packages of enormous import are yet to be dealt with-where there is a whole list of legislation that we have to deal with. It is a chamber in which the Government does not have the numbers, but it is a chamber which, courtesy of the Australian Democrats, recognises its role in getting legislation and other major issues of concern debated. Having made our position clear on this matter, the Democrats suggested to members of the Opposition at that time that we were quite sure that there were many people on the floor above who would be interested to talk to them and get their ideas out in the public debate through the media-no problems whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> However, today's motion demonstrates to me the extraordinary ineptitude of the Opposition, even in its political point-scoring goal. I can understand how members of the Opposition would want to score points; I am just saying that I am not going to provide them with that opportunity because we want to get on with some real work. However, if Opposition senators wanted to score points, I cannot understand why, knowing the position of the Australian Democrats-and allowing only 15 minutes in which to twist our arm in order to try to change it in advance-the Opposition did not invoke standing order 75, which is available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this debate is being broadcast, let me tell the general public what that means. The Opposition could have had two hours to debate the matter. I admit that it could not have been a censure motion; but it could have been a motion of urgency. The Standing Orders say that an honourable senator may `move a motion, without notice, ``That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency . . . '. I would imagine that, if the Opposition wanted to censure the Government, it would be some matter of urgency. Just on the off-chance that the Democrats might have changed their minds and not wanted to be a responsible group in this chamber, if I had been the Leader of the Opposition in this place, I would have made sure that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I had been the Leader of the Opposition in this place, I would have made sure that just in case the Democrats had not changed their minds and wanted to go on a political romp-just like the Opposition does-a proposal under standing order 75 had been before this chamber and that I could have had two hours to bash the Government around the head in this situation, rather than half an hour, at least half of which will be taken up by Government speakers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed that Senator Powell will not support the motion to suspend Standing Orders, because I believe that how this Government is run is a matter of extreme importance to the people of Australia. This Government has another two years in office before it slowly ebbs away, to use the former Treasurer's words. There is no doubt that it will ebb away in the flow of politics because it has now lost the support of the people. It can never be the once proud party that it used to be. It has severely mortally wounded itself and its condition is now terminal. I suggest to Senator Powell, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, that the position of the Government as it relates to Australia and its economic performance is very relevant to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The leadership of the Government came into contention on 25 November 1988 when Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty were invited to Kirribilli House. What right has anyone to put up the highest office in this land and have it debated with two people who have no support in this Parliament? I might say that Sir Peter Abeles has a lot of support in this Parliament, but he and Bill Kelty are not elected members of this Parliament. What are we going to see next-Sir Peter Abeles in the Caucus meeting, taking the minutes and offering advice? Is he going to take part in decisions made by this Government? Is the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) going to ring him up and ask him what he thinks?</PARA>
<PARA> The decisions that are made by this Government must be made in this Parliament, not at Kirribilli House by some unelected person and some captain of industry. I do not know what the Australian Labor Party (ALP) grassroots think of this Government when it has to bring in a captain of industry as a referee in its party disputes. This situation has got to the absolutely ridiculous stage. It is made even worse by the fact that this country is bleeding to death in an economic malaise caused by the previous Treasurer who has disqualified himself today. We have record unemployment, a $1.6 billion trade deficit today, and the Government is out of control: there is no hand on the tiller. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson's reputation as a numbers man has been shot to pieces; he does not have any integrity left. Senator Button is fighting with Senator Richardson and there is just one great chaos in the Ministry. The Centre Left is against the Right and the Right is against the socialist left. What a way to run a government. The Government is in terrible trouble and therefore I suggest that this matter is relevant to Australia; it is most important. This country cannot exist without a government that can develop policies and fix the malaise of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We now find that we have a government which is designed like a camel and which will end up like a horse. The socialist left will be pushing its agenda against the Right. It will demand its pound of flesh-I can guarantee that-and it will get it. We will have decisions like the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-a $1,000m decision which the Aboriginal community did not want, but which the Left wanted because it thought it was good for the Aborigines. The only thing was that no-one informed the Aboriginals or asked them what was good for them. That was the sop to the ALP left, that is what it got and we will get more of it. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Button has made the point about whether the courtesy is here. It is really a question of whether any such debate will enhance things.

Former Senator Chaney has defeated him internally in the Party but, of course, he now has an opportunity because of other revelations-but we will not go into all of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one moves the suspension of Standing Orders one is actually supposed to go to the urgency, but all we have heard is simply the substance of the argument. That is a fair enough tactic. We never take a point of order now because it is only a five-minute speech and an honourable senator can put as much into it as he or she likes. But the reality, in terms of this chamber, is that we did not get the Estimates procedure completed-through no fault of the Government-on Thursday night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is imperative that we debate the standards of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the chamber today. If the Australian Democrats believe that the standards of the Prime Minister are all right and that there is no need for them to be debated, the standards of the Democrats are as bad as those of the Prime Minister. Senator Robert Ray may believe that thuggery, and thuggery only, is what the Australian Labor Party need use, but he cannot use it in this place. He should keep it for his Labor colleagues. Senator Ray is good at it over there. He can use his thuggery; he can call Labor members to show their hands; and he can tell them that, in their vote, they can show and tell; but he should not try it in the Senate. It will not get him anywhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of this. It started back in 1988, when the present Prime Minister and the past Treasurer (Mr Keating) got together to play with the leadership of this country. They came to a dirty deal. They trusted each other so much that they each brought in their own witnesses. That is the trust amongst the Labor factions. They each brought in their own witness. What happened? That billionaire, Abeles, came in representing the Prime Minister. Mr Kelty came in to give the past Treasurer a bit of support. What happened? They came to a deal that the Prime Minister would hand over the office to his mate the Treasurer halfway through what would be the next term.</PARA>
<PARA> But what did the Prime Minister tell the people? He told the people a deliberate lie. He said to the people of Australia, `I intend to stay there for the whole of the next term'. He knew that he had made the deal and the witnesses knew but nobody came out and told the people of Australia the truth-and the Democrats believe that that is all right. After all, the Left put in the Prime Minister, and who is more Left than the Left of the Labor Party but the Democrats. So they will support the Prime Minister today. </PARA>
<PARA> How did they get the vote to put the Prime Minister where he is? They got the vote in the Caucus by the Prime Minister, true to his union background, saying, `I do not trust one of you lot. I want a show of hands'. So what did we get? We got Mr Keating saying, `I am not in that. I want a secret ballot', because he did not trust his lot either. But that was a no go. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Hawke made a mistake, so he called a meeting for 10 o'clock. We were all out at the airport, which was fog bound. The cars came out, collected them all and took them back for that meeting at 10 o'clock. But Senator Richardson-Brutus Richardson-left Parliament House and caught the plane home. He was not going to be part of that. He wanted a weekend to do a few deals around the place. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning another good union method was used-that of `We don't trust you to have a secret ballot. But, if we are forced to have a secret ballot, we will have the Labor Party secret ballot-you will vote and then you will show your neighbour'. The Queensland Right can intimidate the lot of you and say, `If you don't vote the way we tell you to vote, you will lose preselection'. This standard adopted by the Government is supported by the Democrats. The Democrats like the `hands up mates and if you have to go to a secret ballot, you show and tell' method. That is the sort of democracy they support. I will come back to Senator Ray. He should not try intimidation in here-it just will not work. </PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In the time available to consider the report Small Business in Australia by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, I wish to raise two main issues. Firstly, there is a desperate need for confidence to be returned to the business sector in Australia. The only way that will happen is if stability is returned to the Government of this country. Today's leadership crisis is only the tip of the iceberg of the uncertainty that surrounds this Government and consequently this country. Look at the haphazard way our exchange rate has fluctuated in the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA> Business is based on trust as well as on legal contractual arrangements. However, recent revelations and the actions of both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the former Treasurer have not been an inspiration to the community. In fact, people are appalled at what is happening in Canberra today. Business cannot succeed in such an environment of uncertainty and distress. It is not a great inspiration to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has produced difficult economic conditions, the like of which we have not seen since the Great Depression. In fact, a recent survey of over 15,500 small businesses in Australia by KPMG Peat Marwick has revealed a number of chronic situations. Demand within the economy has decreased dramatically. Business cash flows have been depleted. It is difficult for companies to borrow from trading banks, as lending criteria have been tightened in the crisis. There has been a reduction in property values, so the asset values of businesses have dropped dramatically and they cannot borrow nearly as much. There has been a definite reduction in business confidence to commence new undertakings. Finally, to top it off, there is now a reduced cash flow operating with the economy due to the reduced sales of the Christmas-New Year period. If stability were returned-I see the final solution to this being a change of government-the end result would be an improvement in the economy: business confidence would then be returned and encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to my second point-that is, what can be done? There is an urgent need for the new company tax arrangements to be modified. Last year, this Labor Government introduced what I see is a most damaging change to business, particularly the small business sector. The Government now requires small business to pay 85 per cent of its tax within one month of the end of the financial year. I urge the Government to take note of the submission given to it earlier this year regarding company tax payments and how they have affected small business in Australia, as well as the desperate need for transitional arrangements to be instituted to the new forward collection of the 85 per cent of tax. I call on the Government to take action immediately to relieve this chronic situation of the bringing forward of company tax collections. Otherwise, hundreds and thousands of small businesses will go to the wall unnecessarily as a result of this Government's desperate actions to collect even more tax. </PARA>

I particularly wish to refer to a specific part of the report and, in doing so, I want to make the comment that I am rather disappointed with a number of aspects of this report because it contains some sweeping statements that do not mean one heck of a lot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In dealing with the matter of having confidence in the report, I refer to page 18 on bankruptcies. I want to compare that with the lack of support that was given by the Australian Democrats in this place to a motion to censure the Government. I am appalled by the position adopted by the Australian Democrats. Looking at the report, we find that it spells out clearly the position which has developed. I refer in particular to my State, Western Australia, which has had the greatest increase-97 per cent-in the number of bankruptcies in the past 12 months. I refer also to the other States: Victoria, 65 per cent; New South Wales, 62 per cent; Queensland, 56 per cent; and South Australia, 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we put that alongside the unemployment figure that currently exists in Australia of 9.9 per cent-once again with Western Australia at 11.1 per cent-we can gauge the performance of this Government; yet a few minutes ago in this chamber the Democrats said that we did not need to debate that aspect of the Government's performance at this time. Of course, the Government has the economy in absolute disarray, which is highlighted by those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government often refers to what occurred during the Fraser years. It is worth looking at the graph on page 19 of the report, which relates to performance across the board. We find an estimated figure for this coming year of 12,400 bankruptcies. Comparing that with 1982-83, when the figure was 5,100, we find that there has been a 2 1/2-fold increase. Looking at those figures across the board in the report, we find that in six out of the eight years the figure has been significantly higher than it was in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight these figures because they clearly demonstrate the Government's inability to effectively address monetary, fiscal and industrial policies. These figures bring out the point that the level of bankruptcies in this country, alongside our unemployment figures, is a product of the Government's failure to address fiscal and monetary policies and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> In the few remaining moments I have left, I also want to highlight page 29 of the report, where it talks about taxation reform and the impact of a capital gains tax on complying with the taxation legislation. At page 31 under the heading `Regulation Reform' it highlights the cost of regulation-two areas that need to be addressed but which have not been touched upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I end my comments on what occurred here last Thursday night and just prior to this debate. At this time when small business is going down the drain in a way it has never done before, it was reported that Senator Cook was at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention. Senator McLean is also at that ILO convention-the first time that an Australian Democrat has been taken along to it. What deal has been done for that trip? Is it a deal to support the right to strike legislation? Is it a deal for the introduction of a labour court? Is it a deal to remove sections 45D and E and common law action in industrial matters? The Government should come clean on this; it should not behave in the way that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) behaved in the Hawke-Keating affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address briefly the first annual report on small business in Australia by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Before doing so in detail, I need to correct one or two statements made by Senator Crane. The Australian Democrats were not prepared to give half an hour or two hours, as the Opposition would have had if it had won its particular motion, to the leadership convulsions of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is important is the economy, the state of unemployment and the state of small business. We believe that this House has a responsibility to address itself to these questions in substance and in detail and to find solutions, rather than to capitalise on a party political issue, which is no business of this House and certainly should not be used for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The report before the Senate underlines the importance of small business by documenting that there are 692,700 small businesses in Australia and 65 per cent of Australians are employed, to the extent that they are currently employed, by small business. The report indicates a number of areas in which small business needs support badly; they are in capital and in training. The report does not address either of those and that is a matter of regret. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time now the Australian Democrats have been advocating a loan fund for small business at a rate which enables small business to compete with big business. The Government as yet has not supported this initiative. I trust that the new Treasurer may well look at that initiative. I trust that the Opposition parties may give up their distrust and dislike of targeted economic intervention and lend support to provide some capital to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we do not go to such a fund, there are two other measures at least that we could adopt. One of them is to put all banks under the Prices Surveillance Authority. It is clear that small business is paying 18, 19, 20, and even 22 per cent on the overdraft funds that it needs as working capital. The banks have had the cost of their funds reduced, yet they seem strangely reluctant to reduce their rates to borrowers. Perhaps it is not so strange because, after all, they need to recoup the losses that they have incurred by making irresponsible loans to some shaky paper entrepreneurs, and there is plenty of evidence of the bad debt problems. Small business should not be the sector that should carry this particular load. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that we should look at is training. Currently there are 6,900 people who have been seeking places in tertiary institutions, but have not been able to find places. The Australian Democrats believe it is urgent that additional funds be made available to educational institutions to ensure that all Australian citizens who can contribute to making this indeed the clever country get an opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas on which the report touches, which I believe require specific action. One of them is the neglect of the trade practices legislation to protect small business against unconscionable conduct, for instance, by large shopping centre operators, due to the fact that section 46 adverts only to persons rather than corporations. It is one of the matters, I am pleased to say, which is now part of the trade practices inquiry which we have initiated, and which will be looked at by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other matters which we should address in the area of small business. Small business should be given an opportunity to take part in our export development, which is an extremely important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see that this Government has chosen to recognise the significance of small business at long last and that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has seen fit to produce this first annual report on small business in Australia. However, I am disappointed that it has cynically chosen this vehicle to try to justify its economic policies in delivering to us the recession which was planned, whereas the report should have been addressing more particularly the difficulties that small business faces in the light of those policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nowhere, for instance, in this report are there any statistics on the number of bankruptcies that have been caused by this Government's policies. It uses statements such as:</PARA>
<PARA>The economic slowdown has reduced employment levels . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a nice polite way of saying it has created mass unemployment and that it is going to grow beyond 10 per cent. It makes statements such as:</PARA>
<PARA>While the downturn in economic activity has been more severe than anticipated-</PARA>
<PARA>that must be the understatement of the year-</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is beginning to experience the benefits of consistent policy in dealing with the inflation and current account problems of the late 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>The people of Australia are feeling the benefits all right. They are feeling it in their inability to meet their mortgage payments or their lease payments, or to buy stock if they are in the business of retailing. They are suffering all right. The report then goes on to have the hide to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the volatility in monthly current account figures, the result for the six months ended December 1990 showed an unambiguous improvement in the current account position. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what the figures that came out today show is an unambiguous position where we have a blow-out of $1.6 billion representing an increase of imports of at least 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is quite significant that this report comes before the Senate straight after the Government and the Australian Democrats refused to debate our censure motion which was designed to bring the Senate's urgent attention to the disregard that this Government has for its responsibilities at a time when Australians are suffering the impact of the worst recession in over 60 years. I listened to the reasons that were given by the Government and by the Democrats as to why they would not entertain discussion on that motion to censure the Government. It was quite significant to listen to the matters which, for instance, Senator Button thought were important. First of all, he talked to us about the need for courtesy. I would have thought that, in the light of the past 48 hours, courtesy be the least--</PARA>

Thirdly, he told us that there was a desperate need to get the Appropriation Bills through and how terrible it was that we got up at half past one Friday morning and needed to go home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the first annual report of Small Business in Australia. It is a very serious report on the state of small business in Australia and, of course, it is very tragic that there are increased bankruptcies right across this country. It disturbs me that the burden of these increased bankruptcies has largely been borne by Western Australia which, as the report says, has the largest increase in total bankruptcies in the December 1990 quarter over the December 1989 quarter with 97 per cent. In the year to June 1990, total business bankruptcies rose by 41 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has a situation where we have increased bankruptcies; increased failures before businesses actually go into bankruptcy; increased unemployment; increased hardship; more farmers going to the wall; and increased taxation burdens, with the aid of the Australian Democrats because the Australian Democrats along with the Government are the tax junkies of this country, who will see anything and will tax it, yet not caring about what is happening, whether it is in the cities or whether it is in the country. We see so many farmers being forced off the land-they are small businesses-and the small businesses that are supporting them in the towns going to the wall. Yet what does this Government do? All it has is a leadership wrangle. All this is happening while Messrs Hawke and Keating and Senators Robert Ray and Richardson and many of their cronies are bickering about whose turn it is to run the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole problem that is causing the deck of cards to fall down around us in this country is second to all their leadership tussles and the acrimony that is going on from one side to the other. Where is the benefit to this country? What is going to be done by this Government to turn this situation around? Is it prepared to bring in some policies that will be beneficial to small business or is it to continue on the way it has gone in the past eight years and ensure that bankruptcies go up even further? I mean, 41 per cent total to the year ended June 1990 is something of which it should be totally and utterly ashamed. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we have only two senators sitting in this chamber for this debate: one who does not understand it and the other who may or may not, depending on whether someone has written out an answer. Victoria has 65 per cent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The small business community has had a gutful of lip service paid to it. What we have in this first annual report of the Small Business Unit of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, entitled Small Business in Australia, is the culmination of the first year of the Hawke Labor Government's attempt to set the perception that it has a concern for small business. It created the Ministry of Small Business and Customs, trying to set the perception to the small business community that it was going to give consideration to its concerns, going to act upon its concerns and going to put in place a set of policies that responded to its concerns, but this report is nothing more than lip service to the small business community. It does not address or highlight the difficulties that it is facing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will quote a couple of passages from speeches by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). He said, `Some issues clearly require more research and consultation and will have to be progressed over a longer time frame.' In other words, it is too difficult, we are going to act some time in the future but we can't and won't act now. There are overriding considerations and they are not the small business community, which happens to be this country's largest employer. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about small business people in this country we are talking about people who have mortgaged their own homes and invested their life savings in a business to try to give it a go, make a go of it and create wealth and job opportunities for other people. That is the motivation and incentive driving small businesses to risk their life savings and their homes in building up a structure for the future. What are we doing to them? At every turn we are putting obstacles and hurdles in the way such as the high interest regime of the Hawke Labor Government over the last couple of years that has starved small business of capital urgently required for maintaining stock levels. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen small business having to put people off. I can assure members of the Government opposite that, having had some involvement in small business over the last 20 or 30 years, when it comes to a position of having no choice but to lay off a member of staff who has been with the business for 10, 15 or 20 years who, in turn, has a family to support, it is not a very easy thing to do-it is a heart breaking, heart wrenching thing to do. Over the last couple of years small businesses have been forced to take that course of action because they simply have no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of them have tried to stave off doing that. That is why there are the high bankruptcy levels throughout this country referred to not only in this report but also by other speakers. They are an indication of small businesses trying to hang on, trying to keep up staff levels, trying to keep businesses going and trying to save their life savings. But at the end of the day there is no alternative for them, and that is why they have had to succumb to bankruptcy and liquidation as a result of this Government's economic policies and direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should go out to some of the small country communities and see how businesses are surviving there. There are no job opportunities for young people in those communities any more because they have simply disappeared-they have gone. Honourable senators should have a look at the suburban streets and shopping centres with the `To let' and `For sale' signs up, and the small businesses that have closed. They are all a stark indication and signpost of this Government's economic policies that are ruining small business. The engine room of the economy of Australia is being starved and crippled by this Government's action and direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that, instead of paying lip service and attempting to set perceptions, the Government did something and had a concern for small business. Policies should be put in place to start to address the real problems of small business such as on costs and those areas of micro-economic reform that we keep talking about that need to be addressed-transport costs that affect small business people in country communities of Australia, who have to pay far more for their goods and services before they hit the shelves because of the high transport costs; and telecommunications costs that affect every small business operation which are so dependent upon telecommunications today. There are power costs, land tax, WorkCare and Workcover which, in some instances, were increased by 64 per cent. In WorkCare and Workcover we have too high, unsustainable benefits which pass on high premium costs to small businesses which simply cannot absorb those costs any more. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the areas that need to be addressed by governments rather than glossy productions. This is a good, glossy production but, at the end of the day, this first annual report goes nowhere near addressing the plight of small business. It does not identify the areas and gives no plan of action as to how this Government will attempt to look after small business in the future. </PARA>

I am glad that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) is in the chamber because I ask him to have a look at the document.

Very little of any value to the small business community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter that was dealt with in the Committee hearings, but there was an outstanding question at the time of the tabling of the report. It deals with the acquisition of a computer and computer services for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, specifically for the Australian Customs Service. This matter has been reported upon in various parts of the media illustrating the fact that people are quite appalled by the example of the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) joining in a consortium with IBM and Wizard Information Services and submitting a tender for evaluation to itself, such a tender process being ridiculous in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) whether he would tell me the state of that tender.

That is despite the fact that reports had been made that the tender had been received and was being evaluated, and despite the fact that at the time that Julie Power wrote her article, which was published subsequently on 30 April, at least one of the partners with DAS did not know that its tender had been ruled out of order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister does not have a good record for dealing with tenders in his Department. I wonder whether he could tell me what is the current state of the tender on behalf of DAS, IBM and Wizard Information Services concerning the supply of a computer for the use of Customs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Parer knows, there are very distinct arms of DAS. The diverse range of functions that are conducted by the Department in its constituent bodies are conducted in such a way that, quite often, one arm of the organisation seeks services advice or whatever on a commercial basis from other arms of the organisation. At the same time, there are areas of the Department which may be involved on a consultative basis with other arms of government but, in the same context, other arms of the Department providing services in relation to the same area of consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been indicated quite often, we are taking the Department-and the Department is doing this extremely well-through a transition stage, from a traditional public sector department to one which is geared towards having its constituent bodies operate on a financial basis. As a consequence, whether in the area of property, information technology, transport, or whatever, some arms of the Department have to bid for work from other arms on a competitive basis. This is the regimentation that is involved in making sure that government services are cost competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of conflict of interest in this area is one that was raised in the context of this submission for tender. As I have already indicated publicly, we are in the process of developing a consolidated corporate policy for handling the question of conflict of interest and potential conflict of interest in all areas of administrative services. The policy will acknowledge that conflict of interest is an issue which faces most public and private sector organisations. Our policy for handling it consists of a clear statement of business ethics and the reinforcement of standards already covered in service-wide policy documents, such as the guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants and Commonwealth procurement guideline No. 3. The policy will also draw on other DAS policy documents such as the Department's code of ethics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The underlying principles of the policy are, firstly, full disclosure-all DAS officers are obliged to alert the clients to any possible conflict of interest and negotiate a suitable resolution-and, secondly, organisational separation; that is, between those areas of the Department involved in the procurement process and those areas which may be in a position to bid for such work. In the information technology (IT) purchasing area, these principles are applied. The Standards and Contracts Branch of DAS maintains strict rules concerning the release of proprietary information elsewhere, including to the IT Services Branch. Further, DAS will not serve on any IT acquisition council where a current tender for services is being evaluated by that council. It should be noted that, as a result of recent Government decisions, heads of agencies are now fully accountable for all aspects of the IT acquisition process. As a department, we no longer control the tender process. I acknowledge that there is potential for conflict of interest in any line of business. We have a number of policies and practices in place for handling our own circumstances. As I say, policy is made on an interim basis. The consolidated departmental policy is being finalised to provide clear corporate direction as to how such conflicts are to be resolved within DAS. </PARA>

Going specifically to the method by which the tender was to be assessed, I stress that it was again one of these tenders where there was to be a four-stage process and criteria were to be established and then scores would be given against that set of criteria. One might say that it was a system of evaluation similar to the one which Senator Parer has drawn the Minister's attention to on a previous occasion and in which the Minister subsequently intervened and had an inquiry into. When the Minister finally released the document, which was a report of the manner in which that tendering process operated, the report said that the basket system of allocating points was deficient in some way.

I refer the Chairman to question No. 33 `Ministerial consultants' which was hence a reservation in the report. I would like to ask the Minister a question about consultancies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Committee knows and as we discussed last week, the question of consultants is one which has attracted some interest. Ministerial consultants are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. To give a full answer, each portfolio Minister may engage up to two consultants at any one time unless the Prime Minister approves otherwise. Proposals for the employment of consultants by Ministers are subject to approval by Cabinet. After scrutiny by the merit panel convened by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Industrial Relations provides advice on terms and conditions of employment. The consultants are engaged primarily to perform specified duties and if the merit panel were of the view that a proposed consultant was not qualified to perform specified duties it would recommend that the engagement not proceed. In essence, we have consultants or individuals providing advice and skills in respect of specified duties. I think Senator Parer asked further to that how that differed from consultants employed by the Department-is that correct?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was really asking what is the functional difference-or perhaps the mission statement, if you like-between a consultant who would be employed by a Minister and a consultant who would be employed by a department. In other words, what are the functional responsibilities? Would there be a clear difference in functions? Obviously, the consultants employed by Ministers have specific purposes in relation to the ministerial role of the Minister, whereas I would have imagined-I am not sure about this and I am seeking clarification-consultants employed by the departments would be simply related to departmental matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have already covered the area of ministerial consultants. When one looks at departmental consultants one is looking at the use of external consultants in a whole range of areas where specialist skills are required-for example, on the construction side where expertise is not available in-house. For instance, in this Department, Australian Construction Services is the largest user of consultancy services, and it uses them mainly for design and construction projects where the required skills and expertise are not available in-house. The Overseas Property Group is another major user for very much the same reasons. For example, there might be minor construction and maintenance project consultancies and legal services provided in both of those areas where those skills are not available within the Department. In respect of ministerial consultants, they play, primarily, very much an advisory role in terms of the administration of government.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think in the instances where consultants have been employed by secretaries of departments, those consultants have been engaged in the development of policy advice and assessments of government services.

The question I am asking is whether this is simply a political media monitoring service which really has nothing to do with the Department.

Of course, different areas are covered in newspapers. For instance, the Department of Employment, Education and Training would have a different focus to a department such as Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.

As a consequence, the policy direction and administration of government can be effected by inputs, ideas and whatever is picked up through the clipping and transcript service. Although Senator Parer may choose to see it as purely political, it does have a very useful role in alerting government to the adequacies or inadequacies of its policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before Senator Parer goes any further, I might help him. As I said, I did not know to whom it was circulated. But I am advised, as I suspected might be the case, that the news clippings are in fact circulated to senior Department of Administrative Services staff. They are not just for the Minister. That is the practice that I would expect happens in other departments as well. They are of use not only to a ministerial office but also to senior management of departments to ensure that that management is on top of the administration of departments as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not draw that inference. In terms of the role of the clippings and how they are used both by Ministers and public servants, it is very easy for us here to have a purely political perspective of the role of Ministers. Obviously, there is a job to do in terms of administering a department as well. It should be recognised that those clips are useful to Ministers as well as to senior public servants in the administration of departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, Senator Parer may have taken one perspective of it. But I suppose, as in all areas of activity, one needs to know what is going on within a department or an enterprise with which one is involved. These clips are quite useful to that extent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have two more questions in respect of this. Do all transcripts of all media-which I understand is the reason for the sudden increase in the cost of this-go to the Department? The other question, to which I referred earlier, was asked by Senator Kemp. We thought the answers we got covered all the consultants and the National Media Liaison Service. As I have pointed out, it seems that we have a brand new ball game here and that hidden away in departments within their budgets is another, but externally contracted, national media liaison service-which probably makes the National Media Liaison Service look pretty attractive. As the Minister is responsible for providing the answers in regard to ministerial consultants, can he advise us to what extent this practice exists in every other department of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is pretty easy to build sandcastles in debates such as this. The first point to make is that, from my understanding of the definition of the word, we are not talking about consultants to Ministers; we are talking about the provision of services. There are a number of services provided to Ministers by departments and provided jointly for both Ministers and departments. This is one of them. We are not talking about a parallel National Media Liaison Service; we are talking about a privately contracted service to the process of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of other departments, it is not something that is paid for by the Department of Administrative Services. I think probably the best thing that Senator Parer could do is to take the matter up with other responsible Ministers. I would not draw from this any suggestion that we are talking about organisations such as Croll, Monitair and others as being on a consultant arrangement with government; they provide a service. </PARA>

He also said that that related to five or six days in Ireland, whereas the documentation suggests once again that it was only a two or three day period. I would be grateful if the Minister could advise how these mistakes came to be made and, firstly, whether the documents are checked within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when they return to Australia; secondly, whether they are checked in the Department of Administrative Services; and, thirdly, whether they are expected to be checked in the relevant Minister's office.</PARA></TALK.START>

That advice is normally taken. There are reasons for this. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade quite often takes the view that one should stay at certain residences or hotels because of, amongst other things, security aspects and the proximity to appointments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to change the topic and ask a few brief questions about Comcar. I refer to some of the questions unanswered as at 6 May which I believe are related because they talk about the cars purchased under contract and so on. I understand that recently there has been a change of direction within Comcar in respect of self-drive cars and I would like some clarification. Just by way of explanation, up until now honourable senators have had the opportunity in capital cities, as well in the Australian Capital Territory, to take a self-drive car, which I understand costs somewhere in the order of $35 a day, compared with the use of a chauffeur driven Comcar at $70 an hour. My understanding is that that particular service has now been cut out. There may be very good reasons for it and there may have been some abuse, of which I am not aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just by way of example, over the weekend I was in Perth undertaking my shadow ministerial duties. I sought to have a self-drive car, which I understand would have saved the taxpayer an awful lot of money, but I was prevented from doing so because I was advised that I had to use the Comcar service. In fact, as it turned out in one instance, Comcar was required to engage a private vehicle hire rather than my being able to drive myself at considerable saving to the taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer's point was raised with me privately by Senator Knowles last week. I am sure she does not mind my mentioning that. There is an inconsistency in terms of the costs incurred if one were to fly back to one's home base as opposed to staying in Canberra for a weekend. I understand that it would be more attractive to stay here if one had the mobility to get around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Access to motor vehicles, in the circumstances outlined by Senator Parer, does depend on Remuneration Tribunal determinations which govern the service that can be made available to members of parliament in such circumstances. From my understanding, the Remuneration Tribunal does not provide for unlimited free-range use of self-drive cars whilst in Canberra. That issue is something that we can examine and take up with the Tribunal to see whether there is any way of having a satisfactory service provided that is adequately monitored. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the first question, self-drive has been a long held entitlement in terms of driving from point to point for long distances and on official business. If Senator Parer were to drive around Perth on official business, he would be able to get a self-drive car. My first answer was accurate. We will follow up and give some attention to the second question with respect to the use of cars whilst in Canberra. I thought that I would do so after Senator Knowles raised the question last week to see whether there is any way in which we can get the Remuneration Tribunal to come up with a more flexible determination. </PARA>

I am going ahead of myself when I get onto this but the Minister raised the issue, so it is an appropriate time to clarify it. Let us not debate whether it is an Australian company. That does not matter. `Australian manufactured' means to me probably the same as it does to others. Irrespective of its origins, if a product is manufactured in Australia we could probably term it `Australian manufactured'.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are no 3 1/2-inch diskettes manufactured in this country. To some degree, on the 5 1/4-inch diskette, it is just simply a folding and wrapping exercise. I will not go into the details now.

Some time between the letting of the tenders and 4 March, the Minister was contacted by Nashua Australia Pty Ltd. I think that I asked the question before and I would just like it verified here. What sort of contact was it? Did it come through a lobby group? Was it by letter? Was it by telephone or was it by some sort of representation? The Minister confirmed that it was by letter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to go to the material that is on the record. I want to go, first of all, to the Commonwealth procurement guideline No. 12 dated 1990, Australian and New Zealand supplies. The Minister is familiar with that document, I take it. I would like to go to page 2 of that document where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA>The ANZ supplies policy aims to maximise competitive opportunities for ANZ suppliers in Commonwealth procurement. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It does not involve discriminating against foreign suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA>It asks that potential ANZ suppliers be actively sought, and so on, but the bottom line is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . buy supplies on the basis of value for money after considering all relevant factors and evaluating offers against requirements-</PARA>
<PARA>Value for money was the criterion set out when the new procurement guidelines were brought in. I turn to the Government's own report-the one that was originally commercial-in-confidence-of the inquiry into the goings on behind these decisions. It deals with the various methods that were employed by the Department and in the part dealing with market knowledge, specification and staged procurement, under the heading `Staged Procurement', it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The public tender process was employed. No advantage was seen by officers in employing any other option. There were many suppliers, the products were off-the-shelf and there were no discernible issues of quality differentiation. Therefore, what was contemplated was a competition on price for readily available items. In the circumstances, and providing the market was properly informed of other necessary conditions of proper competition, this may be seen as a reasonable decision.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's own inquiry determined that that was a reasonable decision. We have established, firstly, that we ought to find an Australian made product, but in determining the criteria and the information to hand, the bottom line is value for money. The Government's own evaluation of the process used says that the process used was reasonable and that competition on price was to be an important factor. I now refer the Minister to his own letter to Mr Terry Fewtrell, the Acting General Manager, Purchasing and Sales, regarding the tender from Nashua Australia Pty Ltd for the contract. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Following representations from Nashua, and the offer of a new price list, it would seem that Nashua have-</PARA>
<PARA>not `might have', but `have'-</PARA>
<PARA>unfortunately hurt their own case by not submitting their best price at the time of the tender. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, at the time of the tender Nashua submitted a price which met the criteria laid down in the various publications concerning procurement, the Government's own evaluation of the system used says that the criteria it used was reasonable, yet the Minister chose to intervene and say, `Hey fellas, they've got a new price-seeing they have seen the other prices-and I want them to get part of the action'. The Minister is saying that he is favouring this company and giving it the benefit of having seen everybody else's price and retendering, and he is telling the Department it is to be included. Would the Minister tell the Committee where that line of logic is incorrect?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have looked at what Senator Bishop quoted from the interim report and my letter. I think it is fair to indicate, as I have indicated already a number of times, that I was concerned about a number of aspects of this particular tender-the seeking out of Australian suppliers being one and the question of costs being another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The correspondence that Senator Bishop referred to is one of a number of communications-some verbal-between my office and the Department on this particular issue. I refer Senator Bishop to the page that she quoted from. In respect of the cost issue and the question of negotiation, the report indicates as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In keeping with more traditional public service practice no provision was made for post offer negotiations. With the benefit of hindsight this process could have benefited from having this facility available. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is one concern that the report raises which is, and was, quite valid to my mind. The next page of the report is also important in respect of this question of prices. It goes to the question of evaluation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer the question in the way that I want to answer it. Senator Bishop can ask the question in the way that she wants to ask it. Maybe I am reading her mind or maybe I am jumping the gun, but I will go to that point now to give her a full answer. Her tolerance would be appreciated. On the question of evaluation, the point is made that this process resulted in some low priced offers and individual items not being accepted. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A clearer idea of the supply and demand sides of market would have enabled earlier publication of evaluation method. </PARA>
<PARA>The bottom line to all of this is that I had a number of concerns, the report of the Department emphasises those and that report was to senior officers. They, in their advice to me, made a very clear recommendation on the basis of not including Nashua's revised price offering. It is one that I accept. The advice from the General Manager of the area, which was agreed to by more senior departmental officers, was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Maintaining the status quo is not appropriate. Our review has pointed to some major deficiencies in the process. Whilst there is no suggestion of bias in the process, by not deciding and notifying in advance the criteria to be used and the relative weights that might be applied in the evaluation, potential bidders did not know clearly and consistently how the evaluation process was to be conducted. This could have affected their price offering. Furthermore, the application of the ``basket approach'' does not give best ``value for money'' in every case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were Senator Parer, I would withdraw that. There is absolutely no reason why he should accuse anyone in my Department of attempting to cover this up. This is advice from senior departmental officers dated 6 May. Senator Parer has had this advice for months and he has had a chance to analyse it, for him to make the suggestion that this is a cover-up is totally out of order. It is a scurrilous allegation to make.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. He did not tell me where the logic that I exercised was incorrect. To recap, this report says that the system of procurement employed concerning this particular procurement was found to be a correct method and that Nashua was to comply with the ANZ policy for procurement, but the bottom line in the Government's own publication says that value for money is to be the criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will take the Minister to other publications dealing with the Government's benchmarks, and he should always understand that when it comes to dealing with procurement the basic requirement is to comply with Finance Regulation 44A and Finance Regulation 43. Those finance regulations are delegated legislation and have the force of law. They must be obeyed. Once they have been followed, the various other guidelines that are laid down are followed. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I was making very strongly to the Minister, and where Senator Parer used the term `cover-up' in a legitimate sense, is the Government's evaluation report under the heading `Future of Contract', which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The issue arises as to the future of this contract bearing in mind the current controversy. As a general principle processes like this should not be overturned on the protest of a loser in a competition. To do so would tend to bring the purchasing process into disrepute and invite protest on every occasion. There are only two conditions on which re-opening should be seriously contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted that it says `re-opening'-not picking one's favourite and sticking him in, but `re-opening' the process. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>These relate to the circumstances in which there is sufficient violence to equity and/or probity . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a company putting in a price which is too high and, having lost out, putting in the lower price. That is a violence on equity and probity. To recap, this is the reason:</PARA>
<PARA>These relate to the circumstances in which there is sufficient violence to equity and/or probity as to warrant this course of action. A weaker case could be made out for re-opening a process which resulted in an unsound business proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out again that it refers to re-opening, not adding in one's favourite. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In exercising judgment, however, care needs to be exercised to take into account whether the violence done outweighs the damage that could be done to the Commonwealth's contracting processes at large. In our opinion, there was not sufficient violence to outweigh the damage that could occur. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the arrangement should stand as it is. </PARA>
<PARA>We should read this document as a whole, as is the proper way to read a document. I refer to the section that the Minister referred to earlier, where the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The evaluation method for this purchase suffered from a number of deficiencies. First, the detailed method appears not to have been determined until well into the process. Second, industry was not sufficiently advised of the method at the time offers were invited. Third, the prospective size of the panel was not clearly in the minds of officers. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. It states further:</PARA>
<PARA>A clear idea of the supply and demand sides of market should have enabled earlier publication of the evaluation method. Fourth, a more defensive system of weightings, particularly with regard to decisions having to do with ranges of goods and the turnover value of different items could-</PARA>
<PARA>not `should', but `could'-</PARA>
<PARA>have been employed had better product use information been available from previous contract. </PARA>
<PARA>We can take that with the statement that the Minister read out earlier, dealing with negotiation, stating that traditional Public Service practice had been followed, that it had not been elected to use the post-offer negotiation system, and, further, that with the benefit of hindsight this process could have-using the subjunctive, implying doubt-not `would have', benefited from this facility having been available. Despite all of that, the Department says at the end of the day:</PARA>
<PARA>In the interests of the integrity-</PARA>
<PARA>and that has been a much misused term in this Parliament in recent times-</PARA>
<PARA>of the Commonwealth's procurement process the arrangement should stand as is. </PARA>
<PARA>The report says that the violence done to the equity and probity does not outweigh the damage that could be done to the Commonwealth's contracting processes. That is a pretty stern, deliberative and absolute statement for that committee to make. In the light of that finding, I go back to the Minister's letter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Following representations from Nashua-</PARA>
<PARA>and that can be interpreted, `At the end of the day when we did not get our share of the contract we are ringing you to complain'-</PARA>
<PARA>and the offer of a new price list-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, `We have seen the prices and we put in one that is too high; having seen the competition we will now put in a cheaper price'. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . it would be seen that Nashua have unfortunately hurt their own case . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They hurt it all right; they made the wrong judgment. The Minister then continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It concerns me that an established and satisfactory supplier to the Government can be put off the contract without the Department wanting to satisfy itself that it has not unfairly treated the company. </PARA>
<PARA>A good reading of the whole of this document shows quite clearly that the departmental people had gone through it in a quite proper and satisfactory way. Everything about it was proper. The only thing that was not proper was the Minister's intervention. He made a decision that it was wrong that the supplier was put off the contract. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, we should be making every effort to satisfy ourselves that Australian suppliers have put forward their best offer. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us go back to the guidelines. Does the Minister remember these-put out by his Department, things he should be familiar with? What do they say the Minister should do? They say:</PARA>
<PARA>The policy relies on sound purchasing practices to develop an ANZ supply base.</PARA>
<PARA>They say nothing about `preferential'; they say `sound'. They continue:</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth buyers (see some definitions on this page) should actively seek out potential ANZ supplies and suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA>The question asked was whether the Department did that, and the answer was yes, with a tick. The second question was:</PARA>
<PARA>Communicate and build relationships with ANZ suppliers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Had the Department done that? The answer was yes, with a tick. The next question was whether the Department had:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . planned procurement and informed the market in time to give ANZ suppliers the opportunity to meet requirements or the requirements of prime contractors. </PARA>
<PARA>Did the Department do that? Yes, tick. The next was:</PARA>
<PARA>Eliminate practices which may favour foreign suppliers over ANZ suppliers in any stage of procurement and encourage suppliers to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>Was there a problem? No. Did the Department favour foreigners in an unfair way? No, it complied. The next was:</PARA>
<PARA>Decide what to buy and not let individual suppliers dictate procurement decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Commonwealth agencies often collaborate with one another in the discharge of their functions; I make that point as a general observation. Sometimes agencies collaborate on wildlife protection issues or things of that kind. Customs has a general function of controlling and supervising the entry of non-Australian nationals into Australian territory. Macquarie Island is not a proclaimed port, so there are no port regulations in respect of Macquarie Island. However, for the purpose of the exercise of Commonwealth functions, it is an Australian Territory. Anybody going there is subject to the control exercised by Customs in respect of Australian Territories generally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I am sorry, but I am still getting very confused answers and the matter has gone around in circles. Could the Minister find out the truth of the matter and let me know? My basic point is: if a ship leaves Hobart, travels to the Antarctic and has to take a Customs officer with it in order to-according to the original answer I got-`facilitate passengers arrival in Hobart and to ensure their connections are made on international flights', I believe that can be done from the Hobart end. It seems a ridiculous reason for sending a Customs officer all the way to the Antarctic and back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we allowed Senator Walters to deal with some questions pertaining to Estimates Committee A, we were going through the dot points which are required to be satisfied by a department engaged in procurement in accordance with Commonwealth procurement guideline No. 12, December 1990, for Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) suppliers. We had just gone through the first five points, which it is suggested that the Department of Administrative Services ought to follow, and we had discovered that the Department had complied with all of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are only three other requirements aside from that most important requirement, the overriding one, which is that all procurement must be on the basis of value for money. The three remaining ones, very quickly, are that there must be an adequate description of requirements in functional and performance terms where possible; that it is necessary to specify performance in terms of actual need to consider the advantages which new or less well known ANZ suppliers may offer; and, finally, that it is necessary to debrief ANZ suppliers. But the most important one is that they must buy supplies on the basis of value for money after considering all relevant factors and evaluating offers against requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> We were going through that because I was referring to Senator Bolkus's quite extraordinary letter whereby he instructed the `a/g', and I presume that stands for `acting', general manager in purchasing and sales to include Nashua in a contract for which, by the proper evaluation process-I use the word `proper' because that is the final finding of the report which was commissioned into the whole process-these people, who obviously had some sort of relationship that enabled them to be added onto the list, were so added. They were added as a result of the highly unusually letter from the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> I had been quoting from the letter, and I think it is necessary in terms of someone reading Hansard that we place all this on the record. I had been making the point that the Nashua people had put in a poor price. They had not put in their best price. They had made a commercial judgment and had been excluded. The Minister for Administrative Services, when he got a new price list, said that they must be put back into the contract. We were looking at the requirements under the procurements for Australia and New Zealand suppliers' guidelines, because in the Minister's letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA>My view is that we should be actively seeking out competitive Australian suppliers to put on the common use contracts and elsewhere, in line with purchase Australia campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly why I went through all those dot points-because the Department in fact complied with that. So we were back to the question of value for money. I said earlier that in fact the most important requirements with which any procurement officer has to comply are indeed finance regulations, which have the force of law. They are delegated legislation. I mentioned finance regulation 44a, finance regulation 43 and, of course, also I am going to add finance regulation 44b. I think it is important that we put on the record what that requirement is. I read again from one of Senator Bolkus's own publications. This time I am reading from Commonwealth procurement guidelines, September 1989. The whole section is called `Getting value for money' and the introduction very simply says:</PARA>
<PARA>The prime objective of Commonwealth procurement is to support government programs through obtaining value for money in the acquisition of supplies. To meet this objective, we should direct close attention to the issue of quality, cost and timeliness. Finance regulation 44a requires officers approving proposals to satisfy themselves that the proposed expenditure will make efficient and effective use of public moneys. Finance regulation 44b requires that persons entering into financial commitments should be satisfied after reasonable inquiry that in all the circumstances the Commonwealth could not obtain better value for the expenditure. This guideline sets out considerations that are relevant to assessing effectiveness and value in the procurement context. </PARA>
<PARA>So all this material is set out. When we read this document, which is the interim report, the `Review of Common Use Contracting Based on Three Case Studies', all stamped commercial-in-confidence but subsequently released after much debate, we see that the Department went through all the procedures that were necessary. Again, so that we have it on the record, I read from the Minister's own guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA>Value for money is well understood in commercial procurement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Nashua people had often been engaged with government contracts. They knew the guidelines about value for money. They knew that price remains important unless there are good reasons for price not to be the dominant factor. I read again from the instructions:</PARA>
<PARA>To achieve and assess it-</PARA>
<PARA>this is value for money-</PARA>
<PARA>we have to consider all of the price and non-price factors that are significant in any individual procurement following, but not limited to:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Fitness for purpose;</PARA>
<PARA>2. Whole of life costs;</PARA>
<PARA>3. Fair market prices;</PARA>
<PARA>4. Timely delivery;</PARA>
<PARA>5. Post delivery support;</PARA>
<PARA>6. Effective warranties;</PARA>
<PARA>7. Reasonableness; and</PARA>
<PARA>8. Commonsense must be important in our approach. </PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Getting value for money means ensuring that benefits are commensurate with costs, that least cost choice should not be followed automatically if there is a clear and reasoned justification for not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that the price that was quoted was not the best price so, to justify the price argument, the Minister, by his own guidelines, would have to show that there is clear and reasoned justification for not making the decision based on price. But the really untenable fact in all of this is that this great pile of regulations has been followed and the new procurement guidelines have been followed, but what has occurred is after the event. The company has complained to the Minister, and the Minister has intervened and instructed his Department not to reopen the tendering process because the tendering process was defective in accordance with all those guidelines. But the Minister said, and I quote his letter:</PARA>
<PARA>It would seem that Nashua have unfortunately hurt their own case by not submitting their best price at the time of tender. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister took it upon himself to direct his Department to give preferential treatment to that tenderer. That is just not acceptable. In the words of his own commissioned report-and I go through these words again because they are not only salient but they are integral to the integrity of the tendering process:</PARA>
<PARA>As a general rule, a general principal, the processes such as these should not be overturned on the protest of a loser in a competition. To do so would tend to bring the purchasing process into disrepute and invite protest on every occasion. The only basis for reopening the tender-</PARA>
<PARA>It is to reopen the whole process, not to force the Minister's choice or the Minister's directive upon the Department and that was a violence to equity and probity. The report concludes that, on balance, the damage done to the integrity of the tendering process is not outweighed by any violence against equity or probity. I am afraid that the Minister's actions stand condemned by his own report. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that it took so long to get this report and the fact that the Minister seemed to be unfamiliar with his own guidelines causes one to have great concerns about the method by which all tendering is to be treated. </PARA>

<PARA>Whilst there is no suggestion of bias in the process, but not deciding and notifying in advance the criterion to be used and the relative weights that might be applied in evaluation, potential bidders did not know clearly and consistently how the evaluation process was to be conducted. This could have affected their price offering. Furthermore, the application of the basket approach . . . does not give best `value for money' in every case. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been accepted by officers and even Senator Parer that, of the two items, Nashua would have come in third in terms of the low price of the 5 1/4-inch disc, DSDD 48 TPI, and seventh in respect of the 3 1/2-inch disc, DSDD. Eight tenderers were accepted overall. Nashua has come in third and seventh on two items which constitute a fair proportion of the contract, probably between 25 and 33 per cent of overall sales-33 per cent being closer to the fact. The end result of my intervention has been that, in terms of dollars and cents, the taxpayer is now getting better value for money. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop can ramble on all night, but that is the answer she will be getting from me all night and that is the answer that has stood the test of time and debate in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me get one thing straight. As has been made known in this document-but there is an incapacity on the part of those opposite to understand it-a report of the review team went to the person who commissioned that report, who was a departmental secretary, and through him to Mr Palywoda, the head of that area. They then advised me. I have said that a million times. The advice that I got was from my senior departmental officers, both in writing and in discussion. Their advice to me was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Maintaining the status quo is not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Irrespective of whether I say it to Senator Parer in Greek, Latin, French or whatever; it means the same thing. The outcome of the review has been that the basket approach has been questioned and, as a consequence, the process that has been developed is that we are selecting the best value for money items for the specific lists of products for tendering. As a consequence, I think 23 out of 26 tenderers somehow have a piece of action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister interjects about inferences. There are no inferences in this matter. The point is that the Minister himself has done something, we want to get to the bottom of it and we are going to stay here until we do get to the bottom of it. The fact that 23 out of 24, or whatever the figure is, have gone on the list in itself makes a whole joke of the tender process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will go straight to the point. As has been referred to by Senator Bishop, the Minister wrote a letter to the Department. He told the Department that it must include in the tender process a company that was unsuccessful in the original tender. Subsequently, the Department had a look at its tendering process and decided that some aspects of it could be improved. There are always some aspects in any tender process which could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that, when the Minister wrote his letter to Mr Fewtrell of 4 March, he had no idea at all of what would subsequently be found to be some improvement in the tender process. Over the last few weeks we have been attempting, through Question Time, with little success, to get the Minister to come clean in what has all the earmarks of improper interference by a Minister in the tender process. I am not saying it is improper, but it has all the earmarks. No matter what questions we have asked, he has answered from carefully prepared text, irrespective of whether the answer has been relevant to the question. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are my own notes. It is not another leak from the Department, if that is what the Minister is worried about. Those evasive actions by the Minister make it essential to get to the truth of this matter. If satisfactory answers could be obtained, we would be only too pleased to drop the matter. There could be only two reasons. It is no good trying to justify after the event why the Minister intervened, because he made it very clear in his letter why he intervened. The response from Mr Palywoda to his letter was equally clear-that he came along later and said, `Well, we found some things in the tender that could be improved'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister will not produce the original letter from Nashua to him that sparked this intervention. Will he come clean and say why he intervened? It is no good referring-and I repeat this-to subsequent events which have all the appearances of a cover-up to protect the Minister from something that he did which, on the face of it, was quite improper. Did the Minister intervene because he was misinformed? Did he intervene because he shot from the hip and does he regret that he did that? In other words, was it a bit of stupidity? Or did he intervene for some more sinister reason? They are the simple questions we are asking. They are the questions we have been asking for weeks on end. I want the Minister to give us an answer that does not refer to subsequent events which do not relate to the letter. As Senator Bishop has pointed out-and I will not go through this again-in referring to the Minister's letter, we have established that the Australian supplier with regard to the 3 1/2-inch disc is not an Australian supplier; the discs are totally imported. The 5 1/4-inch discs are folded and wrapped in Australia. Therefore, that excuse goes out the window. I accept the fact that, when the basket of commodities was not used, the original tender price was one that could have been accepted. But let us have a little direct honesty from the Minister. He did not know that when he wrote the letter, did he?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of points. I have made it consistently clear from the start that I got myself involved in this for a number of reasons: firstly, the fact that an Australian supplier was excluded; secondly, pricing; and thirdly, the evaluation process. All those matters were either by correspondence or conversation relating to the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am stunned by the hypocrisy of those opposite. I was in my office during the dinner break. A letter that I had received from Senator Parer quite recently about another Australian supplier was brought to my attention. It is one that I had focused on and am continuing to focus on. Essentially, the terms of his request for me to get interested in that arrangement were ones that he now tells me I should never have accepted from any other organisation. Senator Parer has basically asked me, in respect of another instance of tendering, to find out why an Australian company has missed out and how it could be better encouraged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why it is not on the list and how it could be better encouraged. That is precisely the same motivation that I had in respect of this issue. Senator Parer should not come in here with canned hypocrisy. He has asked me to do exactly the same thing in respect of that issue as others have asked me to do in respect of this one. I have made it very clear from the start that they have been my motivations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The end results of my intervention in this area are threefold: firstly, an Australian supplier, a supplier which is entitled to use the `Australian made' logo is on the contract; secondly, we are getting a better assessment of value for money and cheaper items have made it more available to government; and, thirdly, the evaluation process has gone through a rigorous assessment, one which will improve it. That is the outcome. They were the three motivations. The three motivations and the objectives that I had at the start have been met. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer should not come in here consistently telling me that I have not come clean from the start, because I have made it very clear from the start that these have been the three motivations. It is just that Senator Parer has both the incapacity and the unwillingness to accept what I said on day one in this place. For so long as he does not accept it, he can ask whatever he wants and he will get the same answer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell him, if he is prepared to listen. What we are talking about with the computer consumables is a tender that went out, where 23 or 24 people tendered and eight were successful. After the tender was let, someone went to the Minister. He intervened and directed his Department to go against all the principles of purchasing. My letter-and I do not mind stating which company it was-was in regard to a company called Clough Engineering Group in Perth, an Australian company that wants to be put on the list to tender. It wants to be put on the list; not to be given a tender. The Minister's Department has refused to put it on the list to just put in a tender. Clough Engineering has no idea why that has happened. The company wrote to me and pointed out that it is an Australian company. This is all to do with the tender for building a new Australian embassy in Jakarta where the company is already established and does a lot of work. I see that the Minister is nodding so presumably in this instance some benefit might come out of it. But there is a classic difference: this was a company from which his Department would not even consider a tender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other case was a tender that had been let to companies. An unsuccessful tenderer approached the Minister and a direction was given to his Department. I have not yet had a satisfactory answer. The answers that the Minister is giving Senator Bishop and me do not hold water. All that we have is a letter from the Minister saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it would seem . . . hurt their own case by not submitting their best price at the time of tender. </PARA>
<PARA>We have already established that a major item on the list was a 3 1/2- or 3 1/4-inch disk which is not manufactured in Australia. So the Minister's remark in regard to Australian manufacture is wrong. He then directed the Department, obviously without any consultation with it, to re-establish this company on the tender. What does this do for the tender process? The principles of tendering are paramount throughout Australian society and, if one may say so, they are even more important for government because once one takes away the trust that people have when they put in a tender to government, one destroys that probity. </PARA>
<PARA> Seeing as the Minister gave another example, I indicate that I wrote to him some six or eight months ago about a group which, because of traffic jams and all sorts of things, was four minutes late. I said to him, `Perhaps you should reconsider this or recall tenders'. I think I pointed out in the letter at the time that it was my own idea to do that: it was not even suggested by the group because it was late. It had tried to make contact via the fax machine but it was jammed, so the tender got there four minutes late. The Minister wrote me a letter and said that under no circumstances could he do that. I accepted it because of the probity of the tendering process. That is mentioned in the Minister's letter. </PARA>
<PARA> I will try again: can the Minister tell us why he did this? It has nothing to do with finding out later that he could have improved the tender process. As I said before, when one looks at any tendering process one always finds some way of improving it. People do the best they can when tenders go out. This was an established system: it had been used for many years. I would not doubt that some good might have come out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Representations have been made and on a number of occasions I have asked the Minister to let us have a look at the letter, but so far he has denied to do that. It could well be that if he tabled that letter we would accept it: I do not know. Having come from the private sector, I know that it takes tendering very seriously: it is something about which one has to be awfully careful and stick to the rules. My colleague Senator Bishop has shown quite clearly that all the tendering procedures were followed to the `T'. I understand that there were no complaints from Nashua about that. </PARA>
<PARA> All Nashua did, from the indications, was to come in and say, `Look, we made an error; we overquoted'. I do not know why it did that, but I noticed in Mr Palywoda's response to the Minister that it was a `commercial mistake' or words to that effect. That is the sort of tough break one gets in business if one does something like that. It could well be that because the company had been tendering in the past it took the view that, `The Department will always take our tenders because they are in such great usage'. That could well have been the case. But someone came in and said, `Look, we missed out because we made a mistake'. At that time the company was not aware that maybe if there had been a different method of selection it would have been accepted. It came in and said, `We were offering you a cheaper price'. The Minister said, `Put it back on, subject to its new price meeting the criteria used in the assessment'. </PARA>
<PARA> All we are seeking is some advice. I say to the Minister that if there was no impropriety on his part-although any interference in the tender process amounts to impropriety-or ulterior motive as to why he did this, if he just swallowed a bit of pride and said, `Look, I shouldn't have done the damn thing; it was a mistake', we would accept it-not that I think it is something we should be awfully proud of, but there has to be a simple reason. We are trying to get to the bottom of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my comments to the specific remarks made by Senator Bolkus concerning the four pages signed by Mr Palywoda on 6 May and those parts of the document that he referred to. Senator Bolkus cited parts of this document when trying to rebut some of the propositions I had put to him about the manner in which this whole matter has been conducted. I refer him to the part that he quoted, namely, the options section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First and foremost, it is most important to point out that in my copy, which is the sanitised version, that section called `legal position', which presumably made statements about liability, has all been deleted. It is significant that the options section follows upon the legal position. As we read it as a whole as distinct from selectively, which is the way the Minister read it, it is interesting that in fact the document draws no conclusions. Far from putting a plain and simple case, the paper says that there are three options. Option (i) is the status quo and it defines the status quo as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> confirm the existing arrangement and accept the judgments made in the initial evaluation notwithstanding that the evaluation methodology was not made explicit to tenders in to the RFT. There is no evidence to suggest that there was any bias towards any particular tender in the `basket approach' used. Within that approach, all tenderers were treated in an even-handed and consistent manner . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Option (ii) is to:</PARA>
<PARA> cancel the standing offer and call for fresh tenders as the evaluation methodology was not clearly spelt out to potential bidders in advance and this may-</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress the word `may'-</PARA>
<PARA> have affected the way they tendered . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that so much of these reports are written using the subjunctive, which always implies doubt. That is why one uses the subjunctive. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) add to the existing panel of suppliers all firms who, on a price basis, were in the `top 8', for each product item but who by the application of the `basket approach' evaluation were excluded from the panel of suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus, in dealing with the remainder of this letter from Mr Palywoda, states that Mr Palywoda made a choice in favour of one of these options. In fact he does not. Of the first option, he says, `Maintaining the status quo is not appropriate'. He says, and this is what the Minister quoted:</PARA>
<PARA>Our review has pointed to some major deficiencies in the process. Whilst there is no suggestion of bias in the process, by not deciding and notifying in advance the criteria to be used and the relative weights that might be applied in the evaluation, potential bidders did not know clearly and consistently how the evaluation process was to be conducted. This could-</PARA>
<PARA>again, use of the subjunctive-</PARA>
<PARA>have affected their price offering. Furthermore, the application of the `basket approach' does not give best `value for money' in every case. </PARA>
<PARA>`Does not give best value for money' qualified by `in every case'. If we go back to the guidelines, we have already established that the question of best price is the test that should not be applied exclusively, only if there is good reason not to so do. We have not seen any good reasons. But option 2 is interesting. Option 2, so says Mr Palywoda:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . has the advantage of putting all tenderers on an even footing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty fair. </PARA>
<PARA>They can re-tender in the clear knowledge of the evaluation criteria and the relative weights to be applied. It entails a cost not only to DAS but also to the industry. An indicative cost in re-tendering is $270,000. </PARA>
<PARA>One might say that the integrity of the entire process is worth $270,000, if that is to be the reason that it is rejected. He goes on to list what the disadvantages are-namely, that it would cost money, and that:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also likely to lead to representations from suppliers currently on contract who might argue that the original tender evaluation treated all suppliers in an even-handed and consistent manner notwithstanding the evaluation criteria was not published. They might also argue that we have re-opened the process under pressure-</PARA>
<PARA>under pressure-</PARA>
<PARA>from an unsuccessful tenderer which runs against traditional high standards of fair dealing and probity; cornerstones of Government purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Minister's own report. This is the one that he said is the basis for his decision. To accept that he would reject reopening the tender, they are saying, could be argued that he would not be having fair dealing and probity. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Option 3 has the advantage of quickly rectifying-</PARA>
<PARA>quickly rectifying-</PARA>
<PARA>the identified weaknesses . . . without imposing additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are putting a price on integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>It increases the complexity of the arrangements for end users but it does give them a wider choice of suppliers. Like option 2 it has the disadvantage of inviting complaints from suppliers on the current panel who might argue that adding additional suppliers reduces the value of the contract to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Far from making any recommendation, Mr Palywoda says:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the complex issues involved and the sensitivity of this contract, arrangements have been made for you to discuss this matter with the Secretary, Mr Hillier, Mr McAlister and myself today at 4 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA>That is on 6 May. For the Minister to say that that document in any way, shape or form is the basis for the action that he took is simply misleading people. Clearly it leaves the option open to the Minister, and the decision presumably was made by him. In that context, why will the Minister not release the letter that was originally written to him from Nashua Australia Pty Ltd?</PARA>
<PARA> Why can we not have the complete picture? Why can we not have all the facts? What is there to hide? If the Minister stands yet again and tells me it is commercial-in-confidence, he will pardon the Australian public from having a degree of cynicism. The fact of the matter is that the Minister had an option. He could have reopened the tendering process if he found that on balance-and I go back to the substance of the report-the violence against probity and equity was such as to outweigh the integrity of the tendering process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has never put a case which says that is what he considers the proposition to be. The Minister has simply said, `I chose to do what I chose to do and I would do it again'. It is no answer to keep repeating something which is not accepted, not just by us but also by the industry as a whole and by ordinary Australian taxpayers. It will not do. Could the Minister tell me why he will not table the letter that was written to him by Nashua?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had a meeting with the Secretary, Mr Hillier, Mr McAlister and Mr Palywoda. If Senator Bishop really wants to know who advised me what, the first three gentlemen advised me to do what I finally did, on those grounds that I spelt out in my answer in this place on the first occasion. In respect to Mr Palywoda, it is fair to say-and I have his permission to say it-he was more inclined to cancel the standing offer and call for fresh tenders. The senior officers who gave the advice were: the Secretary, the General Manager, Supply and Distribution and the Executive General Manager, Sales and Services Program. The latter two people, together with the Secretary, had a very firm view of what I should do, and that was the advice that I took.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. I think that is important because if I were looking at this question, the sort of legal advice that might be contained in this document would have been that, if the tender had been cancelled, the Commonwealth could have been rendered liable in damages for negligence. The Minister, in fact, could have exposed the Commonwealth to more or less than the $270,000, which is the figure that is cited as a cost that was incurred with regard to option (ii). What option (ii) does not say is whether or not that figure is an assessment of the likelihood of a settlement that might ensue. So the Minister, by saying to us that he was advised in that meeting that the best option for him was to add people into the contract does not really canvass the whole picture, the whole truth. The reason for that advice could well have been because otherwise the Minister and his Department would expose the taxpayer to a greater expenditure by reason of negligence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The paragraph where the $270,000 figure is mentioned says that an indicative cost in retendering is $270,000. That would have been the cost to industry of going through a new tendering process, some small part of that cost I think being incurred by the Department. That was a consideration that was taken into account. What we have done is in accordance with the legal advice and that advice is that we are not liable for anything because of the change in the process. Let me also say a better understanding of this contract, the nature of it, and what it means by way of common use contract, is quite important when one makes a legal assessment of one's liability. As I say, we have acted on advice that we would not be liable.</PARA></TALK.START>

He personally is responsible and he did not know. He did not even know what the word `publishing' in this context means. The guidelines are not subject to tabling and disallowance. They are not subject to being published in the general sense. They are available to officers who have the authority to publish in the Minister's Department; officers on whom that is devolved.

We have attempted at great length to find out from the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) why he intervened in a contract some time after it had been let. He has consistently refused to give a direct answer to those questions. He does refer to subsequent events but, from his own letter, he intervened in a contract at the time because he believed the tenderer had put in a price which, at that time, militated against the tenderer because it was too high. He has refused to table a letter from Nashua Australia Pty Ltd which may well clear up the matter. He leaves in our minds a serious doubt as to the motives for that intervention.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall give the example of the student who came to see me. He is a full time university student. He is married, and his wife was earning the $18,150. The limit was decreased to $12,150, which meant that he was no longer eligible for Austudy. He compared himself to a friend of his whose parents were on an income of $18,150 and the limit for whom went up to $19,350. He asked me about the justice of the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other aspect of the answer is that, in respect of a spouse situation, it would be expected that one person who would have reliance on the spouse's income, that is, the other spouse, while in relation to a family situation it is quite probable that there would be more than one student with some reliance on the family income. Senator Walters can shake her head, but she has asked for the rationale and I have given it to her. She may disagree with it-and I expect that she does-but that is the rationale. In the case of parents it is likely that there will be more than one student dependent on the income. That is why the adjustment was made-to be more beneficial there.</PARA></TALK.START>

I asked the Department for details of the basis on which the Department of Employment, Education and Training acted to abort the Department of Defence overseas recruitment program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to item 32, entitled engineering recruitment from abroad. It is dealt with on page 72 of the Hansard for Estimates Committee D. In the answer I was told that the Department of Employment, Education and Training had not advised the Department of Defence that it could not recruit overseas. According to the answer, DEET did not become involved in this matter of the recruitment of engineers until 2 January 1991. At that stage DEET was invited to discuss a possible labour agreement with the Department of Defence on the entry of British engineers. The answer went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>

Can the Minister provide information about the availability and the qualifications of engineers in Australia in relation to the requirements of the Department of Defence? For instance, are there courses already existing in Australia which could produce suitably qualified engineers for the purposes of the Department of Defence and, if not, are there any proposals to establish courses so that costly recruiting programs from overseas might be avoided?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will move on to another item. Under the item entitled `General Matters' in the report of Estimates Committee D there is reference to points raised about the scope of questioning in Additional Estimates. Senator Kemp referred to this item in the report last Thursday, but I want to take the matter further. The Minister kept referring to Standing Orders to confine questioning of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to only those specific items included in the Additional Estimates and to preclude general questions. The report of Estimates Committee D notes that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The conduct of hearings, so far as questioning is concerned, is governed more by convention than by Standing Orders, which are silent on the distinction between questions permitted when the main Appropriation Bills are being examined and those permitted in the additional Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Minister was making a very clear distinction between Budget Estimates and Additional Estimates. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>You know the rules of the game and I am sorry that is the way we have got to play it. Estimates committees-</PARA>
<PARA>I take it that he meant Budget Estimates-</PARA>
<PARA>are different. At Estimates committees you can go through, as I have gone through, and ask whatever you like on the whole portfolio. This is Additional Estimates, and we know that the Standing Orders provide for specific questions. </PARA>
<PARA>However, that is not correct. The Standing Orders make absolutely no distinction between Budget Estimates and Additional Estimates. In the hearing, I placed it on record that the Minister was allowing a very narrow range of latitude in questioning. There came a stage during the hearing when Senator Teague requested an adjournment to a private meeting to reach a compromise with the Minister over the scope of questioning, but some members of the Committee continued to express concerns about the Minister's restrictions on the Committee's questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because the report concluded that the Senate should provide clarification on the scope of questions to be permitted at Additional Estimates, bearing in mind that there is no distinction in the Standing Orders between annual Estimates and Additional Estimates. I ask the Minister to explain why he kept referring to Standing Orders to insist upon a distinction between annual Estimates and Additional Estimates when the Standing Orders clearly make no such distinction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did refer to Standing Orders. If one goes back to the Hansard of that day, one will find that I even alluded to some specific standing orders. The basic point is that we are considering Additional Estimates and, by their very definition, we are looking at the additional estimates of departments. As a consequence, we would be looking at those extra expenditure items. When one compares that with Estimates, the distinction is quite clear. I did allude to specific standing orders during the discussions at the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made the point before that I am not the only person who has held this view. There was, apparently, in Estimates Committee A on 16 April a similar dispute when the Chairman of that Committee came down the wrong way and allowed a greater degree of latitude than what I think should have been the case. Senator Bishop raised the point that I raised at our Committee. For the record I quote what she said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chairman, with respect, Senator Schacht just asked the Clerk whether this was being paid out of the Additional Estimates. He answered that, no, it was coming out of existing appropriations. Therefore, presumably it is not relevant to this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same point of order, Senator Walsh interjected. As I say, I share Senator Bishop's view on the reading of the guidelines that should control Additional Estimates and, in doing so, reject the position that was adopted in Estimates A which allows a broader area of examination. </PARA>

There is latitude given, but the point I think perhaps the honourable senator is missing is that on this occasion we have before us only the supplementary appropriations. When we meet for the full Estimates we have the total appropriations before us. On this occasion the supplementary appropriations contain only a range of issues, unlike the full appropriations which contain every issue that you can possibly imagine within all of the portfolios.

Standing order 26 (1) says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Subclause (1). Let us have a look at 26 (2). It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The annual estimates, contained in the documents presenting the particulars of proposed expenditure, and the additional estimates, contained in the documents presenting the particulars of proposed provision for additional expenditure, shall on motion be referred to the Committees for examination and report. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that when we have the Budget Estimates we have before us estimates for virtually every part of each department. I suppose the only reason why we would not have any estimates would be if a particular program had stopped and was no longer in existence so there would not be any proposed expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is what the Minister was probably getting at-he will probably indicate to me if I am wrong. Because in the annual Estimates we have estimates for all parts of the departments-because every part of the departments are getting expenditure-it is very easy to range wide in one's questions. But when we come to the additional expenditure that is normally needed at about this time of the year, we are talking about Additional Estimates. Not every part of the departments require additional expenditure. Although I have never seen it, one might find one department which does not require any additional expenditure at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support Senator Tierney and, in particular, oppose the limited view of the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, who is not only the duty Minister here in the Senate, but who was also the active Minister in Estimates Committee D. I believe he has been more restrictive than any other Minister of this Labor Government. None of his colleagues in the Ministry has given the kind of limited guidelines that he gave to Senate Estimates Committee D on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I strongly oppose Senator Bolkus in his rulings and the way in which he conducted himself in this Committee. The Committee retired and on this occasion-and I support Senator Tierney in these remarks-we differed from the Minister. It is the closest we have come to a motion of no confidence in a Minister conducting Estimates committees. The Minister is a senator for my home State of South Australia. He is also a left wing Minister who happens to be a supporter of the present Government and I think he supported Prime Minister Hawke in this present situation. Despite what Senator Colston says, I do not believe these points of loyalty on the Minister's behalf are consistent with the Standing Orders which I have in front of me. </PARA>
<PARA> The publication Standing Orders and Other Orders of the Senate which is before me has been quoted from by Senator Colston at subsections (1) and (2), but I wish to quote it at subsection (12). Subsection (12) says:</PARA>
<PARA>When a Committee considers the estimates, the Chairman shall-</PARA>
<PARA>in this case the Chairman was Senator Zakharov-</PARA>
<PARA>without motion, call on items of expenditure in the order decided upon and declare the proposed expenditure open for examination. </PARA>
<PARA>When standing order 26(12) says `declare the proposed expenditure open for examination'-and I believe that is the form that honourable senators have been used to over the last decade at least-it means that we can ask any question under the first item which relates to expenditure for salaries and other direct expenditures of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp and Senator Tierney have rightly said that this is without limits. I believe that it is appropriate that, under standing order 26 (12), which is on Estimates committees, questions are not restricted in the way that Senator Bolkus idiosyncratically, subjectively and quite singularly has ruled in his conduct of that Committee. I believe that this is a matter of importance not only for this present temporary period of the Labor Government but also for us when we are in government. We should see honourable senators of this chamber being able to ask questions on any matter. It is a quite important matter, and I think Senator Tierney is correct when he says that we should be able to ask a question that relates to the expenditure of government moneys under Additional Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, Senator Bolkus, when he was in Estimates Committee D, gave a limited meaning to the questions that we were able to be asked in the Committee. It was the first time in 26 Estimates committees that I had experienced this kind of limitation. When a new honourable senator, Senator Tierney, rightly interpreting the Standing Orders, said that he could ask any question, he was restricted by the Minister in the Estimates Committee. I believe that Senator Tierney was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say that this is a matter of importance to the Senate as a whole because we ought to be able to ask questions that relate to the decisions of this Government at a time when the Senate is interested in examining the expenditure of the Government of the day. I quote subclause (12) again:</PARA>
<PARA>When a Committee considers the estimates, the Chairman shall, without motion, call on items of expenditure in the order decided upon and declare the proposed expenditure open for examination. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no limitation on that question, and I would like the Committee of the Whole to rule that it is appropriate in the Additional Estimates for questions to be put on any matter that is of concern to an honourable senator. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the specific matter is in fact far more significant than the matter I raised the other night. I draw your attention to page 16 of the explanatory notes for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, relating to running costs. That deals with an item of $715,700 not allocated to function and not allocated to program. The attitude of the Minister for Administrative Services in Senate Estimates means that we are precluded from raising the expenditure of almost three-quarters of a million dollars in Senate Estimates because of this Minister's determination to limit the rights of honourable senators to ask questions. That is absolutely intolerable. That goes across the whole range of the activities of the Department of Administrative Services. It relates in this case to salary increases. In other words, there were additional funding requirements for elements of this Department that this Minister sought to prevent us from asking questions about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very determined and insistent on this point because, when I raised it the other day with you, it related to a much smaller item.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the Department of Industrial Relations in a relatively brief manner. I refer to the report of Estimates Committee F to this chamber with particular regard to the reference which was made to the inquiry into and detailed examination by the Estimates Committee of the annual report of the Department of Industrial Relations, particularly the examination in committee of the relationship between the Department's portfolio mission statement and the various performance standards and indicators for each program area. While it would be fair to say that in examination of the Department we accepted that there were some difficulties in developing various measures of effectiveness with regard to performance standards in the Department, it is still important to place on record my particular disappointment with the standard of the Department's annual report and what would appear to be a somewhat contemptuous attitude by it to the processes of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the Committee hearings, I believe that the report of the Department is inadequate in terms of giving an explanation of the Department's focus, direction and accomplishments for the past year and that the mission statement itself represents little more than a litany of glib motherhood statements and optimistic ideals. Each of the five points referred to in that mission statement really lacks substance when analysed in any detail. They are little more than nice, calming comments which might look very attractive and appealing for the uninitiated but offer little more than dogma. I believe that the Department ought to offer us better than it has in that annual report. The report generally lacks both specific and concrete explanations and background information. For a department the mission of which is to achieve its industrial relations and wider economic and social objectives, I believe that the report is completely inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Committee hearings, the Deputy Secretary of the Department, Mr Bob Marshman, when questioned on the report's mission statement, did not even have a copy available to refer to. I believe that it is somewhat extraordinary for a public servant of Mr Marshman's seniority and experience in the processes of Senate Estimates hearings-a deputy secretary of his level and an old and experienced hand with regard to Estimates committees-not to have such a document available. It simply reinforces what I regard as the inadequate attitude of this Department to the parliamentary processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that at the hearings the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, remarked that he was disappointed that I found a lack of substance in the Department's report because he regarded it as adequate. As he saw it, it set out the functions and duties of the portfolio. I suppose that one would expect that sort of comment from the Minister. It is his duty to defend his portfolio, but I believe, as I said earlier, that it is important that this Department make a better effort in terms of its annual reports in the future. I contrast that example-as I will later when we move on-with what I regard as a very comprehensive and adequate report from the Department of Transport and Communications. A comparison of the reports of those two departments, both of which were examined by Estimates Committee F, serves to underline the shortcomings in the report that has been put out by the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue I raised, again in relation to the annual report and the mission statement, was the statement in the report to the effect that it was the role of the Department to ensure a fair wages outcome. When asked what was meant by a fair wages outcome, I again do not believe that the officers of the Department were able to answer the question. But the Minister intervened to the effect that fair wages were those determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In other words, the Department and the Government assume that wage determinations made only by the Industrial Relations Commission are fair and equitable. Therefore, they in effect claim or assert that wages determined in any other manner are not fair. Wages determined by genuine enterprise bargaining, by voluntary agreements entered into by employers and employees, by definition of this Department, are not fair outcomes in terms of wages and conditions. I strongly contest that contention. I say in conclusion that, if that is the modus operandi for this Department, it will have a lot to learn within the next couple of years when it has to serve a future coalition government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to clarify that. The point I raise in terms of the report-it is along similar lines to that made by Senator Chapman-is that the industrial relations report left a lot to be desired, particularly in terms of the detail that I believe is required for us to make a reasonable assessment. I want to talk about the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, its functions and its cost, as I did at the Estimates Committee hearing. I mention the lack of accountability in terms of the various functions that the Industrial Relations Commission has carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was quite obvious from the questions that I and other senators asked that the Department of Industrial Relations had no idea, and nor did the Minister himself-although in fairness I think he was somewhat surprised about this-about the costs associated with the various hearings and functions of the Commission. I found this quite extraordinary, particularly when we look at the Commission's budget and see that this year the costs have increased by 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I put some questions on notice-and I am now preparing a list for inclusion in a letter-about the cost of some of the hearings and functions being carried out by the Industrial Relations Commission. I put it to Senator McMullan, who is at the table in the absence of Senator Cook, that the Commission, in performing its functions, should be able to identify the various costs in the different processes which it goes through. I will proceed with those questions in detail in the letter which I have not completed yet. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I refer to the Harrison inquiry and I ask: what has been the cost of that inquiry? After that inquiry had almost completed its task-I understand from Commissioner Harrison that there were only three days of hearings left to go-we found that both the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union walked out of the inquiry. This inquiry, in fact, came about at the request of the ACTU to endeavour to find a process by which the problems in the meat industry in this country could be overcome. I intend to finalise my further questions in writing. However, can the Minister give us some advice now as to the cost of the Harrison inquiry? It would certainly appear that the hearing could have been sabotaged and it might well turn out to have cost an enormous amount of money. There was even an overseas trip to examine what occurs in the meat industry in other countries, such as killing charges, processing and all the other things that go with it, although the situation which exists in other countries is well known and well documented here in Australia. So it was not necessary, in terms of formulating what we hoped would come out of that inquiry, for that cost to accrue. Can the Minister give us some idea of the cost of the Harrison inquiry to this point?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before responding to that question, I indicate that there are some things I want to say in response to Senator Chapman's and Senator Crane's more general remarks, but I will do that in one go at the end after everybody has raised individual matters. I do not have a particular costing with regard to the Harrison inquiry. I was aware that Senator Crane raised the cost breakdown issue generally during the Estimates Committee hearing and that we were expecting more detailed questions to be forwarded from him-to which he just referred. It is not going to be an easy process of disaggregation because there are some fixed costs involved in maintaining an industrial relations commission. The question of effectively apportioning them to individual proceedings is going to require some division between fixed costs and the marginal costs added by extra functions. There will be a need for some disaggregation and that will not be straightforward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one other general remark about the cost breakdowns of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, just to put on the record for the Committee of the Whole that which I am sure Senator Crane is already aware of but which needs to be stated to make the answer comprehensive. The Industrial Relations Commission is an independent statutory body. Its administrative wing, the Australian Industrial Registry, is based in Melbourne and issues its own annual report. This is a separate document from the annual report of the Department of Industrial Relations. We need to bear in mind that that is a separate statutory authority with its own reporting arrangements. With regard to the Harrison inquiry, I will get some information for the honourable senator if I reasonably can but, as he would be aware, the officers are not here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McMullan for that answer. I understand that the officers are not here so I am not seeking details. I fully understand that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is a separate statutory authority but, in terms of preparing its annual report and its costings, the Commission should have to go into the same sort of detail and provide the same sort of information that other statutory authorities provide, so that when one looks at the annual report one can ascertain in much more detail where the money is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, when one looks at the annual reports of many other statutory authorities, one can identify, within reason-and I am not asking for every cent to be identified-where the money has gone. One can certainly identify the individual functions to which that money has gone. It is very important for there to be an undertaking that in future the way in which the money is spent in the operation of the Commission will be identified with the various hearings and functions that it carries out. I make the point that there are some incremental costs or overheads which go across the full spectrum. But I believe that there has to be capacity, in terms of integrity and accountability, for a much better financial reporting system for the Commission. </PARA>

But the Government is still unable to provide the answers to those questions on the basis that it is not the responsibility of this Department to monitor those salaries. In fact, as I pointed out in those hearings, it is the responsibility of the various government business enterprises to advise the Remuneration Tribunal of their intentions with regard to executive salaries, and of course the Remuneration Tribunal comes within the responsibility of this Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this Department has information with regard to the salary packages paid to executives in government business enterprises and is, therefore, obligated to make that information available to this Committee on request. This is even more important now with the introduction of performance pay for Senior Executive Service officers. So I would urge the Government to ensure that, if not immediately but certainly by the time of the next Estimates Committee hearings, I can be provided with that information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to respond briefly to the comments of Senator Crane and Senator Chapman. I indicate firstly, to follow on from that which Senator Crane said earlier and subsequently, that the Government is not resisting the general question that the Industrial Relations Commission has to be accountable in its expenditure and ought to report as comprehensively and in as detailed a manner as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In every area of accountability there is a balance between the comprehensiveness of the information for the purpose of accountability and the cost of compiling and providing that information. There is, on each occasion, a balance that has to be struck and there will be a balance that has to be struck again. But as a matter of general principle we do not challenge the requirement that it should be accountable as are other bodies which spend the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add to my previous remarks about the Harrison inquiry to indicate that it is a very atypical example-a special case. The inquiry is essentially comprised only of Commissioner Greg Harrison, who is doing the work as an addition to that of his own panel of industries for which he is responsible as a commissioner. I provide that piece of information for the record. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the question of executive remuneration, we do have devolution, which means that the reporting requirements of government business enterprises are those required of comparable private sector business enterprises in terms of the disclosure required by the Companies Act. Those disclosures are provided in the same form, in that tabular form, and they will continue to be provided in that way. That seems to me to be the appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to respond briefly to the more generalised critique. Certainly to the extent I have had a chance to study the papers of the Committee, I shared the general view that the question of performance standards and indicators is important across the whole of the public sector. If the Committee was unanimously of the view that there needs to be more effort in developing more effective measures of outcomes as opposed to measures of activity, I point out that it is more difficult for a department of this type, but in general that is in keeping with the trend in public sector reform. I do not have an argument with it. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to temper that, what seems on the face of it to be a very proper recommendation, with a recognition of the quality and quantity of the work done by the officers in their Department. I would not want the record to indicate that the criticisms that have been made-some of which may well have some element of merit in them-are the only views that are held in the Senate about either the quality or the quantity of the work provided by very many of the excellent officers working on behalf of the taxpayers in that Department. </PARA>

This again was a follow-up from questions that were asked in the Estimates Committee in the Budget session last year about the difficulty which a number of land-holders were having in obtaining access to the scheme because at that stage the full details had not been finalised and because the requirement to have the scheme approved by a designated officer meant that there was difficulty in obtaining the time from those designated officers in order to gain approval.</PARA></TALK.START>

Why can we not have what occurs in other areas-self assessment for taxation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Minister recognise the difficulty involved in getting people who have more expertise and knowledge about the situation than the farmer himself? The plan is being designed and set up for what are essentially conservation purposes to minimise, as far as one can, land degradation, which is in everybody's interests. Why do we have to set up a group of people around the country, in an area where there is an enormous lack of expertise? Would such people be any better or have more expertise than the individual farmer in designing and planning, whether it be for contour banks or putting in trees or whatever, to perform a water drainage function?</PARA>
<PARA> Why do we have to go past the planning expertise of the farmer and have other people giving that particular plan a tick or a signature, when it is most unlikely that very many of those giving that signature would have as much knowledge of the property and its requirements as the farmer or the land user himself?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are, in the administration of tax and tax concessions, always the competing pressures of ensuring that the requirements of the law are properly being complied with and that the concession is being used for the purpose for which it was originally intended on the one hand and, on the other, the benefit that essentially flows from the move to self-assessment across the Income Tax Act as a whole, which says that we do not want unreasonably to put requirements on taxpayers to have to undergo expense or difficulty in discharging their obligation. How the balance is struck on every occasion is always a matter for judgment. But I would have thought that in this area there was a second element, without straining my limited expertise in this area and consistent with what I said to Senator Chapman about moving towards what I think will be an agreed and modified position, and there is also--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is also the distinct possibility in these sorts of circumstances that some farmers at least will gain significant benefit from the advice or what I guess at least can be called a second opinion. Many farmers do have great expertise and they are perfectly entitled to prepare their farm plan for the purpose of the new tax arrangements but if claims are to be made for the cost of fencing to prevent that degradation, the plan will need to be approved by an authorised officer or consultant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That may not strike the balance perfectly and, even with the changes that are envisaged, we may need to make further modifications as it goes along. I think it is a move in the right direction. I think we are trying to strike the balance between protecting the revenue and not imposing unreasonable burdens on the taxpayers. We are trying also in discussions with interested parties and the Opposition to come to a workable arrangement balancing those two pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as it develops, we find we have not struck the balance as best we might, we will have to continue to look at it over time. I think at the moment, having had more experience from my own point of view in looking at this in comparison with other amendments to the Income Tax Act that we have made rather than come to it as one with a particular expertise about the issues to which this particular deduction relates, the balance does not seem to me to be unreasonable but we will certainly need to keep our eye on it as it develops.

I understand that what the Minister is getting at but I do not believe the practicality of the situation, which exists on the ground, is going to suffice. We have to go back to the Budget of last year, since this move was introduced. A farmer can prepare his own farm plan but he has to get it endorsed. In the case that currently exists in Western Australia in terms of this, there is a process for approving farm plans but he has to wait one, two, three years, or currently the provision can be up to five years, before he can get that plan endorsed. If he proceeds with it and it is endorsed sometime down the track after he has carried out some of the work which is involved in that particular farm plan, will, in fact, that work be accepted because it was done before the signature was placed on the approval of it as an acceptable farm plan?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that I think this is a matter better pursued in the debate about Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), not in the debate on the report of this Estimates Committee. We will be coming to that in the next week or so in the Senate, and I would be happy to enter into that discussion then, when more of these details will have been worked out and we will have a concrete proposal before us, and the implications of it will be able to be debated here in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Committee's attention to the issue that I raised in the Estimates Committee hearing on 18 April, the joint venture fishing operations from Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory. Anyone who takes an interest in the Hansard of 18 April will know that I specifically raised this matter with regard to the harvesting trepang and the venture being a cooperative one between the local Aboriginal interests of Groote Eylandt, the Kailis fishing enterprise which operates out of Bartalumba Bay on Groote Eylandt and a negotiated venture with Indonesian interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that this matter has been commented on, on page 7 of the report of Estimates Committee F and that some concern has been expressed by the Committee with regard to the ongoing management of such an important joint venture fishery arrangement. However, I am concerned that the question taken on notice and then answered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy appears to have been misinterpreted. My question was specifically with regard to the harvesting of trepang. The answer is in the context of the harvesting of trochus shell. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the issue can be clarified. The subsequent details given in the answer do, in fact, relate to trepang as opposed to trochus shell.The two are quite distinctly different, as I think anyone involved in fisheries would be well aware. Trochus shells, of course, are basically harvested, taken to various Asian places and are used primarily in the production of various paint products and have a different appeal whereas trepang, of course, is a delicacy particularly in the cuisine of many Asian areas. There is a great potential to develop the trepang industry out of Groote Eylandt. I am certainly aware from discussions that I have had recently on the island that the Aboriginal owners in the area are keen to pursue the joint venture arrangements. I am also aware that the Kailis fishing interests which have had a long association in that area are also keen to pursue the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> My first question is whether the specific answer that was given with regard to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service related to trepang as opposed to trochus and, secondly, I would ask what discussions the Department has had with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service which I understand has frustrated the development of this important joint venture arrangement between the Aboriginal people, the local fishing interests and the Indonesian interests, by insisting that a very detailed management fishery plan will have to be developed because of the nature of trepang harvesting. </PARA>
<PARA> From my discussions with officers of the fishing industry in the Northern Territory, and specifically with the Kailis operators at Groote Eylandt, I understand that the trepang proposed to be harvested is very common. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has included this particular common species in its list of endangered species and, therefore, it is precluding the issue of an appropriate fisheries licence by the Northern Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that there is a demonstrated market-I believe that Chinese buyers have shown an interest in taking some 40 tonnes a month-I am concerned that the answer given to me with regard to quarantine may, in fact, not be the correct one and that other agencies of the Federal Government are frustrating this important industry and project from getting off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there are other species of trepang that could more appropriately need to be protected. It is surprising that they are not listed on the Australian National Parks and Wildlife list of endangered species. I seek clarification that there is every intention to have this matter resolved quickly and promptly so that all interests can gain appropriate benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That point is not particularly relevant to the reason why-as Telecom explained, frankly, I think, very reasonably-there are three regional telephone books instead of one consolidated book. That is, principally, that the production of one consolidated book would require an additional 250 tonnes of paper to doing it in the way that it is currently done. Secondly, around half a million dollars in unnecessary expenditure would be incurred by doing it that way as well. Further to that, it provides a more convenient and less expensive service for advertisers to be able to target their advertising more appropriately to regional directories than to have to carry advertising in one single directory to cover almost the whole of the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, they are cogent reasons why it is sensible-both environmentally and economically-for Telecom to produce the books in the way it does. Further to that, Telecom has pointed out that, to the extent of the figures that Senator Panizza has just mentioned-that is, the 3 per cent crossover between the three directories-a free dial-in information service is, in any case, available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that answer. Information other than phone numbers is available in the book. As the Minister said, that service is free. I make the point in passing that those 260 tonnes of extra paper could probably be recycled for use at some other time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move on to the research results on the next page which just show how the questions are asked. There is a question on directory satisfaction which shows that the numbers of satisfied residential customers is 72 per cent, and business customers 51 per cent. I understand that the numbers are down on the business customers and nowhere near those of residential customers. That means that 49 per cent of customers are not satisfied. They certainly have not been taken into consideration very much. </PARA>
<PARA> In the bottom section there is a question on preference. The number of business customers who express a preference for one country phone book is 73 per cent, and it is 59 per cent of residential customers. Would the Minister agree with me that the preference of country business users and residential customers may not have been very well adhered to?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not agree. The reason I do not agree is that the research identified that the need for users and business users to have more than one regional telephone directory is understood. A service is provided and advertised by Telecom that allows these people to readily obtain copies of the telephone directories they require by accessing a free call to Telecom. I have to say that saving 260 tonnes of unnecessary paper, half a million dollars in unnecessary expenditure-the research demonstrates that there is only a small crossover between the books-and, in addition, providing a free service by providing additional books for whoever requires them, is a pretty responsible approach by Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to the National Rail Freight Corporation on which I asked a question at the time and put questions in writing. I asked various questions, and I will give the Minister a brief run-down of them. With less than three months to go before the promised starting date of the National Rail Freight Corporation, I asked what decisions had been made about the headquarters site, the chief executive and things such as signalling and shareholding. The answer at the time was that these matters would be subject to consideration by the Government, and further negotiations and meetings of the relevant Commonwealth and States transport Ministers in mid-June 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With what has been going on lately in two States the Minister probably has not had that meeting, but the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made certain announcements last year-and I certainly agree-that this venture with the National Rail Freight Corporation will provide a lot in improving rail transport. This will put rail in a much better competitive position next year. Could the Minister tell me what is going on at the present moment? I asked the Minister a question in this place about five weeks ago, and he told me that certain things had not been put in place but progression was at hand. Yet we were able to read what someone from an inquiry had to say to the National Farmers Federation which was, more or less, an outline of a program, and the Minister did not seem to know quite what was going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have nothing to add to the previous answers that I have given on this matter. The matter still revolves around-unsurprisingly, I might say-a disagreement between the Federal Government and the States as to the extent of the equity that each of those constituent parties to this agreement will contribute. It requires an agreement of all the governments to reach a conclusion in relation to national rail freight, and the current disagreement revolves around the amount of money that is going to be contributed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government remains committed to this extremely important initiative. But to get an agreement we must have the compliance of all the parties. The information that I provided to Senator Panizza still stands correct. A meeting is scheduled for this month to continue the process. It is a difficult process. I am sure that eventually it will be resolved. However, very largely it comes down to the question of the relative balance between the amounts of money to be contributed by the States and the amount of money that has been offered-that is, $150m-by the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA>What system of calculation does the Government use? What does it take into consideration in arriving at that figure? Later on I will be asking about the results of that inquiry. Does the Government take into consideration a fuel levy that is already paid, sales tax paid on a vehicle, sales tax paid on tyres, sales tax paid on oil and grease and licence fees already paid? Will those figures be taken into consideration in what is described by the Minister as a more equitable system of recovering costs?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, all of those costs will be taken into consideration. I say by way of explanation that the reason the matter has not yet been resolved is that the Government is responding positively to the representations that have been received from remote Australia. Indeed, a significant amount of lobbying has been going on. I have been personally involved in that, as has the Federal member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, and there have been some ineffectual efforts from outside the fence by Senator Tambling, who is waving at me across the chamber. More particularly, as a result of a commitment that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave to truck operators in Mount Isa, a meeting was recently convened which I attended, along with the Federal member for the Northern Territory and, I must say, a very effective group of industry lobbyists-whom Senator Tambling probably would have met, because a number of them were certainly present at the conference in Alice Springs that he attended-and representations were made to the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister gave commitments that those industry representatives would have an opportunity to become directly involved in the process by being involved in actual meetings of the officers' committee that is determining this issue now. He also gave an absolute commitment to them, which I think was repeated publicly-and the only confusion I have over this is that I certainly heard it publicly said, but I cannot recall whether it was by the Prime Minister himself or the representatives of that group, who would quite properly have made it public-that the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission's report at this point would not be proceeded with. In fact, I think the exact words he used were that they were history. I was there when that was said. He said that the Premiers Conference procedure would be taking over and research would be carried out, and that this group would continue to be consulted. I know that the process has not yet been concluded. The reason that it has not been concluded, I am thankful to say, is that the Government is responding positively to the representations from industry that it is continuing to receive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask the Minister a couple of questions on the same issue, relating specifically to the conference on the transport needs of people living in the remote and rural areas of Australia, which was held earlier this year and which both the Minister and I attended in Alice Springs. During the Estimates process I placed a question on notice asking when the report of that conference would be publicly released and whether a copy could be made available to the appropriate Senate Estimates Committee. The reply given to me in the Committee was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The report is scheduled to be publicly released by 31 May 1991 and will be available to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Why have we not yet received a copy of that report and, given that 31 May has now come and gone, why are delays being experienced? What issues will the report specifically address arising from the conference and will any special recommendations be made to the Government as part of the process that the Minister described in his answer to Senator Panizza? This is a most important issue for people living in the remote parts of Australia. I am glad to note the Minister's acknowledgment that the recommendations of the earlier Butcher report have been superseded by events. I also ask whether the Minister is in any position to indicate the likely increases. There were phenomenal increases proposed, particularly with regard to truck registration fees. I think the figures being bandied around at the time that the Butcher report came out were that a number of transport operators who would normally have been expected to pay about $4,000 per annum could be up for liabilities of between $60,000 and $70,000. If this matter is now being reviewed, is the Minister now able to indicate, as a result of the report that we were due to see on 31 May or any work going forward to the Premiers Conference or through the Department for this year's Budget, just how far in advance of the former registration fees or what proportion the increases are likely to be?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Tambling's first question is that the report will certainly be published. Its production is imminent; it is in the final stages of preparation. It involves coordination between two departments-my own Department and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy-and I am advised that it will be released very shortly and will certainly be made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to Senator Tambling's second question is no; I cannot give that information yet. Representations have been made by Senator Tambling, myself and others in this process, and I thought they were made very effectively by the industry group at the meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In remote Australia, a trucking company services particular clients on a regular basis almost exclusively over roads which would, without argument, not receive any particular benefit from any increased charges that might be paid by the truck operators that use them. Indeed, the principals of the companies that have made representations to us say that they do not realistically or reasonably expect-because of the very limited use that the roads have-that they would be massively upgraded. Indeed, that is not a demand that they are making. That is one problem with a universally imposed charge which is currently being reconsidered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the obvious point that the Inter-State Commission's report to the Government is precisely that; it is a report to the Government. It does not indicate Government policy. It is simply the result of what I think is fundamentally very good research by the Inter-State Commission, which has clearly raised problems in particular areas involving remote Australia which the Government, to its credit, is now giving very sympathetic consideration to. That consideration is not yet concluded, I am pleased to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the estimates for the Department of Transport and Communications, in contrast to my somewhat critical remarks with regard to the Department of Industrial Relations, I found the annual report of this Department a very good one, in terms of its attention to detail and the explanations given, its design and presentation and the relatively fair way in which it dealt with transport and communication issues. I commend the Department on its report. I hope that the Department of Industrial Relations will take a leaf out of this Department's book in the future when preparing its reports. However, there are a couple of issues I wish to raise with regard to questions that I left on notice with the Department which I consider have been answered completely inadequately subsequent to the hearings of the Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first was a question I asked in relation to the fringe benefits tax for various bodies under the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Communications. That question was to the effect:</PARA>
<PARA>What were the total sums paid in each of (a) 1988-89 and (b) 1989-90, in fringe benefits taxes by the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian National Line Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>AUSSAT Pty Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Airlines Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>ABC</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Motor Vehicle Certification Board</PARA>
<PARA>Australian National Railways Commission</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Postal Corporation (Australia Post)</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Road Freight Transport Advisory Council</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Telecommunications Authority (AUSTEL)</PARA>
<PARA>Telecom</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Transport Advisory Council</PARA>
<PARA>Broadcasting Council</PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Authority</PARA>
<PARA>Federal Airports Corporation</PARA>
<PARA>Independent Airfares Committee</PARA>
<PARA>Inter-State Commission</PARA>
<PARA>Maritime Services Advisory Committee</PARA>
<PARA>OTC Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>Promotions and Appeals Boards of the Department of Communications</PARA>
<PARA>Qantas</PARA>
<PARA>Railway Industry Council</PARA>
<PARA>SBS</PARA>
<PARA>Transport Industries Advisory Council</PARA>
<PARA>The written reply I received to that question referred to an apparently similar question which had been asked by a colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Rocher. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley a similar question in the House of Representatives on 19 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>It then simply reproduced Mr Beazley's answer which was to the effect:</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the Honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The total FBT payments made on behalf of all State Offices and Central Office for the Department of Transport and Communications was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 1988-89 $A217,438.97;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 1989-90 $A219,130.98. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not prepared to ask statutory and other bodies under my portfolio responsibility to commit the resources to obtaining the information requested, particularly when the information is regarded as ``Commercial-in-Confidence'' for those bodies involved in commercial activities. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard that response as totally inadequate. It is a legitimate question for this Estimates Committee to ask the Minister and the Department the specific details of fringe benefits tax paid by authorities within the control of the Department. Certainly, the Australian Taxation Office requires similar information from every other commercial operation in the country. I believe the responsibilities which this Estimates Committee has to fulfil require that a question such as this be answered. I ask the Minister whether he will provide an answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I want to raise is this: I asked a question about the funding of share dealings of Qantas Airways Ltd, particularly its purchase and the purchase of other commercial bodies of shares in Air New Zealand. I have received the answer to that question only in the past 24 hours. I have not had the opportunity to do any further investigation of the answer. In respect of the answers that were provided, in each case the answer was annotated as provided by Qantas. I wonder whether that indicates that the Department itself has some reservations as to the satisfactory nature of the answers provided in that it was not prepared to put its own imprimatur on those answers and whether some additional information might be forthcoming in the future in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I answer that question, I will provide some additional information to Senator Tambling in respect of his previous question, which I am sure he will be pleased about, which I did not know about. In respect of the consultation issue, which I recall very vividly was raised at the Alice Springs conference by the road transport industry in the Northern Territory, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) responded, prior to the release of the report, positively to that issue being raised at the Alice Springs conference and has appointed Jim Cooper, who Senator Tambling knows, from the Northern Territory to the Australian Transport Advisory Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have examined the answer provided to the question on notice by Senator Chapman and I can add nothing to it at this point. The information is indeed as Senator Chapman has described it, with the aggregate amounts given.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to move to a series of questions that I asked with regard to the Auditor-General's report. These relate, firstly, to the reporting functions of the fixed assets of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), the audit of the Civil Aviation Authority's Treasury activities and also control over flight records after the Auditor-General had identified problems in the levying of aviation charges. I must say that the answers I have been given are, at best, very general. I guess they might cover a fairly broad area. In view of these answers-and I note that the Auditor-General was somewhat critical of the reporting functions of a number of these authorities-I ask what action has been taken by the Government in terms of making sure that their reporting functions are improved and that there is more detail provided? I would particularly like to draw attention to that part of the Auditor-General's report which identifies the problems in the levying of aviation charges where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The problem of missing flights is being addressed by greater emphasis in the Avcharges Centre . . . </PARA>

Could I have an explanation in the answer to the general question I asked as to why that is difficult, because it seems to me that it should be a fairly straightforward bookkeeping exercise?</PARA>

The whole process of the report and recommendations of the Inter-State Commission has been taken over to some extent by the process of the Special Premiers Conference, which was an initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and was taken up by the Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That matter is still under way but, irrespective of arguments about equity-about money, for example, that is to go into the national rail freight system-or about charges that are to be levied under the system for uniform registration, there remains a commitment to the early establishment of a uniform national code of regulation. But it is still subject to the process of the Special Premiers Conference, and that process, as I say, is currently responding to representations it is continuing to receive, now directly, from industry. </PARA>

Thus, I refer to the questions that I asked specifically concerning baggage handling equipment at Sydney Airport.

There are five questions, but the date that the contract was awarded is not in the response. I will see whether I can find that information. With respect, might I say that the position, as I reiterated at the Committee and as I do so again now, is that the Federal Airports Corporation is a body which has its own commercial charter and which conducts its business in terms of whom it awards its-Senator Bishop is shaking her head.

I must say that this approach stands in stark contrast to the attitude that has been demonstrated with some particular virulence on the Opposition benches for some weeks with respect to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and the outrageous hide he had, presumably, in intervening on behalf of Australian companies. Presumably, Senator Bishop is now demanding to know why I did not do the same, having complained about it with respect to Senator Bolkus.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was intending to refer to those discussions that we had earlier and to be absolutely consistent in the attitude that I have.

<PARA> In this case I intend to ask whether or not the Federal Airports Corporation followed the procurement guidelines. Despite the fact that there is a tendency by this Government to push operations off-budget, whilst it is in the public sector and it is public money it is accountable to this Parliament. If the Minister wants to push it off-budget totally, then he should privatise it. Until such time as he does, it is still in the public arena and as such accountable here. What was the method of procurement that was used? Did the team that determined that method of procurement follow the ANZ Bank's procurement guidelines?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Bishop's assertion, this is public money and properly subject to these processes. As Senator Bishop knows full well, it is certainly appropriate to examine this matter in the full Estimates process, but it is not appropriate-it was done only out of courtesy to Senator Bishop; I was chided for it during the Committee hearings by the Chairman of the Committee-to have officers present, at considerable expense and inconvenience, of organisations for which there is no appropriation whatever in the supplementary Estimates. I simply make that point; there is none. That also includes the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I perhaps will have to take a different view on this in the future, in the sense that a number of newspaper articles were recently published, which frankly I agreed with, expressing what was considered to be a scandalous procedure in terms of the Estimates Committee procedures of this Senate.

<PARA> In response to Senator Bishop's rage about going overseas, these baggage systems are in the process of enormous recent technological change. The bar codes and the kind of equipment being provided internationally is state of the art. Indeed many airports around the world-I understand currently only three or four in the United States; that is how new it is-are installing this kind of equipment. The bar code systems are not simply important for shifting the bags, the principal concern these days in providing this kind of technology is security. It was entirely appropriate to send an officer to examine systems in place overseas, which currently do not exist in any airport in Australia, of the state of the art equipment the FAC is planning to install at the new international terminal at Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I have looked at the answers given to the questions without notice raised by Senator Bishop during the Estimates Committee hearing and I am perfectly satisfied with the detail provided. At this stage we cannot ascertain the date on which the contract was awarded; I do not imagine the world hangs on that, but we will certainly obtain that information. However, the rest of the information provided for the remainder of the questions the honourable senator actually asked is more than adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I asked the date is fairly simple: did Mr Charlton go overseas to inspect these baggage handling systems, which I might add had been in existence overseas for years, before or after the contract was awarded? Was he part of the evaluation of the tender? If so, what expertise did he have to exercise in evaluation if he had never seen such things in operation? That is the point of the date of the contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We can then go to the question of subcontracts. It was only when I received these answers that we knew that the awarding of the subcontract worth $1.3m, not to the Australian company which tendered for $1m, was a question not for the Federal Airports Corporation but for the prime contractor. Fairly legitimately I am interested to know these salient points. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 April 1991, a number of unanswered questions were incorporated by the Committee in its report. Those questions had been on notice for some considerable time to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). However, the answers were subsequently given to me. One question raised the issue of the new airport facilities at both the Darwin and Alice Springs terminals. I asked a four-point question which related to: the construction timetables and the proposed expenditure; timetable dates; details with regard to the redesign of each of the projects and any financial variations; and specifically, in part four, what proportion of subcontracts in respect of Darwin and Alice Springs airports for supply, services and labour have been let to contractors-suppliers outside the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Information was provided with regard to both Darwin and Alice Springs airports independently. I note that most of the information provided related to structural matters such as steelwork, aerobridges, baggage handling, electrical services and a number of similar-type contracts. I am concerned that one of the issues not addressed by the Federal Airports Corporation relates to the provision of what could probably be described as artworks in both of those new airport terminals. I have pursued this matter independently with the Federal Airports Corporation for some months. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago, I was advised by the Manager of the Federal Airports Corporation in Darwin, Mr Santalucia, that approximately one per cent of the project figure was being appropriated for the provision of suitable art and craft works in both of the facilities. That would therefore involve subcontracts in respect of provision of art and crafts works at Darwin Airport in the vicinity of some $500,000 and, for Alice Springs, in the vicinity of some $200,000. None of this, of course, is mentioned in the answer that was provided. The issue is important because, like the questions that Senator Bishop has been asking, it is the process of procurement that actually concerns me. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that, in a press statement of 25 March 1991, the Federal Airports Corporation detailed a specific policy with regard to art for overseas visitors which it intends to adopt as an arts policy for Federal airports right around Australia. Much of what is stated in that media release follows the representations that I had been making to the Corporation for some specific time with regard to Darwin and Alice Springs airports. I am concerned that what was being allocated as a percentage of the new tender works is now being gobbled up. We have nothing but gobbledegook with regard to broad, general aims and the appointment by the FAC of a new arts policy which has been developed `with the guidance of eminent adviser, the former Chief Executive of the Australia Council, Dr Jean Battersby'. The release went on:</PARA>
<PARA> In the future the commissioning or acquisition of artworks will be an integral part of the building design process when the Corporation is adding new facilities or refurbishing existing ones. </PARA>
<PARA> All suitable creative media will be used including painting, sculpture, tapestry, mosaics, photography and craftworks to illustrate the breadth of Australian talent. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend making our airports better introductions to Australia and its principal regions and play a major role in the community . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not dispute the necessity to have artworks, but what I want to pursue specifically is the fact that, as to the subcontracts of the new terminals, as acknowledged in the media release, I have been unable to get sufficient and up to date information as to how the process of the expenditure of some $500,000 for Darwin and $200,000 for Alice Springs is, in effect, to be adopted, incorporated or tendered-or whatever the process is. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certainly aware that Dr Battersby has made a number of visits to the Northern Territory. She has consulted different groups. She has obviously antagonised different groups. She has made very provocative statements about the availability and the standard of Northern Territory art. I would certainly dispute those provocative and, in fact, critical comments, because, as I believe Senator Collins would acknowledge, there are hundreds of very fine craftsmen and artists of international standard in the Northern Territory, all of whose works I believe should be available to be incorporated for the local colour and quality that can be added to both Darwin and Alice Springs airports. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the issue obviously does not have the sympathetic consideration of the Federal Airports Corporation. For example, I was speaking to the executives of the Arts Council of the Northern Territory recently, who advised me that they have not received any acknowledgment or follow-up to their letter to the Federal Airports Corporation of 10 December 1990, in which they raised a series of questions following a meeting with Dr Battersby. They sought clarification of a number of points: the commissioning or direct purchase of artworks; the perceived role of any advisory committee, which I believe has never functioned nor worked; the FAC policy regarding the purchase of, in particular, the work of local artists; and what budgetary allocations had been established in respect of, in the case of this letter, the installation of artworks for Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I received a letter from the Crafts Council of the Northern Territory Inc., over the signature of Leonie McNally, the Executive Director, and dated 30 April 1991. I will read the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Re: New Airport Terminals-Darwin and Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Management and the members of the Crafts Council of the Northern Territory wish to record their disappointment in relation to the lack of commissioned art and craftworks from the European arts industry of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would be aware our artistic community makes a significant contribution to tourism and the general economy of the Northern Territory. The Crafts Council of the NT is saddened at the loss of opportunity to showcase our talent and create further employment for Territorians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory's point of difference, our multicultural society and unique flora and fauna can only be truly reflected by Territorians. </PARA>
<PARA> We would welcome an opportunity to discuss this further with you. </PARA>
<PARA>I have also received written representations, which I do not have with me at present, from the Fine Arts Department of the University College of the Northern Territory. I am well aware that the principal of that Department has been seeking to discuss this matter now for some months with the Federal Airports Corporation without success or acknowledgment of the representations that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the amounts of money that are to be allocated-some $500,000 for Darwin airport and some $200,000 for Alice Springs-I should have thought that there would have been a proper process to ensure the involvement of local personalities drawn from the Northern Territory, to ensure that the selection of that art and craft properly reflects the character and representations of Northern Territory artists. We should not have to rely on some adviser imported from Sydney or elsewhere who wanders into town, talks with ministerial staff and other executive officers around the Northern Territory but who is unable to accommodate the wishes of Territorians about such an important event. </PARA>
<PARA> I would ask that the Minister clarify the matter, particularly with regard to the fact that in the answer provided to me there is no detail of the significant sums of money that are to be allocated from the budgets and the construction programs as acknowledged by the FAC in its own media release for these two most important airports, which I hope Senator Collins will be opening in the next few months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons why I would imagine that these amounts of money were not included was that they were special appropriations made by the board of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). It is to the great credit of the Federal Airports Corporation that it made these appropriations at all in the current tough times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to work myself into a lather over the artworks for either airport terminal because my view is that over the years both those terminals will be effectively used to showcase Northern Territory artists, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. Frankly, it would not have surprised me if the Federal Airports Corporation had decided to either remove that amount of money or substantially downgrade it because it is, relatively speaking and in terms of the cost of art, not a huge amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I hope we will be able to do in respect of some very innovative ideas that were proposed by Northern Territory artists is to persuade-and I do not think this will be difficult when times get better-the major operators of the airport, that is, the airlines that use them principally, to commission artworks for the building. </PARA>
<PARA> The angst that Senator Tambling feels about comments that might have been made by Jean Battersby are nothing to the angst that I feel about comments that I am told were made by the Northern Territory Minister for Education and the Arts, Shane Stone, in respect of what he thought should go in. Those comments horrified me. I have to tell Senator Tambling that it does not matter whether one is talking about constructing airport terminals, town halls or any other public buildings, there is bound to be a more intense debate about the colour the walls are painted-and I have been involved in that too-and the design of the carpet than anything else. As Senator Tambling would be well aware, there has been a very lively debate about the carpet that will be used in the Darwin Airport terminal, which has seemed to almost totally preoccupy the people currently involved in building it. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that I do not particularly like it, but I am sure it will grow on me. I can remember a council in a Northern Territory town telling me only recently that it had a half-hour debate on the appropriation to construct a multi-million dollar building but spent six months talking about the colour of the carpet and the design of the chairs for the chamber. I am not surprised at that because we will never satisfy all of the demands of the multitude of organisations involved in producing art and craft. As is truly said, beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I think the FAC is rightly proud, as is John Holland Pty Ltd, of the extraordinary percentage of major contract work which has, by deliberate policy of the organisation, gone to Northern Territory companies. It is a proud record indeed. As Senator Tambling would be aware, in excess of 70 per cent of the total construction of both airport terminals, that is, $80m worth, has gone to Northern Territory companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I can say that, without exception, the only work-some of it is major in terms of cost-that has not gone to Northern Territory companies is for contracts for the provision of baggage handling facilities, lifts and other specialist steel fabrication and so on which Northern Territory companies are simply not in a position to provide. It is a proud record of delivery to Northern Territory business which has been achieved. The FAC is rightly proud of it, and so am I. It has been achieved by a deliberate policy of giving preference, wherever possible, to Northern Territory firms. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the concern that is being expressed. Personally, having seen what is being proposed and having had a number of meetings with Jean Battersby, I think Territorians and the visitors who will be coming through those airport terminals, both domestic and international, will be very pleased with the result that will be there on opening day. It cannot be the final result, because it is a relatively small amount of money, considering the cost of some of the works for the terminals. I have no doubt that as the years proceed the project will be added to significantly. I trust the bulk of the art work that will go into both buildings will be from Northern Territory artists. </PARA>

Has Dr Battersby walked out and purchased $700,000 worth of art of her own choice, or has she had a process that has involved a selection panel, either in the artistic area or to assess the financial contributions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am with Senator MacGibbon. In fact, I agree with him absolutely and I am sorry that he was not listening when I said that. I just said a few minutes ago-I will repeat it for Senator MacGibbon's benefit-that in the current economic circumstances I would not have blamed the Federal Airports Corporation Board, which made this decision, had it taken a decision not to proceed. I think there would have been howls of outrage-from me too, frankly-from the Northern Territory's representatives, and particularly Senator Tambling in view of what he has just said, if a decision had been made to cut off all art work to the buildings. I am not so much of a philistine as to think that we should spend $80m on two airport terminals without at least putting some modest degree of art work in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the total construction costs of that terminal and the $15m-worth of foundation work that was already in place and was utilised and had been put there during the previous construction, and with the $56m-worth of new construction, half a million dollars is a relatively modest amount of money to spend on art work. The building is going to cost in the vicinity of $70m-odd when it is finally constructed. I would not have blamed the FAC if it had decided-it would have been a controversial decision-not to appoint anybody. Perhaps that would have got Senator Tambling off my back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Senate to a question that Senator Bishop put on notice regarding Ross Carlton's overseas itinerary. Public spending has been mentioned, so if you do not mind, Madam Chair, I will ask a few supplementary questions even though the hour is late. I notice that Ross Carlton departed Sydney via Singapore Airlines, arrived in Zurich the next day and inspected automated baggage systems there. The next day he decided to travel to Milan by train. Knowing that that is a touristy sort of track, which I am sure is dearer than air travel, I was wondering why he took the train, except that it does go through St Moritz and the Bernina Pass as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He got to Milan that evening and he could not have done much inspection because he was off to London. From my experience of Linate airport in Milan-there are two airports there-I would say that it would be the last place on earth anyone would go to have a look at a baggage system, because it is the No. 1 place in the world for losing baggage. However, he decided to carry on to London. Then, after conducting his English inspections, he went back to Europe, did the European tour and went back to London. Then he came home with Continental Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> We are expected to travel overseas with Qantas and return with Qantas, and I believe it is a pleasure to travel with Qantas, so why does Mr Carlton not qualify for the same treatment? Why should he take a touristy train when he can travel more cheaply? Why should he do it in two sections? Why did he not clean up Europe before he went to London, do the English tour and come home, preferably on Qantas instead of Continental Airlines?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now want to ask a question, still involving the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), concerning Sydney Earthmoving Pty Ltd, about which I asked questions, some of which were noted as questions remaining unanswered and some questions, which are in the Hansard, remain unanswered. We have received answers to two of the questions I asked on page 21 of Additional Information Received, volume 4, which read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a) What is FAC's relationship with Sydney Earthmoving Pty Limited?</PARA>
<PARA>(b) What is the likely source of landfill for the third runway?</PARA>
<PARA>Part of the answer to question (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of sources and types of fill were discussed. Although no conclusions are reached in the report, demolition waste was noted as having a disadvantage in that the estimated annual production in Sydney is only three million cubic metres. However, if it were to be used it would not need processing as provided by Sydney Earthmoving Pty Limited. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Hansard record of what Mr Ramsey said. I might say at the outset that I did write to the Minister and ask for these witnesses to come. I found it curious at the time that, having acceded to my request, the Minister then seemed to intercede for and on behalf of the officers of whom I was asking questions, on the basis-I can only assume-that I was only allowed to ask them nice questions. We had two people. One was a public relations sort of person and the other one was a financial person. </PARA>
<PARA> I did ask specific questions about the landfill. My information had been that there would be a traditional supplier who would perhaps be using metal from various quarries for the fill for the third runway and that the cost would be $23 to $28 a tonne delivered. Mr Ramsey replied that he had no way of knowing, even in his wildest dreams, what the cost of the fill would be, but he thought that $23 a metre delivered onto the site would be too much and that perhaps it would be sand at the rate of $3 or $4. Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to check that before you took it as firm evidence . . . Certainly, I do not believe there is any intention by the Corporation to use land based fill for the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA>The questions I want to ask the Minister are: is there to be a single supplier of fill; what are the various types of fill that are being considered; and what is the approximate price of that fill to be supplied?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the kind of fill that is being considered, all of that information is contained in detail in the draft environmental impact statement with the pros and cons of each kind of fill. Those assumptions, of course, will have to change without question as the project develops. For example, initial testing in an area where it was hoped 50 per cent of the fill was to be recovered from-that is, the space between the two runways-has already been found to be unsuitable for such a purpose because it is too elastic for that purpose. Clearly, that will change after further evaluation of the various options that are being examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of whether there will be a single supplier of the fill could hardly be determined if a final decision on the actual kind of fill that will be provided has not been made. Not only has land fill been considered but also, as the draft environmental impact statement points out, industrial waste and slag waste from blast furnaces is being looked at. There is a whole range of fill, but that is a long way from making a decision about any of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I am interested that in answer to a question the Minister said that there is a need for 11 million cubic metres of fill. Presumably that is subject to further consideration as well. There is an estimate that annual production in Sydney of demolition waste is only 3 million cubic metres a year. Could the Minister tell me what is the basis of that calculation and, indeed, as he says there is likely to be a number of sources of fill, why that source would be ruled out.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may not be. Can I point out the difference between the two propositions. I would have thought that Senator Bishop herself would have realised this. The reason why 11 million cubic metres of fill can be accurately identified for the runway is that we know how long the runway is going to be, how wide it is going to be and how deep it is going to be. It is not too difficult to work out how many million cubic metres of fill are needed for it. As the draft environmental impact statement points out, quite clearly there are number of various sources being considered for the fill. Further engineering evaluation will need to be conducted when that matter becomes firmer after the Government makes a final decision on whether the construction of the runway will go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>

The answer that has been given to me is that three people travelled in China for five days to produce four stories. Later in the answer the Department says that, earlier in the year, the SBS journalist undertaking the project received a grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the specific purpose of shooting the stories in China. The value of the grant was $7,500, thus the net cost to the SBS was $1,000.

The Minister will recall that the reason I raised it is that Sydney has indeed launched a bid for the same Olympic Games.

Senator Bishop is putting the extraordinary proposition that the Government should constrain SBS-or it should be censured, at least-from giving reporting and air time to a competing bid for the Olympic Games because Australia is putting in a bid. I say to Senator Bishop that that is a pretty extraordinary proposition, with respect. </PARA>

What have we been listening to for the past month from the Opposition with respect to a piece of legislation which we are putting through this Parliament? An absolutely undiminished parade of mewling, puking, hypocritical humbug about constraining free speech, is it not-constraining the freedom of the media and daring to suggest that paid political advertising, which is pretty riveting stuff at the best of times, not be permitted on television.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we move on to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and away from SBS, that was a pathetic attempt by the Minister. What we are talking about is the allocation of funds from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is taxpayers' money that we are talking about. If Beijing wants to come here and put paid advertising on Australian television, that is fine, but I do not want the taxpayers of Australia to pay for its advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move on to the ABC. While we are dealing with the question of what is paid for by taxpayers' money, let us look at the way in which the ABC chooses to put some sporting programs to air. I asked the Minister in the Estimates hearings who made the decision about who was to pay fees to the ABC to get a particular sport to air. The answer that was provided at page 13 of Additional Information Received, volume 3, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Under section 25(5) of the Act the ABC is prevented from receiving external funding for programs other than government bodies or from bona fide co-producers or organisers of public entertainment. Co-production monies received in respect of sporting events invariably fall within the latter category.</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting thing is that there seems to be one rule for some and another rule for others. Because the co-production fee is required to be paid, sporting bodies are required to go out and organise sponsorship, and the sponsorship then, in the arbitrary nature of the ABC, seems to be left off the screens. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to page 14 of the same information booklet and deal particularly with the 1990 Dunlop Footwear National Netball Championship, where the All Australian Netball Association Ltd was required to pay $40,000 in order to get its program to air. This relates to the program `Goal Attack', which involved coverage of all the Mobil Superleague of netball. It is my understanding that there is a ruling that, despite the fact that Mobil Oil Australia Ltd is its sponsor, someone in the ABC has made the decision that the word `Mobil' shall be censored from the program. Could the Minister confirm that that is true?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The board provides the guidelines that govern this matter, I am advised. If it is necessary for information, then the sponsor will be named. In respect of Senator Bishop's particular complaints about co-sponsorship and in terms of the arrangements that are entered into for co-production, it is usually the smaller sports rather than the larger sports that are available for the purposes of co-production.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think if the Minister does an analysis of the sports that are covered and looks at the source material he may be able to have access to, he will find that is not true. He will find, indeed, that the co-production fees that are payable by large organisations are really quite small, that things like women's golf pay a very large percentage of the co-production fee, and that, in fact, the co-production fee amounts to a de facto purchase of air time, because if one does not come up with the co-production fee the program does not get to air. But the question I was asking very specifically about the Mobil Superleague was whether the Board, if that is the body that has made the decision, has in fact made a decision that Mobil is to get no credit for being the sponsor of that superleague.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my intention tonight to just take a few minutes to address an issue which is of interest to me as I was privileged to be present as a representative of the Parliament at the Nepalese election on 12 May. This of course was significant because it was the first democratic election to be held in that country for 30 years or more since the monarchy intervened in affairs in 1959 and produced an authoritarian system of government which eventually evolved into a process known as panchayat. The panchayat system involved indirect elections to a parliament which lacked influence and a series of local consultations. Those consultations barred organised political parties from involvement in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A few years ago there emerged a democracy movement in Nepal similar to those that have emerged in other parts of the Asian subcontinent in relatively recent times. The democracy movement consisted of academics and students, trade unionists, human rights activists, people from the legal fraternity and journalists. </PARA>
<PARA> There were several bloody clashes during the period of the late 1980s involving the democracy movement and security forces. Between 200 and 500 people died during those clashes. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, the movement was successful but not without cost to individuals and to the country as a whole. Nepal is the fourth poorest country in the world, according to the World Bank. Its average income per capita is only $US150 per annum. In over 90 per cent of cases family households are dependent for income on agriculture, and subsistence level agriculture, at that. Nonetheless, even with the problems of the evolution of the democratic movement and the economic constraints within which the new Government which emerged a little over one year ago is operating, it was possible to formulate a new constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The outgoing Prime Minister, Mr K. P. Bhattarai, ought to be commended for the manner in which that constitution was drafted. In particular, the constitution moved away from the panchayat system, which was abandoned, towards a constitutional monarchy built upon a new House of Representatives which consists now of 205 seats. The constitutional process led directly to the general election. </PARA>
<PARA> From what the international observers who were present could see, the election campaign was very free and open, certainly by the standards of the subcontinent and, it is fair to say, by world standards. It was a free contest. It consisted of very well attended rallies, of amounts of time allocated between the parties for television and radio, and extensive publication of newspapers. Each political party tended to produce its own newspaper in a broadsheet form. The parties were as wide as the political spectrum could possibly be imagined. In all, some 44 parties or splinters of parties contested the general election. Given the fact that somewhere between 65 per cent and 75 per cent of the people of Nepal are illiterate, the parties were represented by different symbols. The symbols were quite fascinating in their complexity and in their invention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Nepali Congress Party, the major party as it turned out, was represented by the tree, which could be seen in most parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu, and various other symbols were employed by other political organisations. For example, the United Marxist Leninists (UML)-somewhat of a misnomer in view of the party's platform and personalities-was represented by the sun, but there were symbols as different as umbrellas, water taps, eye glasses, various farm animals and crops, right through to relatively modern affectations. All these symbols were employed to represent the political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The voting system employed on the day was ingenious. People simply needed to allocate a stamp with their respective party's symbol reflected on the stamp to register a formal vote. The presence of international observers, including the Australians, really came as an initiative of the Nepalese Government and an organisation called the Nepal Election Observers Committee (NEOC). NEOC really consisted of many of the people who had been selected in the democratic movement. They had taken an active interest in the formation of the democratic process in its infancy and saw it through. </PARA>
<PARA> International observers came from right around the globe, including Europe, north America, Asia and the Pacific, whilst the Indian subcontinent was particularly well represented. There is a lot of interest in this Parliament in the affairs of the subcontinent. I know that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has a particular interest in Nepal and Bhutan, as do Senator Maguire and Senator Teague in the Indian subcontinent generally. There was a very wide representation of observers from the democratic political institutions right around the globe, such as the various electoral commissions, human rights activists, political parties and the like. They were allocated to different parts of the country. Some 30 districts right throughout the country were covered during the course of the election. In my case, I went to a district called Sindhupalchowk, which was close to the Tibetan border. </PARA>
<PARA> Polling day, by world standards, was well organised. Police were on hand at most of the polling stations. Armed police and military patrols were out, owing to the practice of ballot-box stuffing which is so widespread in other parts of the region. We saw that recently, and most unfortunately, in India. </PARA>
<PARA> Election officials, party scrutineers and the like were able to operate freely in the overwhelming majority of cases. There were some unfortunate incidents that tended to mar the process, but overall it was a free and fair ballot in terms of the manner in which it was organised, the votes that were cast and the votes that were counted. In the aftermath, where irregularities were reported to the Electoral Commission, many polling stations had their votes cancelled as being invalid and having been the product of breaches of electoral laws. When I left Kathmandu, some 38 polling stations had been placed in that category. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I say briefly that Australian-Nepalese relations are very warm. The Nepalese people are very generous. From my brief experience and from what our Ambassador in Kathmandu, Les Douglas, explained to us, the Nepalese tend to regard Australians very well. That is particularly the case because of the various kinds of aid projects in which we have been involved since 1966. Since the late 1970s, some 25,000 hectares of Nepal have been reafforested through cooperation between Australian and Nepalese experts. We were able to see some of the projects while we were there. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also been active in civil aviation and in bringing Nepalese students to study at Australian institutions. Looking at the work that Mr Douglas and his colleagues in Kathmandu have done, they are to be commended for the manner in which they represent Australia, following on from some very good work done by our first Ambassador, Ms Di Johnstone, from 1986 through to 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> In Nepal, Australia's interests are to be a good international citizen. The Australian delegation certainly sought to contribute to that process. The election overall was free and fair. We have seen emerge a functioning and effective government, based on the Nepalese Congress Party, and a functioning and effective Opposition, based on the UML. It is a very positive development for that region of the world, coming as it does on the heels of the outbreak of democratic movements around the globe. It was a privilege to be present, and I thank Mr President in particular for the opportunity to be present and to see the election and the emergence of a new democratic government in that part of the globe. </PARA>

<PARA> With the exception of Upurl Upurlila, 1988/89 and Oombulgurri, 1988/89, there are no outstanding matters in relation to acquittance of CDEP grants prior to 1989/90. The outstanding matters in relation to Upurl Upurlila are in the process of being resolved and acquittance will soon be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Oombulgurri, ATSIC grants identified in the audited financial statements do not match actual releases. The Regional Office has taken this matter up with the Community and Auditor and an early resolution is expected.</PARA>
<PARA>1989/90 Grants</PARA>
<PARA> In the Kununurra Region, audited financial statements are still outstanding for Kalumburu, Mandangala, Woolah, Muliarkar and Lamboo Gunian. Recruitment of additional resources is currently being undertaken to commence the acquittal process of these outstanding grants.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Derby/Broome Region, all 1989/90 annual audited financial statements have been examined and, where possible, grants have been acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA> Where grants cannot be acquitted at this stage, appropriate action has been undertaken as detailed below:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Queries highlighted in Annual Audited Financial Statements have been raised in correspondence to relevant communities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Copies of correspondence where queries have been raised have also been sent to relevant Auditors.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon receipt of satisfactory responses, relevant grants can be acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA> In this Region, audit reports for 1989/90 have not yet been received from Pender and Mowanjum. The auditor and community Chairperson have been advised of this breach of funding conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>In the South Hedland Region, audit reports have been received in the Regional Office but have not yet been analysed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) ATSIC is not aware of an official review expressing reservations or inadequacies with regard to cash payments by any of the Western Australian CDEP communities.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Qualified audit reports have been received for 17 (one third) of the 52 CDEP communities in Western Australia. The communities concerned are:</PARA>
<PARA> Djarindjin; Bardi; Lombadina; Junjuwa; Yungngora; Junjuwa (Muludja and Ngalingkadji); Wangkatjungka; Kadjina; Looma; Mulan; Beagle Bay; Punmu; Strelley; Burringurrah; Ngangganawili; and Upurl Upurlila.</PARA>
<PARA> The audits reveal a number of shortcomings common to these communities, primarily in the areas of bookkeeping, cash systems and management, records maintenance, and accounting systems and procedures. Problems of this nature are not uncommon in remote communities where experienced staff, qualified accountants and training facilities are all scarce resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has taken steps to rectify inadequacies in all the instances identified by the audit reports. Action undertaken includes implementation of financial management training programs for staff and councillors of several communities; the installation of new financial management, internal control and wages systems in a number of communities; and assistance given to communities in the appointment of bookkeeping or management staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) An evaluation of Grant Acquittals for all Programs is currently being conducted by the Office of Evaluation and Audit on a national basis. The Office will be involved in an evaluation of CDEP this calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It was discovered that at Yungngora Community one of the staff members was falsifying names on CDEP wages payments. An amount of between $5,000 and $6,000 was allegedly re-directed to her personal account. The matter was referred to police authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The projects officer at Upurl Upurlila, investigated in connection with payments for items of personal benefit, was charged by the Kalgoorlie Criminal Investigation Bureau, convicted and ordered to undertake 180 hours of community service and to pay restitution of approximately $600.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission acknowledges the importance of community development plans. Work has commenced on developing a program. Both the Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are examining options for providing assistance to communities in the preparation of community development plans.</PARA>
<PARA> Under new administrative arrangements for CDEP, communities will have to provide a CDEP works program when making applications for CDEP grant funds. The works program will comprise a list of projects that the community sees as important to its social, cultural, recreational and economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> Communities are being encouraged to develop specific CDEP plans and/or community development plans. The CDEP works program would be an integral part of either of these plans.</PARA>
<PARA>ASSESSMENT CRITERIA</PARA>
<PARA> All CDEP grants are assessed by the Commission on the annual ``Grant Assessment Form'' which is completed by Regional Officers as part of the annual draft estimates documentation.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the annual grant assessment all CDEP projects are to be fully reviewed on a three- year cycle commencing in 1991/92. It is envisaged that these reviews will be undertaken by officers from the Commission and the Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA>PRIORITY SETTING</PARA>
<PARA> Under new administrative arrangements, priorities for the allocation of CDEP Oncost and Support funds will be determined by Regional Managers in consultation with Regional Councils and CDEP communities and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>INACCURATE PAYMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that some communities have not always submitted fortnightly variation schedules. However, while this can cause short term inaccuracies, community entitlements are adjusted when subsequent schedules are received.</PARA>
<PARA> While delays occur between the Commission and DSS this does not result in over or under payments by ATSIC, as any adjustments necessary (after DSS checking) are made in subsequent quarters.</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of sanctions under the standard grant offer have been corrected by additional mandatory special conditions for CDEP.</PARA>
<PARA>The administrative changes to the CDEP system to take effect from 1 April 1991 have been designed to simplify the calculation of communities' entitlements and should reduce the possibility of inaccuracies.</PARA>
<PARA>MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING</PARA>
<PARA>TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of qualified Aboriginal people has been a problem for DAA/ATSIC and communities alike. Training initiatives have been taken by DAA/ATSIC and the Department of Employment, Education and Training to address this issue.</PARA>
