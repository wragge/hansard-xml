<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a statement to the Senate concerning notices of motion. On 23 August 1990 the Senate amended standing order 76 to include the following paragraphs:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) A notice shall consist of a clear and succinct proposed resolution or order of the Senate relating to matters within the competence of the Senate, and shall not contain statements, quotations or other matter not strictly necessary to make the proposed resolution or order intelligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The President may delete extraneous matter from notices and may require a Senator giving a notice contrary to the standing orders to reframe the notice.</PARA>
<PARA>These amendments were adopted on the recommendation of the Procedure Committee in its fourth report presented in June 1989. The Committee noted that very lengthy notices containing extraneous matter were being given for the purpose of making debating points rather than with any intention of having a resolution or order passed. The Committee explained the provision in the amended standing order referring to `matters within the competence of the Senate' as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as notices of motion containing extraneous material, recently there has been a number of notices referring to matters which have no connection with the legislative activities of the Senate or with public affairs. The Procedure Committee considers that such notices of motion also should be explicitly provided against by the Standing Orders.</PARA>
<PARA>In discussions in the Procedure Committee, it was made clear that this rule was designed to prevent, in particular, notices of motion congratulating sporting teams. Such notices have a tendency to multiply and to refer to more and more obscure events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, due to the traditional tolerance of the Chair, notices containing extraneous material and lengthy quotations have become common and notices referring to sporting events, without any attempt to connect them with any public policy, have again emerged.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of industry councils for certain primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are already industry councils for the wool, meat, horticulture and pig industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These councils have made significant contributions to policy development in their respective industries and the Government has foreshadowed the establishment of a statutory policy council for the grains industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will establish such a council and provide a legislative framework under which industry councils can be established for particular primary industries in the future. A similar Bill was passed by the House of Representatives but withdrawn from the Senate in the autumn 1991 sittings of Parliament. The Bill which I am introducing today differs from the earlier Bill in that individual industry councils and their membership will only be established by the inclusion of specific provisions in this legislation. The usual processes for amending an Act will need to be undertaken to amend the schedule to establish a new council and specify its membership. The concerns expressed by the Senate in relation to `legislation by regulation' have, therefore, been addressed in the revised approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first instance, only a Grains Industry Council will be established under the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has been the case for the existing industry policy councils, the object of the industry councils established under this legislation will be to facilitate the development of sound Government policies for these industries by bringing together representatives of different sectors of an industry and giving them an active role in the policy formulation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Functions and Powers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions and powers of the Councils are set out in Part Two of the Bill. They are the same as those which the Parliament has agreed in passing legislation to establish the Wool Industry Council in the autumn 1991 sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the functions and powers provided, the Industry Councils will be given a more central role in reviewing and coordinating industry policy than is the case for the existing policy councils other than wool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is reflected, for example, in the first function listed in the Bill, under which an industry council is required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry. In carrying out this function, a council will need to have regard to the activities and general strategies of other relevant statutory authorities in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coordinating role of the industry councils will also be strengthened in a number of other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The councils will be able to convene industry review conferences. In this context, I would note that the grains industry has recently undertaken a major strategic review in the form of the Grains 2000 Conference initiated by the Grains Council of Australia. The Bill also provides for councils to be required by regulation to convene conferences at such intervals as may be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made for councils to convene regular meetings of the chairpersons of the other relevant statutory bodies in the industry and the regulations may require that such meetings be held. The purpose of these meetings is to enable the Chairpersons of each of the industry's statutory authorities to be well informed of the activities of their counterpart organisations and thus ensure the coordinated development of industry strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Constitution and meetings of the Council</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part three of the Bill provides for such matters as the composition of industry councils, appointments to the councils and meetings of the councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Membership of industry councils will be broadly based to provide major stakeholders in an industry with an opportunity for input to the development of policies affecting that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and his Department have consulted closely with the Grains Council of Australia and widely with other peak grain industry bodies on the establishment of the Grains Industry Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This council will encompass wheat, coarse grains, oilseeds and grain legumes. Its membership will enable producers of each of those categories of grains to be represented through the Grains Council of Australia. Processors and users of grain such as flourmillers, malt producers and grocery and stockfeed manufacturers as well as marketers, including statutory bodies and private traders, and bulk handling authorities will also be represented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extensive involvement of the States in grain marketing, storage, handling and transport warrants inclusion of a nominee of the Australian Agricultural Council. The interests of employees in the policies affecting all sectors of the grains industry will be reflected through a member nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the establishment of other Councils under this legislation in the future, I can assure honourable senators that the Minister will consult with representatives of the relevant industries before bringing forward the necessary amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister would expect meetings of an industry council to be held on a regular basis. Members may require a meeting to be called if a minimum number of members so requests. For the Grains Industry Council, a minimum of nine members will be required to request that a meeting be held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part four of the Bill provides councils with the power to establish committees and working groups. This is intended to ensure that councils can set up functional committees or subject specific working groups if required. Provision is available under this Bill for working groups to actively involve a broad range of people including council members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of part five of the Bill outline the terms and conditions of office, remuneration and allowances and other administrative arrangements applying to members of a council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of part six include arrangements for staffing of councils and requirements for an annual report to be prepared and submitted to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Funding</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the operating costs of the Grains Industry Council, which will be met by the Government, will be of the order of $100,000 for the remainder of 1991/92 and about $350,000 in a full year. The operations of the council, including funding, will be reviewed during 1993. Funding arrangements for any other councils established under this Act will be considered prior to their establishment or reconstitution under this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that Industry Councils established under this Act will provide a focal point for the industries they are set up to serve as well as providing an important link between industry and the Government in the development of national policies relevant to those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister is well aware that the Grains Industry Council is being established at a particularly critical time when the grains industry is experiencing enormous pressures not of its own making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, over the longer term, the industry's future will rest upon the capacity of its producers, marketers, processors and researchers to develop and implement strategies for adapting to a rapidly changing production and marketing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enhancing our industries' international competitiveness and productive capacity with minimal government regulation and intervention will be fundamental to securing their future. The Government will continue to further develop an appropriate policy environment in which individual industries can pursue this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides a mechanism through which the grains industry as a whole can participate in advising the Government on appropriate policy objectives and strategies for the industry.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service Amendment Bill 1991 makes a number of amendments to the officers' mobility provisions contained in part IV of the Public Service Act 1922. The mobility provisions preserve certain rights of public servants who are transferred to, or take up employment with, certain government business enterprises or authorities which are staffed outside the Public Service Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable to the Government that people with mobility rights may benefit from the redundancy arrangements of an agency and then return to the Public Service where they may either get another job with the Commonwealth or, if no work is available, have access to further redundancy arrangements&mdash;that is, to `double dip'. The Government is also firmly of the view that the redundancy arrangements available to former public servants in government business enterprises and other authorities should not be more generous than for other staff in these agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this Bill, therefore, give effect to the Government's policy that people with Public Service mobility rights who become redundant in an agency should be allowed the benefit of a single option, that is redundancy arrangements in the agency, or return to the Public Service, but not both. The Government's intention to introduce these amendments was announced by media release on 29 May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before explaining how the Bill will prevent `double dipping', I will briefly touch on the relevant aspects of the mobility provisions. The part IV provisions of the Public Service Act adopt a `two-tier' approach to the preservation of mobility rights, although this expression does not itself appear in the legislation. The first tier generally applies where officers of the Public Service move into employment with an agency with part IV coverage as a result of applying successfully for a job in that agency. Such people generally have first tier coverage for the first three years of their employment with the authority. First tier also generally applies to public servants appointed to statutory offices which have a fixed tenure. While on first tier, officers are deemed to be on leave without pay from the Public Service and automatically become unattached officers of their former Public Service department. As such, they may return to that department at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second tier of the mobility provisions applies to a number of categories of former Public Service officers, including: those who continue to be engaged in employment with a part IV agency beyond the first tier period; those on first tier who resign from the Public Service but not from the employing agency; and those who are transferred from Public Service employment as a result of the transfer of a function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the second tier arrangements, people cease to be officers of the Public Service, but retain certain rights, including the right to apply for promotion and transfer to Public Service vacancies. As well, a person with second tier coverage may apply for reappointment to the Public Service in certain circumstances, including retrenchment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the complex nature of the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act, the amendments contained in the Bill are themselves quite complex. Essentially, however, the Bill does two things: it provides that people with either first or second tier coverage who are offered and accept a retrenchment benefit in relation to the termination of their employment with an agency will cease to be covered by the mobility provisions. As a result, people will not be able to accept a voluntary redundancy payment on their retrenchment from an agency and also exercise a right of return to the Public Service, where they may be able to get either another job, or access to further redundancy benefits. Instead, the Bill provides that they will have a choice of either accepting a voluntary redundancy payment or exercising a right to return to the Public Service. They will not be able to do both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also affects the operation of the Public Service redundancy award to the extent that it provides that, where people who become excess in an agency choose to return to the Public Service through the use of the mobility provisions, then any action taken by the authority in relation to a person's retirement is to be taken as if it had been done under the Public Service redundancy award. The purpose of this is to prevent a person `double dipping' by taking advantage of benefits available under two separate awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of an example, in the absence of such a provision it may be possible, under the existing arrangements for retention in employment provided by the Public Service and similar redundancy awards, for a person to have thirteen months of retention in employment in an agency before returning to the Public Service where, if there was no position for the person, a further retention period of 13 months would then be applicable. Such a possibility is clearly unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as ensuring that persons with first and second tier mobility rights are unable to `double dip', the Bill makes similar provision for people with mobility rights arising from the repealed Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928. As I indicated earlier, the amendments contained in this Bill provide people with mobility rights who become subject to redundancy arrangements in an agency with a choice. A choice of whether to use the redundancy arrangements of that agency, or to return to the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that this choice should be made soon after people become aware that they may be retrenched from an agency. However, as the Government is concerned that people are able to make an informed choice, the Bill also provides that people must be given information about the operation of the amendments contained in this Bill which affect them, before being required to choose the course they will take.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preventing the duplication of redundancy benefits removes the potential for significant, and unjustifiable, additional costs associated with the restructuring of government business enterprises and authorities. While it is not possible to provide an estimate of the likely additional expenditure if legislative, or other arrangements, were not in place to prevent double dipping, there is a considerable potential for such costs. Current estimates suggest that there are currently some 50,000 people covered by the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. Many of these people are presently working in agencies which are undergoing major restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complement this Bill, the Government will also be putting in place arrangements, which may require legislation, to ensure that all redundancy costs arising from actions taken by an agency will be met by that agency. This will include costs arising from either the payment of redundancy benefits or through the use of Public Service re-entry rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of establishing non-Budget agencies such as government business enterprises or authorities is to provide such agencies with financial independence, which includes the opportunity to access benefits and savings arising from that independence. It is therefore appropriate that they also bear the financial responsibility for the full costs of their decisions. Conversely, it is clearly inappropriate for Budget agencies to bear the costs associated with decisions over which the Commonwealth has no direct control.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS (STAFF)  BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill is the  second of the two Bills in the legislative package which forms the basis of the transfer of the Repatriation General Hospitals to the States' health systems. The Staff Bill has been drafted in accordance with assurances the Prime Minister and I gave to safeguard the interests of staff who work in the hospitals and who will be affected by the integration of the hospitals into the State health systems. Keeping the hospitals running as viable institutions serving the community at large as well as those veterans seeking to still use the hospitals is the best way of guaranteeing jobs and the interests of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are currently some 10,000 staff employed in Repatriation General Hospitals throughout Australia of which more than half are engaged in the medical, nursing and allied health professional fields. The remainder are employed in the administrative, computing, manual and technical fields. They are highly skilled and dedicated and have the capacity to assist the States to provide quality hospital services to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To honour the promises given to these staff, the Commonwealth entered into extensive negotiations with the ACTU and Veterans' Affairs unions. These negotiations have resulted in an Agreement which commits the Commonwealth to do its best to ensure that the maximum number of staff are offered a job with the State. The Agreement also covers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">income maintenance;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">re-entry rights into Commonwealth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the commitments to staff of the Repatriation General Hospitals are set out in the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the unions, the Staff Bill declares these commitments in the form of a legislative statement of Parliament's intentions. The government expects that, as a result of the intentions stated in this Bill and the agreement negotiated with the unions, the overwhelming majority of Repatriation General Hospital staff will receive and accept job offers from the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those staff who accept a job offer or who are offered what is considered to be a "comparable job" the Bill contains provisions to separate them from Commonwealth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This special legislation package is then, a vital part of the commitment both I and the Prime Minister gave to staff that their interests would be safeguarded. The legislation has been developed in consultation with all the unions involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of the Repatriation General Hospitals to the States will result in more efficient use of the hospital system nationally and the concurrent introduction of the Repatriation Private Patient Scheme will offer entitled veterans and war widows better hospital options. As I indicated in my comments on the financial implications on the Treatment Bill, accurate forecasts of cost savings associated with the integration of the Repatriation hospitals into the State health systems can not be made in advance of completion of negotiations with individual States and setting the timetable for integration in each State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (PROVISION  OF TREATMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill and the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991 which accompanies it, form the legislative package embodying the principles and guarantees to the ex-service community and Commonwealth employees in relation to the integration of the Repatriation General Hospitals into the States' health systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stress to this House that these Bills do not mean immediate and automatic transfer of the hospitals to the States. Negotiations with State Governments on the terms for integrating the Repatriation General Hospitals are continuing. However, both the Bills establish the mechanisms by which the hospitals' staff may eventually be transferred to State employment and the conditions under which veterans and war widows will receive their treatment entitlements after integration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills represent the culmination of a very long process of investigation into the future of the Repatriation General Hospitals. Three of the earliest reports: the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare (1973); the Non-Parliamentary Inquiry into the Repatriation System (the Toose Report, 1975); and the Bailey Task Force on Co-ordination of Welfare and Health Services (1976) contained recommendations concerning eventual transfer of the Repatriation General Hospitals to the States. Following a 1984 Parliamentary Works Committee recommendation, the matter was eventually referred to the review of the Repatriation Hospital System Committee (the Brand Committee) which, in 1985 recommended that planning take place for the effective rationalisation and integration of the Repatriation hospital system with the States' hospital systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faced with the increasing difficulty of access for an ageing veteran population to the Repatriation hospitals in each State, and the realisation that changes were needed in the Commonwealth/State structure of health care, the Federal Government accepted the Brand Committee's recommendations. In August 1988, I announced the proposal for integration of the Repatriation General Hospitals into the State health systems by 1995 or earlier. The Government was persuaded that this would lead to a greater range of hospital and specialist treatment closer to veterans and war widows' homes, and also enable the retention of the hospitals as viable institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, this was a decision of some sensitivity and one which has generated much emotional debate. To get to this point has required massive effort and consultation with a wide range of people&mdash;ex-servicemen and women, war widows, staff, State Government officials and medical professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safeguarding of veterans and war widows' rights has been a fundamental goal of the extensive negotiations which have taken place since 1988 with representatives of ex-service and kindred organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major concern of ex-service organisations has been to ensure that transfer of the hospitals to the States' health systems would not diminish the level and quality of hospital and specialist treatment. They sought reassurance that the Government's guarantees on the standard and level of service would be maintained when the hospitals came under State control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill responds to these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind this House of the Prime Minister's promise in April 1989 that "no Repatriation General Hospital will be transferred to a State until a satisfactory agreement has been reached on matters such as priority of access and quality of health care for veterans and war widows". The Repatriation Private Patient Principles attached to this Bill provide that assurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should emphasise that the term "priority of access" does not embrace the proposition that veterans or war widows would get priority entry to a hospital over a patient with more urgent medical needs. This does not happen now and it never will. Such a situation would constitute a breach of medical ethics. However, the Repatriation Private Patient Principles ensure that veterans and war widows in need of hospitalisation get the necessary access through better use of the integrated Repatriation hospitals, the public hospital system and private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has been prepared in close consultation with ex-service organisations. In accordance with their wishes, it has been drafted in such a way as to provide a solid legal framework which underpins the guarantees for continued access to hospital care and status as private patients following integration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991 proposes to amend section 84 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to reinforce the guarantee that the Commonwealth Government will continue to be responsible for the health care of veterans after integration. Specifically, section 84 is to be amended to provide that the Commonwealth, not the States or Territories, must take steps to ensure that treatment is provided for a person consistent with Part V of the Act, which sets out the terms and conditions relating to the treatment rights of eligible veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Bill, by the insertion of a new section 90A, provides for the establishment of the Repatriation Private Patient Principles which will set out guidelines and circumstances under which private patient treatment will be provided. Those guidelines will be subject to effective Parliamentary scrutiny by being made a disallowable instrument thereby demonstrating the Government's determination to ensure the Parliament as a whole remains committed to the health care of entitled veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the draft Repatriation Private Patient Principles accompanies this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Briefly, the principles will guarantee veterans, war widows and eligible dependants:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a choice of doctors and specialists who agree to treat under Veterans' Affairs arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">direct access as private patients to shared accommodation in public hospitals;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">private hospital care, where the public hospital system cannot meet the medical need within a reasonable time, in a private hospital with which Veterans' Affairs has an agreement, or other private hospitals where necessary;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">continued access to former Repatriation General Hospitals;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the additional choice of a private hospital not contracted to Veterans' Affairs, provided they obtain financial authorisation. In such cases accommodation and other charges will be met to a pre-determined level with the veteran or war widow liable for the fees gap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I mentioned, entitled veterans, war widows and eligible dependants will continue to have access to Repatriation hospitals. In recognition of the special place of these hospitals in our society and to ensure that Australians never forget the sad circumstances under which they were established, a condition of transfer to any State will be that the word Repatriation is retained in the hospital's name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The negotiations on the Repatriation Private Patient Principles with the ex-service organisations, Legacy and the War Widows' Guild have resulted in the introduction of monitoring committees, including representatives of the ex-service organisations, to be established in each State and nationally to closely scrutinise these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must emphasise that the purpose of the Repatriation Private Patient Principles is to set out the conditions applying to the freedom of choice and Repatriation private patient status under Part V of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. They do not replace the detailed financial and administrative arrangements contained in the Treatment Principles. They add to the existing mechanisms and provide greater status for veterans and war widows' treatment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the passage of this Bill will set in train one of the most significant changes to the administration of veterans benefits in the history of repatriation in Australia. It is a change which has resulted from the need to ensure that, as the veteran population continues to age and the number of veterans and war widows declines, successive Governments will be in a position to ensure that the promises made, and the commitment to care and provide for veterans who served their country in time of war, will continue to be honoured. This legislation gives to veterans and war widows the guarantees they require and deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of the Repatriation General Hospitals to the States will result in more efficient use of the hospital system nationally and the concurrent introduction of the Repatriation Private Patient Scheme will offer entitled veterans and war widows better hospital treatment options. It is not possible to quantify the financial implications arising from the introduction of the Repatriation Private Patient Scheme and the integration of the hospitals into the States' health systems. The reasons for this are that negotiations with the States are not complete; the number of veterans and war widows transferring from private health insurance or Medicare is unknown; some additional usage of private hospitals by veterans and war widows is anticipated but it is not possible to quantify this at the present time; and details of changes to the Repatriation General Hospitals and consequential staff implications are not yet finalised although the Commonwealth will have a continuing obligation towards transferred staff for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formulation of this legislation could not have happened without the co-operation and support of representatives of the RSL, the T&amp;PIs, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, the Repatriation Defence Forces Welfare Association, Legacy and the War Widows' Guild with whom consultations on the integration process have taken place over a long period and are still continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I call on all Honourable Senators present to support passage of the Bill through the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and the draft Repatriation Private Patient Principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF HEALTH  AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill seeks to amend the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987, to enable the Institute to undertake the collection, analysis and publication of statistics in the fields of welfare services and housing assistance. This is the first step in a process to develop and strengthen national welfare statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for national welfare statistics has been recognised for many years. Major reports calling for the development of national welfare statistics have included: in 1975, the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration and the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty; in 1976, the Bailey Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health; and the 1979 Baume Report on Evaluation in Australian Health and Welfare Services from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been previous attempts to address the concerns. In 1976 the Commonwealth and State Governments attempted to improve the situation by establishing WELSTAT with a secretariat maintained by the Commonwealth. The aim was to establish national statistical standards for social welfare data. Intermittent national data was published on adoptions, children in care and emergency relief but data quality problems prevented regular publication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1987-88 the Commonwealth contribution to the WELSTAT secretariat ceased. Since then there have been Commonwealth/State discussions on data collections for individual programs and States have continued some development work in the general child welfare area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerable work remains to be done. This Government has decided to put in place definite steps to address the problem. The development of a national welfare data role by the Institute is regarded as an essential part of fulfilling the framework for determining roles and responsibilities agreed by the Special Premiers Conference in October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plans to enhance the Institute's role had their roots in the October 1990 Special Premiers' Conference. At that time, heads of Government agreed that the collation of nationally consistent data was essential for the framework for rationalising Commonwealth, State and Local Government roles in policy planning, service delivery and evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attachment 3 of the Special Premiers' Conference communique set out a framework for determining roles and responsibilities in service delivery. It stated that, in determining the allocation of functions to the spheres of Government, considerations should include the need for clear and direct accountability to the electorate and client group, and the achievement of effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms at the least possible administrative cost to Government and service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the October Special Premiers' Conference, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services established a working group chaired by Professor Bettina Cass to advise on a proposed role for the Australian Institute of Health to encompass the collation of welfare statistics. The working group recommended that the Institute's role should be expanded to encompass data on programs which provide welfare, community services and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health and Welfare Ministers, at their meeting on 6 September 1991, agreed to the expanded role and that existing State based data collections of child maltreatment and substitute care be included as a priority area. Housing Ministers have indicated their support of this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers also agreed that a Memorandum of Understanding would be developed jointly between the Commonwealth and the States/Territories outlining the rights and responsibilities of all parties in relation to the Institute's expanded role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Institute of Health was set up by an Act of this Parliament in 1987. As a Statutory body with its own Charter, and with the States represented on its Board, the Institute has been recognised as a genuinely national body, rather than an agent of the Commonwealth. It has been active in improving national health statistics, and successful in working constructively and cooperatively with Commonwealth, State and Territory Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Achievements of the Institute include</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the development of a national minimum data set for institutional health care,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">progress towards a national health labour force data collection covering a number of health professionals,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">progress towards a national cancer statistics clearing house,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">inventory of Australian health data collections, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">initiating the development of a national health information agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this track record it is a suitable body to undertake the development of national welfare and housing assistance statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An enhanced Institute will improve the availability and quality of statistics on welfare services. This information on welfare services and their impact on the Australian population will be available to Governments, researchers and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics will be gathered from programs whether they are administered solely by the Department, jointly administered by the Commonwealth and the State and Territory Governments, or are solely the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will cover a wide range of services which are used by the vast majority of Australians at some time in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care services, including services related to parental participation in education, training and the labour force will be included. Services specific to the welfare of children, including child protection and substitute care from the State-based welfare data collections, that is the WELSTAT collections to which I referred earlier, will, subject to State funding, become the Institute's responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other major areas in which the Institute will produce data are aged care services, services for people with disabilities, and housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the increasing ageing of the Australian population over the next three decades, it will be increasingly important for both Governments and the community to have access to comprehensive data on aged care services. This will make it possible to monitor the quality and effectiveness of existing services and to plan for the future, to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups and to reduce variations in access to, and quality of, services across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement has set the scene for a fundamental restructuring of the administration of disability services, whereby the Commonwealth takes responsibility for employment services, and the States take responsibility for accommodation services. The data on disability services which the Institute will collate will enable Governments and non-Government service providers to monitor the progress and effectiveness of that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements in data on housing assistance will be another important feature of this initiative. The term housing assistance includes the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program and the Crisis Accommodation Program. In order to be able to respond to the needs of people in situations of housing stress, comprehensive information is required on what services are available and what they provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it did in the health field, the Institute will develop its welfare role through a process of active consultation to take place at all levels. Representatives of State and Territory welfare and housing departments will be added to the Board of the Institute. States will therefore be integrated into the process of setting objectives and priorities for the collation of welfare data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide a framework for this consultative process the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has agreed to the establishment of a National Health and Welfare Information Council. The Council's major tasks will be to advise the Institute's Board on</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the development of national health, welfare and housing assistance data and priorities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the development of the Institute's work program and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Council will have members from the Commonwealth, representatives of all State and Territory health, welfare and housing authorities, together with input from key organisations in the health, welfare and housing information fields.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect to see the National Health and Welfare Information Council being proactive in raising the level of community awareness and understanding of the need for and benefits of national information in the health and welfare areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I was in the process of arguing that family allowance is probably the single most important measure that a government can take to stress the primacy of the role of families and to relieve some of the social and other devastation that flows from family breakdown. In that context, it is very important that we address the purposes of family allowance to consider to what extent it ought to be increased rather than reduced. The legacy of this Government is that since it came to power it has presided over a failure to index family allowances to the point where about $6.8 billion has not been paid that would otherwise have been paid if the amount had been indexed over the period from 1978 to the present. That is a testimony to the Government's concern for families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure that is presently contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, and which is undoubtedly the most significant of the measures, is the proposal to introduce an assets test. As will be well known in this place, we have always placed great store on horizontal equity and the necessity to recognise that families on identical levels of income with dependants have more expenditure obligations than those without. Therefore, in most circumstances we think that it is important to recognise that by the payment of family allowances. There are those who would argue that the burden of bringing up children is so important that it ought be recognised irrespective of levels of income and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An income test has been in place for some years and that is a recognition that there ought to be a cut-off point. The need to avoid the distortions that flow from having only income tests in place has led to the need for the introduction of an assets test. Whilst that has been a matter of some anguish on this side of the Parliament, nonetheless there has been a very general recognition that it is important to have a balanced means test in place and that that therefore necessitates the introduction of an assets test at a reasonable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original Government proposal contained in the 1990 Budget was for simply a limit of $300,000 with no exceptions to that principle. That clearly would have wrought very great hardship on people, particularly in rural areas, who find themselves asset rich but income poor for factors, in most instances, which are well beyond their control. Quite rightly, the community and the Parliament ultimately rejected that fairly crude attempt to impose an assets test, irrespective of the circumstances of those who might have been affected by it. The Government did belatedly concede to that concern by raising the limit to $500,000. But it was still an arbitrary limit and ultimately it was rejected by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure before us now contains a number of significantly improved features. In particular, the inclusion of hardship clauses means that even if one has assets in excess of $600,000, one can still qualify for the payment of family allowances. Even Wilson Tuckey, my colleague in the other place who felt so strongly about this proposal to cross the floor, nonetheless recognised in the amendment that he moved that there was a need to have a cut off point. His preference of $2m was related to the relevant rate of return that one is presumed to get before losing the family allowance on the basis of the income test. But, nonetheless, even Mr Tuckey recognised that fact. I think the overwhelming view in the community is that there ought to be a limit. The argument is really where the line ought to be drawn and to what extent there ought to be exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's hardship proposals, in principle, did meet those original concerns but there were still a number of areas that needed to be fleshed out. In particular, I refer to the two legs of hardship&mdash;family income at the level of approximately $13,078, with an increment for children, and liquid assets of less than $10,000 for a family group. The residual clause that picked up any other readily realisable assets of people caused quite a deal of concern in the initial stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, there have been extensive negotiations and correspondence with the office of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). I have to say that I believe the Minister has approached this matter in a very sensible and realistic manner, to the point where we now have firm undertakings, by way of letter, that there will be exemptions for both tools of trade and working capital. Therefore, we have reached the stage where those people who have assets that are a necessary part of earning an assessable income&mdash;in particular, from rural activities&mdash;will find that those assets, liquid or otherwise, will not be held against them. Only those people who have genuinely surplus funds, which are not necessary for their immediate income earning activities, will be caught by this test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a fair and reasonable approach. It has taken quite a deal to get there but at the end of the day the way in which the Minister has expressed those principles is satisfactory. But we will need to wait until we finally see the guidelines which will be introduced. I will be urging&mdash;and I take this opportunity to require&mdash;the Minister to table those guidelines in this place when they become available. I would also be seeking an assurance from the Minister that he will give the Parliament due notice in the event that any change to those guidelines is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we obtain those assurances we will have assuaged the concerns of many people, particularly those in rural areas, who have been very concerned indeed that moneys that were necessarily quarantined for farming activities will not be held against them. Having reached that point, I cannot believe that the Minister would want to surreptitiously change the guidelines or somehow dramatically disadvantage rural families by watering down the provisions in relation to working capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assume that the good faith will continue, that we will have these guidelines tabled. If we do not, I will table them in due course. Nonetheless, I am sure the Minister will be anxious to keep faith and to consolidate the expanded provisions that are proposed to be put in place. On that basis, we have reached a pretty satisfactory resolution of most of the outstanding matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to express a couple of other concerns. It is not clear to me why the hardship provision should operate only for a two-year period. One can understand the extent of the Government's anguish at the fact that it has been responsible for causing `the most serious recession in 60 years', to use the phrase of the current Treasurer (Mr Kerin). There is no doubt that the Government is continuing, and will continue, to pay dearly for the social devastation that it has deliberately chosen to inflict upon many thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when the history books come to be written and the role of Mr Keating is properly analysed this will be seen as an enduring legacy of misery and an albatross that ought to be around his neck for many years to come, and that his ability to mesmerise the press gallery and to punish ordinary Australians will be kept in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it does not seem to make a great deal of sense simply to have a hardship provision that will, hopefully, take one through the current recession because there will clearly be people beyond that point who are in hardship for whatever reason, whether it is a cyclical downturn in the economy, a fall in particular commodity prices or other factors operating in rural areas or in small business in the cities. It does not make a great deal of sense to limit the application of hardship provisions for that length of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when I look at what the Minister says to me by way of draft response&mdash;initially two years is a reasonable time for the operation of the hardship provisions as this will allow time for the provisions to settle in and to be properly evaluated&mdash;it is clear that he really does not have a good argument for removing the sunset clause either. He is simply saying, `We will have a look at it down the track'. However, he has not advanced any reason of logic or principle on why hardship provisions should not continue to be available. So in due course we will be moving an amendment to delete that sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to dwell on the other aspects of this package, other than to indicate that we will also be moving an amendment to oppose the provisions on the reduction in waiting periods for rent assistance. The Government is acknowledging the fact that many hundreds of thousands of Australians find themselves in need of welfare as a result of the current recession. Those numbers will have a very significant impact on the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that there are people in additional hardship, then those needs ought to be recognised in a tangible way. But it does not follow from that recognition that there is a need to reduce waiting periods for rent assistance. Those people are in the same situation as similar people might have been in good times. The principle of a waiting period, if one assumes its validity, is not compromised by the fact that there are many more people in the same situation. Individual circumstances do not warrant any reduction in the waiting periods unless we take the view that waiting periods per se ought to be removed. That is the view of the Democrats and groups such as VCOSS, but it is not our view, and I do not think it is the Government's view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really cannot understand why the Government wants to make this change, other than perhaps to appease some of the concerns for the failings of its policies and to be able to suggest that somehow it is doing something. Other than that, we will be supporting the Bill subject to those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) implements a number of changes to the Social Security Act, most of which were announced in this year's Budget. The changes that I am most concerned about are the introduction of an assets test on family allowance; changes to the current assets test for the family allowance supplement; and the introduction of new financial hardship rules for both the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. I will discuss those matters later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly mention a couple of very positive moves. Firstly, we have seen the introduction of a special child bereavement allowance which enables payment of family allowance, child disability allowance and double orphan pension to continue to be paid to parents or guardians for four weeks after the death of a child. These changes came as a result of the Strathfield tragedy, and I congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for this move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for sole parent pensioners to receive an education entry payment, another very positive step. The payment is $200 each calendar year to assist with education costs. Persons who qualify for the payment have to be sole parents, must be enrolled in a course of study and must be eligible for Austudy. I argue that rather than being a cost to the community, this is in fact a saving. It will enable these people to move more readily out to open employment as they will have improved qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill extends the qualifications for Jobsearch and sickness allowance for young persons. This is really a very welcome and a long overdue move. The definition of an independent young person will be changed to include a 13 week registration with the CES any time in the previous six months. The conditions previously were so harsh that very few young people actually made it into the system and were able to gain support. This move has come after a lot of lobbying from bodies such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and ACOSS in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jobsearch allowance will also be extended to 15-year-olds in certain circumstances, enabling them to become eligible for transition to work incentives. The independent rate will be extended to 16- and 17-year-olds who are being cared for by persons other than their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome and support these moves. Earlier this year the Brotherhood of St Laurence released a paper, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Policy Issues for Social Security</EMPHASIS>, which found that the most severe poverty caused by inadequate income support payments is that of young people, particularly those living away from home. It has been reiterated many times in this place that young unemployed people are suffering terribly as a consequence of this recession. The Democrats have consistently opposed reductions in young people's statutory incomes and although that situation, unfortunately, continues at least these measures make access to an income easier for some young unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the extension of the availability of rent assistance to young people under 18 and a reduction in the rent assistance waiting period from 26 weeks to 18 weeks for people without dependent children. The Democrats have been calling for this for quite some time as a wealth of evidence, again from the welfare agencies, has shown that these arbitrary waiting periods have been causing considerable hardship. Rent assistance is vital where people on low incomes are trying to survive in the private rental market. This measure is a recognition of the unfairness that this lengthy waiting period has been causing. I would like to see this waiting period end, as has been mentioned by Senator Alston, but at least we have some improvement; it is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on the changes affecting farming families. At last the Government has recognised that rural Australia is in deep trouble and that farming families are in crisis. It seems to me that there has been a great deal of reluctance on the part of the Labor Party to acknowledge this crisis&mdash;I presume that that is because farmers have never been its natural constituency. However, one only needs to spend some time in rural areas to appreciate that poverty and hardship there is as great as, if not worse than, anywhere else in this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to stop talking; it is time to start offering positive assistance. In preparing for this speech I went back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> of the last few months. Almost everybody in here has at some stage mentioned the problems being faced by rural Australia. In particular, there have been a number of very long and eloquent speeches outlining the problems being faced in our rural communities. Time and time again we have discussed economic and social hardship in country areas. We have talked about declining farms incomes and the falling return on farm assets&mdash;it is down to 0.3 per cent in 1991, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. We have talked about the escalating farm debt; more and more foreclosures; the increase in suicides in rural areas; marriage breakdown; children unable to continue secondary school, let alone go on to university, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that this crisis is unparalleled in post war Australia. Our rural communities are attempting to deal with an unprecedented range of circumstances coming together. This is causing farm incomes to drop to zero and well below. High interest rates, government policies, the slump in commodity and stock prices and drought&mdash;a drought which is now estimated to be affecting 60 per cent of eastern Australia&mdash;have combined to leave rural Australia in despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 11 November 1991 there was a story about the plight of the town of Jericho in central Queensland. The local shire doctor, Melissa Buttini, tells a tale that is common virtually wherever one goes in rural Australia these days. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The article states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural Australia is hurting very badly and farm families need more than just talk. They do not need to put up with any more hand wringing and crocodile tears or listen to any more speeches. What they need is policies, and they need them to be put into action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have a three-step proposal for assisting rural Australia. The first thing we need to do is stabilise the situation. That basically involves a moratorium on all foreclosures; access to income support as needed; further cuts in interest rates; a stop to cutting tariffs and other support, because the farmers are receiving absolutely nothing in return; and the maintenance of community services in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second step is to set the framework for future stability. This involves debt restructuring&mdash;and, for that, legislation is needed&mdash;re-regulation of the financial markets and regional development planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third step involves active and intelligent support from government and strategies that support and promote sectors in which we can thrive, including investment incentives, value adding to primary products and, in particular, supporting Australian research and development. We need import replacement; we need strong and effective anti-dumping legislation; and we need to encourage the population to remain in rural areas.

We need to have very specific, stipulated guidelines put into this Bill that show very clearly that the tools of trade are not included in this assets test. It is no good relying on a letter from the Minister and on a few reassuring words. What we need is legislation in place that specifically excludes the family farm from the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem with an assets test on luxury items&mdash;if, indeed, any farm families still have them. It will certainly catch those elsewhere in Australia who still maintain their second or third block of flats somewhere, units on the Gold Coast or perhaps luxury yachts on Sydney Harbour. Fair enough, include those in the assets test, but it is not fair enough to include farm and small business assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, we were able to combine with the Liberal Party of Australia because it supported us in keeping the assets test off family allowance. At that time a lot was said about the fact that families deserved some support for the additional cost of raising children. We wonder what has changed since last year so that we are now looking at an assets test that includes the family farm. We are certainly still talking about a rural sector in crisis. Indeed, some would argue that the situation is even worse than at the time we had this debate last year. What has changed? Yes, the Government has introduced long overdue hardship provisions, but are these adequate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with interest that the Liberal Party will be moving to take the sunset clause off and, of course, we will be supporting it. But that is only tampering with the edges; tinkering around. What we need to do is make certain, and give the farm community some certainty, that the tools of trade will not be included in this assets test. The only way we can do that is to amend legislation. I will be moving a specific amendment aimed at ensuring that there is no consideration of the family farm in that assets test, and a separate amendment which will also remove from the assets test the tools required by other small business people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hardship provisions in the Bill also provide some additional access to family allowance supplement. What will happen is that some low income families with limited available funds or liquid assets will still qualify for family allowance and family allowance supplement under this package if their net assets are under $600,000; their income is below the married benefit rate of $13,000; and their available liquid funds do not exceed $10,000 for a married couple, or $6,000 for a single person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of the assets test on family allowance, families with assets over that $600,000 threshold can still get family allowance if they meet the same requirements; in other words, that they do not have an income over $13,078 and that their liquid assets are under that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will certainly improve access for some families to FAS. However, the assets test introduced on family allowance will deny it to many farming families who have previously received it and relied upon it. I do not believe it is good enough simply to rely on the Minister's word that there will be no hardship. I believe we need to see changes in this legislation. For a great many farming families, family allowances meant that they could feed their children and, as the President of the National Farmers Federation recently pointed out, the real challenge is not only keeping people on their farms but also ensuring that people get enough money to feed their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday I met with three women from the Murray Valley in New South Wales who were in Canberra to put their view on how rural women were coping and the actual views of rural women in the Murray Valley region to politicians. This group provided me with a number of case studies. Again, the stories are all too familiar. They match those in other parts of the country. I refer in particular to a letter from Jan Outram. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many people in the electorate of Farrer the Family Allowance has been the difference between being able to afford to buy groceries or not. I would like to quote the case of two families in our district.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family 1:  One partner of the farm has a limited amount of relief teaching to cover household expenses but come Christmas holidays when there is six weeks of nil income, she relies wholly and solely on the Family Allowance to feed their family of five.</PARA>
<PARA>For the second family, the family allowance was previously able to be put away for such essentials&mdash;maybe these days they are luxuries&mdash;as school fees and compulsory school uniforms. Today, that family is relying on their family allowance to put food on the table. She also mentions a third case history:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past twelve months we have drawn upon the family savings that our parents have put away for their retirement. Instead of having an adequate retirement that they planned for since the day their own children became independent, they will now be financially dependent upon us until death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are now raising the fourth generation on this farm. With this generation seeing it harder and harder to make a decent living. We are no longer able to build upon our assets and our income is decreasing each year. We do not need the added burden of assets testing to get a Family Allowance payment to meet weekly household expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>This group also made the point, one we have been arguing for quite some time, that farming families need their assets to earn their living. They cannot sell off a piece of the farm here or borrow even more money just to put food on the table. I accept that taxable income is not always the best way to determine who needs support, but I would argue very strongly that we are looking at a sector that is earning this year, on estimate, 0.3 per cent on its assets, and that is certainly a good way to determine who should and who should not receive support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just rural women who are disadvantaged in so many ways by our superannuation and taxation systems. There is a continuing unwillingness to recognise the value of women's unpaid work, particularly when it comes to caring at home for children. Family allowance&mdash;and, prior to that, the child endowment support system&mdash;has been seen as one small way of addressing these inequities. The acceptance of the assets test clearly signals the end to the notion that the family allowance is not a welfare payment. I guess we could argue that with an income test put on it we certainly moved in that direction previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have to trim the fat because of this country's dire economic circumstances, there are many in the community who are asking why it should be Australia's children who are paying and, in particular, why our rural children. It is for these reasons the Australian Democrats will be opposing the assets test on family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Opposition members like to go out into rural areas and portray the Democrats as people who do not understand what is happening. But I would argue very strongly that we have been consistent on these issues. We do understand very well what is happening in rural Australia and I would argue strongly that rural Australians have indeed been abandoned by those politicians they have looked to for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's inability to realise that this is just another example of its lack of understanding about what is happening to the community beyond this place and beyond the offices of Cabinet Ministers is really amazing. As I said, the Democrats will be opposing the introduction of the assets test on family allowance. If that move is unsuccessful, I will be moving two specific amendments. One amendment will remove the assets test on the family farm, and the second amendment will remove the assets test for other small business people. The final amendments I will be moving will exempt work related assets from other assets tests under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are particularly concerned that we should be providing farm families with access to various means of income support available under that Act. Once again in my travels through rural Australia, I have heard many similar stories about farmers being unable to get any sort of income support. One story that keeps cropping up is that of women from farming families who have separated, who have moved off the farm and who cannot&mdash;because they still have a share in that farm&mdash;gain any access to income support at all. These women, usually with dependent children, are not able to be supported by the father because he does not have an adequate income himself&mdash;in other words, the spouse cannot pay any maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I have received a number of letters and had phone calls from elderly people who cannot access the age pension because they still have an interest in the property on which they may have retired. In some cases, they have retired to nearby towns. They cannot now divest this asset. They cannot now pass it onto their children, to the generation that is now working the farm, because they will be caught by deeming provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some provision in the Social Security Act to pay a pension or benefit. The Act makes reference to `if the asset is unrealisable'. What this has basically meant is that people have had to put the farm on the market. The Government has addressed this very recently. I understand there will be legislation before this place in a matter of a week or so that will move to give a few farmers access, and this special income support package is specifically for those facing severe hardship. However, it is going to give very, very limited access to unemployment benefits for very few farmers. It will still involve a considerable amount of red tape. A phone call I received yesterday from Queensland highlighted that many farmers cannot wait the months and months it will take for this benefit to be put in place. If the assets test were now to be taken off for farm families, it would give them access immediately to a variety of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new measure the Government is planning for unemployment benefits apparently will let in about 2,000 farmers throughout the country. A United Farmers and Stock Owners handout from South Australia asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How big is the problem? To date, the Government, both State and Federal, and the major parties, both Liberal and Labor, have failed to understand the size of the problem. As an illustration, the latest changes to the Commonwealth's roads program will, according to the Government's own costings, benefit 300 or 400 families in this State, not the 10,000 who need it.</PARA>
<PARA>So I would argue very strongly that the Government's package is inadequate. What the Opposition is suggesting&mdash;that is, that we rely on a couple of letters and comments from the Minister&mdash;is totally inadequate. We need to see in this legislation specific statements that mean the family farm is excluded from the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I urge Opposition senators to give our amendments some serious consideration. There are two specific amendments and each of them will be moved three times. The first is to remove the assets test for farm families for family allowance; then off family allowance supplement; and, finally, from other pensions and benefits. The second amendment does the same thing for small business people, removing the assets they need to run their business from the assets test for family allowance, family allowance supplement, and then for other pensions and benefits. I argue that we need to redress an injustice that has already existed for far too long, to the detriment of not only farmers and their children but also this country as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill seeks to implement a number of proposals by the Government which will make major changes to our legal system. The Bill seeks to amend the Federal Court of Australia Act and introduce into the Federal jurisdiction, but not into State jurisdiction, the concept of class actions, which has been a feature of the American legal system for many years. However, that is a form of legal proceeding which has never been known in the English legal system, either in the United Kingdom or in Australia; it has also not been taken up in the European legal system in the same form as it appears in the American system. Therefore, the Government's proposals involve major, some would even say revolutionary, changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of adopting in Australia the American system of class actions has been debated here for many years. The reason for the action is said to be the problem that occurs when there are a number of litigants or potential litigants with small claims, the total of which could involve a very large amount indeed. There is always the likelihood that few claimants will commence proceedings at all on their own account because it would be too costly; in other words, it would be too difficult for them to join together in any form of group action, and anyway if a number did pursue their own claims there would be a multiplicity of actions. It is said that the American system, which enables one person to bring an action on behalf of a large number of others who have a similar type of claim arising out of some action or inaction by the defendant, is the answer to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have debated the subject for many years and who are not so impressed with it believe that that problem is greatly overstated. No doubt it was this sort of concern and type of debate that persuaded my predecessor as Attorney-General, Bob Ellicott, to give a reference on this subject to the Law Reform Commission in February 1977. It is interesting to look at the history of the matter in the Commission. The Commission, which was then under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Kirby, as he then was, was not averse to making major changes to the legal system. There was a lot of sympathy for that sort of thing in the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Commission deliberated on this subject for nearly 12 years before it reported. The reference was made in February 1977 and the report was delivered to the Government on 1 October 1988. It was not tabled in the Parliament until 21 December 1988, so almost 12 years elapsed while the Commission deliberated on the problem which it had been given by Bob Ellicott. I do not think it is any secret that the Commission had considerable difficulty in coping with this question or in coming to any conclusions about the appropriate way of dealing with the problem. It did not have difficulty in coping with many other legal problems that it was given by way of references. Indeed, I gave the Commission a number of references when I was Attorney-General, as has the present Government. Although the Commission's reports took time, because it was appropriate that the matters should be properly considered, I am unaware of any other report that took such a long time as the one on the subject of class actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the Law Reform Commission was considerably divided on the subject. Indeed, a former commissioner, who was assigned a major responsibility for a time with this reference, wrote an article on the subject in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> as long ago as 1980 which perhaps reflected the problem that faced the Commission. Therefore, this Government's proposal is by no means self-evident. It has caused great difficulty and a great deal of debate for those who have thought about the matter. I regret to say that it will cause a great deal of division of opinion in this chamber and in another place, if it ever gets there, because the Opposition will oppose the legislation. If that fails, we will propose a number of amendments to the Bill which we hope will give it a more acceptable face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, before I discuss those matters, I would like to deal with the issues themselves and examine whether the Government's proposals should be supported. As I have said, the question with which this legislation deals has had a long gestation. Many had hoped that it would have been stillborn and would not have been brought into the Senate. A number of people would even go so far as to say that it is a monstrosity. To some extent the Government gives some colour to that concern because the speech by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) on this Bill is remarkably bland. It is almost as if he is trying to hide this creature to which the Law Reform Commission gave birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect that, after all these years of struggle in the Law Reform Commission, it was only after Justice Evatt was appointed President of the Commission that this matter suddenly took new life. No doubt she was the driving force in the report of the Commission which advocated what it calls group proceedings, with all sorts of extensions of Federal jurisdiction and revolutionary proposals about contingency fees, assistance funds and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give credit where it is due. I know that he has not fallen for the full Evatt program, and thank God he did not. No doubt support from the Australian Democrats might have been more enthusiastic if he had done so. It really is one of those rather loony proposals that come up from time to time from commissions like the Law Reform Commission. I am glad that the Government has not gone the whole way with it. However, unfortunately I believe that the Government has gone too far. The Opposition is not implacably opposed to trying to solve the problem. Our amendments indicate that we have an alternative proposal which does not go anywhere near as far as the Government's proposals. But we feel that our proposal would command a great deal more support both in the legal and business world and would achieve the same purpose, and I will deal with that in a little more detail later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's second reading speech to this Bill is interesting. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new representative proceeding provided in the Bill is based on the existing representative action procedure in the Federal Court and in State Supreme Courts.</PARA>
<PARA>I regret to say that statement is simply not correct. Where one person can bring an action in a court not on behalf of himself and specified people, no matter how many there may be, is a representative action. But for a person to be able to bring an action where he or she purports to bring it on behalf of an uncertain number of people, not specified in any way, except in general terms that they would have a common interest, where the ultimate judgment is for a sum of money which does not reflect accurately the damages established by all those people&mdash;many of whom would not even know the procedures on foot, yet their rights would be very considerably affected as we will also see in this debate&mdash;is something quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I have called the Minister's speech bland. Were I allowed to in this chamber&mdash;which I probably would not be&mdash;I would refer to it in an even less flattering way than that, given that the Minister says that the legislation is based on existing representative actions available in our existing system. The Minister does say&mdash;I have already commended this&mdash;that he has not adopted the Law Reform Commission's group proceedings approach or the extension of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia for such proceedings. I am in two minds about the question of the extension of jurisdiction in this area. I will say something about that in a moment as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very bland and misleading to say that the Government has not adopted the Commission's group proceedings. It may be that that is literally true, given the special definition in the report. The fact of the matter is that the Government has adopted a proceeding which is basically the same proposal. Let us not mince words about it. It is a question of whether we are having a class action along the lines of the American system or whether we will seek to improve the existing representative action that has long standing and experience in our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already indicated the problems which this Bill seeks to address. As I said, the problem is that a number of people with claims arising out of a very similar set of circumstances, perhaps in cases created by one defendant, have to have a multiplicity of action. Some people do not even start the cases at all and it is alleged that there has been an injustice. Our legal system&mdash;based on the United Kingdom system, which includes the English and Scottish system, and the European system&mdash;has a different solution to the problem; namely, representative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem in this case is that the representative action approach was not working as well as it could about the time that this debate started in Australia. Although I cannot speak for him, when my former colleague Bob Ellicott gave this reference I think he may well have had it in mind that something less ambitious and less revolutionary than the pure American class action might have been the solution. I know that he used the words `class action' in his reference. I think that was unfortunate. I certainly would not have used that expression had I been giving the Law Reform Commission a reference. Nevertheless, I think there are other ways of looking at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the Minister seems to think that representative actions would be some sort of solution, but, unfortunately, as I said, they were not working very well in the 1970s when this debate was going on. Since then there have been major improvements in representative action. The person starting the representative action has to be specific as to the people he is representing. That seems to be a reasonable proposition. A representative action also had some procedural limitations as to the sorts of claims that could be brought under it. That is something that has now been overcome both in England and in Australia in some of the State jurisdictions and certainly in the Federal jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government and the Minister do not fully appreciate the extent of the improvements that have now been made in some cases by legislation but mainly by rules of court and the decisions of judges. The representative action has now reached a stage where, if a government introduced this legislation by a statute&mdash;I am certainly not objecting to that&mdash;in relation to the Federal Court in a different way, we would not have any objection to it. Indeed, quite recently a judge of the Federal Court, Mr Justice Wilcox, using the Federal Court rules, allowed a claim where 116 people were in a group on behalf of whom the claim was being brought. We cannot say that a representative action is something that is not workable where there are a large number of plaintiffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me summarise the objections that we have to this approach to the class action. Firstly, in our view, it is unnecessary because the representative action can be extended and improved, if necessary, to do the job. I believe that if we adopted that system in the Federal Court of Australia Act the State jurisdictions that have not brought their system up to date would follow suit. Indeed, with the cross-vesting now available as a solution to these conflicts of jurisdiction, Federal and State, I would have no objection to the whole thing applying through the cross-vesting system which does not occur in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is a totally new concept for our legal system and it has not been adopted in legal systems in the United Kingdom or the European Community. This legislation seems to be part and parcel of the Government's proposals for a new product liability law, greatly extending the availability and easing the proof of product liability claims, which has frightened a large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Minister indicated only the other day that he proposes to modify those rather unfortunate proposals that were made. I wonder why the Minister, when he took such a positive step in those cases, does not also reconsider this proposal. The two are combined. They are certainly combined in the minds of those small sections of the community which are pushing very hard. They wanted this easy product liability law and the class action in order to enforce new and easy methods of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third objection against this legislation is that it will introduce new and uncertain burdens on our court system. As I said, it is a revolutionary proposal. It will encourage more litigation. Fortunately, as the Government has not picked up some of the other aspects, the legislation may not encourage more litigation as much as Justice Evatt and the Law Reform Commission's proposals would have done. We already have an enormous expansion of work in the court system, both Federal and State. We are training more and more lawyers and we are starting to become a community nearly as legally driven as is the United States community. I do not think we ought to be encouraging this system any further. This sort of new facility will only add to the work of the courts and the cost of litigation, and it will be a bonanza for lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth objection to this legislation is one which I have already touched on: it will be available only under Federal jurisdiction. I am very surprised that the Government would take this retrograde step. For years, including when we were in government, we have been looking&mdash;as has this Government, the former Attorneys-General, particularly Mr Lionel Bowen, and I am sure Senator Tate as well&mdash;at ways and means to minimise the problem of having Federal and State jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to copy the American system, as they are doing here, they ought to look at the terrible confusion that has always been the case in America which is caused by having a Federal court system and a State court system. When we set up the Federal Court we started down that track. It soon became evident to us when we were in government&mdash;and it was clearly evident to Mr Lionel Bowen&mdash;that it was not a sensible direction in which to go and that we needed to bring the Federal and State jurisdictions together. One of the really commendable reforms to our legal system by this Government &mdash;the proposal came out of the constitutional convention process, but was taken up by Mr Lionel Bowen&mdash;was the very radical proposal to have cross-vesting of jurisdiction between Federal and State courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not been close enough to see how the legal system has been operating in recent years, but I understand it is working very well and has ironed out most of the problems. Yet a Bill has been brought in which goes in quite the reverse direction. In this Bill, the Government is saying that this new proceeding will not be available where the Federal Court gets jurisdiction under the cross-vesting legislation. We ought to be moving further. Having recognised the problem, the Government ought to be moving to integrate totally our court system in Australia and get rid of Federal and State conflicts completely if we possibly can. We were going in the right direction; I think this is going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another objection to these proposals&mdash;which is perhaps on a more philosophical plane&mdash;is that the class action can be brought on behalf of people who do not know about it. People are given a chance to opt out if they do know about it, are not happy with it and want to conduct their own proceedings. That is a redeeming feature of this Bill. But most class actions will be taken on behalf of an indeterminate number of people, and a lot of people will be brought in and have their legal rights determined without even knowing that this is occurring. In many cases, they will not care. Our court system is based on the fact that individuals make their own decisions to initiate proceedings; it is done by the conscious decisions of individuals. That is what ought to happen; people ought to take responsibility for whether they want to start proceedings. But under this Bill they become part of a system without knowing, or perhaps even caring. It really goes against the philosophical basis of our legal system and affects the individual rights of people to make those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, additional costs and expenses will be imposed upon unsuccessful defendants. If plaintiffs succeed in these cases, large sums of money will have to be determined and made available. When judgments are made, notices will go out to the newspapers far and wide. Under the American system, when claims have been settled, judges have awarded rights to people in Australia and all parts of the world. They receive notices and they can come in and get their cut of the cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will clearly create additional costs for business&mdash;for example, higher insurance costs&mdash;which will be passed on to the consumer. The average consumer could well be worse off because of the higher prices he or she will have to pay for goods in order to cover these costs. This legislation is said to be in favour of the consumer and those few people who have not themselves bothered to take any action about their claimed loss. It may be of benefit to those people&mdash;and, as I have said, those people do not need to be in Australia, if the American system is any guide&mdash;but the ordinary, average consumer will probably pay more as a result of this facility which the Government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is pretty clear that the Government is yet again giving in to a very vocal, noisy lobby group in the consumer area. There is an element in this area, like there is in the green movement, which proposes extreme solutions to problems. Clearly, there are problems with consumer rights. I am not saying that they should not be attended to, but there is a point at which these things can be taken too far. The Government has clearly given in&mdash;it probably believes it survived in the last election only because it pandered to the extreme greenies. It is pandering to these very noisy elements in the consumer movement and hopes to survive by pleasing a few of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a host of reasons&mdash;legal, practical, philosophical and political&mdash;why this Bill should not be passed in its present form. Because the Bill seems to the Opposition to be going along the wrong course, we will oppose the second reading of it. However, if we do not succeed in that regard, we have circulated a number of amendments and I will explain our alternative if that comes about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, we are saying that instead of having a system where an indeterminate number of people, unbeknownst to them, can be swept up in litigation, only having the right to opt out if they happen to learn about it&mdash;and that may not be the case&mdash;the Government should have introduced a system which would improve the representative action and give people the right to opt in to an action which had been commenced on behalf of the group. A person might start off representing 100 people, but find that a few more want to join&mdash;maybe even another 100 people.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is basically our alternative proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats welcome and support the Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1991. Indeed, we congratulate the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and his Department for bringing it before the Senate. We are strong advocates of the concept of group proceedings, as provided for in this legislation. Indeed, if we have a criticism to make, it is that this Bill is long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process which has led to its introduction began in February 1977 when the then Fraser Government asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the matter of class actions. The Commission's report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court</EMPHASIS>, was not tabled in this place until almost 12 years later in December 1988. Even though that report contained fully drafted legislation, it has taken three more years for the Government to put forward a Bill which is quite similar in effect to the recommendations of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This delay is perhaps indicative of the ill-founded hostility and alarm which the spectre of representative proceedings, as they are termed in the legislation, has provoked in the business community in particular. Yet any careful reading of the legislation makes it clear that these fears are unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there are some critical defects in this legislation which, if left uncorrected, will seriously undermine the public interest advantages that are supposed to flow from it. The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments at the committee stage to remove some of these defects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be supporting the Opposition's amendments which, in our view, would gut the Bill. In this matter, as in so many others, we feel that the Liberal Party of Australia is being a mouthpiece for the nervous Nellies in the business community who do not realise that cutting out shonky operators will be not only to the benefit of ethical practice but also to the benefit of those companies which are concerned about serving consumers and being competitive in domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have shown a longstanding commitment in this place to grouped proceedings. In an attempt to spur the Government to implement the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, former Senator Haines adopted the Commission's proposed legislation and introduced it in 1989 as a private member's Bill called the Federal Court (Grouped Proceedings) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a founding principle of our Party that the public interest demands that access to the courts be made easier and less costly for those with limited means. Grouped proceedings are a step in that direction. It is therefore pleasing to see that our work and the campaigning of many other organisations, such as the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, has at last borne fruit. But the greatest credit must go to the Law Reform Commission, whose report on this matter is of outstanding quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summarising the case for grouped proceedings, I can do no better than quote the Commission's conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An effective grouping procedure is needed as a way of reducing the cost of enforcing legal remedies in cases of multiple wrongdoing. Such a procedure could enable people who suffer loss or damage in common with others as a result of a wrongful act of omission by the same respondent to enforce their legal rights in the courts in a cost effective manner. It could overcome the cost and other barriers which impede people from pursuing a legal remedy. People who may be ignorant of their rights or fearful of embarking on proceedings could be assisted to a remedy if one member of the group, all similarly affected, could commence proceedings on behalf of all members. The grouping of claims could also promote efficiency in the use of resources by enabling common issues to be dealt with together. Appropriate grouping procedures are an essential part of the legal systems' response to multiple wrongdoing in an increasingly complex world.</PARA>
<PARA>The core of the issue is that the actions of corporations and government departments can have adverse impact on millions of people. It is an unarguable matter of efficiency, equity and justice that where large numbers of people have been affected they should be able to seek redress through grouped proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the Commission cited numerous examples where lower costs and greater efficiency could be achieved if grouped proceedings were available. For example, more than 300 workers afflicted with the asbestos related disease, mesothelioma, brought individual actions against CSR Ltd, its subsidiary, Mimalco, and the Western Australian Government requiring common issues of law to be determined in each individual case. This was also necessary in the hundreds of damages claims by bushfire victims against the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. Other cases cited include misleading advertising by a credit union and a college, losses by cruise passengers, damages for discrimination, defective software and the chemical pollution of oyster farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Commission's conclusions, after detailed and thorough examination, that existing court procedures do not offer equivalent advantages to grouped proceedings, the business community, and in particular a working party composed of various organisations of the business community, have publicly claimed that the need for grouped proceedings has not been demonstrated. They also fear that the cost to business will be disproportionately high, that excessive litigation will be encouraged and that consumer groups will use the new procedure to pursue political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These criticisms rest on the assumption that the Federal Court, on which this Bill confers wide discretion in the execution of representative proceedings, will prove itself to be so incompetent and, indeed, so naive that it cannot prevent such consequences arising. These claims are a reflection on the Federal Court, not on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, it is utterly predictable but nevertheless disappointing that the Opposition is prepared to gut a Bill which the Democrats consider to be a major demonstration of progress in the administration of justice in Australia. The Opposition has proposed a series of amendments which would restrict the applicability of representative proceedings to the point that they would be almost unusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Opposition's amendments, group members would be required to have claims arising from exactly the same circumstances giving rise to exactly the same issues of law or fact and they must seek exactly the same form of relief. This is a quite transparent attempt to narrow the range of possible actions to a point where they almost disappear. The amendments would also reverse the opt out provision in the Bill whereby persons are included as group members unless they apply to be excluded&mdash;in other words, to make it an opt in provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats recognise that issues of civil liberties arise here but the practical implications of being included in a group without one's knowledge are virtually nil. On the other hand, the potential for representative proceedings to deliver justice to the disempowered and the poor will be greatly enhanced if they are automatically eligible to receive the benefits of a finding in the group's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's intention is clearly to protect people who break the law to the detriment of large numbers of people from the consequences of their actions. Somehow this is supposed to benefit the business community. In fact, the reverse is true. As I have said before, businesses with ethical and lawful practices will benefit if their shonky competitors are more readily brought to justice. What the Opposition is proposing would keep Australian business ethics at their current low level, which everyone agrees must be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to be misunderstood as saying that all businesses currently have low ethical practices. However, in the late 1980s we saw examples of many high fliers and sharp operators giving the business community a bad reputation. I believe that we must take every opportunity to exclude those bad apples&mdash;if I may use that expression&mdash;from the business community, the overwhelming majority of whose members are prepared to follow proper ethical practices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' support for this Bill is qualified by a number of reservations. First, the Bill specifies that representative proceedings may not be brought in relation to any cause of action arising before the date of proclamation. This is a sop to those people who are opposing the intent of this Bill. It has no legal or, indeed, moral justification, given the Government's admission that the Bill confers no new legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems contrary to the policy objective of this Bill to make it impossible for people who have suffered at the hands of organisations, government departments or businesses, not to be allowed to use a better procedure which is now available. This provision will disadvantage large groups of people in the community, including AIDS sufferers in New South Wales and in other States, and many others. The Australian Democrats express great regret that the Government has seen fit to pay attention to the representations from pressure groups&mdash;as Senator Durack so correctly said&mdash;which in this case have suggested that insurance companies will suffer if this time limitation is not introduced. I will be interested to hear the justification of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) for this provision and, as I understand it, the Government's reluctance to support our amendment to remove it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill allows a representative proceeding to be stopped or stayed if the cost of distributing compensation funds is excessive in relation to the amount claimed. It also allows respondents to receive any undistributed compensation funds. This provision allows any outfit which has ripped off the public to keep or retrieve the spoils, provided that there are large numbers of people affected who cannot be contacted except at high cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this sends the wrong message to the business community and that, indeed, it is wrong in principle. Why should people who have ripped off the public benefit because of some mechanical defect in the process? We believe that a cy-pres mechanism, under which undistributed compensation funds are channelled to the next best recipient, is a far more satisfactory approach. We are assured by the Consumer Credit Legal Service that there has been an increasing acceptance of this principle in the business community. One dispute in Victoria, over the awarding of a credit providers licence, was resolved in part by the establishment of a cy-pres fund. Accordingly, our amendments provide for the group representative to direct unclaimed compensation to a Commonwealth, State or Territory legal aid fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to us by the Government that there are constitutional problems in allowing the Federal Court to allocate funds in that this could be identified as taxation. On the advice available to us, our amendment avoids this problem by allowing the redirection of compensation funds only on application by the group representatives. In other words, we are suggesting that people who are entitled to certain moneys simply exercise their right to assign their property to others. That can hardly be construed as taxation. We say that the decision as to where the funds should go is a matter for the affected group entitled to the funds, not for the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I wish to commend the Government for the principle of the Bill, which is a major advance in providing greater access to the legal system. It is parallel to the cost of justice inquiry which was pressed for vigorously by the Australian Democrats and by Senator Schacht, and which is now pursued no less vigorously by the Cooney committee, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate on this very important Bill. I believe this Bill will introduce a means whereby those many people who might be affected by a particular action of a person or corporation in our society will be able to obtain the relief to which they are entitled. I do not believe this particular proposal will lead Australia to go down the United States road&mdash;as it is sometimes referred to&mdash;and become an overly litigious society, such as in the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Class Action</EMPHASIS>, which I know you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have seen and believe has merit as a film. I do not think we are going down that road by means of this proposal because we have set our face firmly against some features of the American legal system, such as contingency fees, which appear, from my observations over there recently, to drive the American legal system rather than the merits of the issues themselves. It is important that people who have a legal right be given an opportunity to assert that right in the proper forum of the court so that it might be adjudicated upon. That is what we are providing for in this proposal for enhanced representative proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important to make clear&mdash;certainly, it is in my mind and I hope by now in the mind of any fair-minded commentator from the business community&mdash;that this proposal is not inseparably, inevitably linked with the question of product liability. One of the great benefits of this piece of legislation will be that it will probably be a means by which actions by shareholders and others in contravention of corporations law might take place: actions against company officers for false statements and takeover documents; contravention of fundraising provisions; and actions for loss or damages as a result of market rigging, insider trading or market manipulation. The enhancement of the rights of many shareholders to take this sort of representative proceeding will be a great aid to the more formal regulators, such as the Australian Securities Commission, in ensuring compliance with the corporations law. I am quite convinced in my own mind that, if shareholders had had such representative proceeding available to them during the latter part of the 1980s, at a time when regulation was so weak under the National Companies and Securities Commission,<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> for reasons to do not with the initial idea of the structure of it, which at the time Senator Durack established it was a very good example of cooperative federalism&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the States starved that institution of the money needed to enforce those laws that were agreed upon at the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities. I am getting a little off to one side. What I am trying to say is that I believe this procedure will be of great assistance in ensuring that, in the area of the corporations law, not only the Australian Securities Commission but shareholders will be given an enhanced capacity to ensure that they can get those remedies which flow from contravention of the corporations law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to say that there is a real need in Australian society for this type of procedure. Certainly, when one looks at the English model, upon which most of the rules of court relating to representative proceedings in Australian jurisdictions are based, it does not provide the capacity to deal with the modern phenomenon, for example, of claims against pharmaceutical companies. In fact, when I was in England recently I discovered that the court was trying to grapple with 1,500 separate claims which were being processed in relation to a particular pharmaceutical. The Australian jurisdiction has followed the English model until now, except in Victoria where it has an opt-in procedure, put there after the bushfires tragedy specifically to try to provide a process to deal with those particular types of actions. The Federal Court rule makes it very clear, and it is typical of the rules in Australian jurisdictions. Order 6 rule 13(i) provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding the proceeding may be commenced, and, unless the Court otherwise orders, continued, by or against any one or more of them as representing all or as representing all except one or more of them.</PARA>
<PARA>What is important about that is that it has to be understood that in those representative proceedings the procedure is not an opt-in procedure, despite lots of misrepresentations&mdash;or misunderstandings would be fairer&mdash;on the part of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present representative actions in the Federal Court and in other Australian jurisdictions, except Victoria for the reason I mentioned, do allow actions on behalf of unidentified persons. They do not require consent in their representative actions. There is no requirement to name the persons represented. Persons who do not want to be represented must apply to become defendants, but in any case they are bound by the decision; they cannot opt out. I regarded that as an infringement of the rights of the persons who might otherwise be in that group. That is why the opt-out procedure has been decided upon. I do not think it is right that persons in the group should lose all their rights to bring separate proceedings if they so wished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The English rule that we have adopted so that the plaintiff becomes the self-elected representative of the others&mdash;and he certainly does not have to obtain their consent&mdash;has to be modified by this opt-out proposal. The model now in the representative area works an injustice; it strips the individual of an opportunity, his freedom of right, to bring his own case. Therefore, under proposed new section 33J of the Bill we have a procedure which is headed, `Right of group member to opt out'. It is a right and that is why it has to be emphasised&mdash;not that I believe in fact that it will be much exercised, because quite clearly it is a very expensive process to opt out and mount one's own case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States experience, based on a paper provided to me, although written some decade ago, indicates that perhaps one per cent of group members might opt out and that of those only a very few actually mount their own actions. Our legal officer in the Washington Embassy, Mr Brian O'Callaghan, has made extensive inquiries and has been able to find nothing that really refutes that experience reflected in that paper. But the right has to be acknowledged and that is what we are doing in this enhanced representative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is true that the courts in Australia, as in the United Kingdom, have tried to be more flexible, particularly with the joinder of plaintiffs procedure in the very case which Senator Durack mentioned&mdash;I think he mentioned Mr Justice Wilcox in the Federal Court of Australia in relation to a case conducting that; it was done under the joinder of plaintiffs rule rather than the representative rule&mdash;it is interesting that the head note to that in the Federal Court reports reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regret expressed that the provisions relating to grouped proceedings such as those recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission were not enforced in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA>By the way, I make it very clear that I am not saying that Mr Justice Wilcox supports this Bill. I would not try to trespass on the proper distinction between the arms of government and I am not hereby saying that the Federal Court of Australia applauds and supports this piece of legislation; that is a matter for the Executive Government and this Parliament. But at page 314 of his judgment Mr Justice Wilcox said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there were in force in this Court provisions relating to grouped proceedings, such as those recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report `Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court' (ALRC 46), it would have been possible for the Court to determine all common questions of fact or law at a single hearing in such a manner as to make the result binding on all applicants and all respondents.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result would have been to avoid the repetition in each of the later cases of most of the evidence in this case, with consequential savings in costs and the earlier finalisation of the whole litigation. But that recommendation has not become law. So it will be necessary to deal with each of the cases separately.</PARA>
<PARA>And he goes on. So there is an indication that even the Federal Court, under its more flexible joinder of plaintiffs process, indicates that there would be merit in moving somewhere along the lines of the ALRC report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not gone as far as that report in some respects but I believe that we have come up with a very workable proposal which gives persons who want to vindicate their rights the opportunity and preserves the rights of individual litigants to opt out but&mdash;and I emphasise this point, as did Senator Spindler &mdash;preserves at all times the supervisory powers of the Federal Court to ensure that the process is not abused. In fact, proposed new section 33ZF states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any proceeding (including an appeal) conducted under this Part, the Court may, of its own motion or on application by a party or a group member, make any order the Court thinks appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very good declaration, a statutory recognition, of the proper role of the court in everything that it does in this area. It goes on in proposed new section 33ZG to deal with vexatious litigants and matters such as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a proposal which should commend itself to the chamber. The second reading of this Bill merits support and I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

I do not agree with most of what is in it, but if we are lumbered with the Bill, it is an easy Bill to deal with. It is a good example of what I would hope the Commonwealth Parliamentary Counsel would achieve more often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I do not need to repeat the Opposition's objections to the extent to which this Bill takes the availability of group proceedings. The amendments that I have moved are designed to amend the Federal Court Act in a way which gives effect to what we think is the appropriate form of group proceedings, namely, the extension of a representative action, well-known in our jurisdiction in the past, mainly in State courts, of course, but in the Federal Court in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of being able to take proceedings on behalf of an identified number of named people, which may be a difficulty under the present system, the Government proposes a system whereby the proceedings are taken and people have to opt out. Obviously, they cannot opt out if they do not know about it, and many will not know about it. If it is an extension of individual rights, it will be somewhat ham fisted in its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing situation where there is a mixture of rules of court, decisions of judges and, in some cases&mdash;I think, in Victoria or South Australia&mdash;a statutory provision, is not satisfactory. That is why the Opposition has brought forward this alternative which will amend the Federal Court Act and overcome a lot of the existing deficiencies in representative action through the opting in procedure which these amendments are designed to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there may be debate about certain aspects of these amendments. There may be deficiencies in them, even from the point of view of what we are seeking to achieve. However, it seems as though the Government and the Australian Democrats are not going to support the amendments. Therefore, I see no point in making another speech in relation to the subject. We have already debated whether we will have an opting in or an opting out form of group proceedings at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that the Government's form is, in fact, the class action. We have no objection to people grouping together and saving costs on all sides, saving court time and so on. That is what we seek to achieve with this alternative proposal. In many ways, what we want to achieve would be satisfied by going as far as these amendments would suggest. However, that is not going to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, our proposal to omit section 33M is based on the fact that we believe that under our proposal the Court does not need to have the number of powers that it has under the Government's proposal. Our system would leave people and their legal advisers free to make most of the decisions themselves. They do not need the Court acting as a nanny to the extent required under the Government's proposal. The Government's proposal is much more court controlled and interventionist than ours is. However, as I have said, if the Opposition's proposals are not accepted with respect to proposed clause 3&mdash;as I do not expect them to be&mdash;and the decision of the Committee is to support the Government's proposal, I will not propose amendment No. 7. That is the position that the Opposition is adopting. Perhaps that will facilitate the progress of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to ensure that people who have suffered an injustice or damage and have a current cause of action are able to avail themselves of these provisions. As the Minister has confirmed, the Bill does not in any way create new legal rights. We are simply enabling people who have a current cause of action to adopt a procedure which is cheaper and easier for them to engage in; in other words, a procedure which gives them access to our legal system. The attempt by the Government in this particular clause to ensure that only those causes of action can be dealt with under this procedure which arise after the proclamation of the Bill is contrary to the intent of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be opposing this particular amendment. The limitation of the Bill to those causes of action arising after its commencement is a sensible one. We believe that the Federal Court can now be prepared to accept this increased workload which will flow from the enabling of those who have a cause of action arising after its commencement to band together in the enhanced representative proceedings provided for in this legislation.

They have been able to factor those into their insurance premiums.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will oppose the Australian Democrats amendment to make these new proceedings retrospective. In the reasons given by the Minister, he now seems to have found a greater concern about burdens on the court than he has hitherto shown in this debate. I welcome that. But the overwhelming reason why the Democrats amendment should not be accepted is the second reason that the Minister gave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is a classic example of the way the Democrats think. They present themselves as great believers in civil rights, human rights, fairness and all the rest of it. What could be more unfair to defendants who, as the Minister said, have not been able to cover themselves for new liabilities that are going to be created if this amendment goes through? Clearly, and I have already dealt with this objection, the new and not inconsiderable burden of this legislation on the business community&mdash;let us not worry about the cowboy types that the Minister is concerned about&mdash;is going to fall to a large extent upon producers of products; even though it is not necessarily contained as part and parcel of the product liability legislation. I can see the wider justification and I accept what the Minister says about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the consumer movements and the people the Democrats claim to represent here will in the end pay enough as it is. But now the Democrats are going to be saying, `Well, it doesn't matter about all those people who have produced products and haven't covered themselves sufficiently for insurance. That doesn't matter. They can go to hell. We want all these retrospective liabilities to be created'. They do not give any consideration to the rights of people in the business world. It is a one-sided typically Democrat approach to everything that we see in this chamber. There is a major matter of principle involved here. It is a principle that the Democrats obviously do not respect or even consider; namely, the rights of the defendants. They are all for the rights of plaintiffs and they want to extend them. They could not give a damn about the rights of defendants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must respond to the claim made by Senator Durack that what we are suggesting has a retrospective effect. What we are talking about is a legal right that is in existence. It is not retrospective. What we are saying is that people who have a cause of action should have the possibility to avail themselves of procedures which would make it easier for them to pursue their claim under an existing cause of action. Indeed, if it is a choice between people who have done wrong in the business world or wherever&mdash;who have caused some people damage or loss&mdash;we believe the rights of people must take precedence over the imagined rights of those who have perpetrated these losses. It is quite clear that what we are talking about is giving people a chance to recover for damage that has been caused to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

In these circumstances, the Australian Democrats are proud to be on the side of the consumer who has been done damage. I press the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has only dug himself further into his morass of ignorance about the way the world works. He seems to think that the defendants in these cases are full of moral turpitude. The Minister has instanced the commercial cowboys and so on, but I am talking about the business people who, in many cases, may have strict liabilities imposed upon them by the law; that liability is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that it is not retrospective in that sense, but the fact is that in a large number of these cases liability would arise under fairly technical rules in the law of contract and tort. In the case of contract, it might be some very technical matter of construction of a contract, involving purely legal argument and where there is no sense of wrongdoing, as the Democrats seem to see it. They seem to see business people as all being engaged in some sort of wrongdoing most of the time. </PARA>

That is why anybody with any sense&mdash;it might be businessmen, it might be professional people, most of whom do have sense&mdash;will have insured against this sort of liability. With all the goodwill in the world, the probity and everything else that Senator Spindler talks about, there is no way one can be sure of not being found to have civil liability in a court. Indeed, the way our criminal law is developing, a number of people are surprised to find themselves in the criminal courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about wide civil liabilities that are imposed by the law on people for many reasons and in many circumstances, and it is only fair that those people should be able to insure themselves and cover themselves; and prudent business and professional people do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to reports concerning the shooting of people in Dili yesterday and earlier reports of the deaths of two men in Dili on 29 October. What are the facts presently known to the Australian Government concerning the incident in Dili yesterday? When did the Government first become aware of that incident? What were the circumstances of the deaths on 29 October? What action has been taken by the Indonesian Government in relation to these deaths? What steps have been taken to convey to the Indonesian Government the concern of the Australian Government that all such incidents are fully investigated and appropriate action taken to bring to account any members of the security forces guilty of violation of human rights?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3036" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on this issue. I know it is of concern to members of all political parties, on both sides in both Houses. The Government is deeply disturbed by the reports to which Senator Hill refers. In respect of the incident on 29 October, I do not have much detailed information. I will seek to obtain that for Senator Hill. Although the details of a recent incident are unclear, it is now evident that an appalling tragedy has occurred in Dili in which many people have been killed. The number is not available at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequent upon this, the Indonesian Ambassador was called to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning and the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta has been instructed to call on the authorities there. Through these channels, we have asked the Indonesian Government for urgent information about what exactly happened in Dili yesterday. We have urged the Indonesian Government to conduct a thorough investigation and publish a full and factual account of what happened and why. We have said that we expect that those responsible for breaches of human rights should be appropriately dealt with. Those three issues go to some of the gravamen of the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans, who is overseas, has been asked to discuss the matter with Dr Alatas, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, in Seoul where they are attending the APEC ministerial meeting together. An officer of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta is on his way to Dili to see what he can find out about this incident. His inquiries will include the investigation of reports that an Australian aid worker was present at the event and may also have been injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning, the Indonesian Ambassador said that the Indonesian Government was viewing yesterday's events very seriously and would undertake a thorough investigation and that it regrets the deaths which have occurred. The Ambassador gave officials an account of the incident based on preliminary reports. He said that violence had erupted following an attack by demonstrators on an Indonesian army officer. Of course, we are not in a position to assess the accuracy of conflicting reports of the incident, but we certainly welcome the Indonesian Government's acknowledgment of the seriousness of it and its decision to undertake an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also indicate that the Australian and Indonesian governments have worked hard on the basis of goodwill on both sides to build a responsible and beneficial relationship between our two countries. In that relationship, East Timor has always been an area of concern. We have recognised Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor. We have consistently expressed our concerns about human rights abuses there. I say again that we encourage the Indonesian Government to deal with this tragedy openly in accordance with the international standards of respect for human rights to which both countries subscribe.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage I do not think that we have a clear picture as to what occurred at all, except to say that there were a number of deaths. Obviously, I am not in a position to relay the Indonesian version of events which was conveyed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the Ambassador this morning other than that which I said the Ambassador had said: that there was a serious situation and a number of deaths had occurred. He also offered a comment on an attack on an Indonesian officer. If any information comes to hand, I will make it available. I think it will depend on a number of issues, discussions in Jakarta and the visit of an Australian official to Dili.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>Third Runway at Sydney Airport</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="3037" SPEAKER="Loosley Sen S." NAMEID="BS4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I refer to the debate about the future airport needs of Sydney. Is the Minister aware of claims that the construction of a major airport at Badgerys Creek would create 50,000 new jobs in western regional Sydney? What is the Minister's assessment of these claims? Are such claims correct?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3037" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted these claims. They are significant claims in a time of need to create genuine new jobs. Unfortunately, the claims are not correct. As I have said before in this chamber, a lot of people do not appreciate the extent of employment that currently exists at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport&mdash;KSA. Sydney Airport currently has a situation where 45,000 people rely on it directly for their jobs. A great many of these 45,000 people not only work at Sydney Airport but also live in the electorates adjacent to the airport and are ably represented in this Parliament by a number of Labor members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correct analysis to use for Badgerys Creek is the directed international airport option. That is the only one that generates a maximum amount of employment. That option of a directed international airport at Badgerys Creek would cost in the vicinity of $2 billion and would result in direct airport employment at Badgerys Creek of 28,300 people by the year 2010. The difficulty is that this figure has to be discounted by the fact that 10,000 of those jobs would simply be transferred from KSA to Badgerys Creek; therefore, they would not be new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flow-on employment at Badgerys Creek would only be about 6,000. The reason for that is that a great deal of the indirect employment generated at Badgerys Creek would be sourced elsewhere in Sydney; that is, around the current support facilities that are located near the existing Sydney Airport. The total employment at Badgerys Creek from a directed international airport would be about 34,500, not the 50,000 mentioned. As I said before, that would have to be discounted by the 10,000 jobs that would simply be transferred from KSA to Badgerys Creek, which would give a net figure of 24,500 new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of genuine new employment anticipated to be generated at KSA by the increased growth that will be served by the third runway is 13,000 jobs directly employed at the airport and a further 13,000 employed indirectly. That is a total of 26,000 new jobs that will arise as a result of the KSA development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the difference between that 26,000 and the 24,500 I mentioned at Badgerys Creek arises because the airport at Badgerys Creek would be non-commercial&mdash;a directed international would be profoundly non-commercial&mdash;and those jobs would be created by what would be, in effect, a giant RED scheme; whereas the 26,000 jobs created at KSA would all be sustainable jobs funded directly by the industry in which those people work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Why did his ACTU accord partner yesterday reject the Minister's much vaunted industrial relations law review package? What role did Keating campaigner Bill Kelty play in its rejection? Are any of the Government's planned fourth term major reforms likely to be achieved with a change of leadership?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3038" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been involved in consultation on industrial relations reform with employers and unions for the past 12 months. Indeed, we have succeeded in making some important reforms already. Last year, honourable senators will recall, we amended the Federal Industrial Relations Act for the purpose of encouraging union amalgamations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the question of industrial relations reform is a continuing issue. The key question for the Government is: what is the appropriate type of industrial relations system for Australia? The secondary question is: how does one give legal integrity to that system? By stating that, it is clear that this is a complex and difficult issue and that there are many points of view about it. We start from a situation in which the parties are polarised on this matter. So far, it is fair to say that there is no consensus as to what a reasonable outcome will be. We intend to press on and work at achieving that as far as it can possibly be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to indicate our views to the community as to what we think is the direction of that reform, honourable senators will remember that some weeks back in this chamber I made a major statement about industrial relations reform which, while not applauded by the Opposition, was certainly acclaimed by the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the ACTU and others. Since then the national wage case decision has come down, in fact, complementing the very things I said in my parliamentary statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultations are not complete. As I have said, we will continue to talk to try to refine and define a package which I can bring forth to this chamber and this Parliament in order to enact what I think is a very important reform to the industrial relations system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of an interview which took place this morning on Hobart radio with the Green Independent, Christine Milne, MHA, in which she accused the Minister and his Department of deliberately frustrating a visit to Australia by representatives of Organocell-Thyssen? In light of the potential importance of this technology to Tasmanian forests, can the Minister tell the Senate whether the Thyssen visit will proceed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3038" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am vaguely aware of it, but I am now more aware than I was a second or two ago of the interview which took place between Dr Werner Greve and Christine Milne about a proposed visit to Australia by Organocell-Thyssen which has been postponed. There is a fair bit of misinformation being spread about what has transpired. I suspect it has more to do with the Greens' approach to forestry issues in general rather than any real concern about Organocell, because they have certainly not made any representations to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the visit, which was to be held this week, being postponed involved the practical difficulties relating to the appointments with key people whom the delegation wanted to see in Tasmania and other States, including Canberra. It turned out that arranging a visit which was a qualitative one in terms of the people it would meet was just not possible, and to bring Organocell-Thyssen out from Germany for a tour of that kind would not be in the best interests of anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are working on arrangements for a quality tour by Organocell early next year. The visit will continue to be arranged by the Commonwealth, but will be done in consultation with other interested States&mdash;particularly Tasmania, which has an obvious interest in obtaining the most environmentally sensitive and cost effective pulping technology available. My office has been in contact with Mr Llewellyn, the Tasmanian Minister for Forests, and confirmed again our strong interest in the technology and in the visit proceeding and recognised that it is a matter of priority for the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the honourable senator that there was certainly no feeling within the Commonwealth, nor obviously within the Tasmanian Government or industry, that the Organocell technology is without promise. I would hesitate to try to explain it to the Senate at Question Time, but I did have an explanation of it from Thyssen scientific people when I was in Germany in July this year. Similarly, there is no feeling that we should not pursue, collaboratively, technological developments with Germany, and the visit will take place in light of those circumstances.</PARA>

It also refers to the brutal massacre of defenceless East Timorese at a memorial service in Dili yesterday. Firstly, will the Minister make the results of the inquiry by the Australian Embassy officer who is now on his way to Dili available to this Parliament?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of self-determination for East Timor was resolved in terms of the world community&mdash;and particularly the Australian Government's position&mdash;many years ago. It has been a bipartisan position on the part of the major political parties. I must say, personally, that I have some sense of regret about the earlier period of our involvement with East Timor; but that is not an issue which can be revisited at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in answer to a question from Senator Hill, in terms of our relationship with Indonesia the concern about human rights in East Timor has always been a difficult issue for us. It has been a shared concern and one which we have had to try to deal with in the best possible way. The honourable senator asked in the earlier part of her question whether I would make available the findings resulting from a visit to Dili by an official from the Australian Government. As I said to Senator Hill, we will provide any information we can, arising from that visit or any other source, which enables us to better understand what happened.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Is it true that in Australia approximately 500 babies die every year from sudden infant death syndrome?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that all honourable senators are interested in the condition known as sudden infant death syndrome. It is a fact that the Menzies Centre for Population Health Research based in Hobart has demonstrated a strong association between placing an infant to sleep on the stomach and death from sudden infant death syndrome. This particular research has been published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS>, the prestigious international medical journal.

It was attended by such authorities as the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Royal Australian College of Paediatrics and other medical colleges, the Royal College of Nursing Australia, and various State health authorities. That conference adopted a unanimous recommendation that infants should not be placed on their stomachs to sleep unless there was specific medical or other reasons. As a result, hospitals and clinics in every State are presently adopting that recommendation. I believe that this is a major breakthrough in the epidemiological study undertaken by the Menzies Centre for Population Health Research. It is to be commended for undertaking this study. I hope that as many mothers as possible can be informed of this recommendation. Whilst it is not claimed that this is the sole cause of the phenomenon of sudden infant death, nevertheless, if this precaution can be taken, it may reduce the incidence of that tragedy by some 40 per cent.</PARA>

If they really believe in competitive pressures as being a way in which the marketplace can be organised to deliver services at a reasonable cost to Australian consumers&mdash;in this case, conveyancing advice&mdash;they should support doing away with the monopoly of lawyers in this area.</PARA>

It is going to be very difficult in terms of systems problems for my Department to work its computer programming to try to cover a decade of assurances of support. It has to be remembered that it was only in 1988 that the idea of transferring this to Social Security to follow up was even thought of, given that governments previously did not worry about it. The Fraser Government's answer to this had always been to waive the debt. We did not want to keep doing that, so we have taken on the task.</PARA>

Now that we have ironed it out, we intend to chase through the files manually. Obviously, this will take quite a bit of time because we will have to go back over a decade of people.

I am not sure whether Senator Patterson is advocating that if people are in this situation we sell up their homes or whatever. But the Government will identify as many of them as it can and we will certainly raise a lot more money than $9m over time as we examine the files one by one, and there are thousands of them. So it will be a long term job but it is one that we will undertake. As soon as we can identify exactly how much can be collected from the exercise, we will let Senator Patterson know.</PARA>

It was on 27 September before the Senate committee of inquiry into the disclosure and advertising ban Bill that she initially raised this matter and I think also in a press statement soon thereafter. I am not aware of the document Senator Sowada has referred to. However, I am advised that the New South Wales State Electoral Office did provide roll information in the form of computer tapes to the political parties in New South Wales prior to the May State election. The State Electoral Commissioner has advised the Australian Electoral Commission that the tapes were provided to the political parties only and were not provided or sold to anyone else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today on the eve of the Government's eighteenth attempt in nine years to produce some kind of economic statement as a cure-all for the sickness that it, and it alone, has inflicted on the Australian economy. We have had 18 budgets, mini-budgets, economic and industry statements. There were three in fact this year: the March industry statement; the August Budget; and the November jobs statement. Where are we with the results? We are exactly where this parade of perception setting yet almost totally ineffectual statements have put us, and that is bumping along the bottom of a deep and patchy recession; the longest recession since the 1930s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not once in all of the verbose and grandiose detail of those previous 17 statements did the Government change its policy approach or even admit to being wrong in its policy approach. Not once did it make any attempt to abandon the very policy which sent us into such a fast and painful decline with its reliance on high interest rates alone to steer the economy and dampen demand. We know it certainly dampened demand but as a policy in isolation it steered out of control and along the way it wiped out the very heart of the Australian way of life: a job and a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the public is cynical? It is faced with a government about to announce a so-called job statement in an attempt to persuade us that it can somehow replace some of the jobs which it deliberately and cold-heartedly allowed to be eradicated. Is it any wonder that the State Premiers have turned their backs on Canberra when they are faced with a bickering, squabbling, non-performing bunch of politicians who happen to call themselves a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, put it succinctly when he indicated that the leadership, not Australia, was at the forefront of this Government's priorities. It is a government paralysed by its leadership jostling rather than determining the policy direction we need to put in place to create long and meaningful jobs for Australians. So the Australian dream, a home&mdash;that achievable opportunity which sold us to migrants worldwide&mdash;is no longer a realistic expectation for Australia's younger generations; and jobs, the very thread which sews the fabric of our society together, are lost to many and are not ever even being experienced now by a growing number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eighteen statements down the track and the result is that one in every 10 Australians has no work and precious little hope of finding any in the next 12 months. With the school leavers about to come on to the job market in the next few weeks it is believed that as many as six out of every 10 school leavers in December may also be left without employment prospects and opportunities. Yet absolutely nothing this Government has so far displayed can in any way give any person hope that tomorrow will bring a new dawning from the statement it is going to put down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a senior economist this week how we would assess and quantify just one statement out of those 17&mdash;the March industry statement&mdash;and what it had done for Australia. He shrugged his shoulders and asked, `How does one quantify platitudes, public relations creations, policy half promises and policy ideas which tinker rather than correct?'. That question seems to say it all. These words could be a eulogy to 18 statements and nine years of non-cohesive economic direction. The nine years of the Hawke Government are littered with lost chances, missed opportunities, discarded ideals and broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that the architect of this policy direction is not only the Hawke Ministry as it is now but the pretender to the throne, the pretender to the prime ministership, Paul Keating himself. He was there participating during these nine years in this policy direction of high interest rates that have bankrupted people, broken families, destroyed businesses and destroyed jobs for young Australians. In fact, if one looks back, one sees that the track record of this Government is absolutely appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not hard to reason why when the clash of the massive egos that we have at the top has created that policy impasse, the paralysis of government. Where that was not the problem, the Government simply would not take the necessary hard decisions which may have estranged it from its union base. Because of the Government's union base it would not and could not take vital taxation reform decisions. Paul Keating's option C for a broad based consumption tax was rejected in favour of an increasingly cumbersome, unwieldy, haphazard and costly wholesale sales tax system that it expanded from $3.5 billion worth of income in 1983-84 to $11 billion now. The Government has got its consumption tax but it is a hidden consumption tax. It just expanded the wholesale sales tax net to catch a lot more people in the net and gain a lot more revenue. It is taxation by stealth because the Government is not prepared to front up with major taxation reform for the long term well-being of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, along with bracket creep which is destroying incentive and destroying productivity gains that come from the incentive of wanting to work and produce more in the workplace. Because of its union base the Government could not and would not dare tackle deregulation of the labour market when it deregulated the financial markets in 1985&mdash;a major imbalance in the policy direction of this country. Nor, because of its union base, has it had the fortitude to move along micro-economic reform at the pace essential to ensure that the manufacturing sector can restructure and perform competitively. In other words, the Government is removing the tariff barriers but it is not at the same time removing the cost impediments to our manufacturing industry via micro-economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March industry statement this year makes that last point glaringly evident. If the Government had been so serious about the future economic health of Australia it would have and could have included new initiatives on labour market reform and rail, coastal shipping and waterfront infrastructure reform. But they were not there. The Government is stale and it is so impotent, so cowardly and so beholden to the union movement. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has been working on draft industrial relations legislation but, because the ACTU will not cop it, 18 months of drafting legislation has now gone out the window. The Minister is not prepared to take on the ACTU when he knows it is right because he has been working on that legislation for 18 months. Because he could not get past the door of the ACTU and get its agreement, 18 months of legislative work has gone. He knows it was important for the benefit of Australia in terms of industrial relations and structural reform but he is not prepared to proceed because of the attitude of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would rather see the further demise of our manufacturing sector than offend the union movement. More jobs gone to keep more union mate bosses happy! It certainly seems the end result. How can a government be so lacking in foresight and policy direction when manufactured goods make up some 70 per cent of our imports yet only 20 per cent of our exports; when we have a severe shortage of venture and development finance in this country; when we are the only industrialised country in the world not to have an increased proportion of exports to GDP; when only Spain invests less on research and development than we do; and when the Economic Planning Advisory Council says our labour productivity is still declining?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely these facts would spell out to any government that we are in deep trouble and that action, not perception of action, is what is called for; and that we need a sense of direction, purpose and rekindled hope for Australians. But the Government is taking no direction to rekindle hope for the Australian community. In the light of that overwhelming list of failures behind us, how then do we judge tomorrow's job statement? Can there be anyone left in Australia who can trust that the actuality of tomorrow's statement will come anywhere near meeting the perception it will aim to create? I doubt it. Jobs, or more importantly the lack of them, is tomorrow's main subject area. But we know that is only because Paul Keating's cheer squad forced the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to consider the 10 per cent unemployed worthy of consideration as a community concern and also due to the pressure that the Premiers have been applying to the Prime Minister and the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States are screaming for job support and stimulation. I remind Senator McMullan that there are five Labor Premiers. It is the States which have to face the front line problems when our social fabric starts to unravel as jobless numbers rise, with increases in crime, homelessness, bankruptcies, domestic violence, child abuse and suicide and increasing pressures on the social structure of our community. All those pressures are being applied as a result of a lack of economic direction in this country. Real government, true government that puts the good of the country first, when faced with such enormous social problems would not be looking for just a quick hit fix headline. It would be looking at changes in policy direction and long term agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not take a mind reader to work out which way the Prime Minister will slant his statement tomorrow.

Despite admitting that it will accelerate the better cities program, the Government is not proposing to spend any money on it in the next financial year. The Prime Minister has at last acknowledged in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that the press got it right when it reported that document that went to Federal Cabinet on Sunday evening. Initially, the Prime Minister denied it publicly. Yesterday, a little more pressure was brought to bear and he had to back off and say, `Yes, that was the document that went to Cabinet on Sunday. We are going to accelerate it and put out $652m, but we are not going to spend the $652m'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an absolute nonsense! Again, the Government is setting public perception, not achieving the bottom line purpose of creating meaningful, long term jobs for Australians. Not at all. It is about getting a headline, trying to convince the public it is doing something&mdash;creating action&mdash;when, in fact, it is not doing anything on the bottom line to create real jobs for Australians. It is treating the symptom, not the disease, applying bandaids to try to quench the haemorrhaging of jobs that we have in this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what Australia needs and the Government full well knows it. We need jobs now, but we need them through policies&mdash;not individual projects&mdash;that create jobs. For example, if tomorrow there were an honest&mdash;if perhaps belated&mdash;attempt at turning around the job market, we would hear much about an immediate effort to look at anti-dumping controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Dr Michael Deeley, managing director of ICI Australia, has recently said publicly that one-third of all Australian imports are dumped. His view was supported, I might add, by the ACTU in its presentation to the Government a fortnight ago that anti-dumping is one of the most important things that need to be acted on in this country. It is Dr Deeley's view that immediate anti-dumping controls to halt the deluge of cheap items on to our market would create more jobs in Australia than even a further fall in interest rates. That view is shared generally by industry, by the ACTU and by many other groups within the community. If the Government were serious, what we would see tomorrow would be not a public relations exercise, but some meaningful measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the March industry statement legislation is just now turning up on the table. It is only now, eight months after that industry statement was brought down, that this Parliament is considering legislative effect to that statement. Does that mean that as a result of the statement tomorrow, it will be the middle of next year before we see any legislation to create changes in policy that will bring jobs to Australians? That is the track record of this Government. It tries to set the public perception and does not worry about taking action&mdash;let that flow down the track in due course. That is why so many Australians are out of work today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is somewhat strange in Parliament to hear a member of Parliament complaining that the Government too often comes to Parliament with statements about the economy. That concern is based on two fundamental misconceptions. One is that it seems to me obvious&mdash;and I am surprised that it has not occurred to Senator Olsen&mdash;that a democracy requires that when a government is going to take action on the economy, it ought to come in here and advise the Parliament what it is that it is going to do, and that it does so frequently is a plus, not a minus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, it says to us that the old era of once a year budgets and once a year economic statements is long gone. It is possible to argue that it was never appropriate, but that is a debate for the historians. What is clearly apparent is that as the rate of change in economic circumstances increases rapidly, as the availability of information about the state of the economy changes and increases rapidly, it is no longer appropriate to contemplate a circumstance in which policies are set in place some magical day in August and not reviewed and not revised. It always was, in my view, an absurd proposition; if it were not so historically, it certainly is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, of course, we often hear the shadow Treasurer call for mini budgets. As soon as we propose that there should be a statement he says, `This is a terrible thing. You are proposing to change direction and this is a sign that there is something wrong'. A few weeks ago the Opposition was saying that it is exactly what we should do. The real concern of the Opposition is what is going to be the distinction between what is in our document and what it would propose. It is that question of substance to which I wish to turn in a moment. Let us continue with this discussion of the question of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who would advocate that there is something wrong with having perhaps three economic statements in a year, as we have had in 1991&mdash;for which I make no apologies and, in fact, which I think is entirely appropriate to the circumstances of 1991&mdash;are those who would advocate the fixed solution to changing problems. That has been the position of the conservatives in Australian politics for a decade. They stand transfixed in the face of changing economic circumstances, advocating the same policy mix whatever the circumstances. If the economy is growing too quickly, they say, `What you should do is cut wages, cut public spending and change the tax mix to increase indirect taxes'. If the economy is not growing quickly enough, they say, `You should cut wages, cut public spending and change the tax mix to increase indirect taxes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do not need a series of economic statements because they have had the same policy for 10 years in the face of changing economic circumstances. I believe they were not appropriate policies for any of those circumstances, but they cannot possibly be appropriate economic policies for all circumstances. It is inconceivable that they could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflected in the attitude expressed by the advocates of `Don't bring in an economic statement. Let us have one set of policies over the decade irrespective of the changing circumstances'&mdash;those who have developed in the cloistered environment of the IMF, the university and the merchant bank&mdash;is an elegant economic theory which anybody can find in an American textbook from Chicago. Every time reality does not conform, they think reality must be wrong. How could it be that there is no economic evidence around the world to support the theories that are being advocated? Where people have tried these policy mixes, the outcome has not been as is advocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us return to the prospect, as the Prime Minister has indicated, of a statement to be made tomorrow. That statement will not be a major change to long term economic strategy. That is the one thing which Senator Olsen has said which is correct. It will not be, because it should not be. The basic thrust of long term economic policy is for a sustained economic recovery of the type which Australia has not been able to enjoy since the First World War. All the evidence is that economic growth rates in Australia in the last 75 years have been lower than the international comparisons and lower than they might otherwise have been with appropriate mix of policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that we should be having essentially a stable pattern of fiscal, monetary and wages policy, and I am confident that will continue after tomorrow's statement. Let us not forget that, while we are in the middle of a very serious recession which is causing pain to many people, when we find the hyperbole about the nearly nine years of Labor Government, notwithstanding the serious problems of recession, we have 1.54 million more jobs in Australia now than we had in 1983 as a result of the phenomenal success of job creation of the Government in its first seven years. That is not to minimise the cost of the recession to individuals and to families affected by it, but it seeks to give some sense of perspective that is in context and in terms of the impact of the series of economic statements made by the Government since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we will have tomorrow is another element of short term response within a coherent long term framework of fiscal policy, monetary policy and wages policy designed to achieve the sort of sustainable recovery which&mdash;to the shock, horror and concern of the Opposition&mdash;all the responsible economic commentators are saying indicates that in the course of 1992 there is likely to be a pattern of moderate low inflationary growth which is sustainable in the long term and which causes great fear and apprehension to the Opposition. If Opposition senators do not understand that they have all too narrow a lead in the polls against the Government in the middle of a recession, they should know that when that recession recedes so will their lead. Any sensible analyst would understand that. </PARA>

Westpac has made similar reports. The Opposition may not be quite so concerned about Westpac. There may have been something about the National Australia Bank that particularly upset those opposite. We find from Westpac a forecast for 1992 saying that Australia's growth will be 2.3 per cent next year, which is better than or equal to New Zealand, the United States and Japan. It is not something about which we should be excited because a figure of 2.3 per cent is not, long term, a rate of growth to which we aspire. We would hope that, long term, it will be higher. But it is not an insubstantial rate of growth, and in terms of the international economic environment in which we find ourselves it will be a satisfactory performance and the platform on which continuing sustainable growth can be based. With inflation at 3.5 per cent, it is comparable with all those other countries to which I referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a circumstance in which all the responsible economic commentators, all the banks and all the independent analysts are saying that 1992 will be the year in which recovery will commence and moderate sustainable recovery will be achieved with low inflation, while maintaining the success on the balance of payments front. That is what those people are saying. I think their views are right. Westpac is also saying&mdash;and as circumstances change so it is appropriate that the fine-tuning of economic policy should be modified&mdash;that we now do not find a concern about overheating in the economy as occurred after the previous recession. I think that that is correct. The situation where we have the basis for modest growth without the risk of overheating gives the opportunity for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to make a statement tomorrow that can enhance the job creation success of the recovery. It gives room to move in a manner that is consistent with overall strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a continuing case for all governments in terms of contemporary economic management to have flexibility to continue to introduce economic packages such as those which have been introduced this year&mdash;the rural assistance package, the reduction of taxes on business inputs, the enhanced depreciation regime and so on. Are people saying that these things should not have been done? Of course they are not. They are simply saying that they wish what we were doing was introducing a consumption tax to blow out of the water the success on inflation. They ask us to slash government spending by $4 billion and to destroy 46,000 jobs, which are the announced policies of the shadow Minister for finance. It is suggested that we should have had a balanced budget which would have cost 40,000 to 50,000 jobs as the solution to unemployment&mdash;that is, to throw more people out of work. It is said that the solution to inflation is to put up prices, and that we should be changing the labour market so that the weakest workers in the marketplace are less protected. That is the solution to increasing living standards&mdash;allowing workers' wage standards to be cut. It is the very old conservative formula&mdash;that when one has a problem with unemployment one puts people out of work; when one has a problem about inflation one puts up prices; when one has a problem over living standards one cuts wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what will be contained in the Prime Minister statement tomorrow. If honourable senators opposite are worried that that is not the case, I am sorry for them, but I am not sorry about it. It is not what should be in the policy and it will not be in the policy statement. We will find another example of a statement which modifies at the margin the policy directions to give some extra impetus in the area of jobs. It will sustain a stable macro-economic environment which government is obliged to provide. It will continue to have the moderate stimulus from the automatic stabiliser that flowed from the Budget&mdash;a stimulus which those opposite would not have provided and which would have made unemployment worse. It will continue to allow the moderation of monetary policy which has led to interest rates being at their lowest rate for a decade. It will continue the stable and effective wages policy which has been developed over the past nine years and which has created the preconditions for and enabled us to achieve record low inflation and low inflationary expectations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats would agree with most of the statement in this matter of public importance debate this afternoon. I find it passing strange that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, should have criticised the Opposition for not looking at the facts in the light of its economic theory. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that if one looks at the facts, one sees that Australia during the time of the Labor Government has built up its largest foreign debt ever and has over a million people unemployed. We have seen a massive shift of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, a shift which is still continuing. We have seen a shift of capital from productive investment to speculative investment and we have seen high and rising immigration rates lead to a capital widening rather than a capital deepening. In light of this the Government is still persisting with the same policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even stranger is that the Opposition would pursue precisely the same policies. Indeed, the Opposition is as driven by market economics, by so-called economic rationalism, as is the Government&mdash;perhaps even more so. Today, Senator Button quoted Alexander Downer, who remarked recently that the Opposition would have done what the Government has done in its term since 1983 but it did not have the guts. That was quoted in this chamber earlier this afternoon. The former shadow Treasurer, Mr Howard, said of the policies of Mr Keating, whom a moment ago Senator Olsen described as the pretender to the throne, that they were ones which had a relatively easy passage because the Opposition agreed with most of the policy changes which Mr Keating was introducing. While we agree with the statement, as we have said before, we find that the Opposition would have landed Australia in precisely the same predicament, perhaps even more quickly than the Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, neither the Government nor the Opposition has any long term view of where it sees Australia's position in 10 to 20 years from now, simply leaving the economy to the market and to the naked forces of aggression and greed which will not deliver Australia the sort of future to which it must aspire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a considerable arbitrariness in the cultural arrangements which a society makes for itself, including economic arrangements. This is one of the things that honourable senators in this chamber and, indeed, honourable members in the other chamber have, by and large, totally ignored. It is an unfortunate fact that we have very few scientists who enter politics who have a biological basis to their understanding of social relationships. As a consequence, they believe that the natural world outside can be pushed around in much the same way as human relationships and social arrangements and economics can be pushed around. That is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real world out there with which we must conform. As I have said many times in this chamber, the real world of tomorrow will be a greenhouse world in which we as a society must conform if we are to build a viable future. That is what this debate is supposed to be about: a viable future for ourselves and our descendants. I quote a very famous economist from this country, Dr H.C. Coombs. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing divinely ordained about the economic system: it is the product of human ingenuity, effort and capacity to organise and can therefore, properly be questioned, criticised and, if a better alternative exists, rejected.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the things that neither the Government nor the Opposition is prepared to do. In his most recent book, Stephen Boyden said:</PARA>

<PARA>I would include there, economic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the point of difference in the wording. The wording in the matter of public importance includes the words `to build economic growth'. The Australian Democrats have been criticised in this chamber quite unfairly in the past when questioning the idea of growth. Economic growth refers to a progressive exponential increase in the dollar value of goods and services manufactured year on year after having taken out the inflation factor. It refers to a real and exponential increase in the flow of resources through the economy. It is clearly not sustainable in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, this afternoon I want to stress that, as measured by economists, economic growth includes many things which are really costs. I ask Senator Olsen whether, for instance, when the $6 billion is added&mdash;I stress added&mdash;to GDP as a consequence of motor vehicle accidents, he wants economic growth to occur by growth in the number of accidents which occur in Australia. Is that the sort of growth he wants? In using the term `economic growth' unqualified, I presume he is referring to what economists mean by economic growth; that is, growth of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometime ago I asked Senator Walsh, when he was Minister for Finance, about that $6 billion. He correctly pointed out that it did appear as an addition to GDP. He said, `If you start to take the costs out of GDP, it may be that all of GDP would gradually disappear'. Of course, if we were able to disentangle the costs and the benefits of GDP, we may well find that in the time since the Hawke Government the cost component of GDP has been the component which has been growing and the benefit component of GDP is the one which has been falling. Therein would lie a very satisfactory explanation of the fact that ordinary people perceive their conditions as having become considerably worse during the past 10 years, even while the economy was growing. I make a plea to both the Government and the Opposition that if they use the term `economic growth' they need to define that term rather more carefully. </PARA>

But we are still awaiting a decision on these and other major projects, projects that could provide jobs and stimulate growth. The rhetoric of this Government will live on long after its deeds for, in truth, this Labor Government has done more to put people out of work, out of business, out of school and off their farms than any government in Australia's history&mdash;a terrible indictment of any government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention was to make Australia more competitive. Has it done that? The answer is obviously no. We have levelled the playing field in Australia, but our rural industries are merely more vulnerable to corrupt world markets.

The intention was to get more Australians working together; the reality is they are not working, neither are they together. One million Australians will be looking for work this Christmas but, unfortunately, they will not find it. This Government has not been able to achieve unity, even within its own ranks.

At the present time we have Senator Richardson wanting to drive the bus that runs over the Prime Minister; we have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) door-stopping to torpedo the Premiers Conference and the Prime Minister; we have the Speaker of the House and other assorted colleagues arguing with the Cabinet and Caucus about a third runway; and we have the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) withdrawing industrial relations legislation because his ACTU masters do not like it. Increased productivity was much talked about, but soon abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at specific areas and specific promises. In the March statement the Prime Minister claimed that small- to medium-sized businesses were `key agents of economic growth and structural change'. He promised the establishment of a small- and medium-sized enterprise development program and some $3.4m was allocated. Yet how much better off is Australian small business? Small business bankruptcies in 1990-91 show that business failures are running as high as 70 per cent in some States, with an across Australia average of 50 per cent, and the rate is increasing. </PARA>

The Prime Minister assured our resource industries, particularly forestry and mining, that legislation would ensure an environment that gave confidence to those companies to invest and proceed with their operations. But the Prime Minister forgot to ask his unofficial Cabinet&mdash;the green vote. Accordingly, at present in Australia we have dozens of projects waiting to proceed which are unable to do so because the companies involved cannot be certain that Government policy will not be changed tomorrow and render their operations non-viable. </PARA>

Senator Button has claimed they have all been obstructed by environmental processes, but the Government still refuses to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations reform is just as far off now as it was in March. The Minister for Industrial Relations suggested in his contribution to the March statement that there was a need in Australia for `reconciliation and renewal'. Eight months on, and only yesterday, we find headlines in the paper suggesting that the Federal Cabinet is still to decide on a proposed package of industrial relations reforms because the ACTU will not give the official nod. Monday's media detailed the trials and tribulations of an abattoir owner in Victoria who has attempted to use contract labour in his works but has effectively been held to ransom by the AMIEU.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a matter of public importance put forward by Senator Olsen which calls for policies to build economic growth and sustainable job opportunities. I oppose this proposition because it ignores a number of key factors. It ignores this Government's focus on getting the economic conditions right for medium and longer term growth, and it ignores our concentration on economic fundamentals for long term growth and for sustainable job opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would like to look at monetary policy and the role of this Government over the last 18 months in regard to interest rates, which is a very important economic fundamental. Monetary policy has been eased time and time again and rates have been lowered. But, of course, those opposite do not want to know about it. Interest rates were not originally set high as an end in themselves, but were designed to moderate spending on imports by Australians. That is the reality: they were designed to ameliorate the flow of domestic expenditure into imports because domestic production could not match total local spending. Australia could not keep financing a large import bill. After all, imports have to be paid for in hard currency and, as a result, interest rates were high in order to moderate that level of spending. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But it is pleasing to note that our overseas balance of payments improved significantly during the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very pleasing to note a 13 per cent increase in export volumes in the last financial year&mdash;in other words, real exports were up 13 per cent. I am pleased to point out on behalf of my State, which is a major producer of motor vehicles, that total exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts now amount to almost $1,000m per year. Furthermore, last financial year, while export volumes rose 13 per cent, import volumes fell by 3 per cent. So there has been a major turnaround in our overseas balance of payments from some $22,000m in the previous financial year to $15,000m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have eased off interest rates and we have eased off the monetary policy control of spending in Australia. As a result, interest rates have come down significantly. There have been 10 rounds of reductions in interest rates since early 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go back to January 1990. When we proposed lowering interest rates the present Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said that an interest rate reduction at that time would be short lived, premature and political. That is what he said in January 1990. Since then we have had nine rounds of interest rate reductions in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had contradictions from those opposite which show why they are not competent to run an economic policy or be given the chance to do it. Look at a statement made in this place by Senator Hill&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate&mdash;as recently as 22 August this year. Despite Dr Hewson's saying that interest rate reductions were short lived, could not be sustained and were political and premature, Senator Hill came in here and said, `They should be lowered faster'. He said that in his keynote speech in reply to the Budget Speech. What a massive contradiction between the claims made by Dr Hewson last year and those of the parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party in this chamber. The Opposition cannot get a consistent line on economic management. Since then, cash interest rates have reached their lowest level for 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter that concerns the Opposition&mdash;and I understand it&mdash;is the importance of housing interest rates. Last year, the predominant housing interest rate from banks was 17 per cent for home mortgages. Now the predominant rates are between 12 and 13 per cent. I know that Senator Olsen understands this very well. Interest rates for home loans have come down enormously and they are very sensitive politically. Housing affordability has risen accordingly. As interest rates have come down in this country, housing affordability has gone up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to inflation because this is the jewel in the crown. The real success in this country has come in getting inflation down and cost rises out of the Australian economy. By the end of September last year, the consumer price index had risen by 6 percentage points in this country. This year, in the 12 months to September, prices rose not by 6 per cent, 5 per cent or 4 per cent but by a mere 3.3 per cent. There has been a massive reduction in inflationary pressures in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will concern those opposite at the end of January is that inflation will slump further. They will go into 1992 facing a Government that has got inflation down to 2 per cent. The reality is that the December quarter consumer price index last year was 2.7 per cent. That will not show up in the annual figures at the end of January next year. Even if the inflation rate for the December quarter this year is 1.3 per cent&mdash;double the present quarter&mdash;we will have a 2 per cent inflation rate in the Australian economy. Is that not a tremendous achievement? We are getting inflation out of the system in Australia. When those opposite left office, they had inflation running at 11 1/2 per cent. That was their record and it is objective fact. We will have inflation at a much lower rate than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the factors bringing down inflation is the reduction in interest rates. The wonderful thing now is that interest rates are part of the base for the consumer price index. We have already had an interest rate reduction since the last consumer price index was calculated. I can say right now that one factor is working to bring inflation down in the December quarter. We know what it is&mdash;the recent reduction in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting the fundamentals right in the economy. Interest rates have come down enormously. We are getting the parameters right in the form of cost inflation, which is down enormously from the record of those opposite. We now have a very competitive inflation rate in the Australian economy compared with those countries with which we trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to hark back to December last year. The current Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said on 22 December last year, on the record, `Inflation in Australia clearly is stuck between 7 and 8 per cent'. I have just detailed that inflation is now down to 3.3 per cent and heading towards 2 per cent. It will be 2 per cent by the end of January. The gentleman who is the present Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said last year that inflation in Australia clearly was stuck between 7 and 8 per cent, and he is wrong again. Wrong again, Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the international comparisons for inflation, because this is where the real advantages are for the Australian economy. In the past, under the Liberals we consistently had inflation rates above the average for the 23 industrialised OECD countries in the Western world. Consistently, regularly and repeatedly we had inflation above the world average. It is now below the world average. Our inflation rate of 3.3 per cent compares with the average rate of 6.2 per cent of the 23 industrialised countries of the world. There is a tremendous cost advantage potential for Australian firms selling products abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the inflation rate. Our inflation rate now is lower than that of Japan. Is that not a wonderful achievement? Inflation is now lower than the 3.4 per cent in Japan. Those opposite worship the conservatives in the United Kingdom who said that they would bring in new economic policies and reform the British economy: inflation in the United Kingdom is 5.8 per cent compared with our 3.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Olsen pretends to speak for the farm sector. Look at the inflation rates in those grain exporting countries that compete with us: Canada, 6.2 per cent; the USA, 5.0 per cent; and Argentina, of course, well above us. We are becoming very cost competitive. We are getting inflation out of the system in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go to the first part of the statement and answer the question posed there. Has the Hawke Government continuously missed opportunities to build economic growth and to achieve sustainable job opportunities? The answer to this is undoubtedly yes, but it is silly to concentrate on Coronation Hill or resource projects. As this week's EPAC discussion paper suggests, the future of this country does not lie simply in resource development or real estate but in high value added products such as telecommunications, scientific equipment and biotechnology. That is why it is outrageous that this Government has totally neglected the solar power industry in Australia at a time when the world is finally starting to look seriously for renewable energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are one of the few developed countries in the world which are net energy exporters. That means that, if some sort of global agreement is reached on the imposition of a carbon tax or some other kind of anti-greenhouse tax, we will be very heavily affected.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sensible forward planning by the Government would ensure that we would be able to replace the export of fossil fuels&mdash;which is not sustainable in the long term anyway&mdash;with the export of renewable energy technology. We already lead the world in this technology. Professor Martin Green has developed the world's most efficient photovoltaic cell; Solarhart and other firms produce world class solar hot water heaters; but we have no national strategy to develop and capitalise on the enormous potential employment which such an industry could create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of lost opportunities can be found in the area of railway development. We need urgent upgrading of our main line rail links and large investments in urban light rail systems. In the last eight years the Hawke Government has spent less in this area than was spent in one year of the Fraser Government's term. There are numerous other examples, such as the huge growth and employment possibilities which the creation of recycling industries will bring, as well as the swag of locally developed inventions which each year are bought up by foreign investors and then developed overseas, thereby shifting potential Australian jobs into actual overseas jobs. Some recent examples are the loss of Australian control of the gene shears technology and the inability of the developers of the Scram Jet to obtain local development finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of appropriate amounts of venture and development capital is now widely recognised as a market failure, and at last the Federal Caucus is starting to demand some action on the issue. The Caucus working party on employment has recently called on the Government to legislate to create a national development fund with a small proportion of superannuation savings. This has been Democrats policy for many years, and it is tragic that it has taken a recession to get the Government to consider seriously its national obligations in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity has been the overvalued exchange rate which our farmers and manufacturers have had to contend with since the late 1980s. The Government's refusal to lower the exchange rate has been the greatest single blow to industry creating sustainable jobs. Of course, the use of high interest rates accentuated this overvaluation and then created the current recession, thereby destroying over 200,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So, yes, there have been many lost opportunities and there has been an awful lot of public relations hype in the way the former Treasurer has conducted economic policy. But to say that there has been no substance to the various Budgets and mini-Budgets delivered by the Government is simply wrong. To be fair, I think we should acknowledge some of the excellent tax reform work which has been achieved by this Government. We have not supported every decision, and neither will we in the future, but a lot of equity has been returned to the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the area of micro-economic reform, the Democrats argue that the overall policy thrust has been incorrect. For example, the unilateral lowering of tariffs without, at the same time, a strengthening of the anti-dumping legislation has been suicidal. There should have been coordinated import replacement strategies operating between the Government and local industry. People who lose their jobs in industry restructuring should be automatically retrained, not left to live in poverty without any genuine prospect of alternative employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the ridiculous notion of competition at any cost in telecommunications services is another area of Government policy which is totally opposed by the Democrats. The wholesale privatisation of government business organisations is also an ideologically driven notion which has no public interest benefit. It is also one which the Opposition continues to dish up to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Opposition wants action. Does that mean eliminating legitimate environmental concerns? Does it mean eliminating a Federal Budget deficit? Murphy's economic model predicts that this would cost 46,000 jobs. Does it mean eliminating all awards? Does it mean abandoning cabotage? Does it mean regressively changing the tax system to boost the disposable income of the wealthy? This is action but it is action New Zealand style, and it means that the disparity of wealth distribution will worsen and the lot of ordinary people will deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats reject this simplistic analysis. The most important action the Government can take is to change direction in economic policy, and the statement to be delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tomorrow could well be Australia's last chance. </PARA>

Firstly, I might take up the matter raised by Senator McMullan, who sought to give the impression that Westpac is declaring that there will be a significant upturn in activity next year. The truth of the matter is to be found elsewhere. A newspaper article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia faced its longest recession since World War II, Westpac bank chief economist Bill Evans said yesterday.</PARA>

I find it cute that out of those statistics Senator McMullan can build an argument to suggest that Westpac is claiming that the recession has bottomed out and we are now on the way to recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there were a government in terminal decay and decline, it is the Hawke Labor Government. It is in a state of total paralysis and now, of course, is its time of reckoning. All of its rhetoric, all of its talk, all of its false dawns have been stripped away and the cruel reality of eight years of Labor Government is starkly before all of us. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might well look at the cruel reality of that record. Of one million people unemployed, 300,000 have been unemployed for more than 12 months. Thirty per cent of young Australians are unemployed&mdash;and 30 per cent of that 30 per cent have never been able to find a job&mdash;and 160,000 breadwinners are on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For every two job advertisements there are 100 people looking for jobs. That is the record of this Government in employment. Of course, that flows over into bankruptcies. During the eight years of this Government, 50,000 companies have become bankrupt. In Western Australia alone, the numbers have doubled from 1,000 to 2,000 in the last 12 months. That is the achievement of this Government after eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember something that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said at his 1983 policy launch. Talking about the record of the Fraser Government, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One in ten Australians out of work&mdash;a figure no Australian would have believed possible a few years ago, and which no Australian government should ever be forgiven for creating.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Now we see a level of unemployment a great deal higher than that. The truth of the matter is that this recession is not a recession we had to have; it is a recession that this Government has induced. It has dragged Australian society into deep misery, unparalleled since the depression of the 1930s. The Government has caused despair, bankruptcy and desperation, not because of circumstances beyond its control but because of circumstances within its control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy for Australian society is that this is a Government that has been driven by minority groups. This has never been a government of consensus; it has never been a government for all people. It has been a government for selective groups who promise, at the end of the day as part of their blackmail, to deliver votes. This is a government that has survived on the basis of promises. This is a government whose single objective is to survive, and to govern for itself alone and not for Australians. Manifest in that is the recession we are presently having. If ever there was a dispirited, discredited and failed government, it is this Government led by a pathetic, humiliated and bullied Prime Minister whose total preoccupation is keeping his own job, with total disregard for everybody else's jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to list the types of jobs that this Government has deliberately and wilfully passed up&mdash;meaningful, sustained, long term, productive jobs. Let me cite a number of projects: the Jabiluka uranium mine in the Northern Territory, 600 jobs denied; Koongarra, 500 jobs denied; Kintyre, 300 jobs denied; Coronation Hill, 515 jobs denied; Marandoo, 800 jobs denied; Yakabindie, 400 jobs denied; the Clinton mineral sands project, 180 jobs denied; the titanium oxide plant at Whyalla, 240 jobs denied; the Yeelirie project, 165 jobs denied; the Wesley Vale pulp project, 120 jobs denied; Amcor's bleached kraft pulp and paper mill project, 1,000 jobs denied; WA Chip and Pulp kraft pulp and paper mill, 1,200 jobs denied; ANM's Albury plant, 700 jobs denied; Daishowa's Grafton mill, 1,000 jobs denied; Forest Resources bleached chemi-thermo plant, 500 jobs denied; Paper and Pulp's Bagasse pulp mill, 500 jobs denied; and the ANM Albury recycling plant, 700 jobs denied. That totals over 7,500 jobs that this Government has refused to allow to proceed. The cost to Australia is $8 billion in investment alone and $2,920m in foreign exchange earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a recession that we need to have. This is a recession we are having because this Government has chosen, for political reasons, to visit it upon the Australian people. I imagine that tomorrow we will see another phoney statement talking about phoney jobs. We can always tell when this Government is in absolute despair, and that is when we can feel a ministerial statement coming on. We have had industry statements, mini-Budgets, tax summits, housing summits and job summits&mdash;none designed to relieve the problems which drove the Prime Minister to have them. They were only designed for the purpose of soothing, seducing and disarming the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But alas, like all these things, there is an end point. Perhaps that end point was yesterday when the six State Premiers, five of them Labor, said, `Mr Prime Minister, we will not go through another charade. We will no longer visit Canberra as mendicants, simply to sit around for another talk-fest so you can put out another press statement saying, "All is well with the world, trust me, rely on me, I will cry some but in the end it will work out"'. Perhaps the final point has come with the Premiers. If it has come with the Premiers, it has come with the overwhelming majority of Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solutions to the present problems in Australia are not sophisticated or complicated; they are simple but they take courage. They require the gumption and the fortitude to deregulate the labour market. They require the introduction of micro-economic reforms of meaningful purpose, whether they be on the waterfront, to coastal shipping, to transport or communication&mdash;all those things that are capable of making us competitive. They require the privatisation of those fat, bloated government enterprises that are consuming Australian taxpayers' money. More than anything else, they require a reforming of the tax system to give incentive, to reward effort, endeavour and savings so that the tax is not on income but on consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, that is something that the past Treasurer, Mr Keating, knows about because he proposed it under his own option C. But because the ACTU knocked it on the head and this weak, vacillating, failed Prime Minister of ours capitulated, we did not get the consumption tax that we could have had at the beginning of this decade; and so Australia paid the price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hawke Government has had a priority of economic growth and the achievement of sustainable job opportunities since its inception as a government. Tomorrow the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will announce initiatives to accelerate job opportunities in this country. This matter of public importance criticises the Government's Budgets and statements, especially the March industry statement. I should like to refer to some industry issues because some very superficial things have been said today by the Opposition in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the terms of the matter of public importance, I believe that government statements have not been public relations statements. There is something in the issue of public policy, because one of the problems in industry policy that we make no apology for is that this Government has sought to change attitudes on industry policy. It is not a simple matter of a snippy, snappy decision being made by some politicians, as one would have thought from coalition speakers. In industry we have had to change and transform entrenched attitudes of both management and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many changes have been made by this Government, and I will try to describe some of them. Indeed, there have been many qualitative changes since 1982, and I should like to mention a few of them to rebut what Senator Olsen said when he claimed that there were a few simple things that could be done. With the usual Liberal Party obsession, he proposed removing the cost of the impediments, referring to the unions as the key point of his formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has furthered the education, training and multiskilling of our work force, which is a prerequisite for creating effective employment. We have also established, without question, compared with the previous Liberal regime, a cooperative industrial relations climate. We have had a basic reform of the public and private infrastructures. All of these initiatives represent an integration of workshop reform, education and training, which is the foundation of the effective creation of productive employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Olsen referred to research and development in Spain. I thought that was very unfair because this Government introduced a 150 per cent research and development tax concession. It was announced in March that from 1993 the research tax concession will remain permanently at 125 per cent. In that area there is a contribution by this Government, but we cannot get over the problem that we have with Australian industry where there has been a tendency for industry not to recognise the need for its own research and development. But to give an unbiased and a balanced description of these changes one has to take into account all the factors involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention again, as I did the last time I spoke, because it has to be mentioned, that this Government has changed the culture. The most recent initiative was the $20m to promote the advanced manufacturing technology development proposals. All of those are important because jobs cannot be created in a vacuum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the critical area of education. To create employment in the current climate means that one has to plan. This Government has planned by making sure that during its term of office the retention rate at secondary schools has increased. It has gone from 34 per cent to 70 per cent. So we are laying the basis for young people to be trained properly to take their place in the modern industry situation that Australia faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill, in criticising the Government, referred to Federal-State arrangements. No better example exists than that of TAFE in the State of New South Wales, where both Senator Brownhill and I come from. It is estimated that in 1992 90,000 students will be turned away from TAFE colleges in that State. That State has a Liberal-National Party government. Those 90,000 account for 56 per cent of all unmet demand in 1992. That unmet demand for TAFE nationally is projected to be 160,000 in early 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is obviously concerned that participation in TAFE over the last decade has been virtually static. While our Government has raised the retention rate, unfortunately under the State governments the TAFE area has remained static. That is the critical area for successfully going into modern technology and creating jobs that will be effective in both the manufacturing and the service industries. In fact, in the last three years the number of TAFE students has fallen significantly. This is unacceptable for a nation like Australia because jobs do not come in a vacuum, and we need a skilled work force to fill the jobs in the service and manufacturing industries. So I hope that the Government, whether it is tomorrow or in the near future, will take its education policies and the education and training of the work force to the next stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left, I draw attention to the fact that this is a very strange debate that we are having on the eve of the Government's statement. I feel that we should have this debate after the Government has made its statement tomorrow so that we can deal with the reality of the next stage of the Government's program. When it is introduced next week, or whenever it is introduced, the Opposition's proposal will not be to develop the human capital of our country, as I have described it. It will be to adopt a policy based on greed; on the old fistful of dollars that has served the Liberal Party so well in election after election; on literally a public relations process of trying to fool the Australian people that a consumption tax will not undermine the living standards of ordinary people, because it certainly will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can bet, even a week before the consumption tax is announced, that there will be significant cuts in the public infrastructure. We have seen the model. It exists in New Zealand. It is a model that the Liberal Party and&mdash;probably reluctantly&mdash;the National Party will adopt. The National Party will do as it always does; it will go along with the Liberal Party policy but, at the edges, it will criticise it and say, when it is in the country, that it does not quite support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that when the coalition introduces its consumption tax there will be a tremendous effect on employment, and that is what we are talking about, because it will add to the costs of ordinary people and reduce the amount of money that they have to use. We have to remember that whatever figure the Opposition decides upon for the consumption tax we can be guaranteed that it will increase if it were ever in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom there was a 75 per cent increase, from 10 per cent to 17.5 per cent; in New Zealand there was a 10 per cent increase in just three years; in Austria there was a 150 per cent increase. So when we are talking about projected statements, honourable senators should watch for the coalition statement and not believe that the figure as announced will be the final figure that will be affecting ordinary people in this country. It is based on that threat to employment, as the purchasing power of ordinary people will be reduced, that we will have a very serious situation if the consumption tax is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this proposal is introduced, part of the Opposition's package will include the inevitable cuts to pay for the fistful of dollars; the removal of Medicare; the privatisation of essential services; and the removal of indexation of family allowances, which is one of the achievements of this Government. Do honourable senators remember what happened when Liberal governments were in power before? Pensioners got their increases just before the election. This Government has indexed pensions so that people know where they stand and they have a guarantee of equity in their financial arrangements when they are on the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for all these reasons, it is not simply a matter of talking about what the Government has done. I think it would be fair for us to come back in a fortnight's time and have a real debate comparing the consumption tax of the Liberal Party and the cuts that it will offer with the Government's position.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a few brief remarks about this annual report. All honourable senators get bombarded with these reports during their time here in Parliament House and we all have a look at them. This report particularly attracted my attention, because I wanted to ask myself the question, `Why did the Commonwealth need to have a fire board?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I am sure that the people who serve on this board do a very good job and try to meet the objectives of the board. Basically, the objectives of the board, as outlined in the annual report, are to: advise the Commonwealth on fire protection in its own buildings and properties occupied by Commonwealth public servants; advocate uniformity of practices and standardisation in fire protection; advise Commonwealth departments on fire protection matters; give consideration to the responsibility of the Australian Construction Services section; carry out inspections; act as a source of advice in relation to fire protection matters; advise Commonwealth departments where it is considered that deficiencies in fire protection exist; and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my question: why does the Commonwealth really need this body for fire protection? Obviously, it is something that is done very well at a State and local level right across the country. There is obviously cooperation between local fire brigades around Australia. I can see very little need for the Commonwealth to get involved in fire protection by having this Fire Board. It raises the supplementary issues as to what this board actually did during the last year, which the annual report refers to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nice looking report; it has a nice cover and it fills up quite a few pages. As far as I could judge from reading the report very briefly, the board investigated major fires, that is, fires where damage over $100,000 occurred, and the total cost of those fires investigated came to about $1.25m. The actual cost of running this board in the last 12 months was about half a million dollars. So the Commonwealth taxpayers&mdash;the poor old taxpayers of Australia, a diminishing breed&mdash;have paid out about $500,000 to investigate fires where the damage came to about $1.25m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that those fires would have already have been investigated by the local and State authorities responsible in those States. I see little value in the Commonwealth spending even more money investigating these fires at that level. I would have thought a cooperative approach with the normal construction services and property officers from the Department of Administrative Services could easily do this and fulfil this function without setting up a board with all the associated people. The board has quite a considerable staff for the job that it carries out and, as I said, it spends about half a million dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other discernible activity of the board that I could find in the report was that it issued three circulars. The board has issued a lot of circulars; it has issued many over the last 10 or 15 years. Last year it issued only three circulars: one on the removal of asbestos; one on portable fire extinguishers; and one which was a subjects index. These were not even new circulars; they were really just revisions of old circulars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should be very careful in looking at the funding of these boards by the Commonwealth. The sum of $500,000 may not seem very much in the context of the annual estimates and expenditure of the Commonwealth of Australia. But as we all know, as with many of these groups that the Commonwealth funds, honourable senators should consider the very need for existence of the Commonwealth Fire Board. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make some remarks about the annual report for 1990-91 of the Australian Safeguards Office by the Director of Safeguards dealing with section 51 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. As a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, Australia has an interest in the operation of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which supervises the treaty at the international level. In recent months we have seen the total failure of the International Atomic Energy Agency to exercise its proper function with respect to detecting what Iraq was doing with its nuclear facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the functions of the International Atomic Energy Agency are of such a nature that it is confused over its role. On the one hand, it is charged with the responsibility of promoting nuclear energy. On the other hand, it is charged with the function of looking after nuclear safety at the international level. Quite clearly, these two functions are in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline</EMPHASIS> program last Saturday night there was an interesting interview with Paul Leventhal, the President of the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, US, and Hans Blix, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. We found that the agency should have been well and truly aware, over quite some time, as to what Iraq was doing but, in fact, chose to turn a blind eye to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his introduction to the program, Paul Murphy referred to the International Atomic Agency as a watchdog. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this particular watchdog was snoozing in its kennel at the time; not that that matters&mdash;it has no teeth anyway.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia should direct very close attention to that matter because Australia teetered on the edge of nuclear war in the case of the recent Iraq-Kuwait conflict. Paul Leventhal went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Agency does a very effective public relations job of making people believe that there really is an effective system capable of detecting bomb-making. They have misled the public and, frankly, it's scandalous, because what we see in Iraq is just fair warning of what's to come.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Paul Leventhal is saying that Iraq is only the foretaste of what will happen in many other countries. Indeed, if one looks in today's newspaper one will see that South Korea is very concerned that North Korea may be developing a nuclear weapon and refusing international inspection of its nuclear facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline</EMPHASIS> on Saturday night, Peter Marshall said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We found that certain figures in the Atomic Energy Agency have long been pressing for its inspectors to act as policemen, following up their own suspicions, but this idea has always been rejected. So frustrated did one inspector become 10 years ago, that he decided to speak out. He warned that one country in particular was planning to build nuclear weapons. For making these comments, the Agency sacked him. The country of which he'd warned was Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA>Ten years ago Roger Richter, who also appeared on the program, was an IAEA inspector who warned of what Iraq was doing. For his pains in warning the world as to what was in store, he was sacked by the IAEA. The program concluded with Paul Leventhal stating:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE (PATHOLOGY)  AMENDMENT (NO. 2) BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to pathology services. This is one of four Bills to put in place the Government's reforms for the restructuring of the pathology industry that were announced in the Budget. The other three Bills are the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1991, the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Licence Fee) Bill (1991). The pathology initiatives which were announced in the Budget were in response to two things&mdash;first, the National Health Strategy Background Paper No 6 "Directions in Pathology" and second, longer term statistical evidence which has indicated that pathology services have been increasing at a disproportionate rate when compared with other medical services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of initiatives has been developed in consultation with representative bodies from the pathology profession. The package includes industry structural reforms, savings measures and schedule fee reforms which will be the basis for further negotiated restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has also established the Pathology Advisory Committee to advise on the implementation of ongoing reforms. The committee membership comprises the Department, the Health Insurance Commission and the pathology profession represented by the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key components of the initiative are the introduction of a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres and proposed regulatory amendments to the Pathology Services Table. A single level schedule fee will be introduced, as opposed to the current SP and OP levels. The schedule fee will be set at seventy percent of the current SP rate for all services except for certain items of cytology and histopathology, and four high volume tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New transaction fees, which represent costs other than those directly involved in the test procedure including the costs associated with transporting of specimens to the laboratory and collecting samples, will be introduced to offset the reduction in the schedule fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an attempt to increase their share of pathology service delivery, there are indications that some pathology practices compete with each other by providing significant inducements for treating practitioners to request pathology services from their practice. Some pathologists may place their trained staff within a doctor's surgery, and this action may not only reduce the doctor's ability to choose between pathologists on a "service-by-service" basis, but may have the undesirable effect of significantly increasing the amount of pathology ordered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 February, in order to be licensed, a collection centre must be an independent facility, owned or leased by an approved pathology authority, which is set up with appropriate equipment and supplies for the collection of pathology specimens. The centre must be staffed by employees of that approved pathology authority and include staff trained in specimen collection procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally recognised within the pathology profession that there are too many collection centres in this country, many of which are operating in very close proximity. Often this has the effect of being inefficient and adding unnecessary expense to the provision of pathology services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number and location of collection centres will be reviewed in co-operation with representatives from the pathology profession, with a view to reducing the number significantly over a two year period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formula for the allocation of licences for permanent collection centres is based on the volume of pathology services, the number of full time equivalent specialist pathologists associated with the practice and the number of treating practitioners who request pathology from that practice. The number of centres operated by some pathology practices will exceed the number which may be granted a licence under the new arrangements. Excess centres may receive temporary licensing and will be phased out over two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 February 1992, private approved pathology authorities will be required to hold a licence for each of their collection centres, to enable the payment of medicare benefits in respect of pathology services rendered at those centres. The licence fee has been set at $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently established pathology practices will be eligible to apply for up to three licences, and so new market entrants will be assisted during their first year of operation. In addition, on a proven needs basis, special consideration may be given to granting licences to centres which service rural areas currently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new transaction fees are intended to cover costs other than the test procedure itself and include indirect operational costs, professional quality assurance, courier and collection costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new transaction fees will be applicable on an episodic basis i.e. a claim may be made for the provision of pathology services requested by a practitioner in respect of one individual on the same day. For example, if a practitioner orders four pathology tests for a person on one day, medicare benefits will be payable for each of those tests but only one transaction fee may be applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together with the reduction of the schedule fees for individual services, the introduction of an episodic transaction fee will remove a distortion in the present arrangements which reimburses pathology providers more than once, where multiple tests are ordered on the same specimen, for costs incurred only once in collecting the specimen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transaction fees are two-tiered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A higher transaction fee of $15.50 will be set for specimens collected in licensed permanent collection centres, private or recognised hospitals, the patient's residence or in a licensed day hospital facilities. The specimen must be collected by an employee of the proprietor of the laboratory in which the pathology service will be rendered or an approved pathology practitioner associated with that laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lower transaction fee of $9.50 will be set for specimens collected in licensed temporary collection centres or the surgery of a treating doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain histology and cytology items will be subject to a different transaction fee structure. This will give recognition to the greater degree of complexity of specimens taken from hospital in-patients. Hospital in-patients generally require more specialised attention than outpatients, and this is reflected in the rendering of some pathology services as compared with those services performed in non-hospital settings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for specific circumstances under which a medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable where the pathology specimen is collected in an unlicensed collection centre. Any person who operates an unlicensed centre will be required to take all reasonable steps to inform both the person from whom the specimen is to be taken, and the pathologist who may perform the pathology service, that medicare benefits will not be payable for the service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable where inappropriate agreement, arrangement or incentive for ordering the service exists between the approved pathology practitioner rendering the service, the treating practitioner requesting the service or a medical entrepreneur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform of collection centre arrangements is being undertaken to negate the potential for this nexus. There must be no functional, direct or indirect, pecuniary or other beneficial contractual arrangement or understanding in relation to the ordering of pathology between the approved pathology authority, a pathologist, the treating practitioner, employer or employee of the practitioner, or any other party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms I have outlined are supported by strengthening sections 129AA and 129AAA of the Health Insurance Act 1973. These sections relate to bribery and prohibited practices in relation to the rendering of pathology services. The categories of persons which can commit an offence against these sections has been broadened, and in particular it will include bodies corporate which in some instances have been used to avoid the restrictions placed on individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties for breach of the conditions of these sections have also been increased significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crucial role of general medical practitioners in primary health care will continue to be encouraged, as will the collection of patient samples in their surgeries, wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bulk-billing arrangements will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patients will not suffer loss of existing entitlements to pathology services. However, the significant reduction in the number of collection centres will encourage GPs to collect specimens themselves. The patient should, therefore, be inconvenienced only when their doctor insists on directing them to a collection centre which may be some distance from that referring doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to assure you that the importance of appropriate use of pathology in disease prevention and diagnosis, is well recognised and supported by Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, inefficiencies in the current arrangements, plus inappropriate use of pathology services, create an unacceptable burden on our health system and the Government's reforms are designed to reduce these inefficiencies and produce a more cost-effective industry. The reforms sit squarely with the Medicare objectives of cost containment, equity and universality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment (No. 2) Bill 1991, specifically allows for circumstances in which medicare benefits will not be payable. That is where the pathology specimens are collected in an unlicensed collection centre or where there is an inappropriate arrangement, or inducement offered for the rendering of that service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, this Bill will put in place a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres, and it will also strengthen the provisions for offences relating to bribery and prohibited practices in relation to pathology services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is complemented by the provisions contained in</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1991,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill 1991 and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>CORPORATIONS (UNLISTED PROPERTY  TRUSTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President: on 23 July 1991 the Treasurer and  the Attorney-General announced a range of measures which the Government would be taking to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. As part of that approach, the Government decided to legislate, with effect from the time of the announcement, for the imposition of a standard twelve month notice period for the withdrawal of funds from existing "public" unlisted property trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, Mr President, real estate is a long term investment. However, managers of unlisted property trusts are required by law to buy-back unitholders investments when requested to do so. This requirement has usually been accommodated by a provision in the relevant trust deeds enabling the management company to redeem from the assets of the trust, units which it is required to buy-back. The relevant legislation does not provide for maximum or minimum periods within which buy-back or redemption requests must be met. This period has been set in the relevant trust deeds. Most investors were, until mid 1990, able to withdraw their investments by giving between one week and two months notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the downturn of the commercial property market, such redemption arrangements have become unworkable. Unlisted property trusts are unable to attract new investments or sell property at realistic values in the current depressed market. Both these avenues had previously provided management companies with the liquidity necessary to meet buy-back or redemption requests on short notice. The realisation that property values had slumped and adverse perceptions created by difficulties in relation to the Estate Mortgage trusts and other corporate collapses resulted in increases in the levels of withdrawals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, most of the unlisted property trusts which were not linked to financial institutions were, in the second half of last year, forced to call meetings of their unitholders to seek their agreement for temporary "freezes" on withdrawals and/or to adopt extended withdrawal notice periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990 the relevant regulatory agency at the time, the National Companies and Securities Commission, acted quickly to attempt to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. In July of that year they established a task force which included representatives of the relevant industry peak bodies to attempt to find a solution to the illiquidity of unlisted property trusts. In August 1990 the NCSC issued a set of guidelines, arising out of the work of that taskforce, designed to enable such trusts to operate on a stable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work of the NCSC was continued by the Australian Securities Commission when it took over responsibility for corporate regulation on 1 January 1991. In February this year, the ASC recommended to the Attorney-General a number of measures which were designed to ensure that unlisted property trusts could operate on a stable basis, despite the weak property market conditions. In brief, these involve requiring such trusts to maintain adequate liquidity levels at all times. A failure to do so would result in the convening of unitholder meetings to consider the future of the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Attorney-General's Department was examining these proposals, the major bank and life insurance company owned fund managers placed before the Government advice relating to the deteriorating state of the unlisted property trust industry and in particular the situation with their trusts. It was apparent that some of these trusts were on the verge of experiencing liquidity difficulties. The Government was convinced, after considering the advice of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank, that the imposition of a standard twelve month notice period was essential if the fund managers were to cope with the difficulties they were facing in meeting withdrawals from their trust at short notice and the interests of unitholders were to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a serious risk that a "run" on these trusts would have developed. Despite possible investor perceptions to the contrary, the parent institutions are not in a position to provide unlimited liquidity support for their funds management subsidiaries. The parent banks especially are not in this position. The Reserve Bank has a policy of restricting dealings of banks with their managed funds subsidiaries to an "arm's length" or commercial basis. In these circumstances, a run on the institution linked funds would have almost invariably led to the "fire sale" of commercial properties into an already weak market. Prices would have been driven down further. As a result, investors would have suffered significant losses. It might be noted that, in any "run" situation, the more sophisticated wholesale or institutional investors tend to be amongst the first to withdraw their investments with ordinary retail investors being left to bear the bulk of the ensuing losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had we allowed a situation to develop whereby the managers of the institution-linked trusts were forced to place large amounts of property onto the market, this could also have led to broader systemic problems for the financial system in general. In particular, a significant proportion of the around 29 billion dollars of non-performing loans currently being carried by the banking system are secured by commercial property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faced with a further substantial fall in property values, the banks would have been forced to increase their loss provisioning against these loans and to reassess the asset quality of currently performing borrowers. The consequent reduction in the supply of credit flowing from that process could have led to more business failures and further job losses in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the standard twelve month notice of withdrawal period does not of itself solve the liquidity problems of unlisted property trusts nor was it intended to. Clearly, it is necessary for many of those trusts to restructure their operations so as to provide a better match between the essentially long term nature of real property as an investment and investor demands for ready liquidity. The introduction of the twelve month notice of withdrawal period is providing management companies and trustees with breathing space in which to reach agreement with their unitholders on restructuring proposals. The Government expects all necessary restructuring to be completed by the end of next July. I note that this process has begun.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the main features of the Bill are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investors in those unlisted property trusts regulated under Corporations Law which existed at 23 July 1991 will be required to give twelve months notice in relation to buy-back and redemption requests in respect of units in those trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This rule will not apply to unitholders who are in financial hardship. Management companies will, where they are satisfied of such a unitholder's financial circumstances, be required to buy-back units as soon as practicable at a discount not exceeding 7.5%. Any disputed cases will be required to be referred to the trustee for determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a mechanism in the Bill to enable unitholders to vary the standard twelve month notice period in circumstances where it is commercially viable to do so. Such variations will require the approval of 75% of unitholders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25% of unitholders eligible to vote do so. A meeting will be able to be convened on the initiative of the management company, trustee or upon a requisition from 50 or one-tenth of the unitholders in the trust (whichever is fewer). In order to avoid a situation where the notice period is shortened in circumstances which may adversely affect the viability of the trust, both the management company and the trustee will be able to apply to the Australian Securities Commission for disallowance of a variation to the notice period. The ASC will be able to disallow such variations where it is satisfied that it may result in a threat to the liquidity of the trust or the liquidity of the management company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the ASC will be empowered to permit the trustee to refuse redemptions from trust assets where it is satisfied that such redemptions are likely to adversely affect the value of remaining units or otherwise prejudice the interests of the remaining unitholders. This provision is designed to prevent a situation where a trust is forced to sell properties into a weak market in order to meet redemption requests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The granting of permission to refuse redemption requests will not, however, alleviate the management company from its obligations to buy-back units in accordance with the trust deed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.require buy-backs and redemptions to be made at the price prevailing on the date of payment as opposed to the date of giving notice;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.enable unitholders to, with the approval of the management company, withdraw a buy-back or redemption request; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.ensure that unitholders do not lose any of their entitlements to income or other benefits between the date of giving notice of withdrawal and when they are actually paid out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have mentioned, the standard twelve month notice period is part of a range of measures designed to restore confidence in the unlisted property trust industry. Other elements of the new regulatory structure which were announced on 23 July are to be given effect to by the making of regulations under the Corporations Law. These regulations, which will be largely based on recommendations made to the Attorney-General by the ASC, are presently being developed by the Attorney-General's Department in close consultation with the ASC and relevant industry bodies. An exposure draft of the regulations is expected to be released later this month for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal features of the new regulatory structure are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.management companies and trusts will be required to maintain an adequate level of liquidity at all times;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a breach of the liquidity requirements will result in the calling of a meeting of investors to consider, among other things, the removal of the manager, the listing of the trust or the winding-up of the trust;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.borrowings by trusts will be limited to 20% of the gross assets of the trust; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there will be a capital adequacy requirement for management companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These requirements are designed to overcome the problem of the essentially illiquid nature of property investments in relation to those trusts which continue to operate as "traditional" unlisted property trusts. The proposed liquidity requirements will be framed in such a manner as to automatically require the convening of unitholders meeting to determine the future of the trust before it gets into a position of serious difficulty. Beyond this the ASC will, as already outlined, have the power to permit the trustee to refuse redemption requests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill also contains provisions which will be applicable to unit trusts in general. First, the Bill will enable amendments to be made to trust deeds for unit trusts where they are approved by 75% (by value) of unitholders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25% (by value) of unitholders eligible to vote do so. Under the existing law, such amendments cannot be made unless they are approved by an absolute majority of unitholders. While the existing rule certainly ensures that management companies take active steps to encourage investors in unit trusts to participate in meetings where amendments to the deed are proposed, there has been some concern that the existing requirement in many circumstances is too onerous. The proposed amendment was sought by the industry. The Government believes that it strikes a better balance between ensuring that trust deeds are not amended without an adequate degree of investor support and the imposition of costs on unit trusts which are ultimately borne by the investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Bill contains an amendment which will ensure that unitholders are able to requisition meetings for the purposes of giving directions to the trustee or management company in relation to the affairs of the trust. Such directions must not be inconsistent with the trust deed. This amendment corrects a difficulty resulting from a judicial decision which effectively meant that unitholders were only able to give directions to the trustee in relation to matters concerning the accounts of the trustee or the accounts of the management company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains an amendment to the Corporations Law to make it clear that the Corporations and Securities Panel has the power to make interim orders pending the final outcome of proceedings brought before it by the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of the Panel, on the reference from the ASC, is to determine whether or not unacceptable circumstances have occurred in relation to an acquisition of shares in a company, or as a result of conduct in relation to shares in or the affairs of, a company. Where the Panel declares an acquisition or conduct to be unacceptable, it may make orders to protect the rights or interests of shareholders or to ensure that the take-over proceeds as it should have done but for that acquisition or conduct. The Full Court of the Federal Court recently ruled that as a matter of statutory construction the Panel does not have the power to make interim orders to preserve the rights of persons pending its final determination of an application before it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment in the Bill ensures that the Panel will have such powers. There is wide acceptance of the need for the Panel to have this power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION  AMENDMENT BILL (NO.2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President: The commencement of the new  national companies and securities scheme on 1 January 1991 was the single most important landmark in the history of corporate regulation in this country. It marked the bringing of corporate regulation for the first time under a single national regulator, the Australian Securities Commission, accountable to a single legislature, the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transition to the national scheme has been a remarkably smooth one with the Australian Securities Commission quickly taking up its key role of providing regulatory supervision of the activities of corporations and the securities markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the new regulatory framework on 1 January marked the completion of the first phase of the Government's program to reform the structure and substance of corporate regulation in Australia. The importance of this for Australia should be not underestimated. Without a credible regulatory environment, Australian companies will not be able to attract local or international investors. There can be no doubt that Australia's reputation as an attractive place for international investment was severely tarnished by the activities of some entrepreneurs. This Government is determined to redress that damage and restore Australia's standing as a place for secure investment. Already there are encouraging signs that the Government's resolute action to turn performance in corporate regulation around is beginning to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second phase of the Government's reform program involves a sustained and far reaching program of reform of key areas of the corporate law long recognised as in need of overhaul. Throughout the 1980's, the flawed structure of the cooperative scheme not only led to inadequate enforcement of the law but also largely impeded the law reform process itself. This Government is determined to remedy the last ten years of neglect in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as honourable Senators are aware the Corporations Law which came into force on 1 January this year introduced some reforms in relation to prospectuses, takeovers and the strengthening of the investigating powers for the corporate regulator. At the time of introduction of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which established that Law, the Government foreshadowed an ongoing program of corporate law reform. The Bill now before the Senate is the second major such reform initiative introduced by this Government since the commencement of the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will recall that the first such initiative was the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1991 passed by this Parliament earlier this year. The first of the package of reforms contained in that Act brought about necessary and long overdue reform to require companies to consolidate their accounts and those of the entities they controlled so that investors and creditors would be able to determine the true financial position of a company. The second key area of reform included in that Act strengthened the law relating to insider trading so that the pernicious practice of insiders dealing on the basis of price sensitive information could be more effectively attacked. These new laws, which came into operation on 1 August this year, have sent a clear signal to local and international investors that integrity and credibility will be restored to our markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill No.2 deals with reform of other discrete areas of the Corporations Law, namely, fundraising, the Australian company number provisions and the settlement of securities transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to fundraising, the Bill proposes a number of technical amendments which will remove current uncertainties in relation to the operation of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Australian Company Number provisions will finetune those provisions to meet business concerns regarding the cost of complying with the ACN requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments will facilitate new settlement procedures for stock exchange transactions and assist the Australian Stock Exchange to improve the efficiency of its settlement procedures. This will enable the Exchange to offer a service which is comparable with best international practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill was publicly exposed with the agreement of the Ministerial Council for Corporations in August. A number of submissions have been received from interested persons and organisations. Many of the suggestions for changes to the Bill have been incorporated into the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the Bill and has approved its introduction into Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing in more detail with the provisions of the Bill, I would like to briefly place this Bill in the context of the Government's overall program for the reform of companies and securities laws. In particular, I want to make it clear that this Bill is far from the end of the story for reform of the law in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proposing that a further Corporations Law reform bill, the third this year, be released for public comment later this year. That Bill will contain much needed and long overdue reforms to the law relating to loans to directors and intra-company transactions, corporate insolvency law and directors' duties. It will also facilitate the introduction of a fully automated clearance and settlement regime for securities traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also bring before the Parliament next year further reforms implementing the recent report of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report on an enhanced disclosure regime for securities. It is the view of this Government that the key to fundraising laws which are fair to all participants and which will attract investment is the putting in place of a regime which ensures the timely disclosure of material information to the market. Such laws, together with a regulatory body which has the foresight and readiness to embrace the best information technology to provide an up to date database, will prove decisive in attracting investment to our markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time now there has been widespread concern as to whether the Corporations Law provides an appropriate regulatory structure for collective investment schemes. The Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee will be reporting on this matter next year. The huge level of funds invested in pooled investments by ordinary Australians make it essential that there is exemplary regulation of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the law enforcement area, the Government expects to introduce legislation soon to enable compulsory powers to be exercised by Australian business regulatory agencies on behalf of their foreign counterparts. The internationalisation of securities markets and the rapid transfer of funds across borders make it essential that the ASC be able assist its overseas counterparts in the investigation and prosecution of offences against securities laws. In turn these agencies will assist the ASC to fulfil its statutory mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another matter which the Government regards as of the highest importance in the area of the enforcement of the Corporations Law concerns the self-incrimination provisions relating to ASC investigations. These provisions are currently under review by the Joint Parliamentary Committee for Corporations. The Committee's report and recommendations will be examined as a matter of the highest priority when available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it will be clear from the outline I have just given that considerable time and resources are being dedicated to the reform of our corporate laws. Given the regulatory failure and the excesses of a small but high profile section of the business community during the 1980's, honourable Senators may rest assured that the Government will continue to maintain the momentum of reform and will continue to do so in close consultation with the business community and related professions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now deal briefly with the key features of the Bill before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fundraising</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stated earlier, significant reforms to the regulation of corporate fundraising came into effect under the Corporations Law on 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is satisfied with the substance of the fundraising reforms. The new provisions have resulted in better information being provided to potential investors and a more informed market. Notwithstanding some criticisms of the provisions, all the signs are that business has quickly adapted to the new fundraising laws. Indeed the significant capital raisings this year indicate that the greater information being provided to the market is facilitating investment activity and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government recognises that experience since 1 January has resulted in the identification of a number of matters which warrant clarification. This Bill includes a number of largely technical amendments for this purpose with a view to ensuring commercial certainty. These amendments are essentially those set out in the exposure draft with some minor modifications as a result of comments made during the exposure period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of releasing the exposure draft in August, the Attorney-General announced that he had asked his Department to review the application of the provisions of the Law which prohibit the issue of prospectuses containing materially false or misleading statements or from which there are material omissions. A range of conflicting views were expressed by various interested parties. Following further consideration of this matter, and in light of public submissions, it is felt that it would not be desirable to amend s.996 in a manner which would involve any significant policy changes at this stage without the benefit of public exposure of the amendments. Instead the Bill includes an amendment which clarifies the position of s.996 by providing that it does not apply to those offers in relation to which a prospectus is not required to be lodged with the ASC. The long term approach to civil and criminal liability in relation to the offers of securities will be reviewed in the context of consideration of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee's recent report entitled "Report on An Enhanced Statutory Disclosure System".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the fundraising provisions in the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.make it clear that the fundraising provisions do not apply to trading of securities on the stock exchange;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.clarify how the prospectus provisions apply to other secondary offers of securities; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.clarify the operation of various defences against civil liability for misstatements in, and omission from, prospectuses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulation of prescribed interests and arrangements (such as unit trusts) under the Corporations Law has also been the subject of some controversy. Apart from the question of the regulation of unlisted property trusts, which is being dealt with in separate legislation, the issue of whether the trustee or the management company is responsible for the keeping of the books of accounts for prescribed interests has caused particular concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report on the appropriate regulatory framework for prescribed interests and other collective investment schemes the Bill contains an amendment to make it clear that the trustee may continue to cause the books of accounts for prescribed interests to be kept by the management company. This will avoid unnecessary and costly disruption to the administration of unit trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registration Numbers of Companies and Registrable Bodies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Australian Company Number (ACN) and Australian Registered Body Number (ARBN) is to provide a simple way of assisting persons dealing with companies, foreign companies and registrable bodies to identify those bodies. The ACN and the ARBN provide a unique nine digit number for each Australian company, foreign company and other registrable body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A moratorium on the use of an ACN or ARBN currently applies to the requirement for companies, foreign companies and other registrable bodies to display their ACN or ARBN on public documents or eligible negotiable instruments under the Corporations law. However, companies and bodies are still required to display their ACN or ARBN on their common seal and any document that is required by the Law to be lodged with the ASC. This moratorium expires on 31 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the amendments proposed to the ACN and ARBN provisions will be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.cash register receipts produced by an electronic machine and which set out information which is stored in the machine will not be required to contain the ACN or ARBN of the company or body issuing the receipt;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.alternative abbreviations for ACN and ARBN (without full stops) will be available for use by companies and bodies in all official documents;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an advertising document issued by a company which is not also used as a document for undertaking some form of transaction with a person will not be required to contain the company's ACN or ARBN;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the ASC will be empowered to exempt a company or bodies that operate in transportation of persons or goods from being required to place its ACN or ARBN on documents that are used in connection with transportation where it is necessary or desirable in the interests of promoting or maintaining consistency in international practice relating to transport documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of fixed date settlement for market transactions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains important amendments which will facilitate the introduction of a fixed date settlement regime for transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. The purpose of this regime is to ensure that settlement of a sale of securities takes place 5 days after the trade. It is anticipated that this requirement will reduce the risk in settlement of share transfers and the claims on the National Guarantee Fund, lead to more certainty for market participants and improve the international competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regime being introduced by the Exchange follows internationally accepted standards for settlement of on-market transactions. Failure to implement such a regime in Australia could lead to off-shore markets becoming more efficient and more competitive than the domestic market. This </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will in turn erode the liquidity of the Australian securities markets. This Bill extends the coverage of the National Guarantee Fund to facilities that have been developed by the Australian Stock Exchange to assist traders to comply with the new settlement requirements. The Exchange will also have access to the Fund for losses suffered by the Exchange as a result of brokers defaulting on their obligations under these new facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY SELF-GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision to pass to the Australian Capital Territory the power to control the Territory's electoral system. The Bill also gives effect to the related decisions to transfer to the Territory the power to determine by enactment the number of Ministers; and that the Territory no longer require the Treasurer's approval to make certain guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1991, this Parliament passed the Australian Capital Territory(Electoral) Amendment Act 1991, which effected certain refinements to the existing electoral system and provides for a referendum to be conducted in conjunction with the next election for the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly. The purpose of the referendum is to determine the Territory electorate's preference between two electoral systems, a single member electorate system based on the House of Representatives system, and a system of proportional representation modelled on the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his Second Reading Speech for the Bill concerned, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories made the following statement, and I quote "The Government believes that following the next A.C.T. election the Assembly will be at a stage where it is able to conduct its own electoral affairs. Accordingly I am pleased to announce the intention of this Government to hand over to the Territory the power to control the Territory electoral system after the next election, scheduled for February 1992". End quote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment by amending three pieces of legislation, the Australian Capital Territory(Self-Government) Act 1988, the Australian Capital Territory(Electoral) Act 1988 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Self-Government Act is of course the legislation which establishes the Territory as a body politic under the Crown, establishes the Legislative Assembly as the body exercising legislative power and, amongst other things, delineates the powers of the Assembly relative to the retained powers of the Commonwealth. In order to effect the hand over of the electoral power, the Self-Government Act is amended to provide that, following the next A.C.T. general election, members of the Territory Assembly will be elected as provided by the Self-Government Act and by enactment of the Territory Assembly; but that until such enactment is passed, members shall continue to be elected as provided by the Self-Government Act and the existing Commonwealth legislation, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. The Electoral Act, which currently provides the Territory electoral system, will thus be repealed on the coming into force of effective Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Self-Government Act is further amended to provide that in future, the Territory Assembly shall have the power to determine by enactment the number of Ministers and that, until such enactment comes into force, the number shall not exceed 5. The existing provisions require that the number shall be 3. In addition, the Territory will no longer be required to obtain the approval of the Treasurer before making guarantees for the discharge of certain obligations. These provisions again reflect the view that the Territory legislature should have greater responsibility for its own affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Capital Territory(Electoral) Act is amended by the repeal of provisions relating to the qualifications of electors, such provisions having been incorporated into the Self-Government Act. At the same time the opportunity is taken to provide that certain Parts of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, as applied by this Act, are subject to amendment by regulation; thus extending an existing provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, several consequential amendments are to be made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Firstly to repeal the provision whereby the Australian Electoral Commission is required to perform such functions as are conferred on it by any law of a Territory, secondly to extend the Commission's powers to enable it to perform certain of its functions in conjunction with an Australian Capital Territory electoral authority and thirdly, to vary an existing provision to provide for joint action with an A.C.T. electoral authority in respect of electoral rolls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterate that it is the Government's view that the Australian Capital Territory legislature has reached the stage where it should be allowed to conduct its own electoral affairs following the next Territory election, scheduled for February 1992. This Bill provides for the hand over of powers to enable this to occur within the legislative framework of the Self Government Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BANK INTEGRATION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bank Integration Bill 1991 will facilitate the integration of savings banks and trading banks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the liberalisation of banking regulation in the mid 1980s, the differential treatment of savings and trading banks became increasingly unnecessary, and the Government decided to remove the distinction for regulatory purposes between them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Banking Legislation Amendment Act, which received royal assent on 7 November 1989, included amendments to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement in the 1988 Budget of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks. The removal of this distinction was aimed at enabling banks within the same group to have better use and allocation of funds, simpler funding and accounting arrangements, and greater flexibility in servicing customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of preparation of the draft legislation in 1989, it became apparent from discussions with the banking industry that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation removed legislative barriers to the integration of trading banks and savings banks, there remained significant administrative costs and legal difficulties. Given the urgency associated with other provisions of the amendment Bill, it was considered inappropriate to defer passage of the legislation to incorporate further amendments. Accordingly, the Government indicated in 1989 in the second reading speech to the amendment Bill that consideration would be given to further legislation to facilitate integration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill serves that purpose by including provisions which facilitate the transfer of the assets and liabilities of each savings bank subsidiary to its trading bank parent. That transfer is, in the main, achieved through the principle of universal succession, but it is also assisted by exemptions from most Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes and fees and by providing for tax neutrality under income tax law. The legislation will thus give further encouragement to savings and trading banks to amalgamate, consistent with the legislation passed by the Parliament in 1989, and in doing so will also simplify the prudential supervisory role of the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the main purpose of this Bill is to allow for the registration of some people as citizens by descent who formerly were eligible to register but did not do so for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation which this Bill seeks to remedy arises from amendments in 1984 to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 which limited the registration of Australian citizenship by descent to persons under eighteen years of age as from 22 November 1986. Attention has been drawn to some people who, as children, were included on their parents' Australian passports and were subsequently issued Australian passports in their own right over a period of many years. These people have always assumed that they were Australian citizens and did not register because they were unaware of the fact that they had been required to do so to become Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Stewart Royal Commission Of Inquiry Into Drug Trafficking recommended tightening passport issuing procedures and the Passports Act 1938 was amended in 1984 to provide that Australian passports could be issued only to Australian citizens. To meet that provision all Australian passport applicants have to prove they are Australian citizens. When some former passport holders have applied for Australian passports they have discovered that they are not and never have been Australian citizens and are therefore not eligible for Australian passports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular group of people consists of those who were born outside Australia to parents who were Australian citizens and, although eligible to be registered as Australian citizens up until 21 November 1986, have not been so registered. Because the people concerned are now over eighteen years of age, they are not eligible to be registered as Australian citizens by descent under the current provisions of the Act. Where they are permanent residents of Australia, they can obtain citizenship under the provisions of the Act relating to the grant of citizenship. Most who have come to notice cannot obtain citizenship under these provisions because they do not have permanent residence in Australia and this naturally causes them a great deal of distress and inconvenience. If they are outside Australia, they cannot return unless they meet the criteria of the Migration legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not foreseen in 1984 that there were people in this category and legislative provision was not made then to protect them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes a new section 10C of the Act which will enable people who are in this situation and have a close association with Australia to apply for registration as Australian citizens by descent, even though they are now over eighteen years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill requires that for an applicant in these circumstances to be registered as an Australian citizen, he or she must have at least one natural parent who was an Australian citizen when the applicant was born and who is an Australian citizen when the application is submitted. If that parent is dead when the application is submitted, then the parent must have been an Australian citizen at the time of death. The applicant must now be eighteen years of age or more and have been born outside Australia. The applicant must also have an acceptable reason for not being registered as an Australian citizen. It is believed that in most cases the reasons given will be that the applicant had previously been issued with an Australian passport and has thus reasonably assumed that he or she was an Australian citizen, or the applicant has been enrolled under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for some years or the applicant was unaware of the registration provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the "acceptable reasons" specified in this Bill, other "acceptable reasons" for failure to register as an Australian citizen may be specified in the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An application will be subject to the normal fee for registration as an Australian citizen by descent and, because of the age of the applicant, subject to a good character requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of people able to obtain Australian citizenship under this proposed amendment is expected to be small. However the distress and inconvenience caused to those affected people is sufficient to justify this amendment to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequential to the major amendment, this Bill proposes an additional amendment to section 10B of the Act. This amendment is necessary to ensure that children of people who obtain Australian citizenship under the major amendment to the Act, as outlined above, or under the existing section 11 of the Act, are considered no differently from children of people who obtained citizenship under the current provisions of section 10B or the former section 11 of the Act. The amendment will require that before a person under eighteen years of age can acquire Australian citizenship by descent through a parent who also acquired Australian citizenship by descent, that parent must have a close association with Australia as already prescribed in section 10B of the Act. To emphasise that close association, section 10B requires the parent, in these circumstances, to have been lawfully in Australia for at least two years at any time prior to the registration of the person as a citizen by descent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill puts forward two further amendments. The first of these provides for review by The Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision to refuse an application for registration as an Australian citizen under the major amendment which has been outlined. The second is to ensure that the current section 11 is consistent in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally Mr President there are five other minor amendments which are listed in the Schedule to this Bill. These amendments relate to references in the Australian Citizenship Act to the Migration Act 1958. When the Migration Act was amended in 1989 its sections were renumbered. The opportunity is taken with this Bill to correct those section numbers of the Migration Act which are quoted in the Australian Citizenship Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating an omnibus Bill, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. I will address myself to parts 2, 5, 7 and 8 of the Bill. I point out that the coalition is not opposing these parts of the Bill, but we do have some reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal first with the amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. The Government's purpose in this part of the Bill is to attempt to ensure that the Commission has the power to enter into a number of financial management risks, hedging transactions, interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, options and futures contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will enable the Minister for Transport and Communications to set guidelines that deal with Australian National Railways' power to enter into such deals. The guidelines may provide that Australian National Railways is only to enter into deals of a specified type. A contract will be taken to have been entered into for hedging purposes if it reduces the risk related to borrowings, revenue obtained by AN from an investment, the cost of commodities obtained by AN or to maintain the value of AN's investment of property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment has come into this Parliament because of a recent judgment of the House of Lords in the Hammersmith and Fulham case. That judgment raised doubts about the power of similar government enterprises in the United Kingdom. Subsequent legal advice indicated that Australian courts could follow with a similar decision. Following the United Kingdom decision, Australian financial institutions indicated that they wanted the matter cleared up before entering into agreements with Australian National Railways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is meant to legalise practices already in use by Australian National Railways but which lack the all important statutory power. It may be useful for me at this point to remind the Senate of the current operations of the Australian National Railways Commission. It operates Tasrail in Tasmania; it carries interstate freight and passengers in conjunction with State railway bodies; and it operates non-metropolitan lines in South Australia and the interstate network between Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie. It is noted that Australian National freight operations are run more profitably than the passenger services which are continuing to run at a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latest issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> there is an excellent article by Mr Tony Thomas entitled `The high cost of work rorts'. It is a fairly encompassing and, in fact, damning article of what is wrong with Australia as a whole. But in relation to Australian National, the article pointed out that from 6 to 9 April this year at Australian National Railways members of the Australian Railways Union placed a ban on the movement of a goods locomotive as a protest at the AFULE members, which is the locomotive engineers union, driving themselves to and from crew relief points. This is just indicative of what is wrong with this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know when the political and the industrial wings of the Australian Labor Party are going to wake up and accept the fact that notwithstanding all the changes&mdash;and some of them are embodied in this Bill&mdash;that are necessary to make an organisation a bit more efficient financially, that is, until the trade union movement and its political arm, the Australian Labor Party, are prepared to address the plethora of restrictive work practices that continue to plague this country, we will never be a clever country, we will never reduce our unit costs of production and we will continue down the path of the road to Argentina and economic oblivion. That is a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vast number of people in the private sector have had to address this; they have had to become more efficient. Yet those in the protected area of closed shops continue to flaunt this country. They do so to their own disgrace because it will end up costing more jobs, and young people coming along will have no future, which is not the way we had it in our generation. Over the past 20 years we have been able to enjoy those luxuries but those days are gone. I believe that neither the industrial wing nor the political wing of the Labor Party will ever face up to this matter while we have this archaic system of industrial relations that exists in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only salvation for this country in the immediate, medium and long term is to move across to a genuine enterprise bargaining system. There can be no doubt that reform of Australia's land transport infrastructure is a key national priority because reform would bring significant benefits for the Australian economy. The October edition of the Business Council of Australia's bulletin quoted an estimate of the Industry Commission that, in achieving world class performance in road and rail, gross domestic product would be increased by up to 2 per cent, with the bulk of this potential gain coming from the rail system itself. Bearing that in mind, it is of some importance that government business enterprises make use of hedging, a form of insurance policy which minimises risk&mdash;or, I should say, attempts to minimise risk because no-one can be too sure with hedging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Government's amendment is consistent with a more commercial outlook for government business enterprises and also legalises established practices, it is only a half-hearted attempt at commercialisation. Hedging will always be a speculative exercise since the hedger thinks that he, of course, can get a better deal by entering into a contract. It is one of those things that continue to be risky but it is part of today's modern enterprises, mainly because of the fluctuations in the value of our exchange rate which were not a feature of Australia some 10 or 15 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doubts that the Opposition raise on this amendment arise because the wording used by the Government does not totally satisfy us that the objectives of the amendment would be attained. We believe it could adversely affect the borrowing powers of Australian National Railways. The problem for the coalition is that the proposed amendment does not give Australian National clear powers to manage its liability portfolio with financial market participants. It gives it the power to hedge. Managing a position includes trying to minimise the cost of funds, and it is a basic requirement to all Treasury operations, but it appears that this amendment may actually narrow AN's ability to act as a commercial Treasury operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, Australian National Railways is acting more commercially than it will be able to with this amendment, because the legislation does not seem to give it the power to unhedge, having gone out and paid for the currency risk. It appears that this amendment denies AN the flexibility of using the money market, as it relates to borrowing on fixed or unfixed rates, to its advantage. Additionally, it appears that Australian National would not be able to borrow in a currency that is not quoted with direct reference to the Australian market. For example, Australian National Railways may want to borrow in Japanese yen at some time and then it may want to swap from yen back to Australian dollars. Because the yen is not quoted with reference to the Australian dollar in financial markets, it would have to swap yen for US dollars and then go back through the American dollars into Australian dollars. The legislation may not allow this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that the proposed amendment does not appease the concerns of the very groups it is designed to satisfy, that is, the financial institutions. Therefore, this amendment may be contrary to the existing requirements under section 18(1) of the principal Act which requires the Commission to `conduct its operations . . . in a manner that accords with sound commercial practice'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the coalition has grave concerns about the Government's amendment to section 2 of this Act as it affects the borrowing powers of Australian National. We believe that steps should be taken to amend the principal Act to make sure the commercialisation of Australian National is done properly. We would amend section 3 to give clearer direction to the involvement of Australian National Railways and its borrowing powers. Section 6(1) should be amended to allow AN's borrowing to be similar to Telecom's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to direct my attention to the amendments proposed for the Navigation Act 1912. This Act deals with the regulation of commercial shipping in Australian waters and Australian ships. It covers the supply of seamen, their working conditions, the issue of safety certificates, salvage and wrecks. There are a few amendments to this legislation. One is to place fishing support vessels outside the sweep of the principal Act so they receive the same legislative treatment as a fishing vessel when engaged in intrastate or interstate trade; in other words, when not on an overseas voyage. The legislation also proposes that fishing support vessels are treated the same as fishing vessels in not requiring the services of a pilot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another unintended consequence of the previous legislation where this little matter&mdash;while not a little matter to the fishing vessels&mdash;was entirely overlooked and, I think, a reflection of how far this Government has sunk in the way it handles legislation and the way it handles the whole economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year legislation designed to ensure more protection of the environment of the Great Barrier Reef was introduced and passed with the support of both Houses of Parliament. That legislation provided for compulsory pilotage on board all vessels longer than 70 metres travelling through the reef. At that time, although the Opposition supported compulsory pilotage to help protect the Great Barrier Reef from accidents damaging to the reef, we drew these concerns to the attention of the Government and highlighted the fact that we believed there had been inadequate consultation with the industry on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was that fishermen were exempted from having the compulsory pilotage on board their vessels while travelling through the Great Barrier Reef or fishing in reef waters. Unfortunately, what was not included was fishing support vessels&mdash;the vessels which supply the fuel, food and general supplies to the fishing vessels while they are out on the job. The coalition supports this amendment to the Act because many of those vessels would have crew on board who would be more familiar with the area than even the pilots who are employed to provide safe passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vessels that are under construction are also to be exempted by this amendment. The legislation also makes changes in relation to the qualifications of masters, officers, seamen and pilots which will ensure that proper and adequate regulations are in place applying to licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention briefly that the Opposition is concerned about the provision of pilotage services, particularly in the Torres Strait and Great Barrier Reef. The concern is that these services are provided by a monopoly provider and we believe there should be competition for pilotage services in these areas, as is the case in many other ports and maritime areas around Australia. It is only with competition that the best services will be provided at the cheapest prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment aimed at ensuring that we have properly licensed vessels deals with alterations to ships and the cancellations of certificates. The amendment ensures that if there is any damage or alteration to a hull or to the design of a ship that could make it unseaworthy, the master and the owner of that ship must report those changes to the relevant authorities. This requirement, of course, will ensure a continuing high standard of seaworthiness of vessels. I should also point out that there is a fine provided in the Bill for non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A minor, but interesting, amendment to the Navigation Act 1912 is the change in the name of the longstanding measurement of Greenwich mean time&mdash;something we have all been brought up on. It is now to be called `coordinated universal time'. I do not think it is proper for me in this place to go into the reasons for that, but I think there was one particular country that hung out because it would not accept the British Greenwich mean time. This will, I trust, do away with the two universal standards of time measurement brought about by the fact&mdash;I said I would not say it, but I might as well&mdash;that the French would never accept Greenwich mean time as it is in Britain. The French overcame this problem by establishing their own standard. It is to be hoped that there will be one standard from now on. No wonder there were problems in the early days with establishing the European Economic Community when there was some difficulty with one country being able to see the other across the water and being unable to agree on the time standard to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last legislative change that I propose to mention is the amendment to the Trade Practices Act which deals with shipping conference services. It deals with international liner cargo shipping and ensures that some sections of the Act which deal with certain restrictions of trade do not apply to certain conference agreements, that is, agreements between international shippers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in the Bill provide that certain sections are not to apply to conference agreements that specify freight rates. They enable the shipping companies that become part of the shipping conference service to be exempt from the anti-competitive aspects of the Trade Practices Act. There is a large group who would say that this should not be allowed if we are to value competition and, of course, we all do. They say we should not allow exemptions from the Trade Practices Commission which enable shipping companies to join together for what seems like anti-competitive arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it should be pointed out that shipping conference services have a falling share of the market and now comprise less than half the market of shipping services into and out of Australia. For example, the Chinese line has been operating for a while in and out of Australia on a very competitive basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would actually happen in this circumstance is that, whenever a conference member changed any one of its myriad freight rates, it would be required to provide a variation to the conference agreement. Of course, we are all interested in trade, and improving our trade position would create a tremendous administrative burden for the shipping companies and the shippers themselves, particularly when the shipping freight rates are publicly available anyway. They are well known. The Opposition, therefore, shares the Government view that there should be an exemption for shipping freight rate charges from the requirement to be registered with the Trade Practices Commission, and we support the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the legislation also amends the title of an item under the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990&mdash;yet another mistake in a previous Act. It omits the Protection of the Sea (Levy) Act 1983 and substitutes the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981. This is an error by those who drafted the legislation. I might say it is the type of error which has become commonplace with this Government and it is only necessary because one word, the word `levy', was left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated when I first spoke in this debate, the parts of the Bill that I have covered are parts 2, 5, 7 and 8.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which Senator Parer has already described as an omnibus Bill. In the form in which it was first presented to this House, it sought to amend six Acts of Parliament. The Australian Democrats were disappointed last night when the Government introduced a very extensive amendment which seeks to amend a further three Acts of Parliament. Initially we were asked to debate that extensive amendment at 10 o'clock this morning, it having been introduced at 10.15 last night. That is not a very satisfactory way of proceeding with such a complicated piece of legislation. My colleague Senator Kernot will be speaking to that particular section at the committee stage but will not be speaking in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to comment briefly on the three Acts which are amended by the Government's amendment and refer in particular to the Acts Interpretation Act, which is amended by reducing the period for the disallowance of regulations under that Act from 15 sitting days to five sitting days. We find that somewhat objectionable as it creates a dangerous precedent. A period of 15 sitting days has been set for a good purpose, namely, to allow people not only in this chamber but outside the Parliament a good opportunity to look at those regulations and to make representations for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the reason for the haste&mdash;the undue haste, if I may so put it&mdash;is that commercial interests are waiting in the wings in relation to the second carrier. We are a little concerned that those interests, both in the bureaucracy and in the outside world, should rush the normal parliamentary process and that the Government should so willingly accede&mdash;and if the Senate accedes to this amendment the Senate itself accede&mdash;to those sorts of changes which perhaps create an undesirable precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pick up on several provisions in the part of the Bill that was presented to us earlier, particularly in regard to the financing of Australian National Railways, but also to some extent in relation to the financing of the Civil Aviation Authority. The Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983, as amended by this legislation, has as its purpose, as stated in the second reading speech, `to minimise their exposure to adverse interest rate variations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the very important issue of the way in which the Government has chosen to go to private interests, to private banks, to raise money for Government expenditure. It is an issue that I have raised on several previous occasions. I raised it in connection with the Government's floating of 30 per cent of the interest in the AIDC some time ago. I pointed out that the Government could, if it chose, create its own credit to expand that organisation. On that occasion Senator Walsh, who was then the Minister for Finance, said that that was an old-fashioned way of doing things. He did not say that there was anything wrong with it but simply said that it was old-fashioned. I was surprised, and still am, that a good idea should cease to be applied simply because it became old-fashioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the Government itself is keen to manipulate interest rates and when it is widely recognised that private banks create 90 per cent of the money that is in circulation simply by book entry, I find it surprising that the Government should continue to fund important public instrumentalities, such as Australian National, out of the private creation of credit on which interest, albeit at variable interest rates, has to be paid. It produces among other anomalies the necessity for the passage of this sort of legislation, namely, legislation in which the Australian National Railways Commission must be protected from adverse interest rate variations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government chose, as it might have done when it first created the Commonwealth Bank specifically for this purpose, to create that credit itself for Australian National it would not then be necessary to pass this sort of legislation to protect Australian National from those adverse interest variations. As we now know, the Commonwealth Bank has been sold off, so the Government has lost and is progressively further losing the ability to make those sorts of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we are recognising the need to divert as much transport as possible, particularly heavy transport, from road to rail, I would like to draw the distinction between the way in which road is funded by way of grants and rail is funded by way of loans, which loans have to be repaid with interest. At a time when it is generally recognised that rail is a lot more efficient in its energy consumption and the number of lives lost per tonne kilometre carried, I believe that to further lock rail into borrowings so that it can serve its function simply confirms that the Government has not yet recognised that rail needs to be funded somewhat differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent my remarks on financing also refer to the Civil Aviation Act, which is amended by this legislation. That Authority also seeks to be protected from interest rate variations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to refer briefly to the Navigation Act 1912, which is amended by this legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes a number of amendments. . . The most significant amendment places fishing fleet support vessels outside the ambit of the Act when not on an overseas voyage. Fishing fleet support vessels are presently trading vessels for the purposes of the Navigation Act, although the fishing vessels they serve are not. The Bill will correct this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An agreement was recently reached that in certain parts of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area certain types of vessels must carry a pilot. The Bill makes provision for the issue of appropriate pilot qualifications for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That legislation passed through this place relatively recently, certainly within the past few months. As I recall, the second reading speech on that occasion gave the interesting figure that some 200 vessels a year passed through that inner channel north of Cairns and around to the Torres Strait without carrying a pilot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the committee stage I will ask the Minister precisely what qualifications will be demanded of the operators of these mother fishing ships when they pass through that area, or will operators of those vessels simply be given pilot qualifications without necessarily being required to carry a fully qualified pilot? For some years it has been recognised that the potential for serious environmental damage in that northern part of the reef is considerable. The Government is to be praised for requiring the carriage of properly qualified pilots. One hopes that this amending legislation does not in any way derogate from that strict requirement for properly qualified pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also seeks to amend the Parliamentary Broadcasting Act 1946. That is fairly straightforward in that it extends the matter of privilege to those broadcasts. At the committee stage I will also ask the Minister how and why certain parts of parliamentary proceedings are broadcast and other parts are not. I feel that will be the appropriate time to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to one part of this omnibus Bill that is before us this afternoon and to follow on from my colleague Senator Parer who spoke earlier on other clauses of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. The clauses with which I will deal relates to the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is very large and very unwieldy. It is described quite accurately as an omnibus Bill. Obviously, the Government has difficulty in managing a Bill as large as this. As Senator Coulter so pertinently observed, a whole swag of amendments were circulated to us at a very late hour last night. Everyone has coped with them, but it was an unnecessary imposition on the legislative process to dump a whole heap of new amendments on the legislators when we already have a very large Bill before us dealing with a whole range of subjects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It demonstrates one of the great shortcomings in the way this Government has organised the departments of state. The megadepartments simply have not worked. They have not worked because they lack a common thread. There is simply no common element between transport, for example, and communications. When we look at the whole field of transport&mdash;surface transport by sea and by land, subdividing land into rail and road, and air transport; I think it is difficult to include air transport with the rest of transport because of some of its very special characteristics&mdash;to then take an aggregation of transport and put it with communications, with no common interest at all, is just a nonsense. I look at the press, the media, telephonic communications, Telecom Australia, OTC Ltd, Aussat and all of broadcasting which are all lumped into one department of state. Even were the portfolio to have a competent Minister&mdash;which it does not&mdash;it would be quite unmanageable because of the immensity of the task involved. I hope that the incoming Liberal-National Party Government takes a more intelligent approach to the departments of state and aggregates them in areas of like interest so that they can be managed, and managed efficiently for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal briefly with the amendments to the Civil Aviation Act and outline from the Bill what the amendments provide. The first part deals with currency contracts for hedging purposes on loans. The second part deals with flying unregistered aircraft and provides penalties for that. It also provides for the flying of aircraft without the correct licensing and the correct maintenance procedures and the issuing of authorisation for various aviation procedures. Then there is a section empowering courts to exclude people who have been convicted of offences for a certain or an indefinite period and sections dealing with the removal of the exemption from income tax, the imposition of statutory liens, the removal of aircraft under lien from Australian Territories and the validation in the form of regulations of a practice that has been going on for some while with reference to private companies in safety matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first general observation I make about the amendments to the Civil Aviation Authority Act is that they are clearly written by the same person or persons who wrote the amendments that came before the Senate, I think, just before we rose for the winter recess. In other words, the amendments still have the same jackbooted, stand and deliver approach. I spoke at some length about that in the presentation of the last series of amendments to the Act. The same vein runs through the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost everything attracts a penalty of two years in gaol if people are found guilty. That is at variance with many of the other penalties that this society exacts for misdemeanours, crimes or breaches of the law. Last time the argument that was put by the Government was that the Parliament had agreed to these rather severe penalties in similar circumstances with respect to aviation in the past and it was only conforming with that. We had the usual assurances that the legislation would be interpreted sensitively and carefully with due respect to the community. That is all very well, but the unfortunate fact of life is that, where we have draconian penalties, there will always be people who will use those penalties in a way that is not sensitive and at times inappropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have is that the powers granted to the Civil Aviation Authority are very great with respect to somebody's livelihood. It can take away a pilot's licence and thereby deprive him of his livelihood. It can take away an airline operator's licence just as rapidly or it can take away a maintenance organisation's licence. The difficulty I have is that, after my involvement in the aviation industry of well over a quarter of a century, I do not see any change in the way the Civil Aviation Authority inspectors operate today compared with their operations 25 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to get this out of perspective. The great majority of the inspectors and investigators do conscientiously discharge their duties honestly and accurately and with due caution to the best of their abilities. There are also those who do not. As I say, I have been involved in aviation for a long while. I have no illusions about the people who are involved in the industry. There are the good and there are the bad; there are the honest and there are the dishonest. But I do think that in the time that I have spent in the industry I can make a reasonable assessment of the good ones and winnow them out from the bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties I have is that the Authority very rarely goes after the bad ones. It may be that it does not have the insight to detect them, which it should have because the aviation community in Australia is a small community. It has always been a small community and people know what is going on. The Authority should know the good from the bad. It may be, as I suspect happens in a number of cases, that the Authority gets bullied by the bad operators who stand over the inspectors. I am not talking necessarily about very wealthy operators; once we get away from the airlines, there are no wealthy operators in the aviation industry. People who are doing the wrong thing often seem to be able to bully their way out. The people who end up in trouble with the Authority are often honest operators who just get harassed and get into a great deal of difficulty in their relationship with the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as somebody in the former Department of Civil Aviation told me when I first learned to fly, the Department never forgets. Once there has been an infraction or a run-in with the Department in some way, the corporate memory is such that it stays with that body. That is an affliction that someone involved commercially in the aviation industry has to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the amendments that are before us, I think that the penalties by and large are too severe. There are too many penalties of two years in gaol without any option. I come back to the way in which the investigations are carried out. One of the unfortunate things about the industry is the way in which investigators often operate alone, without any witnesses. At the end of the day, when an operator complains about something that has been done to him by the Civil Aviation Authority, it ends up being his word against the Authority's; there are never any witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a large number of complaints made to me over the years. There are still complaints being made. If I could generalise without identifying any company, I could say that where a company or an operator is investigated the operator may hear nothing about it for four or six months. Meanwhile, those people do not know where they stand. I think the operators ought to be told the decision and be told as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the other problem, which I referred to before, of the abuse of authority. I will give two examples which have come to my notice in the recent past. The first concerned a company which was operating an aircraft. The aircraft landed to refuel somewhere and the Civil Aviation Authority inspector went up to the pilot in command of the aircraft and accused him of exceeding his flight time limitations. There was a tight schedule to be followed. The company was not exceeding its flight time limitations. But, in the end, it had to hire another pilot to complete the operations for the day because it had a contract to perform. The schedules were delayed. So the company was involved in unnecessary expense and emotional trauma. In that example, which happened some months ago, the company has not heard another word about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another example, a company fired a pilot. That pilot made a complaint against his former employer, alleging certain breaches of regulations. The pilot, by the way, was fired for lack of competence as a pilot; there was no dispute about that. The company was not then investigated, but the Civil Aviation inspector went to one of the junior pilots of the company and said, `We have had these allegations made about the company; what can you tell us about it?'. The pilot concerned told the Department all it wanted to know, and there was no incriminatory evidence at all because the company is quite ethical. When the interview was over, the Civil Aviation inspector said to that pilot, `Don't tell your management about this. Keep this quiet; it is just between us. We will take it up with the company at a later date'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilot concerned was very worried about that. After several sleepless nights, he told his manager. The manager called in the inspector and had a meeting with him. The long and the short of it was that the Authority denied that it had tried to stand over this pilot in any way&mdash;it had used quite a heavy-handed technique of interrogation on the junior pilot. In the end the manager of the company said to the inspector, `Look, you're telling me this didn't occur. My pilot said it did. I'm going to have no option but to fire him, because we run an honest company here and we won't tolerate untruthfulness. So what's the position? He's going to be fired on your say-so because your story is correct'. At that point the inspector ummed and ah'd and said, `Well, it may be that that interpretation could have been put on what I said'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to prove this in a court of law because it gets down to the inspector's word against the company's word. But I have been around long enough to form a judgment on this particular situation, and I am satisfied in my mind that a minority of people&mdash;I stress that it is a minority&mdash;in the Department are abusing their power. I think that is an intolerable situation and, as a legislator, I will do all I can to stop abuses of power in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do think it ought to be brought to the notice of the CAA, because I am quite sure that if the Chairman of the CAA, Dick Smith, were to be interrogated by one of these people he would go off the deep end about it. He would not tolerate it for five minutes. But the very nature of the operation of the CAA means that it would never take on someone like Dick Smith in the same way as it would pick on a poor charter pilot operating somewhere around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the amendments before us today. First of all, there is the business of futures contracts which is quite minor. We then come to flying an unregistered aircraft, which the Opposition takes no exception to. It is quite reasonable that there should be penalties for that. We then get to the point about the issuing of a certificate of airworthiness and a maintenance release. I flag the fact that in the committee stage I will be moving an amendment to this section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An aircraft operates with two forms of authorisation. Firstly, one has to have an overall certificate of airworthiness. I have forgotten, but I do not think that is time dependent; once the aircraft is registered the certificate of airworthiness is granted and that document is necessary to operate the aircraft. On top of that, a piece of paper called a maintenance release is issued. The general rule for a maintenance release is that it operates for a period of 12 months or 100 hours flying time, whichever expires sooner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law has always required that an aircraft must have a valid maintenance release. Either the ground engineer or the pilot taking responsibility for the aircraft, each day it flies, must sight the maintenance release and sign for the aircraft on the maintenance release. The maintenance release contains any special conditions with respect to the maintenance of the aircraft. It always has a running total&mdash;the time in airframe hours at which it was issued&mdash;and each day, at the end of flying, the number of hours flown has to be entered on it. That is quite proper; we have no quarrel with that. But proposed new subsection 20AA(5) of the Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An owner, operator, hirer. . . or pilot of an aircraft must not:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">operate the aircraft; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">permit the aircraft to be operated;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so as to contravene subsection (3) or (4).</PARA>
<PARA>This refers to operating without a certificate of airworthiness or a maintenance release. I think the Government's intention there is very clear. But, since the penalty is mandatory imprisonment for two years, I think the word `knowingly' ought to be inserted so that it reads that an owner, operator, et cetera must not knowingly operate the aircraft. That would be much more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were in the business of hiring aircraft and I hired an aircraft to someone else, it would go out with a valid maintenance release. But, once that aircraft leaves my physical control&mdash;it could be hired out from Sydney and it could go to Perth, Darwin or somewhere like that&mdash;a person could fly it beyond the terms of the maintenance release, it could go beyond its 100 hours, and the maintenance release would expire. In that circumstance, I think it would be quite wrong to put the owner of the aircraft&mdash;who physically could not do anything about it&mdash;in gaol for two years. I think a simple amendment there would be in accordance with the Government's wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendment deals with flying an aircraft without a licence. There have been a number of changes in regulations covering that in recent years and, again, we have no difficulty with that. I think the exclusion period after an offence is a good idea. If the Department does get the bad people in the industry, I think those people ought to suffer more than a fine; particularly where they are operating in an irresponsible or reckless way, as some people do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, personally, have one case against me at the present time where I view one agency as having operated in a grossly incompetent way with respect to the safety of a maintenance procedure. I think guilty people should be deprived of the right to be authorised by the Department to perform certain tasks&mdash;whether it is in the maintenance field or in the operating or flying field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption from income tax has been waived, and we have no difficulty with that. We then come to currency contracts and the imposition of a statutory lien. I will also be moving an amendment here in the committee stage. I think the imposition of a statutory lien is quite valid for the Department when it is going about its statutory functions of licensing and regulating the industry. If it imposes a fine and it is not paid, I think it is proper that it should take a lien. But we are now dealing with a government business enterprise which is involved in all sorts of other commercial activities. I am unaware of any other body in Australia which can put a statutory lien on commercial activities in order to recover debts. I have a reservation about that being a matter of statute; but it may be that the Government can explain its position a bit more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not something that I am just pulling off the top of my head. If one reads Sections 67 and 69 of the parent Act, one will find that in that legislation the Government differentiates between charges for regulatory and licensing functions and for other commercial enterprises. One clause also says that charges must bear a reasonable relationship to the service provided and must not be a taxing element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we come to the amendments to the CAA Act that were passed to us at a late hour last night. In the guise of an environmental heading they provide certain compensatory powers for damage arising from wave vortices. I have no objection on behalf of the Opposition to what is involved there. However, I find that some elements of it are quite unusual, and I will be taking time during the committee stage to go through them in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a discretionary compensation, which is a little unusual because it may or may not be applied. I am interested to know how the CAA, which is underwriting the compensation, will protect itself. Since the amendment is specifically restricted to vortex generation but excludes the effects of vortices on other aircraft in flight, it does have an unusual element to it. I look forward to the explanation by the Government as to why it wishes to do that. I do not anticipate any opposition from this side of the chamber to that section being included in the parent Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final part of the amendments deal with the Federal Airports Corporation. They are really quite simple. They are in two parts and deal with the transfer of Commonwealth land which had been acquired for airport construction in the future to the Federal Airports Corporation, and for the Federal Airports Corporation to develop that land for airport use in the future. The final part is the clarification of the Corporation's liability to pay income tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of amendments within this omnibus Bill, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. They have been outlined extensively, firstly, in the second reading speech by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and, secondly, by Senators Coulter, Parer and MacGibbon in their contributions, so I will not reiterate them. None of them would constitute a major amendment, but as a piece of legislation they collectively make significant changes for the individuals concerned. What is to the nation as a whole often considered to be minor can be very important to the individuals, industries or corporations affected. For that reason I thank honourable senators for their consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two or three specific matters were raised in the second reading debate to which I wish to respond. Most of them will be better dealt with in the committee stage and I will leave those to that time, but there are three particular matters to which I wish to make brief reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was distracted during the best part of Senator Parer's contribution, but I understood him to be expressing concern that the amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 perhaps did not go far enough. At the moment, the Government has considered that issue; it is not the first time that the matter has come before it. The Government does not accept that criticism. We think that it enables AN to enter into bona fide hedge transactions to reduce its risk, but it does not authorise it to go beyond that into more speculative activities. The balance is what the taxpayers would expect the Government to be imposing on a statutory authority with a particular and designated task. I am sure that Senator Parer will continue to monitor that matter as these amendments are implemented, as will the Government. In any event, that is the Government's position on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter raised a matter which I accept is of importance. In one sense it will come up in the committee stage. There is an important question of principle involved concerning the change in the requirements for disallowance. That is not something that ought be dealt with lightly by the Senate, because the disallowance procedures are important to the Parliament's power of scrutiny. We all know that at the moment that is effectively exercised in the Senate. The Government would not lightly move to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter acknowledged, and it is clearly the case, that the power of the Senate to disallow is not in any way impaired; it is simply a question of changing the time within which that can be exercised and within very clearly defined and circumscribed limits, particularly concerning the problem with the sale of the second carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the second carrier and the consequent commencement of network competition in telecommunications is dependant on the bidders having certainty about the regulatory regime in which they will be operating. It is an appropriate balance to say that we will provide that certainty to enable that competition within the timetable envisaged, but in a manner that preserves the ultimate authority of the Parliament to disallow the instruments if it is concerned with them. There will be a sunset clause for that section so that it will have no continuing effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I wish to refer to in the second reading debate relates to a point made by Senator MacGibbon. He expressed concern that the Act did not give discretion to the courts with regard to the penalty to be imposed under certain offences. My advice is that the sections concerned have to be read in conjunction with the provisions of section 4 of the Crimes Act 1914, which means that those penalties have to be interpreted as maximum penalties only and that the courts will, as a consequence of the impact of the Crimes Act on this Act, have a discretion as to whether to impose the maximum penalty and to look at the circumstances of the particular case. It would also mean that the court has a discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty instead of the custodial sentence. That is resolved because of the impact of the other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other queries which a number of senators raised, in particular towards the end by Senator MacGibbon, will be dealt with in the committee stage. It is more appropriate to deal with them then rather than duplicate the debate now. I thank honourable senators for their essentially positive contributions to the debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 and raise a number of matters with regard to the proposed guidelines that have been established as far as the hardship test is concerned, particularly as it affects the farm sector. I also want to say that, as far as that sector of the community is concerned, it is indeed a sad day when we have to be here debating this in the way that we are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to begin by referring to the industry statement that was brought down last March. If that had been enacted last March instead of coming before us this week in this place, with regard to the changes to sales tax some $200m could already have been saved to the sector in terms of costs and imposts on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I raise is in relation to costs and imposts&mdash;and it is a position I raised the other day and will continue to raise until something is done about it&mdash;of the Commonwealth Development Bank and its lack of access to all credit lines that other banking operations have. It is absolutely crucial that such access be given; it would not cost the Government one cent if in fact the Commonwealth Development Bank was given access to full credit lines and was freed up in that sense so that it could operate properly as a bank. My personal view in the longer term is that, in due course, the Commonwealth Development Bank should be privatised and allowed to operate as such. However, I will not deal with that subject today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise a matter particularly affecting the south-eastern part of Western Australia where I come from&mdash;the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs will be looking at this in relation to the drought&mdash;where the seasonal conditions and rainfalls for the last two years have been some 60-odd per cent below their normal average. A survey was done of operations in that area, not only concerning the farm sector in isolation but also the small businesses in towns like Esperance, Ravensthorpe, Munglinup and Lake Grace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was found in the Ravensthorpe and Munglinup shires that 38 per cent of the debt in that area was held with the Commonwealth Development Bank. To put it very simply, that debt to the Commonwealth Development Bank amounted to just in excess of $200,000 per business operation. If the Commonwealth Development Bank had access to commercial bill roll-over loans, whether rolled over monthly or set at five years which can be done, there is the opportunity to reduce the interest rates on those loans by 5 per cent which, on the average level of borrowing, amounts to $10,000 per property or business. That would be a significant way, without having to go through the process of filling out forms and the trauma associated with it, in which these operations could have an impost removed. I will not use the word `assistance', but those people could have an impost taken off them which other people, using different lines of credit, do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not easy to change from the Commonwealth Bank because of the penalties that exist in the system. I believe this would in fact lower their overall costs. When we are talking about hardship, there is much room for a number of things to be done. I emphasise that this would not be like the rural adjustment operation which comes from the public purse, but this would come from allowing full access to credit lines for what is and has been a very large and a very successful banking operation. But with the changes which occurred five or six years ago to the financial arrangements in this country, it is beyond my belief that, in this country, with financial deregulation we have had that financial operator left with limited access to credit lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the hardship provisions, the particular area that concerns me is the working capital component and the way that it is structured. I have to acknowledge that in terms of the correspondence that we have had back from the Minister we have come a long way from where we were a couple of weeks ago. I certainly acknowledge the work that Senator Alston has done in terms of this matter and getting us to this point. One must recognise that the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Wilson Tuckey, who represents much of the area I have been talking about, also raised a number of these points which have been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular area I want to address concerns the matter of shares and debentures in a public company. I seek clarification of this point for a number of reasons. If one looks at the situation which exists in Western Australia, and I am sure in other States but I am familiar with Western Australia, we find operations such as SBS Rural Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd and others which do not fit into the cooperative status but which are major su<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>ppliers of merchandise or goods used in farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wesfarmers Ltd's main activity, as far as the farming sector is concerned, is that it is a monopoly manufacturer of fertiliser. M<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>any farmers hold very small shareholdings&mdash;it can be from $1,000 to $5,000&mdash;in that operation, and this is important for two reasons. Firstly, it maintains shareholder control of a major supplier to the agricultural industry. Of course, Western Australia is by far and away the largest user of fertiliser per farming operation or per acre of any of the States. Whilst there are not large dividend returns, it is very important that that control stay in the hands of the users of this product where a monopoly in manufacturing to the agricultural industry exists. There is of course a very small amount used on lawns in Perth and such like, but that would be very insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make an appeal to the administrators of the guidelines and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is the Minister at the table&mdash;I was hoping that Senator Richardson would be here&mdash;that small shareholdings in a public company, such as Wesfarmers Ltd, not be considered readily saleable assets. It is very important from a business point of view that that control in fact stays in the hands of the people who use the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same situation applies to SBS Rural, which is the largest supplier of farming merchandise in Western Australia. It does not deal in anything else, although obviously some people who are not farmers buy its products. It is worth looking at the history of SBS Rural and putting it on the public record. SBS started off in Esperance some 20-odd years ago with a small group of farmers&mdash;and I was one of them&mdash;who were concerned at the cost of their inputs. We put together what is known as EOPP&mdash;Esperance Organised Purchasing Power&mdash;which became the basis for the structure of what is known as SBS Rural today. EOPP still operates, and there is a similar operation in Geraldton and another in Albany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there is a structure across Western Australia which in essence appoints SBS Rural each year as the agent which supplies these goods and services. This has enormous benefits to the individual users of the product because in essence they control it, both through that membership of the EOPP and, with the floating of the company some two years ago to increase its capital base, by being a shareholder. The majority of people invested somewhere between $1,000 and $5,000. It had nothing to do with investing in a public company, in the true sense of an investment portfolio, but was done for the supply of the required merchandise in terms of the operation of the farms. I would hope, in terms of the guidelines, that some consideration will be given to the situation I have mentioned. It is very important that farmers help themselves. There have been many self-help programs which we have heard about in just over 12 months since I have been in this place.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many instances the individuals who took out the $5,000, for example, of shares actually borrowed the money to do it because they believed, and they were encouraged by people such as me, that if there were some mode of control over a major supplier and effective competition were kept in the marketplace the cost would be kept down. Of course, that is the name of the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the guidelines, there is one other very important point that I would like to raise in relation to education. I refer to the people who live in isolated areas of Western Australia. I hope that provision can be included in the guidelines so that people who have set aside money for the education of their children, as many have done because they do not have access to public sector secondary education, are not required to use that money for another purpose. They have no option, because of distance, but to work through the private school system. I just happen to be one of those people who have set aside money for the education of their children. I hope that the money that is held in cash reserves designated for education is not included as realisable assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to hardship provisions and the issue of working capital. I note what the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, said. On the surface, it looks okay but one always lives with a degree of fear or trepidation when one reads the written word and then one sees what actually occurs when matters get in the hands of the bureaucrats. We have seen this consistently. This is a criticism of the Rural Adjustment Authority. Its interpretation is quite different to what was the intention of the decision makers who passed the legislation at the time. I hope there is some training for the bureaucrats who have the role of determining whether a particular input of working capital is realisable, because I am certain that at times it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On income equalisation deposits, I have no problem with those deposits being nominated as ready, realisable assets, because that is what they are. However, I would caution that such a determination could impact on particular cases in south-eastern Western Australia and, I am sure, on other States. That is the case where operators, because of the drought, have sold stock. They have put that money away in income equalisation deposits for restocking purposes. There has to be some flexibility in the operations of IEDs in those cases. Maybe the guidelines could be written in such a way that, if money has been put away in IEDs for specific purposes, especially for restocking&mdash;money raised from the sale of stock&mdash;there should be some flexibility in its application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On these hardship provisions, we intend moving an amendment to remove the two-year period. It seems absolutely ludicrous or unbelievable that we could be sitting here trying to make a judgment that in two years there will not be any hardship. Regardless of whether one has high commodity prices, which have occurred in the past, or low commodity prices, in a country as wide and as broad as Australia there is always some sector, whether it be in fruit growing, dairying, wheat growing, wool growing&mdash;and I could run through many more&mdash;that is under financial pressure for a variety of reasons. It could well be caused by drought, flood, fire or famine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would strongly urge the Australian Democrats to support us in removing the two-year period. Once hardship provisions are in place it is ludicrous for us as decision makers to try to determine that at such and such a date there will no longer be any hardship under those hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many ways in which the pressure can be taken off those people who are now suffering from this recession. Much of it has come from the policies and the directions that we have had to put up with from one ex-Treasurer, Mr Keating. Had he been a little more flexible in his application of monetary policy and put a little more emphasis on micro-economic reform and fiscal management, we would not be sitting here debating the way we are today. While there is a world-wide impact of a recession in many countries and low commodity prices, many of the problems today have been engineered by none other than the ex-Treasurer. It will be a very sad day if he ever gets to lead this country, because he proved clearly that he did not have a clue how to manage and run a business. In that period of time, he did his best to send it broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate what I said about the Commonwealth Development Bank and wholesale sales tax on oils and lubricants. Most of the harvest will be off. We will find that from the March statement virtually a full year of operating costs has gone by. If the industry or job statement that the Government brings down tomorrow is going to do any good, it should be acted on immediately and the Government should not wait for another 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the Senate is debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. Labor claims to be the party of the battler. Yet its policies have often failed to do much to assist those in need of help. The assumption that the worst off will always do better under Labor is now seen to be untrue. Lower and middle income earners have suffered most from Labor's economic mismanagement, with their real disposable income and their share of the national income reduced. Labor's spending initiatives and redistributive taxation have not brought with them equality or prosperity&mdash;only inflation, debt, high interest rates, unemployment and bureaucratic interference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating yet another example of Labor's redistributive taxation and bureaucratic interference in a number of aspects of this social security legislation. The Social Security Amendment Bill we are debating this evening will implement the major part of the Budget announcements in the social security area. The most significant changes include a proposed assets test on the family allowance, changes to the existing family allowance supplement assets test and a new hardship provision on the family allowance supplement. There are many other changes outlined in the Bill, but the major initiatives relate to the family allowance and the family allowance assets test changes and the introduction of hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance is an income tested payment which used to be known as child endowment and was paid fortnightly to the principal carer of children. It is a payment that recognises the costs of raising children. In 98 per cent of cases the principal carer is the mother, but in the other 2 per cent of cases it is paid to fathers, guardians and even, in some cases, State and Territory juvenile detention centres. In conjunction with the family allowance supplement, it aims to maintain the real value of family payments through indexation as well as keeping it relative to other social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance cuts out when family income reaches $62,057 in respect of one child, with the threshold rising by $3,104 for each additional child. The family allowance supplement is paid as an add-on to family allowance to low income working families. Its purpose is to eliminate poverty traps, that is, to ensure that families do not find themselves financially better off being dependent on social security than they would be at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year many of us had cause to debate the merits of an assets test on the family allowance when the Government proposed in the 1990-91 Budget to impose a ceiling of $300,000. This figure was subsequently raised to $500,000 in the hope of ensuring acceptance. But this was to no avail as it was not ultimately passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that last year the Government suggested that families with more than $300,000 in assets should not be eligible for family allowance. The opposition to that proposal was so great that the Government took that figure up to $500,000. This Bill now sets the asset test threshold for the payment of family allowance at $600,000. This time we are now back discussing not $500,000 but $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of rural communities, the asset, typically the family farm, is home, business and income. It is the lot. That is all the farmers have. Very few farmers have any substantial extra assets. The family farm is the only asset. It has been inherited; it has no value. The farmer has no plan to sell it and, in most cases, he did not buy it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go back to these two provisions&mdash;$62,000 for the income test and $600,000 for the assets test&mdash;the clear inference is that farming assets after debt return 10 per cent. But if we look at the ABARE figures for recent years we find that in 1988-89 ABARE declared that the return on the assets of a farming enterprise was 3.7 per cent. In 1989-90 it was 2.5 per cent and in 1990-91 it was minus 0.3 per cent. Any average of those figures is well below 3 per cent and I remind honourable senators that 1988-89 was a good year. I have received a number of representations from organisations and constituents pointing out what they see as the injustice of the Government's proposals. In particular, I refer to the NFF and also the Victorian Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the fact that many rural people have assets but they do not have liquidity. They cannot say that they will pay their bills with their stockyard. Perhaps they could pay them with the sale of stock&mdash;that is, if they had some stock, or crops, that were of some value. The trouble is that Queensland and perhaps a great deal of New South Wales are experiencing a terrible drought at present. As a result, farmers do not have any crops and they do not have much stock either. The problem is that no money is coming in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents need actual cash to cope with the expenses of raising a family. Until now they have appreciated what has been of some help by the Government to give country children an opportunity similar to that which applies to children who live in the cities. Furthermore, by the very nature of farming, a certain amount of working capital is essential to pay for fuel, seed and fertilisers. It is quite easy, I can assure honourable senators&mdash;and I know this from practical experience&mdash;to spend tens of thousands of dollars on these items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has stated that these changes will principally benefit farmers and rural communities. If the Government really wanted to help farmers, small business people and communities in rural areas, because of the severity of the rural downturn and the deterioration in estimated incomes as a result of its economic policies, I believe it should abolish the assets test altogether. I have always believed that families should be tested on their income and not on their assets. I read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday which says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's estimated that between 55,000 and 60,000 commercial farms in Queensland and New South Wales are affected by the drought, and more than 60 per cent have some form of long-term debt.</PARA>
<PARA>An article about Phil and Donna Lewis of Max Creek Station, Wyandra, in parched south-western Queensland, whose dreams have gone down the drain, shows a very sad state of affairs. The article says that the crunch comes when the banks review the situation. I have a somewhat similar feeling in regard to our son's property, Ten Mile, in central Queensland;</PARA>
<PARA>I know something of what those dear people are experiencing. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Articles like that justify my belief that families should be tested on their incomes and not on their assets. I would like to feel that the Government and the coalition would agree with that. I ask honourable senators whether the Government really appreciates the difficulties being experienced by the rural and farming communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When first introduced in the 1940s and 1950s, child endowment was not assets tested or means tested and neither was the rebate for dependent children. The family allowance was the product of fundamental changes to the child endowment system introduced during the Fraser-Anthony Government days. Its intent was to ensure that those with children were not disadvantaged in the overall structure of the social welfare tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these current changes, the nature and character of family allowance are being fundamentally changed because, for the first time, a number of people are to be excluded from any entitlement at all. Now it seems that family allowance is seen merely as a welfare measure, put in the same category as unemployment and sickness benefits and the like. Instead, it should be seen as an investment in the next generation of Australians.he Australian Family Association said that family allowances were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . designed as a social justice payment to assist Australian families who are investing in our future by nurturing children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assets testing, like its predecessor means testing, is an attempt to convert a social justice payment into a social welfare payment: one not available because of family status, but because of perceived wealth, or lack thereof. It is an attempt to cast families as social welfare recipients: people who take out of the community when in reality they are net contributors to social welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>I can think of few better investments than in the young children of the families of Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our migration program we pay to bring in children from other nations. It would surely be far better for us to support Australian families and to encourage them to bring up Australian children in the great traditions of our national way of life. Indeed, we ought to encourage children to be raised within the traditional family units of our nation where child-care at home is seen as a worthy career and an honoured role. There can be no doubt that a dollar spent on family allowances is a far better investment than a dollar spent on child-care centres. The family is the cornerstone of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All too often, I regret to say, government policy seems to be directed at, and certainly has resulted in, undermining or even breaking up the family as the fundamental social unit, rather than assisting it in times of stress when family support and security are most needed. The Government has abused the family allowance, firstly, by means testing or income testing it; and, secondly, by making it subject to an assets test. Although the Government's amendment seeks to increase the ceiling, there is no appreciation on the part of the Government as to what the family allowance is and what it means to families throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as I said earlier, the Government did not seek to amend its original proposals last year until there was a considerable outcry about the injustice and the insensitivity of these new asset test arrangements, particularly coming as they did in an announcement at a time of a massive rural crisis. I can recall that even some Government members eventually acknowledged that there was a very real problem. The Australian Labor Party member for Grey, Mr O'Neil, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many farmers might be asset rich but income poor, particularly with this year's rural downturn.</PARA>
<PARA>We should remember that he was speaking last year. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many cases, people in rural areas will not be earning any income whatsoever and I think this is a complete indictment of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has happened to alter the rural situation since the honourable member for Grey made his statement. Indeed, the drought has become worse in many parts of rural Australia, particularly in my home State of Queensland and in New South Wales. I think Western Australia has been more fortunate so far in that it has had good rain and, as I understand it, it will have a wheat crop. Many people in Queensland have not been so fortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that if the Government really wanted to help farmers who have been hard hit by the severity of the rural downturn and by the deterioration in farm incomes as a result of its economic policy, it would not even have thought of introducing a test on the family allowance. I believe that it should have been left just as it was in the days when the Fraser-Anthony Government introduced it. Family allowance is a very important source of income for many farmers&mdash;and their wives, of course. Therefore, it is not appropriate to have an assets test which has a very different impact depending upon where people are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there have been proposed changes to the legislation as it was originally drafted. The legislation now includes quite generous hardship provisions. I believe that the assets test has, therefore, been made a little more palatable for farming families, and that enables me to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My brief comments this evening will be directed towards the imposition of the assets test on the family allowance and family allowance supplement. I say at the outset that I very seldom speak on social security measures, but as the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, which puts the assets test on family allowance, will affect people in the country far more than anything else, I have decided briefly to take part in the debate this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance and the family allowance supplement are the major welfare payments&mdash;for want of a better word. I have never believed that they were welfare payments; they were just an update of the child endowment scheme where families that had children were rewarded as against families that did not. What was received in child endowment in years gone by and what is received in family assistance now certainly does not reward us too much for having children. I believe the reward in having children is in the children themselves. The welfare payment certainly used to help, and helps quite a few household budgets now. It is the major welfare payment that is left at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to eliminate this concession&mdash;in other words, put an assets test on it&mdash;I believe it would be a retrograde step. Even accepting the economic reforms that are being undertaken at the present time, I have some very great concerns, my greatest concern being that the assets test could not have come at a more difficult time. It has been pointed out by other speakers that the assets test has come at a very hard time, for all the reasons that Senator Bjelke-Petersen, Senator Crane and others who have spoken before me have given. We have the worst depression&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) may want to call it a recession&mdash;as admitted to by Mr Kerin in Bangkok&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and the Westpac Bank. It is the worst depression since the 1930s. I think this recession will surpass the one that we had in the 1930s, because in the 1930s people were more self-reliant than they are now. In copping this sort of economic situation, this level of unemployment, people cannot cope as well as they did in the 1930s. I remember talking to my parents about the depression they went through in the 1930s. I believe that they handled that depression far better than people are handling the present situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson has told us that the assets test will affect only 2 per cent of families with dependent children. Unfortunately, that 2 per cent of families will be the hardest hit in Australia. I know that there may be other measures. Senator Richardson announced measures a few weeks ago by which farmers and others can get certain social security help. The assets test will affect the hardest hit families in Australia. As I said, they have been hit at this time as they have never been hit before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept, although reservedly, that we will eventually take off this assets test. One of the reasons it is hard to accept is that, even though the assets test limit has been put at $600,000, we have an income test limit of $60,000. Senator Richardson has told us consistently that there should be no correlation between the two. Why should there not be a correlation? If there is an income test limit of $60,000 and an assets test limit of $600,000, presumably $600,000 will produce $60,000&mdash;in other words, 10 per cent. We are told that there is no correlation. Why is there no correlation? There has to be correlation. We have to look at the two in the same context. That is why my colleague Mr Tuckey in the other place moved an amendment to extend the assets limit from $600,000 to $2m. Farmland returns, on average, about 3.3 per cent. No doubt, that is the figure that Mr Tuckey used to get the $2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in the Government wants to believe that there should be a correlation between the two. I am not saying this off the top of my head. If we look at the assets test and incomes test for the age old pension, for instance, we see that a correlation is in place. If we have so much cash in the bank, sitting in a cheque account, not gathering any interest at all, there is a deeming provision. The last I knew, the deeming provision was 10 per cent; it might have been reduced to 9 per cent. In fact, it is about time it was reduced even further. Madam Acting Deputy President, you know about interest rates and the interest that can be earned on deposits in the bank. There is a deeming provision. I fail to understand why the deeming provisions cannot go right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that if the limit were raised to $2m we need not have an assets test at all. But, if we can have a deeming provision for pensioners and on retired income, we should have it across the board&mdash;even though time and time again the Government will say that there is no correlation. We have had hardship provisions introduced into the guidelines&mdash;not into the legislation. The hardship provisions have a sunset clause of two years. In other words, we are putting a sunset clause on hardship. Senator Crane made this point very well. Who can sit here and say that there will be no hardship in two years time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson told us that we can look at it in two years time. The Government of the day can look at any legislation in six months, nine months, two years, three years time or whenever it wants. There does not have to be a sunset clause to do so. Unfortunately, when there is a sunset clause legislation is forced because legislation goes out and new legislation comes in. Things are under pressure. That is why my colleague Senator Alston is moving an amendment to eliminate that sunset clause. No-one can say what sort of conditions we are going to have in two years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, all of Australia, and especially the rural sector, will have turned around in two years time but, even if it has, there are such things as pocket droughts&mdash;as you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would know in Queensland&mdash;which can be very isolated. I have seen pocket droughts that have been in a radius of 150 kilometres. It happens. There can be rain shadows that stay the whole year. Apart from that, there could be a hailstorm on a crop; a flood, as mentioned by Senator Crane; and any other major disasters in minor areas that can happen to farmers or anyone else. It is the same story with small businessmen on a very small and isolated scale, because a lot of small businessmen live off farmers. Do not tell me that that is not hardship, because hardship is certainly there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the guidelines&mdash;in whatever form they may be&mdash;there will be an exemption on working capital. I am very surprised that our side of politics was able to convince the Government to put it in its guidelines. I commend the Government for taking up Senator Alston's recommendation that working capital not be counted in the assets. I believe it will be very hard to define what working capital is&mdash;I have tried to define it before&mdash;but in the spirit of the situation I think it can work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see the Government look at another measure which I have mentioned in certain quarters. If a family receives a family supplement it is received by the main carer of the children, and in 99 per cent of cases I presume it is the wife. The Government could at lease look at giving the 2 per cent of families that are going to lose it four weeks notice that they are going to lose it. In other words if, after royal assent, they are going to be without that family supplement, they should be paid for four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would line up with the measure in this Bill for the four weeks notice of cutting off the family supplement. It resulted from that case in Sydney where a child was killed and the family was getting family supplement and was going to continue to receive it for four weeks. I believe that the four weeks notice could be looked at in this situation, especially as Christmas is coming and these hard-pressed families have to budget to give their children and their family something extra over Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will carry on with the line about giving a bit of notice. We had the March statement&mdash;and I know I have harped on this for a few months&mdash;in which the Government made a lot of noise about what it would do at that time. Certainly, some of those measures were welcome. But here we are, seven or eight months down the track&mdash;we now have the legislation in front of us&mdash;after the Government told us about what better depreciation schedules we were going to have and the elimination of sales tax at certain points. These families are going to lose the supplement on 1 January, the Bill says. Perhaps the Government could have seen the light and given families a bit more leeway, such as it took for itself in implementing the March statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The asset Bill will finally put the test on everything, but one point that stands out is the assets test on isolated children's allowance. I will always work in this place to eliminate it because isolated children, or any children in Australia, have two basic rights: the rights to be looked after in health and education. I support all the points made by colleagues and the amendments that Senator Alston will be moving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is surprising, but years fly away with the wings of a dove, I am afraid. The concern that many people will have is that the imposition of an assets test may cause a great deal of hardship to those in this country who are, as the saying goes, asset rich and income poor. In particular, I am thinking of the people in Queensland and New South Wales who live outside the capital cities and who, directly or indirectly, have had their incomes badly affected, not just as a result of this drought but also as a result of the economic policies of this Government which have so clearly and demonstrably failed to achieve any improvement in the lot of ordinary Australians. We are not just talking about farmers; we are not just talking about the small businessmen: we are talking about millions of Australians who live outside the capital cities and who deserve equal respect and consideration by this Government and by this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the imposition of the assets test. In the Budget this Government originally proposed that the assets test should be applied at $300,000. It subsequently revised that proposal and suggested that the figure should be $500,000. On both occasions we in the coalition&mdash;in the Liberal Party and the National Party&mdash;signified to the Government our refusal to agree with such draconian measures. The Government now comes before the Senate recommending that the assets test be applied at $600,000. Were the Government merely offering an assets test alone, I could not in good conscience support the passage of this legislation but, as you said, Madam Acting President, it should be income to which one looks principally and foremost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am pleased, however, to see that my colleague the shadow Minister for social security, Senator Alston, has negotiated with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) a number of important concessions. Foremost among these is the hardship provision which will ensure that, even if families have assets in excess of the $600,000, they will be in receipt of the family allowance if their income falls below the amount of $13,078 per annum, and they have less than $10,000 in cash or stocks and shares in publicly listed companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is not an ideal situation. I agree with the comments that were made by you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and by my colleague and friend Senator Panizza, in drawing the attention of the Senate to the fact that there seems to be no correlation between the amount of assets, the estimated average rate of return and the income test itself, which stands at $60,000. This is of concern to me. I believe the Government has to recognise that there will always be situations where people may have assets but cannot adequately provide for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the work done by my friend and colleague Senator Alston, the shadow Minister for social security, in getting the Government to agree to these hardship provisions is a major step forward in ensuring that people are not discriminated against simply because of assets which they cannot sell and which they cannot apply to the benefit of their families. For these reasons, I am pleased to see the package of legislation that will be coming before the Senate. I will be supporting the amendments that the shadow Minister, Senator Alston, will be moving in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect, of course, will be to ensure that people who live on farms, for example, have the value of the residence and the associated land removed from the value of the farm before assessing the value of that farm for the purposes of the assets test. This is one of my major concerns and I am pleased to see that it has been answered by the Government in this legislation. It would be wholly iniquitous to include the value of a residence in assessing the value of a farm when the value of a residence in the city is not assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party is concerned to ensure that people who live outside the capital cities get the same treatment as those who live in the capital cities and to ensure that people who live on farms are not discriminated against solely because of the fact that they live on farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major point that I must make, Madam Acting Deputy President, is that the Opposition will be moving an amendment which will eliminate the two-year provision on the hardship test. That, of course, has been of concern to many of us on this side of the chamber because we recognise that hardship is not limited by the days in a calendar and that, even when this drought lifts, there will still be people in cities and in country areas who will be suffering hardship. We believe that it is ludicrous to impose merely a two-year period on the hardship test. For that reason, I will have great pleasure in supporting the amendment that Senator Alston will be moving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments that have been foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats to be moved in the committee stage. I am very pleased to see that Senator Lees has finally arrived in the chamber. I know she spoke in the second reading debate. I intend to make my comments in respect of these amendments now, rather than delay the operations of the Committee by talking at length in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these amendments, supposedly, is to exempt the whole of the value of a family farm or a small business&mdash;and I will come to the definitions of both of those shortly&mdash;from the assets test for the purposes of calculation of a person's assets. This creates a certain conundrum, because, if one accepts the fact that we have an assets test and that we have a hardship test, one wonders what is the effect of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these amendments would be to exclude all farmers and all small businessmen from the assets test, except, of course, if they have $600,000 worth of assets, not being their residence, not being their working capital and not being their business. I know very few people who would fall into that situation. I know very few people who would have $600,000 worth of Mercedes. I know very few people who would have $600,000 worth of runabouts. But this would be the effect of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I cannot really clearly see the logic behind the amendments that will be moved. I suppose it is yet another attempt by the Australian Democrats to move amendments solely for their own political benefit and not for the benefit of the people in question. That brings to me a grave sense of concern and dismay, because our task here should be to legislate for the benefit of the people, not to legislate for the benefit of our electoral prospects. For that reason I will not be supporting those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the definitions and the provisions contained in the amendments proposed by the Democrats, because I think they are quite interesting and also quite badly flawed. For example, the amendment in respect of the assets test for family allowance for primary producers&mdash;and this is replicated in the other two amendments in respect of primary producers&mdash;is quite interesting. It talks about a person's assets and, of course, the assets in question are those of the primary carer. Amendment 2 states that, where the person has his or her principal home on a farm that is owned by the person, the person's partner, or the person and his or her partner, if the person works in a full time capacity and the whole of the land and so on are used for the purposes of farming, those assets shall be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is rather simplistic. It assumes that all farms are owned by individuals or by partnerships. Of course, they are not. It varies from industry to industry, but many farms are actually held in corporate structures. So we would find a situation where one group of farmers is advantaged because the farm is not held in a company and another group of farmers is discriminated against because the farm is held in a company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see the logic or the sense in that and I do not think many other people could either, because there is no logic or sense in it. In fact, it is interesting to note that that clause, that particular condition, is inconsistent with the provision in respect of small businesses because, of course, the amendment proposed by the Democrats talks about a person carrying on a business as defined in subsection 6(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. We have to have some sort of sense of consistency, and clearly that is not present in these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other concern is in respect of primary producers. The requirement is that the person in receipt of the benefit, that is, the principal carer, ordinarily works in a full time capacity as a primary producer on the farm. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would well know that many mothers who live on farms may not necessarily work in a full time capacity as a primary producer. They may, for example, work in an administrative sense. They may solely care for the children. Of course, this amendment is again applying an arbitrary condition which really has no meaningful value, except, of course, seemingly to bolster the electoral success of the Democrats. But it is not going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No member of the coalition will support these amendments. We have looked at them very carefully and we can see how absurd they are. We accept the fact that there is a responsibility on us to legislate in a reasonable and responsible fashion. We believe that the Government has come a long way from its original position in amending the legislation and we believe that the amendment that will be moved by Senator Alston, the shadow Minister for social security, to delete the two-year limit on the hardship test, will also be of considerable importance in bringing this legislation into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the comments of my colleague Senator Panizza, who said that he hoped that after the enactment of this legislation there would be a period of grace before the Government and the Department cut benefits to some of the people who may be affected, especially as we are coming very close to Christmas. It is unlikely that the Bill, even if it passes here tonight, will receive assent before the end of the month, and so a four-month grace period would quite neatly and, I think, compassionately take those people beyond Christmas and put them in a situation where they can adequately plan and rearrange their budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, will accept the spirit in which this proposal is made. It is my very sincere hope that the Government will show a bit of compassion in line with some of the reasonableness that it has shown in dealing with the proposals that we have made to it which have ultimately been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we hope that the Government will recognise that hardship tests must be put in place in respect of other legislation that bestows on people a benefit which is tested on the basis of assets. We do not believe that we can have a situation where people can be discriminated against solely on the basis of their assets when those assets may not necessarily be realisable. We believe that it is incumbent on this Government to show a little of the humanity about which the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, so frequently speaks but which he has yet to demonstrate adequately to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this Bill is not entirely satisfactory to many people on this side, but we are pleased to see that the Government has come a long way. We are very pleased to see that our efforts and our persistence on behalf of millions of Australians will be paying off here this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which has been of great concern to many of us and also to the survival of a great many Australian families who, in turn, are an essential part of our long term national export industry. I refer to the effect of the new assets test on the family allowance, and the adequacy of hardship provisions to enable farm families to continue receiving this necessary assistance. As a Liberal senator for Western Australia, I believe that it is essential that this legislation be framed and administered so as not to exclude a section of the community that is recognised as being rich in unrealisable and wealth producing assets and so often poor in income. My colleague Senator O'Chee has very clearly outlined exactly that problem. For 1990-91, the return on farm assets was a mere 0.3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apology for saying that if, through indifference, this Government were to fail to provide adequate hardship provisions, it would be a tragedy not only for so many individual farm families but also for our economic future as our export earning rural base contracted, and contracted even further. This country simply cannot allow our farmers to walk off the land at a greater rate than they have already been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is relevant to this debate to note that the wheat harvest for 1991-92 anticipated by the Australian Wheat Board is 10.6 million tonnes, down from a 1980s average of 15.5 million tonnes. Were it not for the 4.7 million tonnes from Western Australia, there would be great trouble in servicing our traditional markets. The last thing that Australia can do in a time of massive rural depression is prevent farmers from putting in their next crop. This is why the guidelines for hardship provisions are of such critical importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the guidelines released by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) last week that amounts of liquid cash in the accounts of such unincorporated businesses as farms are to be exempt from the assets test where they are required for `essential and usual expenditure' in operating a farm or business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the word `essential' not be defined in a manner that would in effect hamper normal farm operations. I do not believe that it is feasible to strike upon some arbitrary amount as necessary working capital, and I have been concerned that an attempt to do so will result in injustice to grain growers in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has been stated that the cost of planting a crop averages at $100,000, I would submit that $250,000 could be a more realistic figure for the wheat belt of Western Australia, just as $40,000 may be sufficient working capital for a beef property. Averages, however, cannot take into account the fact that a large operation supporting several families could be looking at $750,000 as the cost of putting in the next crop. These costs, indeed, can vary from shire to shire, with different soil qualities requiring greater expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time of rural recession, the family allowance can have great importance in balancing the family budget. It is that particular area that we must not lose sight of, because too few Australians are aware that the annual amount of $2,254 as family allowance for four children under 16 is greater than the $2,100 that is the net value of production per farm for 1991-92. That is a particularly significant figure, because it demonstrates the importance of what we are talking about here tonight in respect of family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It demonstrates that the rural families who are concerned about this, and their members of parliament who are equally concerned about the ramifications, are not just whistling in the wind about the possibility that they could have lost family allowance. To think that the small amount of $2,100 is the net value of production per farm is very tragic. It is also as well to remember that the purchasing power of farmers is expected to be 5 per cent of its value three years ago. This is not the time to be depriving farm families of one source of income when in 1990-91 a record $34.5m was paid to Western Australian farmers through the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of farm families and the rural economy have a very deep regional impact. It is no accident that, of 21 offices of the Department of Social Security in Western Australia, the one showing the worst rise in unemployment registrations in the 12 months to October was Albany, which serves an essential farming area. That is of great concern to many of those rural families. They are facing not only great hardship but also more and more unemployment. Therefore, it should be of major concern to all of us that the unemployment rates are rising in these areas, and we have to make sure that the impact of this depression will not be felt as badly as it might otherwise be. An 85 per cent rise in those registered for Jobsearch allowance and Newstart, compared with the State-wide average rise of 53 per cent, really tells its own story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the Senate that farmers do not look on the family allowance as a welfare payment, and nor do we. We have never looked on it as a welfare payment. It was intended in 1976 as a measure of horizontal equity to recognise some of the extra cost involved in rearing the next generation of Australians. That is the way it should remain. Perhaps it is inevitable in the time of deepening economic crisis, otherwise known as a depression, that we are currently going through that the family allowance must be withdrawn from those who do not need it&mdash;or who need it rather less than their neighbours. But I certainly would not put farming families in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that it has been converted into an effective welfare payment in a gradual and indirect manner, with an income test in 1987 presaging an assets test. I would strongly oppose any future move to restrict the eligibility of family allowance to the level of the Jobsearch allowance, unless the Government had the honesty to redefine the whole nature of the payment. An income test of $62,000 approximates two modest incomes; it is certainly not overgenerous. The test of these hardship provisions is that they should not result in the withdrawal of necessary support from families who require it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has successfully sought from the Minister an assurance that documentation of actual working capital should involve no more than a statement of the previous year's expenditure, with the recognition that usual expenses may not always be easily identified. I think there is now a recognition, since we have pushed the issue, that these things cannot be hard and fast and that there has to be some latitude. Appeal provisions will be safeguarded through the normal procedures, with ultimate recourse to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these assurances represent an important gain for hard-pressed farm families, it is not, however, good enough that these hardship provisions are to apply for only two years. It is for that reason we have sought, and now gained, an agreement from some people that this should be put up as an amendment. We hope that the Government and the Australian Democrats will now see the wisdom of what our amendment really seeks to do: to wipe out that two-year proviso from the hardship provisions. It is not adequate to say that things will be different in two years and that the benefits will be chopped off. We are really saying that we must leave the provision open-ended and not put that two-year limit on the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that Senator Lees is very familiar with this legislation. We are on the same committee. I hope that Senator Lees will see the problems associated with this and the wider economic problems. I am aware that the Democrats amendments go much further. The problem that we have is that we must look at whether we all cut off this benefit lock, stock and barrel in two years or make sure it is extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may be considered a reasonable time frame for a recovery from a recession which, even the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in more candid moments has conceded, is the worst depression since the 1930s. Only today the Westpac Bank has come out and agreed with him. Moreover it is sadly true that, while sections of the economy may pick up in time, the rural sector has no such assurance through the effects of drought and commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you eloquently went through the problems associated with drought that are being experienced in your own State of Queensland and in many parts of Australia. The drought affected areas are certainly not going to be looking down the barrel of a quick pick up in the next couple of years. The two-year limitation should, therefore, be removed as it is very foolish to anticipate that many farming families will not need to have recourse to hardship provisions over the longer term. Without these provisions, as we have made clear, this legislation will be draconian and highly unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of this Bill have the support of the coalition. I welcome the increase in the child disability allowance to its 1987 level and the extension of the $4.30 fortnightly increase to those receiving the new youth disability supplement. In the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs into accommodation and employment of the disabled, it was made clear that the additional care required by young disabled people at home is quite significant and considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does, however, oppose the spending of an extra $9.3m in 1992-93 through the reduction in the period for rental assistance from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. This does nothing more than increase the rate of this particular benefit at a time when rentals are in a depressed state. I would seriously question an apparent philosophy that encourages rental over home ownership as we do not provide welfare beneficiaries with help towards their mortgages. It could be argued that we are subsidising the providers of rental accommodation. In the context of legislation that seeks to achieve savings, it is inappropriate for this kind of generosity at public expense where real need for change cannot be demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Altogether, the real impact of this legislation should mean a net rise in spending of about $60m in 1992-93, its first full year of operation. While the coalition is opposed to only one of the spending initiatives, the onus comes back on this Government to ensure that these massive amounts of public money are not misspent as we have been seeing through a number of questions from Senator Patterson this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Minister was advised of some of the deplorable rip-offs. From an example in a letter that was sent to him, only yesterday the Minister was forced to concede that at least $23m in welfare benefits paid to immigrants through failure of families to provide promised support was not recoverable. That $23m is a little less than the $25m that will be saved in 1992-93 through the operation of the family allowance assets test. Had the Department been only a little more vigilant and made sure that it had not paid out that money, we would not be having some of the problems we are having today with balancing the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an indictment of welfare and immigration policies that essentially worthless undertakings of support are made under the family reunion scheme, with the newly arrived family member applying for the special benefit within days of arriving in Australia. I was always led to believe that the restrictions were very tough and that people did have to provide the support they offered. Quite clearly, from what we have seen in recent weeks, that is not so. These cases amount to deliberate fraud. A case has been described of a person who was able to receive this benefit on arrival and use the money to visit Sri Lanka. While the benefit was then cancelled, it was renewed on that person's return to Australia. We did not learn anything from the whole exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was advised of this, as in so many other examples of social security rip-offs, in a resignation letter of an employee of his Department dated 21 August. If the Minister actually read the letter, we might ask what action he has taken. If he has not been shown the letter, he should be asking for a copy of it from his Department. Australians who lose their family allowance through the new assets test will not be impressed by stories of couples who received single rate benefits when clearly living in de facto situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's society, with so many Australians genuinely unable to survive without welfare, it is not funny to learn about the woman who got the sole parent pension claiming separation because she and her partner slept on different sides of the sheet. It would be funny if it were not so serious. Other people are deprived of benefits when people are ripping off the system, and ripping it to shreds. Targeting of welfare is supported strongly by the coalition. However, any examples of this lax administration that amounts to the condoning of fraud are absolutely unacceptable. This Government has a very clear responsibility to try a great deal harder in this area. I hope that it does it sooner rather than later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). I agree with some aspects of this Bill. One of those aspects was mentioned a moment ago. That related to the increase that is proposed in the child disability allowance, though I believe that is very inadequate. It is proposed to restore the child disability allowance to the same value it had in real terms when introduced in 1987. Of course, it goes without saying that since that time the child disability allowance has reduced in value and those who were entitled to that allowance have had their money stolen from them by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address my remarks to the question of family allowances. I do so in the context that, as I understand it, the Senate wishes to have the second reading stage of this Bill completed tonight. Therefore, I shall be short. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) nodding away, and I undertake to the Senate to be short. Senator Knowles has pointed out, and I have pointed out time and time again in this place, that the family allowance is not a social welfare measure; yet Senator McMullan in the second reading speech says that the family allowance is the only major social security payment not subject to an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance is not a social security payment. It is part of the tax transfer system which recognises that a family with dependent children at any level of income has more costs and pays more indirect tax than does a family without dependent children. I believe that we should remind the Government what the spokesman on social security said in 1976 when the old tax rebate system was abolished and cashed up into the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then spokesman for social security, former Senator Grimes, said at that time&mdash;and he repeated it at the tax summit&mdash;that family allowances were a tax transfer measure. He indicated quite clearly that they were not a social security measure. Now we have&mdash;possibly for the first time in print&mdash;a Government Minister saying that they are, despite the fact that at the Estimates Committee hearing that same Government Minister had generally agreed with what Senator Grimes had said. If there is to be any credibility allowed to the Government, surely it should stand up for what it said previously when the tax rebate system was abolished. If we had known then what we know now there would have been an enormous outcry against the abolition of tax rebates for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time&mdash;I am talking about 1976&mdash;I agreed with it. I remember standing in the old Parliament House agreeing with the proposition that the money should go directly to the mother, who is generally the carer of children for the purposes of family allowances. I also agreed that the research had shown that most of the tax rebates for children went into the hip-pocket of the husband. What we were really doing then was taking the tax rebates for the children out of the hip-pocket of the male taxpayer and putting them into the purse of the mother. I agreed with that, but I warned that, unless it was indexed, an enormous injustice would be perpetrated against the mothers of Australia; and that is what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time it was not the Government's money; it was the husband's money. Through the legislation which abolished the tax rebate system and transferred the money to family allowances, it was taken out of the back pocket of the husband and put into the mother's purse. Since that time, the Government has stolen much of this money out of the purses of the mothers. Since that time, the true value of the family allowance has been cut by approximately one-third so that in 1991 the real value of the family allowance is, on average, only two-thirds of the value of the original 1976 allowance. If that is not daylight robbery, I have never seen it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what has happened because of the failure of the Government to index that allowance. Yes, it has indexed the allowance now, but from a low base. Still the situation occurs where the money is being purloined by the Government out of the purses of the mothers, to the extent that the Government is stealing $16.32 per fortnight from the purse of a mother with two children. From the purse of a mother with four children, the Government is taking $50 every fortnight&mdash;$49.60 to be exact. That is what the Government is stealing out of the purses of the mothers every single fortnight. It should be ashamed of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Government is getting to the mothers on the land&mdash;the farmers and the families in distress. The situation has been described in this chamber by Senator Lees, Senator O'Chee and a number of other honourable senators. Senator Alston and others have indicated their concern as to what is happening out in the bush. We all know what is happening out in the bush. I know because I have relations on farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of them came down from Senator Bjelke-Petersen's area in Queensland. He grows strawberries&mdash;or used to&mdash;in the Lockyer Valley. Because of the drought it is a bit like a dust bowl up there. The farmers are in dire straits and a large number of others are in dire straits. Yet this Government comes in here and refuses to recognise that family allowances are not a social security payment. In fact, it not only refuses to recognise that they are not but also says that they are social security payments and then big-heartedly says, `We will introduce some hardship provisions'. I remind the Senate that those hardship provisions will not be triggered for many affected farmers until they sell the farm. I think that is most disconcerting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the principle of the matter. If the Government has any principle at all, it ought to stand up for what it has said consistently about family allowances&mdash;that they are part of the tax transfer system. If it does not stand up for that, let Government members get up in here and say that they were deceiving the electors by maintaining that it was not a social security payment but, in fact, a tax transfer system. That is the issue with which we are faced. I know we have faced that situation previously, but I believe that that is the situation we face, in principle, with regard to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we are once again debating Budget decisions. There are five dot points to be addressed. I will speak only to two of them because the others are self-explanatory. Those dot points are: firstly, the introduction of an assets test for the family allowance, which is something totally new to Australia; secondly, the introduction of a family assets test for family allowance supplements; thirdly, an increase of $2.15 in the child disability allowance; fourthly, a $200 up-front education payment for sole parents undertaking general education who are eligible for Austudy supplement, with the presumption that the $200 will assist them to start their education; and fifthly, an attempt to bring independent young persons&mdash;that is a nice way of saying `homeless youth'&mdash;into the Austudy entitlement. The Minister calls them independent 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds. What on earth is he talking about? I would say that they are still very young children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is just making himself feel good by calling what are really homeless youth, independent youth. Of course we all remember the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that by 1990 no child would be living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I will deal with only two of these areas because the others are self-explanatory. I would like to start with the assets test for the family allowance. The family allowance is described by the Government in the second reading speech as the only major social security payment not subject to an assets test. I do not believe that, just because the family allowance is handled by the Department of Social Security, it is a social security payment. We know that many years ago a Liberal government and the conservative parties brought in the family allowance in the form of child endowment. The government of the day said to the taxpayer that this payment was a refunctioning of tax because of the recognition that children are a great cost to a family. If a couple has children, they are doing something for the benefit of Australia. This is apart from anything else, such as the joy that children bring to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals have never considered that children are a luxury or that parents should be completely exempt from tax relief. But this is the way that this Government sees it. The first thing the Government did was to introduce not only an assets test but an income test on the family allowance. Before it did all that, it commissioned Bettina Cass to bring forward a report to recommend what should be done with regard to the family allowance. But Bettina Cass did not bring forward the report that the Government thought she would. Indeed, she said that, for both horizontal and vertical equity, the family allowance should not have an income test or an assets test placed on it. It was acknowledged that, irrespective of what income bracket couples are in, the cost is greater if one has children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Bettina Cass presented this report to the Government. But the Government did not like the report. It washed its hands of it and wasted taxpayers' money because it had already made up its mind what it was going to do. It was sheer hypocrisy for the Government to commission a report like that because it had no intention at any stage of taking note of the report unless it came down the way it wanted. Of course, it then could have pointed to the report and said, `We have had this report from Bettina Cass and that is why we are introducing an incomes test and an assets test'. The Government first introduced an income test and it is now going for an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be argued that the some people&mdash;for example, the Prime Minister's mates, such as Bondy, Packer, Skase and all the rest of them&mdash;should not perhaps claim a family allowance for their children. But they pay their taxes and, even if they have very large incomes, their children are an additional cost. I believe that they should be entitled to get this allowance on the grounds of vertical equity. Many people say, `No, this is not so'. I believe that they would be right if it were a social security payment. But because historically it is not really a social security payment but, rather, a transfer of tax, I believe that even they would be entitled to it. That is one way of viewing family allowance; it is the way that I view it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now come to the assets test. The Government has admitted that this test will disadvantage a whole group of people that it does not really intend to be disadvantaged. But because of its ideology, it has gone ahead with it anyway. We have the situation now where the assets test will indeed disadvantage quite considerably the farming community and lower income groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard Senator Lees, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, Senator Harradine and many of my other colleagues say how bad it is in the rural community at the moment. Senators cannot go around any State in Australia doing their job without recognising the tremendous hardships</PARA>
<PARA>that the rural community is facing. Farmers do have very large assets. They only have to own a small bit of dirt or borrow from a bank for their asset to be considered valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult for members of the farming community not to say that their land is of value. It is of considerable value if they have had to borrow against it. Farmers wishing to get a loan hope that the banks will consider their land a pretty valuable asset. So these days they cannot really claim that land against which large loans have been taken out and in respect of which the banks have given a certain value is not of any great value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only because of a considerable amount of pressure that Senator Richardson has finally come forward with details of hardship clauses. In Senate Estimates Committee C, I questioned Senator Richardson on the hardship clauses.

It has world-wide patent protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stage of testing involves clinical and associated tests on humans. These are required to provide data so that the chemical can be assessed for safety and efficacy by drug regulation authorities before it can gain marketing approval. Only if it gains marketing approval will commercial production proceed. In Australia the Therapeutic Goods Authority has responsibility for giving this approval. Approval for commercial release in other markets is given by national regulatory bodies, for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clinical trials are both expensive and extensive involving the testing of many people and taking considerable time and money. However, it is not only adequate resources that are important.

AIMS is actively pursuing all aspects of development of a final product including finance, chemical trials and commercial partner or partners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims made in this report regarding the proportion, and per capita expenditure by the Commonwealth on R&amp;D to WA are of the right order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth policies for research and development are developed on the basis of national needs and opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The location of institutions will reflect decisions on the appropriate site for individual institutions at the time they were established, subject to review by the agencies from time to time. Public sector research agencies, such as CSIRO, allocate their funds according to the priorities which are set by their Boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research granting bodies such as the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Rural Research Corporations, allocate their funding on a competitive basis to the best researchers according to the selection criteria determined for individual schemes. Western Australian researchers receive funding through these schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cooperative Research Centres are also allocated on a competitive basis. While none of the 15 Cooperative Research Centres selected in the first round were located in Western Australia, in the second round, six of the shortlisted 32 centres are located in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of State Governments in science and technology policy development has been considered recently by the Australian Science and Technology Council in Research and Technology: Future Directions. This report was tabled on October 17, 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report made the point: ``In a country as large and sparsely populated as Australia, the combination of funding and critical mass considerations means that there cannot be a strictly equitable distribution of national research facilities. The location of many such facilities is not as important as fostering more extensive and effective linkages between users and performers, and between performers engaged on similar projects, wherever they are.''</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the report is timely in that it raises matters that should be considered in the White Paper on Science and Technology, due to be tabled next May.</PARA>
