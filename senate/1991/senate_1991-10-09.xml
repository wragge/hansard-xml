<TITLE>Air Landing Fee:  New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>  This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I give notice that, 11 sitting days after today, I shall move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Australian Horticultural Corporation (Dried Fruits Export Control) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 199 and made under the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Avocado) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 207 and made under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 and the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to make a short statement.</PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am giving these notices today because this is the last sitting day upon which it is possible to do so. The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is concerned that drafting deficiencies exist in these two instruments. The nature of these defects is such that an intended right of AAT review of a discretion granted to a public official may be nullified. It is a breach of parliamentary propriety for an instrument to fail to effect its stated purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In this case the instrument not only is defective in this regard but also leaves individuals without a right of review of an administrative discretion, which may be a breach of personal rights. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA>  The statement read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Horticultural Corporation (Dried Fruits Export Control) Regulations Statutory Rules 1991 No.199</PARA>
<PARA>Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Avocado) Regulations</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1991 No. 207</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations are principal Regulations  made to effect recent changes to legislative schemes provided for by the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. Both are important instruments, the first providing the Australian Dried Fruits Board with power to recommend on the granting of licences, to set quota allocations for exports and export markets, to set quality standards and minimum prices, and to approve overseas agents. The second prescribes avocados as both a leviable and chargeable horticultural product, sets rates of levy and export charge, prescribe the industry body with which the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation must consult, provide for the manner of payment of levies and charges, and require the keeping of records.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee was concerned that apparent drafting errors in both sets of Regulations may be so serious as to affect the validity of review provisions. The view of the Committee is that the drafting and presentation of delegated legislation should be of a standard not less than that of an Act of Parliament. Anything less is a breach of parliamentary propriety. This is particularly so when the defects may nullify the right to an independent, external review of the merits of administrative decisions, taken by public officials, which may adversely affect the livelihood of persons engaged in production for export. The Committee has an express mandate from the Senate to ensure appropriate review of administrative decisions. In addition, lack of such review is a breach of personal rights, in respect of which the Committee also has a mandate to act.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice.</PARA>

<PARA>  (d)  calls on the US and Soviet Governments to extend the proposed talks on reduction of land-based inter-continental ballistic missiles to include naval arms control, in particular, a reduction in sea launched ballistic missiles and conventionally armed Tomahawk cruise missiles;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The coalition supports the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 and continues its bipartisan support for this whole Aboriginal education policy which, as I said, has received support in the past and is receiving support now. This Bill amends the original Act of 1989. It is purely an administrative Bill and, in itself, does not provide supplementary assistance or have any financial implications. The original Act underpins the Aboriginal education policy which not only had cross-party support but has been endorsed by State and Territory governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill does two things:  it integrates the higher education component of the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 with the Aboriginal participation initiative within the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. This will mean institutions will support participation by Aboriginal students within their total education program rather than have their support come from two different sources. There is an ambiguity in the original Bill as to whether an indexation formula should be read as year on year or quarter on quarter. The intention and convention have been that year on year is used and this Bill clarifies the original intention. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to make a few points about this whole policy because prior to the introduction of an Aboriginal education policy, there was good evidence that 10 to 15 per cent of Aboriginal students in the compulsory schooling years were not participating in primary and basic secondary schooling. This was despite the national expectation that all school-age children would receive such schooling. Also, participation rates for Aboriginal people in post compulsory schooling were only about one-third of the number for all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  These concerns led to the development of an Aboriginal education policy which came out of the Hughes report of 1988. This report found that, despite improvements over the past two decades, Aboriginal people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. The need to develop this coordinated and comprehensive policy for Aboriginal people was recognised as a priority by all sides of politics. It was based on these findings that this policy was developed, involving agreement between the Commonwealth and all State and Territory governments and, of course, all political parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem was to define the appropriate roles of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments in the policy, with the Commonwealth adopting a strategic planning and monitoring role while the operation and implementation role is largely a function of the States. This seems to be a model that could perhaps effectively be extended in other areas of Aboriginal programs where that kind of coherence and cooperation does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two main programs under the Aboriginal education policy:  firstly, the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program; and, secondly, Abstudy direct assistance. The Aboriginal education strategic initiative program funds operational plans, the Aboriginal student support and parents awareness program and Aboriginal language initiatives. It includes supplementary funding for Aboriginal education strategies of higher education institutions, which has now been transferred. Abstudy direct assistance incorporates non-income support elements of Abstudy. It has two programs consisting of the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and the vocational educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The year 1990 was the first year of the triennium of operation of what is overall a $229m program, roughly ranging from $70m in 1990 to $80m in 1992, and that is, of course, is in 1990 dollar terms. A review will take place in the first year of the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme. This year, 1991, is the first year of the vocational educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. At this stage it is not possible fully to assess the effectiveness of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, there are some areas of weakness. Firstly, the information coming back to the Federal Government, which is largely dependent upon the States and Territories for that information, indicates that the scheme appears to have been fairly slow in operation. Certainly, the Commonwealth's early monitoring of the scheme has not been adequate. But that, of course, may be overcome as the scheme gets over its early problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme, while a very good scheme in concept, works on the basis of establishing a large number of Aboriginal homework centres. This in itself may not appear to be a bad thing, given the home conditions under which many Aboriginal students try to work. It is very important that Aboriginal people have a place to do their homework, but one wonders why there is any need to establish a separate centre for homework rather than look at further extending already existing schools where the facilities are actually there. Why could these homework centres not be in fact the schools?  Why create new centres?  There must remain the suspicion that this decision to have separate centres may have more to do with the policy of the teacher unions than with the efficient delivery services to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this program does not relate directly to Abstudy, Abstudy is nevertheless fundamental to Aboriginal education. There are some concerns on the Opposition side that there is a very lax definition of Aboriginality for Abstudy payments. This matter has been raised by the Auditor-General. It should be clear-cut and easy to establish who is an Aboriginal for the purpose of Abstudy and other Aboriginal programs. It should be easy to establish the exact number of people who describe themselves as Aboriginal--in other words, people who identify themselves with an Aboriginal community--because they put themselves down on the 1986 census as such. With the known mortality rates and so on, it is reasonable for us to have a clear view of what the numbers should be. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we look at the number of people who have claimed to be Aboriginal--to have Aboriginality--and then look at the take-up of Abstudy, we find that in relating the two figures 72 per cent of all Aboriginal people between 12 and 18 years of age are getting some form of Abstudy and that of those between 12 and 44 years of age more than one-third of every predicted Aboriginal person in Australia is receiving Abstudy. Clearly, the reality would be that not more than a third of all Aboriginal people between 12 and 44 years of age are getting some sort of higher education. Clearly, that is a matter that needs to be looked at to make certain that the benefit is going to the people for whom it is intended--that is, the Aboriginal people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is another slight problem that should be raised-- that is, the teachers within the system not having the capacity to communicate with Aboriginal people who do not speak English. There are some schools in central Australia where the basic language, for example, could be Aranda. It appears that probably 10 per cent of Aboriginal people in Australia do not use English in the home. For many people, English would not be a second language; in fact, it would be a totally foreign language which is not understood. That is why it is vital that teachers in these areas should have a capacity to communicate in the language used in those regions. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is not to suggest that English should not be introduced into those schools--obviously it should. A failure to do so would limit the capacity of Aboriginal people, if they wished, to participate fully in the Australian society. It explains why it is so difficult for students, who may have no working knowledge of English, coming into schools, and  obviously a program entirely in English does not meet their needs. That is a point in passing. The fact is, of course, that good educational opportunities are fundamental to Aboriginal people having the opportunity to be full participants in Australian society. This Bill continues that course and, as a result, has the total support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill is a piece of legislation which is basically administrative. The character of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy will remain unchanged. The passage of the Bill does provide, however, an opportunity to review the situation which Aboriginal and Islander people currently face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The principal Act which this amendment relates to signalled the beginning of the Labor Government's decision, supported by the Australian Democrats, to endorse a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. Two years down the track for this policy, which aims for  cooperation between all State, Federal and Territory governments, we have seen some improvements and also room for further progress. Part of the problem with developing effective educational opportunities for indigenous peoples in Australia is that the education system in this country, particularly with respect to higher education, is in bad shape, thanks to the management--or mismanagement--of Mr Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA>  With tertiary institutions so starved of funding, there is even less likelihood that proper attention will be paid to the issue of Aboriginal education. Recently Dr Mary Ann Bin-Salik, who has been involved in the tertiary field since 1975 and who is one of only four Aboriginal women to have attended Harvard University, wrote a book called Aboriginal Tertiary Education in Australia: How Well Is it Serving the Needs of Aborigines?. She was quoted earlier this year as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Tertiary education isn't filling the needs of Aborigines very well because of funding. Most higher institutions aren't really committed to Aboriginal education--I think some are but we have a long way to go. Some institutions are receiving money for Aboriginal programs, but I don't think they are using it usefully; they don't have well-defined policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recently we have also seen the Northern Territory Government cutting education funding, adversely affecting the provision of education services to Aboriginals in many parts of the Territory. In Queensland, in another example of the Goss Government's heavy-handed approach to problems affecting Aboriginal and Islander people, we saw teachers being withdrawn from the school at the Aurukun community. </PARA>
<PARA>  As with many other issues, how seriously we address this matter will impact on the effectiveness and ultimate success of the reconciliation process which the Parliament has just implemented. Education has to be a central part of this process, both through educating non-Aboriginal Australians about the history of this country and by ensuring that appropriate and adequate educational opportunities are available to Aboriginal and Islander people. Setting up appropriate strategies is a good step but, as with the national Aboriginal health strategy, it can be little more than a hollow con unless it is backed up with sufficient and stable funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the sections of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which dealt with the education issue. I have referred to this report in various speeches because I believe it is essential that we do not ignore the wealth of information and ideas which the report provides. It provides a detailed perspective which is independent of political parties and bureaucracies, so it is free of any empty rhetoric which otherwise it might have. On the education issue, it provides a good guide to how much progress has been made and, in contrast to many other issues in the report, education receives a generally favourable appraisal in the sense that things appear to be moving in a generally positive direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report identified the double bind which schooling presents to Aboriginal and Islander people. In essence, the problem which occurs is that the schooling process is almost by definition assimilationist, but it provides many skills and resources which are essential to provide the indigenous people with greater control over their own lives and future. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this can be overcome as long as the maximum degree of participation in the educative process is provided to Aboriginal and Islander people. This principle is embodied in the first long term goal of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, and it is an essential principle not only in education but also in all aspects of Aboriginal and Islander issues. I quote the following passage from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The important thing is the Aboriginal people are allowed to choose a direction for themselves. The only chance for improving education as a social resource for Aboriginal people will come as a result of Aboriginal people deciding for themselves what it is they require of education and then having the means of determining how that end is to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>As ATSIC develops, the role that it plays as representative of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in supervising and having input on the suitability of education services to indigenous people must also be developed. There is evidence of the odd teething problem with ATSIC, but it is essential that it has a proper role in the education issue--and I believe that role is being developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  One other interesting aspect of the Royal Commission's report was the focus it placed on preschooling. This is one area of education that is often ignored, yet its importance, being in the formative years of a person's life, is obvious. The Commission specifically recommended that governments and education consultative groups pay great attention to the fact that the scope of the national Aboriginal and Islander education policy extends to preschooling programs and that it should be recognised that, to a considerable extent, the success of the whole education policy will turn on the success of the preschooling initiatives. I take this opportunity to remind the Government of this recommendation and call on it to ensure that it is being followed up. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also indicated that we have some way to go in developing curricula that are appropriate for Aboriginal and Islander children's learning needs. Curricula also need to be improved so that they reflect to all Australians the fact that white Australia has a black history--and it was not just a history of problems. The report outlined the fact that many Aboriginal communities and groups have identified the need for education curricula to include a course of study to inform students on social issues, such as the legal system, civil liberties and drug and alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leaving aside the question of adequate funding, we still have evidence of increasing retention rates for Aboriginal students, of the valuable role played by Aboriginal education workers in the teaching process and of the development of further independent Aboriginal schools. For me, one of the most recent and pleasing developments in this regard is the opening this year of the Pemulwuy High School in inner Sydney. Developments such as this maximise opportunities for self-reliance and Aboriginal participation, and should be encouraged and supported. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill relates in an administrative way to the ongoing operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. This policy focuses on issues of curriculum but, as it focuses on funding and coordination, it must be considered as part of overseeing the educative process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another area where curriculum still needs improvement is that which is taught to trainee teachers. Teacher training courses need to provide trainees with greater knowledge and understanding of the educational needs and views of Aboriginal and Islander people. There is absolutely nothing more unhelpful and wasteful of resources than sending teachers who know little of Aboriginal attitudes, customs and needs to teach at a predominantly Aboriginal school. Consistent with my previous remarks, indigenous people must be more involved in training courses. It is not a negative picture that I am painting; there is much to be positive about in the development of education practices which meet the needs of Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The education policy was specifically addressed by the Royal Commission's report. I would like to finish by reiterating the Royal Commission's report on this policy. The Commission recognises the value of the policy, but is conscious of the dangers which are present if it is not adhered to in the right spirit. This is why the actions of governments and the outcomes of the policy need to be continually analysed and reviewed to see whether progress is occurring at sufficient speed. As long as the goals of the policy are strongly adhered to, the direction of progress will continue to be generally positive. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission pays particular attention to the first long term goal, which I mentioned previously, as being of special significance in providing Aboriginal people with an appropriate level of control. The Commission's recommendation is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>At every stage of the application of the National Aboriginal Education Policy the utmost respect be paid to the first long-term goal expressed in the policy, that is:</PARA>
<PARA>  To establish effective arrangements for the participation of Aboriginal parents and community members in decisions regarding the planning, delivery and evaluation of preschool, primary and secondary education services for their children;</PARA>
<PARA>It be recognised that the aims of the Policy are not only to achieve equity in education for Aboriginal and Islander people but also to achieve a strengthening of the identity, decision making and self-determination of the indigenous people. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to note that the Commission believes it is unlikely that either of these aims can be achieved without the achieving of the other. What we must do is ensure that we do all we can to make sure that those aims are achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill is a small part in the process of achieving those aims. As we move forward in a spirit of cooperation and reconciliation, I hope that over the rest of this decade the Parliament and future governments of whatever complexion stay true to these aims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise today to address the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991, particularly because of the comments that I read by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, in the other chamber on 11 September in which he primarily attacked the Northern Territory Government's expenditure and efforts on Aboriginal education. I think many people would be well aware that Mr Snowdon has his roots in radical teacher union politics and Aboriginal land politics and not, unfortunately, in the efficient, proper and appropriate delivery of educational services. By comparison, I believe that the present Minister for Education in the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, and the former Minister for Education, Tom Harris, have both for a long time been focusing the interests in the Northern Territory very specifically on the needs of a decent and proper Aboriginal education policy that ensures that Aboriginal students are being properly developed and focused in many ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   For too long the Federal Government has used the Northern Territory as a trial place for social and economic experiments where it would not often use such experimental schemes elsewhere in Australia. Too often these schemes are targeted at Aboriginal people where the Labor Party, the media and the wider Australian public never experienced first-hand the consequences of these actions.  I, therefore, want to address the issue where social justice for territorians, particularly Aborigines, is being neglected by the present Federal Labor Government. The hollow rhetoric of the ALP is too often hypocritical. To me, the measure of educational success should be the number of people in real jobs, not being in handout situations. </PARA>
<PARA>  As long ago as 1973, in a report of the interim committee of the Australian Schools Commission, the issue of equality of educational opportunity in Australian education was taken up. The report reinforced the view that achievement and attainment levels were firmly linked to the socioeconomic circumstances of the student's home environment. It became apparent that, if there were to be any improvement in the educational achievements of students in the poorest sections of the Australian community, there would need to be positive discrimination in favour of these students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth Government introduced the disadvantaged schools program in 1974 to address these needs. This program was one of several to support children and communities in their areas of educational need. It was specifically introduced to assist schools to change their approach to teaching and to assist students attending schools in the poorest parts of the Australian community. In order to achieve this, a target group was formed to identify accurately these schools so that the program resources were delivered to the most needy schools. The Commonwealth Schools Commission had to make fundamental decisions on what social criteria were to be employed. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is now ancient history, but those decisions were seriously flawed. Since its commencement, the disadvantaged schools program has failed to help those in the greatest need. Schools were adopted as the unit of funding rather than as individuals. They were ranked in order of eligibility. It is this ranking which has so obviously incensed the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, and prompted him to make some comments in the other chamber on 11 September this year. However, the honourable member for the Northern Territory has assumed, in his normal fashion, that it was the fault of the Northern Territory Government. However, he has either been misled by his Labor mates or his own ignorance, or he is deliberately concocting a saga in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The disadvantaged schools formula made use of 38 census variables, including socio-economic status, the extent of schooling, unemployment, Aboriginality, ethnicity and housing. The methodology also conducted resources on a sliding scale that provided a higher proportion of resources in ratio to the depth of poverty of the school. In 1979, the Commonwealth Schools Commission knew that all was not well with the formula. It was decided to revise the indicator of disadvantage and to improve the methodology using techniques that reflected more accurately the social composition of schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1983 the Labor Government initially agreed with the assessment made by Dr Ross of Deakin University on his findings in this area in his study entitled `Social Area Indicators of Educational Need'. By November 1983 all States and Territories were invited to join, with the Commonwealth, a national working party on the index of disadvantage to which Dr Ross was an adviser. The working party developed the following dimensions that were found to be significant in identifying disadvantaged schools: occupation, education, income, family, accommodation, tenancy, crowding, language and Aboriginality. </PARA>
<PARA>  A review conference of the disadvantaged schools program was held in Sydney in June 1984 at which the Commonwealth, all States and Territories, parent groups, the National Aboriginal Education Committee and the then Department of Aboriginal Affairs were present. Several major recommendations were made at the conference. These included, firstly, that non-English speaking Aborigines and Asians be included in the new index, as would all other non-English speaking groups; secondly, that all the variables agreed to by the working party should be retained in the index; and, thirdly, that any weighting mechanism adopted and upon which funding distribution would be based should be a fair one and should be linked directly to disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  Case studies undertaken in Victoria and Queensland--also copied separately in the Northern Territory--demonstrated the effectiveness of the Ross methodology. One has to remember that, through all of this, the disadvantaged schools program continued dispensing funds to schools considered disadvantaged under its existing flawed criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>  By early 1985 a further meeting of the working party agreed that the existing resources allocation methodology was inequitable and had no basis in research. It was agreed that the Ross methodology, as undertaken in the pilot study, should be adopted for a national index of disadvantage. The decision in 1985 to adopt an objective methodology started a long, protracted struggle that continues today to the detriment of all Territorians but in particular to the detriment of my Aboriginal constituents in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>  The struggle arose because, to adopt the pilot study approach on a national basis, a significant reallocation of funding was necessary. The pilot study methodology readily identified the very poor communities and their particular socioeconomic structures. It proved what had been suspected for years: many of the disadvantaged schools were being discriminated against by the program established to help them. It also happened that schools in the Northern Territory--particularly schools in remote Aboriginal communities--were among those doing without. </PARA>
<PARA>  What ensued was an impasse--a protracted debate between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth on the implementation of a fair and equitable indicator. The Commonwealth was faced with two options. Firstly, adopt a stable index which weighted all dimensions equally and reallocate funding away from the disadvantaged Labor voting electorates in the cities or, secondly, adopt an indicator that maintained the status quo. This would avoid a reallocation of resources to those who need them desperately, but it would mean cheating through the adoption of a less stable indicator. A model approximating the first option was endorsed by the then National Aboriginal Education Advisory Committee to the Commonwealth because it clearly identified the extreme poverty of Aborigines in remote areas. The Australian Council of Government Schools also endorsed the proposal, as did the national Isolated Children's Parents Association. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, those based in western Sydney, Melbourne or any other southern city who are accustomed to disadvantaged school funding were not to be deserted so readily by the Labor Party. A contrived reference group on the definition of disadvantage was established to debate the proposals of Dr Ross in his notable absence. It received a draft report which dismissed most of the factors that indicated a need to reallocate resources and took no account of Aboriginal needs. After complaints from the Northern Territory Government, its author, Dr Manning, reviewed his findings. He identified that Aborigines did have special needs and recommended that they should receive double the funding of other eligible students and that any school with more than 25 per cent Aboriginal enrolment should be automatically declared a disadvantaged school. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1988, a publication entitled Indicators of Socio-Economic Disadvantage for Australian Schools included a demonstration by Dr Ross of the impact of various weightings on the dimensions which are used to construct an indicator of poverty. Dr Ross provided a table demonstrating the disadvantage ratio for two indicators--Q, the preferred Commonwealth indicator, and G, for each State and Territory. Indicator Q gives a heavy weighting to a dimension occupation that, for the most part, excludes the Northern Territory Aboriginal population. Indicator G gives equal weighting to all dimensions, including occupation, and picks up the remote Aboriginal schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  Dr Ross's comments concerning the table presented for indicator G were:</PARA>
<PARA>The most striking feature (of the disadvantage ratio) was the magnitude of disadvantage ratios for both sectors in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The ratios indicated that, if indicator G was used, the Northern Territory had 3.7 times the national rate of socioeconomic disadvantaged of the rest of Australia. This was largely caused by the extreme poverty associated with remote Aboriginal schools. After seven years of criticism of the existing model from consultants, the Schools Commission, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the National Aboriginal Education Committee, the Australian Council of Government Schools, the Isolated Children's Parents Association and the Northern Territory Government, the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training finally acted to produce a change through the introduction of what it calls the 1991 indicator. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who stands to benefit from the changes within the Department of Employment, Education and Training? Unfortunately, for my Northern Territory Aboriginal constituents who have contributed in the past so significantly to the election of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, it will not be them. They have been conned and Mr Snowdon will have to wear the consequences at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only has the Department of Employment, Education and Training reduced the percentage of the national allocation to Northern Territory Aboriginal students, but also it has discarded the mechanism for identifying the depth of poverty of the poorest schools in Australia. A disadvantaged schools program with no mechanism to identify the extent of poverty in disadvantaged schools is quite absurd. It certainly demonstrates the arrogance of the Labor Government and the inequities which flow from its efforts to put its mates at the head of the queue. No consultation took place with the State and Territory governments during the development of this indicator or the abolition of the depth of poverty mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA>  Northern Territory officers of the Department of Education who have questioned the changes have elicited answers that leave the Minister for Education in the Northern Territory, Mr Stone, along with myself, wondering whether the Department of Employment, Education and Training officers involved even knew that this important part of the structure existed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Questions from all the various bodies supporting the proposals of Dr Ross are still unanswered by the Department, which has offered no rationale for the weightings it has imposed. One of the outcomes of the introduction of the Federal Labor Government's 1991 indicator is that it identifies several Aboriginal schools as the least disadvantaged schools in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>  Papunya Primary School is probably one of the best known of these schools nationally. In data from the 1986 census, Papunya has a population of 340 persons. Of these, 184 are within the work force age limits. Of the 184, 53 are employed and two are actively seeking employment. The census indicates that Papunya has a 3.6 per cent unemployment rate. However, there are 129 persons at Papunya categorised as `not in the labour force'. Therefore, as the two unemployed persons are added to the 129, there are 131 persons not identified in the heavily weighted occupation dimension of the 1991 indicator. Of 184 persons in the potential work force, 131, or 71 per cent of eligible persons in the community, are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  How a school with a permanent unemployment rate of 71 per cent can be identified as one of the least disadvantaged schools in the Northern Territory is of concern to me and should be of concern to the member for the Northern Territory. An indicator that fails to take into account known under-enumeration on this scale is useless in identifying relative poverty across Australia. Not only does that 1991 indicator have this obvious methodological flaw but, by weighting the occupation dimension by a factor of five, it also exacerbates the problem five times. These schools are penalised in a multiple fashion. One wonders how many other schools in Australia are discriminated against by this indicator. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those responsible for the disadvantaged schools program are not walled up in the office in Canberra. They have visited Papunya and many schools like it. They know the problems and the inequity produced if one chooses to misinterpret the employment statistics in relation to seriously disadvantaged schools. So the Commonwealth bodies, the Department of Employment, Education and Training's own advisory groups, consultants, parent organisations and State-Territory representatives were not the only ones ignored. These Department of Employment, Education and Training officers have ignored the evidence before their own eyes. The only conclusion that can be reached is that a deliberate decision was made to proceed with an indicator that was known to neglect Aborigines and the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a further issue that relates to many Aboriginal communities and causes them to be further discriminated against even if classified as employed, and I refer to the community development employment scheme. Under CDEP, Aborigines in certain communities must work on community tasks--they work for the dole, a benefit other Australians receive as a right. In return, Aborigines who receive this benefit through CDEP are classified as employed. At census time these Aborigines are classified as employed although they may never have had, or have any prospect of having, a real job in their lives. As a direct result of CDEP, their community's eligibility for the disadvantaged schools program suffers. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the last couple of months the Commonwealth has argued that the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program was introduced last year to give additional funding to Aborigines for education, but even the Department of Employment, Education and Training has not suggested that they should be considered less disadvantaged as a result. Aborigines should qualify for disadvantaged schools program funding on the basis of poverty, not on the basis that they are Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Northern Territory Government has obviously tried for years to get the Schools Commission and now the Department of Employment, Education and Training to address these issues. It has proposed that all future resource indicators or formulae be developed by a subcommittee of the Australian Education Council so that all States and Territories can participate in their development. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the past few weeks, officers from the Department of Employment, Education and Training have visited the Australian Bureau of Statistics in Darwin to discuss these issues. The Bureau of Statistics has confirmed that the Northern Territory Government view was based firmly on an accurate interpretation of data of the Bureau of Statistics. However, there still appears to be an unwillingness to allow these poorer and remotely located Aboriginal schools to be counted on the same basis as other schools in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is time that we addressed this chronic problem of education in Australia. The Labor Government seems to have been caught up in rhetoric rather than results. The bureaucracy seems to be bogged down in detail rather than looking for proper outcomes by which they should be measured. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition supports this legislation. However, it is necessary and timely to highlight the issues and major areas that must be addressed if we are to see good educational opportunities as fundamental for Aboriginal people, and as giving them the opportunity to be full participants in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>  This was put very well by Charles Perkins in Alice Springs in August when talking about education, and his words make for potent and disturbing reading. Charles Perkins was the first Aboriginal Australian to graduate from university. That it was 1965 before any Aboriginal Australian did so is a shame. It is also timely that we look at his comments in the context of today, and I will quote what Charles Perkins said this year:</PARA>
<PARA>This has not received the focus it justifiably demands. It has been our greatest `blind spot' over the years in not realising the vital element of good education. We have usually left this to others or we have let our academic Aborigines tinker at the fringes with the Federal Government. . . The reality is, we are in the majority, unskilled and uneducated and as such, at the mercy of governments, bureaucrats, pathetic politics and the rise and fall of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Those comments are very timely for us to take note of as to where we are going and the type of underpinning we are giving education for Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

Where I would agree with him is that in future we must avoid an over-bureaucratisation of Aboriginal and Islander education. We must get back to far greater reliance on decentralised decision making and the recognition of Aboriginal and Islander communities--and their experts within their own communities who can educate their children--rather than act as well meaning, distant, white bureaucrats and politicians who think we know what is best for Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Tambling and I might find some agreement on that point, but we can debate that later. I come to this debate with particular experience in Aboriginal education. As long ago as 1967, I was very much aware of the problems of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in north Queensland. As a teacher, I decided to do something about it. I was responsible for the establishment of the first preschool for Aboriginal and Islander children in that State. We called it `Kindergarten Headstart', modelled on the disadvantaged school concept in the United States at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In retrospect, while this kindergarten was a good initiative, it was created very much from the point of view of a paternalistic or, in this case, maternalistic approach to helping Aboriginal and Islander people in education. While it was established and run by well-meaning white Australians, we did succeed in passing over the running of that kindergarten  to the local community within about four years. From that point on, it certainly was a very important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  A few years later there was an attempt to establish what was called the Black Community School, which is very much the forerunner of many of the independent schools that Senator Tambling has referred to. When it was suggested in some of the local papers, the reaction of the educational bureaucracy in the 1970s to the term `black community school'--and I do not know whether Senator Macdonald remembers some of the headlines--was, `What is so special about independent schools for Aboriginal communities when, after all, we have had our independent schools for almost the past 200 years?'. At that time it was regarded as quite a different issue and a threat and a challenge to the education system. I do not want to dwell so much on history; rather I want to talk about the importance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Eurocentric view that we have of education for Aboriginal and Islander people in this country must be addressed in coming years. Clearly, there are Eurocentric skills, if you like, that we all must obtain. I particularly commend the comments that have been made in relation to Aboriginal preschools. We must ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have access to aspects of that Eurocentric education system so they can acquire the skills that are needed in the modern society. But we must see that children come into the system at their own pace, within their own culture. This situation was appalling in the 1960s and into the 1970s. Of course, in some parts of Australia it is still going on. In their first few weeks at school when Aboriginal and Islander children are learning to read, they confront middle-class, white characteristics and values that mean absolutely nothing to them. They cannot relate to those issues, and that would be the case if many of our children were to go to school in a totally different society: they would find it difficult to learn in a totally different value system. That is an issue which is fundamental to the beginnings of education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Tambling touched on the issue of cooperation of the States and the fact that we have a national approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. That national approach is tremendous, but we must ensure that the States do not--`breach' is perhaps too strong a word--forgo some of their obligations. I cannot let this debate pass without a comment in relation to statements made by Premier Goss at Aurukun some months ago. It was suggested that, because children were not attending school and because parents were not valuing education in the way that is anticipated and expected in the Eurocentric culture, teachers should be withdrawn and parents and children should be virtually punished for not valuing education. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand totally the Premier's frustration and the frustration of teachers, educational bureaucrats, ATSIC, and Ministers where, on some Aboriginal communities, children are truanting; they are not in a position to take advantage of the education that is being offered. But I do not believe that withdrawing from the situation is the answer. I think the answer lies very much in the kind of teachers we appoint and how long we leave them in the one area. I know, as someone who used to be involved in teacher training, that a number of my former students wanted to remain in Aboriginal communities and were transferred. Certainly, that is going back a couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to encourage those teachers who want to work in Aboriginal communities with Aboriginal people to develop their own skills and structures in conformity with a broad curriculum base but recognising the Aboriginal culture. These are the teachers who should be encouraged to remain rather than have them transferred when they have only just come into the community and gained some acceptance and credibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aboriginal parents, Aboriginal teacher aids and Aborigines themselves training to work in education is an area that must be extended. Many Aboriginal parents are still reluctant to work within white middle-class schools. They are suspicious because of their own experience at school, because they feel that some of the teachers do not understand and because they have particular expectations of their children. We must break down those barriers between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents and teachers. Many teachers are only too eager to do this. I do not mean this to be a criticism of teachers, but I do think this is an area where much more work has to go into community education and community relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is difficult to talk about Aboriginal education without reference to the over-bureaucratisation of our education. These days, everything has to be measured, quantified and calculated in terms of how much it will cost--financially, of course. I think educationalists within the departments responsible--DEET and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs--have to start thinking about what the alternative is and what the social costs are. There is a financial cost, there is a bottom line, and Treasury and Finance will always remind us of those actual costs. But what is the alternative if Aboriginal and Islander people do not gain just recognition for their skills and talents in this society and if they do not gain the educational skills that they will need to meet the future? The social cost and the ultimate financial cost will be far greater in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was interested in what Senator Michael Baume had to say about homework centres. I am sure that Senator Colston and I and, no doubt, others in this chamber have worked in homework centres over the years. Senator Baume asked, `Why are the schools not used?  We already have a community resource'. As someone who has always campaigned for schools to be opened up and used for a whole range of community functions, I can sympathise with that view. However, often we are dealing with children who are opposing the education structure in which they are obliged to work. I do not think that schools necessarily provide--some schools do--the supportive environment that is needed for the homework support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly believe that wherever possible we should move towards utilising schools for homework centres, but not at the risk of the homework scheme. We do not want a situation such as has occurred in Aurukun where children are not going to school and are not going to the homework centre because the homework centre is based in the school. After all, the majority of children will do their homework in a home-like atmosphere. If that is difficult in some Aboriginal families, we should be far-sighted enough to ensure a comparable environment is provided for Aboriginal children at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>  In regard to some of the issues that have been raised about higher education, I would not want to let this opportunity pass. It is true, as Senator Kernot said, that some tertiary institutions are not particularly interested in Aboriginal education. They do not necessarily go out of their way to take advantage of many of the outstanding Government initiatives that have been taken to encourage tertiary institutions to provide special programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>  I even know of one institution--perhaps there are more--which took the resources that were provided by the Federal Government for Aboriginal and Islander special programs and absorbed that money into other areas of the university. I will not embarrass that particular institution by naming it in this place because the issue has been corrected and that institution is now taking many more positive measures. I think it does illustrate that the Federal Government, through the departments of both Minister Tickner and Minister Dawkins, has to be eternally vigilant in ensuring that the resources that are allocated for specific Aboriginal programs in universities are, in fact, expended in the way in which they are intended. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is just one such example that has been launched recently at James Cook University. Members of the Aboriginal and Islander community can now obtain special entry into nursing studies at James Cook. The head of the department has announced that the course started in July this year. It is long overdue. We have had special courses for teachers in several tertiary institutions for over 10 years, but there have been very few initiatives in regard to nursing which is a vital area for Aboriginal and Islander people to train in their own health care. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might just indicate that, although the applicants preferably should have a high school education--grade 11 or grade 12--interviews are also being held to facilitate special entry. We do need to ensure that there is that degree of flexibility in the entry requirements. Ultimately, the test will be whether the individual can work within the course that is provided. I do not think we should put arbitrary entry limits in the face of applicants who may well be able to succeed once they get past that initial barrier. </PARA>
<PARA>  In debating this piece of legislation, the important fact that has to be raised is that, essentially, we have a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal and Islander issues in the Federal Parliament now and that is a very strong basis on which to build national reconciliation. National reconciliation will occur only if we have education on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today we have been talking about education in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. That is very important. But we also have to talk about what amount of education occurs in the broad community, about what understanding has yet to be achieved in the general Australian community about the reality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's history--it is a black history, as we know--about what has occurred and about what limits there are to Aboriginal and Islander people. We have to educate the white community to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  One such initiative has been taken in Queensland which should provide a model for all States. Queensland is in the process of finalising the establishment of what is called a mobile cross-cultural awareness training unit which has been funded jointly by the Federal Government, through the Office of Multicultural Affairs, under the Commonwealth-State-Territory initiative of the Federal Government's community relations strategy, and the State Government of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rationale for this cross-cultural awareness training unit is that it should foster and support positive community relations and interactions between groups and individuals to group all Australians together in a multicultural society. Its goal is to enhance community relations. Those community relations depend very heavily on education. The unit will consist of a four-wheel drive vehicle and a specially constructed multipurpose van. It will be resourced with multimedia resources to assist its two project officers in travelling around the communities, particularly the outback communities, in trying to build bridges between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. We are very aware of the degree of racism that is present in our community, and that is something that must be broken down through education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, today we have heard about the importance of education that was stated in a number of the recommendations of the reports into Aboriginal deaths in custody. It is essential that our correctional centres, our prisons--whatever they happen to be called in the different States these days--must undergo major transformations in regard to education, not just the education of the prisoners themselves, but the education of the people who work with them. Without that two-way process of education, I fear that we will continue to have the tragedy of Aboriginal deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an ideal opportunity, we could say, when Aboriginal people are in prison for a short time, we hope, to give them certain education that has not been obtained in the wider community. It is important that that opportunity is taken so that those people go back into the community with skills, with the opportunity, to participate along with all Australians. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have chosen to speak very briefly on this Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 just to relate some broad impressions that I obtained recently in a four-day or five-day trip which I undertook in Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait islands in the company of Dr Michael Wooldridge, the Liberal Party spokesman on Aboriginal affairs. My comments will, for that reason, be reasonably broad. Before doing that, I just want to muse on a couple of matters mentioned by Senator Reynolds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I might say that I consider Senator Reynolds to have a genuine interest in the field of Aboriginal affairs. It is one in which she has a lot of experience, a genuine compassion and a wish to help Aboriginal people. But I also wonder, in my relative inexperience in this chamber, about some of the bureaucratic programs, systems and schemes that evolve and are put into place particularly in relation to Aboriginal communities. I note that Senator Reynolds was lamenting or concerned about the over-bureaucratic control of education in Aboriginal affairs. I agree with her. But after eight or nine years in Government, I wonder what this Government has done about it. I would have hoped that people like Senator Reynolds, who have an understanding of this, may have been able to change the system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Coming from where I do--a non-expert category when it comes to Aboriginal education--it does seem to me in a broad way that the programs that are devised in Canberra by Canberra bureaucrats and public servants keep going. The money that is spent on these programs--Senator Reynolds and other senators have mentioned a few--just seems to add on to the cost of administering education and benefits for Aboriginal communities. I often wonder whether the money that is spent on these new programs and bureaucracy would be better spent on the things that really would assist Aboriginal groups. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that we should not be looking towards particularly separate development for different racial groups. These theories went out of favour decades ago right around the world. We should be attempting to get programs that build a oneness of Australia whilst recognising that various groups, particularly Aboriginal and Islander people, come from different backgrounds and different histories and have particular problems. We should be aiming for a oneness of Australia rather than as I see things going in certain areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  This particular Bill transfers the higher education funding component of the Aboriginal education strategic initiative programs to the Higher Education Funding Act, which means that the higher education institutions will provide supplementary assistance to Aboriginal students out of the global budget. As I understand it, these are simply some administrative arrangements to get the funds more defined and more clearly flowing from one to the other. The fact that this Bill is necessary gives some credence to my point. There seem to be so many different programs, different Acts and different initiatives all costing enormous sums of money which I think would be better spent more directly on the real problems of Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation arises following the commencement in January 1990 of the national Aboriginal and Islander education program. That program embraced a number of programs, including  the Aboriginal and Islander education strategic initiatives program, the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program, the Aboriginal and Islander tutorial assistance scheme and the vocational and educational guidance for Aboriginals and Islanders scheme. Generally speaking, the coalition supports the legislation which underpins the national Aboriginal and Islander education policy. The Bill has no particular contentious provisions in itself that require debate here. </PARA>
<PARA>  Prior to the introduction of the Aboriginal education policy, something which has enjoyed bipartisan support in this Parliament, strong evidence suggested that 10 to 15 per cent of Aboriginals of student age were not participating in primary and secondary schooling despite the national expectation that all school-age children would receive such schooling. Also, participation rates for Aboriginal people in post compulsory schooling are only about one-third of the number for all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  These and other concerns led to the development of the Aboriginal education policy which followed the Hughes report of 1988. The report found that, despite improvements over the past couple of decades, Aboriginal and Islander people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. Based on these findings, the Aboriginal education policy was developed. </PARA>
<PARA>  During my recent visit to Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait islands, we spoke with Aboriginal community groups about a number of the problems that they were experiencing with education. Some of the previous speakers mentioned in passing the problems at Aurukun, where the absentee rate is very high. There have been figures suggesting that five out of six students are not attending those schools. The solutions to this problem of education have to be found from within the communities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the long term future of Aboriginal and Islander people depends upon their young people having a good education that will equip them to live in the world which, whether they want to or not, they are going to have to live in. Regrettably, we cannot hold time back. Aboriginal and Islander people are Australians. They are part of the world as it rapidly changes every week. They must be equipped to be able to deal with that. Of course, that happens through education. </PARA>
<PARA>  During my visit to Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait islands, we saw a varying range of educational establishments and the way they are run. Some do have problems and Aurukun has been mentioned. I might mention the situation on Darnley Island, which is one of the easternmost of the Torres Strait islands. One would not find a more beautiful island anywhere. I was very impressed with the school on that island. The school was in recess at the time we visited it, but it was still very obvious from the school that pride was taken in it. </PARA>
<PARA>  We were told by the teacher in charge that there was not a problem with absenteeism on Darnley Island; in fact, the children were so anxious to get to school that they were turning up very early in the morning. The teacher actually had to circularise parents to make them aware that the students would not be supervised before 7.30 a.m. That seemed to be a tremendous lesson to learn. Obviously, something is being done right in that school which encourages the students to go there and which makes them want to be there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The school itself and the classrooms showed that the students really have a positive approach and a very broad education. I might say that I learnt something myself during a self-guided tour of a little compound out the back where the students were obviously learning about hydroponics. It is  a subject which I know very little about. We walked through their compound and saw the different results. They were actually growing tomatoes by hydroponics. A little story was told about each little plot and there seemed to be a competition going on between the various students. This all seemed very positive. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hydroponics is something that may well assist these islands where, at times, the soil that is naturally on the islands might not be the right soil to grow crops and food. Hydroponics may well be an appropriate study for the future of those islands. This was of interest to me, and I am sure the students enjoyed doing that. The school itself is in a beautiful setting overlooking the very deep blue waters of the Torres Strait and the reefs that surround the island. It was all a tremendous feeling because something is obviously being done right. After visiting that school, one would have great enthusiasm and great confidence for the future of education in the Torres Strait islands. </PARA>
<PARA>  Various community leaders spoke to us about the problem that, after year 7, there are no continuing educational facilities on these islands or in communities on Cape York Peninsula. The students have to leave their home base and the family they have grown up with, and move some distance away to Thursday Island, Cairns or bigger places such as that. In some cases they must go quite long distances to continue their education. That is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  Coupled with that problem is the fact that the students who go away to continue their education tend to be the brighter ones. Once they go away they never come back to their community. They make lives and careers in other parts of Australia. At times the better students are lost to those communities forever. That is not a problem peculiar to Aboriginal and Islander communities; it is peculiar to remote Australia. In the community that I live in, and in other communities throughout remote Australia, that is a problem--the better students tend to go away and never return. The expertise or the better learning never returns to remote Australia. That is something we should look at. Of course, the way to get them to return is to have employment opportunities for them. That would give them a reason to return. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should not be looking at only Aboriginal and Islander education but remote Australia education, and I prefer to think of it as remote Australia education. We should be looking at providing incentives to kids to study more so that they can get decent jobs within their own community. It is very difficult to ask remote Australian children to spend a lot of time at and have a real enthusiasm to go to school and expand their knowledge when they know that at the end of their schooling they will leave and have nothing to go to. </PARA>
<PARA>  What interest is there for them to continue with their education studies if they know that at the end of the day they will go onto the dole or that the Government or some agency will support them and give them everything they need? They may not be terribly exciting lives for them, but they will be fed and clothed. They think, `Why bother? What is the incentive? What is the interest in continuing with education? What attraction is there to perform, to achieve excellence, to be the best and to get ahead if it is all for no cause?'. I say this quite obviously not as an educator nor as one with any formal training or particular expertise in the educational field. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have to look at the real bottom line: what education is all about and what future there is for kids in remote Australia. We should really be looking at employment opportunities, the things that will give people something to do in remote Australia. The Government needs to look at that a bit more. It becomes an economic problem, a resource development problem. They are the sorts of things that I think this Government has failed dismally on. It is no good spending millions of dollars on education if the bottom line is not there at the end. In a very broad way we have to look at the incentives for kids to go to school and to stay in their communities once they have graduated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The coalition certainly supports this Bill. I ask that some thought be given to the schools and the educational opportunities that are really working and have proved themselves. These schools and establishments might be used as examples or goals for other schools and educational establishments to aim towards and put some rationality and commonsense into some of the programs that we introduce for education in remote Australian areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill is an extremely simple administrative Bill which has neither a Budget impact nor a policy impact. Contributors to this debate have quite reasonably used it as a platform to discuss the important area of Aboriginal education. There is no need for me to detain the Senate, because there has been welcome and consistent support both in the House of Representatives and, indeed, in the Senate for this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I reiterate that the program for which these pieces of legislation act as legislative support--that is, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, commonly referred to as the AEP--is a truly national policy and is one of the very few where there is total support from both State and Territory governments and the Federal Government for the 21 goals which underpin this important program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make reference to a point raised by Senator Reynolds and, no doubt, by other speakers; that is, that education in this area is very much a two-way street in that we act as the potential beneficiaries--the non-Aboriginal people of Australia--in learning more about that culture. I was pleased to hear Senator Macdonald's contribution about the visit that he recently made to a number of Aboriginal communities. I am certainly aware that Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal society have often been denigrated in the past by non-Aboriginal people in Australia--not so much these days, I am pleased to say. The Aboriginal culture has a richness and a diversity and it is of enormous value to this country and to Australians generally, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The relationships that Aboriginal people have with each other--their family relationships, the strength of those relationships and the relationships between the family and the land upon which they live, certainly in traditional Aboriginal society--are expressed to an extent which has largely been lost and are to a great degree unknown in the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mention this because a number of years ago--in fact, so many years ago that it is almost ancient history--the national curriculum unit, a unit of the Commonwealth Department of Education, prepared a superlative kit, based on a number of Aboriginal families on Elcho Island in the Northern Territory, now known as Galiwinku, which consisted of educational material, videos and language cassettes. The kit simply gave a brief appreciation of the richness and diversity of Aboriginal culture. The kit was specifically designed to be put into schools all over Australia so that non-Aboriginal students could appreciate the great value and diversity of Aboriginal culture. I do not know whether that material has been added to. I have not seen any consolidated material of the quality of that which was produced. Perhaps it is still the main tool in schools for this appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The goal of providing non-Aboriginal Australians with an understanding under this program, for which these Bills act as a legislative support, is acknowledged and recognised in the 21 goals that are provided for under the AEP. Goal 21 states that the scheme is to provide all Australian students with an understanding of and respect for Aboriginal traditional and contemporary cultures. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an extremely difficult task for an Aboriginal person to cope successfully with both cultures. It is trite to say it in the sense that it has been said so many times before, but it is worth saying again: it is a very challenging thing for Aboriginal persons to compete successfully with non-Aboriginal people--as I believe they must do--and, at the same time, retain their Aboriginality. It is a very daunting task. If I recounted the number of Aboriginal people who, in my opinion, have successfully done that it would be a very short list indeed. It is not an easy thing to do. Having said that, I believe that, as other speakers have said and as has been borne out by numerous inquiries, the latest of which was the Aboriginal deaths in custody inquiry, there is no more vitally important element for public policy than education in terms of public support and resources to assist the Aboriginal people of Australia. That is my opinion, without question. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, may I say on behalf of the Government that I am grateful for the expressions of support from the Opposition for this legislation in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. I commend to the Senate the speedy passage of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In speaking to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, which are designed to split the Export Finance Insurance Corporation from Austrade, I wish to make it clear that the Opposition will not be opposing them. The Bills aim to establish EFIC as a separate corporation from Austrade and to supplement its existing reserves by an additional $200m in callable capital. In so doing, existing provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act relating to export finance and insurance are repealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is well to remember at this stage that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation has been around in one form or another for over 30 years. It has probably been buried away and not subject to much scrutiny or attention--until in 1986 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, decided to amalgamate it with Austrade and to make the combined operation something that was to be at the forefront of building Australian exports. The McKinsey report showed this whole endeavour to be a complete and abject failure. </PARA>
<PARA>  To say that the Minister's oversight of Austrade has been slack is perhaps not to put it too highly. It is interesting to note that the last annual report we received was for 1989-90. Though there is provision for the Minister to make directives from time to time, he certainly has not done so. We still do not have the annual report for this financial year. I have managed to ascertain that it exists in draft form. It is important to note that many agencies and departments make draft annual reports available, as is proper, to Estimates committees for the purpose of Estimates hearings. Austrade chose not to do so. I understand that it will not make even the draft available until it has been seen by the board which is meeting at the end of this month after the return from overseas of the new managing director. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also worth noting that a curious part of this whole exercise to split Austrade, which the McKinsey report, as I said, showed to be an abject failure, from EFIC--which, interestingly enough, was exempt from the McKinsey inquiry, despite the fact that it had a common board--was carried out in a way where the new personnel have been appointed pursuant, or allegedly pursuant, to the McKinsey report while the two organisations remained joined and in the care and control of DITAC, whereas that part of the old joint operation, namely Austrade, is to go to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But, curiously, EFIC is to remain with DITAC. </PARA>
<PARA>  My colleague Mr Downer in the other place correctly said that in his view EFIC should also be transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as that is where many aid programs with which EFIC needs to interact in fact lie. The decision to let EFIC remain within DITAC seems to me to be a very strange and, indeed, wrong decision because the history of its administration is not good. I will look at some of those aspects a little later. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bills themselves implement a decision taken by the Government in the March industry statement. The new EFIC is to be endowed with responsibility for officially supported export finance and insurance matters previously undertaken by Austrade under the same name. Although there may be no immediate direct financial impact from this Bill, there is provision to make a call upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund of up to $200m if it is determined that EFIC's assets are insufficient to meet anticipated liabilities, losses and claims. Under circumstances where the Corporation determines that its money and other assets are excessive for the purposes of meeting anticipated liabilities, losses and claims, the Corporation is to return excess capital to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill provides transitional arrangements necessary to preserve continuity as export finance and insurance matters are transferred from Austrade to the newly constituted EFIC and its new structure. Assets, liabilities and staff associated with the relevant functions are also transferred from Austrade to EFIC by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in one form or another has been around for some 30 to 35 years. It aims to insure exports against risk of non-payment by overseas buyers and provides a range of guarantee and bonding services, and of course loans. At present, it covers about 10 per cent of Australia's export trade. Offshore investments can also be insured against non-commercial loss due to exchange transfer blockages, expropriation or war damage and can cover an investment that may be in the vicinity of $490m. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to point out that there are two types of business that EFIC carries out: one is on the national interest account and the other on what is called the commercial account. Before I explain the distinction between those two methods of accounting, it is reasonable to point out that perhaps the distinction can indeed be described as a fiction, as indeed the high risk nature of the business that EFIC carries out is delineated by the fact that the private sector is unwilling to operate in these areas. Indeed, as Mr Downer pointed out in the other place--a thought with which I certainly concur--if it were possible to privatise EFIC, that would be a positive thing, but the degree of interest in the private sector in high risk business certainly appears to be limited. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that clause 62 of the main Bill we are now debating provides that the Commonwealth will guarantee all payments that may be due to be paid by EFIC to a third party, and clause 63 provides that it is exempt from taxation. To describe it as a truly commercial operation, a government business enterprise, as the Government is so fond of describing these corporatised functions, which is then pushed off budget, is not to give a good definition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look in a brief way at the two types of business that EFIC does and will carry out: firstly, at the insurance where EFIC will carry the loss--that is what it calls its commercial account, be it insurance or loans--and, secondly, at the national interest account where, very simply, the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the taxpayer carries that risk. In those situations, the practice would seem to be that EFIC decides that it will decline to carry the whole risk or part thereof and makes a recommendation to the Minister that the remainder or all of the risk be carried on the national interest. It sets a premium which seems to be, by practice, a commercial or quasi-commercial premium plus 25 per cent. The best example of that sort of insurance on the national interest is the wheat sales to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well as that, there is the function of guaranteeing performance bonds, which are largely relevant to loans made by EFIC. EFIC's concessional finance is available and is based on rules consistent with the OECD rules. There is a lending program of about $1.6 billion currently in existence and funds are obtained on foreign capital markets and on-lent at subsidised interest rates. Indeed, in the performance notes that accompany the current Budget, some $14.7m has been provided for interest subsidies. Of course, this is taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose that it is relevant at this stage to mention that during the Supplementary Estimates earlier this year, when Senator Button and I were having a discourse about an alleged commercial loan of some $8m to one Mr Cantor at 8 per cent over eight years, Senator Button told me vehemently that we were not talking about taxpayers' money. I insisted that we were, and Senator Button wrote to me on 3 September and admitted that he stood corrected, that the interest subsidy was certainly taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, it is with concern that we see EFIC established as a statutory corporation--a GBE. That is because we are concerned that scrutiny may be lessened. Despite the fact that public money is involved in the funding of EFIC, the Bill casts doubts on ways in which the Parliament and particularly the Senate Estimates committees might be able to scrutinise those expenditures. There is some discourse at the moment as to the basis on which agencies that are being corporatised are subject to that scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to outline one case with which I have been dealing particularly at the moment, because it highlights the need for scrutiny by the Parliament, and that is the case which has become known as The Other Woman, involving the boat on which a loan was made to Mr Edward A. Cantor for $8m over eight years at a subsidised interest rate of 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is part of Government policy to support the shipbuilding industry so far as it relates to large ships--not small ships. Therefore, a number of loans have been made and a large amount of bounty has been paid. In this case, my initial concern when I raised the matter in the Supplementary Estimates in the first half of this year was how much care EFIC had exercised in choosing the person to whom it chose to lend money. </PARA>
<PARA>  It had been drawn to my attention that a New Jersey newspaper had reported in 1988 that Mr Cantor, to whom the loan was being made, had been charged with racketeering and conspiracy, and bail had been set at $25,000. The report went on to say that Mr Cantor had been detained in New York in July 1988 and charged with defrauding a federal bankruptcy trustee of more than $1 million just months after negotiations began for the construction of The Other Woman. In fact, the contract was signed in December 1987. The contract was with Runmere Pty Ltd and was signed on 28 December 1987. The contract price was $US7.65m. If that is converted--if my memory serves me correctly, the Australian dollar was being valued at between 76c and 80c in the dollar at that stage--that is about $A9m. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 4 February, Runmere wrote to a credit manager of a particular supplier and asked for credit to be established. He  stated that the value of the shipbuilding contract was $13m. One can only assume that that is the contract price plus the anticipated bounty payments. The boat is now alleged to be worth between $25m and $30m and Runmere has gone into liquidation. There are outstanding creditors, according to the last statement I saw, who are owed in the vicinity of $4.4m. The liquidator has a claim against Mr Cantor for some $5m to $6m of estimated alterations to the boat which were never paid for. This would go a long way towards paying some of those outstanding creditors. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, my concern initially was that we should ensure that EFIC never again did business with a person having such a background as Mr Cantor. Subsequent to my raising the matter, I then received a very curious letter, dated 25 September, which was faxed to me from a firm of solicitors in Brisbane. I quote from their letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Edward Cantor's sin in your eyes apparently is that he was convicted in New Jersey of some financial irregularity. . .</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, this is in addition to the other charges because my belief is that those other charges were dropped. I do not know under what circumstances; I am simply told that they were dropped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would be particularly interested to know. This firm of solicitors said that it was writing on behalf of the management and employees of Australian Yacht Builders, which is the company owned by Mr Cantor and which completed the building of the boat after Runmere went into liquidation and, indeed, received the second and third bounty payments of $1.9m and $0.3m respectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Mr Cantor bought the shipyard for less than the mortgage value of the property when it was put to auction--namely, $1.35m--and the directors of Runmere were forced to pay the difference out of the sale of their own homes. As I said, this letter was written apparently at the behest of the management and employees of Australian Yacht Builders. The letter goes on to say of Mr Cantor:</PARA>
<PARA>He says in his defence--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, when he was actually convicted--</PARA>
<PARA>quite simply that he was convicted of making a loan to an insolvent business associate which was in the circumstances interpreted as a bribe. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we are making a loan of $8m over eight years at 8 per cent to Mr Cantor, about whom I have received a letter from a firm of solicitors, dated 25 September, telling me that Mr Cantor has in fact been convicted of a bribe. </PARA>
<PARA>  I still find that I want reassurance from EFIC that we will not be doing business with somebody such as Mr Cantor and that the work that is done in investigation and scrutiny will improve. I have never got that undertaking. The reason why the case became even more important was that, although the contract for building the boat was signed in 1987 and the arrest took place--according to the letter I received from Senator Button--on 26 July 1988, the actual credit agreement under which the $8m was paid was not signed until 13 October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the interim, EFIC went and got a legal opinion after it became aware of the arrest, to see whether or not it would proceed with the loan. It sought that legal opinion from a New York firm of solicitors. Pursuant to that opinion, it proceeded with the loan.  I have repeatedly asked that the Senate be allowed to have a copy of that advice so that we may see the efficacy of the negotiations and, indeed, the checking of potential clients that EFIC engaged upon. The Minister has consistently refused to make that legal opinion available, and he claims commercial in confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>   Let us look through the question of this particular loan. Because in the contract there was provision for a performance bond--and, of course, Austrade was the guarantor of that bond--there was, in fact, a payment made to Mr Cantor of $2.23m. That statement was given in evidence by Dr Fisher, who is the general manager of EFIC, in these current Estimates hearings. Although we have made a loan to Mr Cantor of $8m, which has to be repaid, we have also given him, virtually in cash, $2.23m and we have also given him bounty payments of $2.2m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I ask the Minister whether or not that final payment of $0.3m, which he told me in his letter was due to be paid upon completion of the boat, was in fact paid. The bounty payment of $1.9m certainly was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The total amount of government and taxpayers' money that went into this boat was $17.1m. Indeed, Mr Cantor has admitted that himself. But the interesting point is that we are meant to be doing these things, I am told, in the interests of exports for Australians and producing business for Australians. I think it is well to note that the company that had the contract is, of course, now in liquidation. There are outstanding creditors and there is an outstanding claim against Mr Cantor which the liquidators have no money to pursue. We now have a boat which is valued at somewhere between $28m and $30m. I am informed that Mr Cantor was going around New York saying, `I have this wonderful boat courtesy of the Australian taxpayers. It is a very good deal'. </PARA>
<PARA>  My concern, as I said right at the outset, is that by looking at the way in which this particular case has proceeded we need to be sure that this newly created body, EFIC, pursuant to this legislation will be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament. This case of The Other Woman, this particular boat, is not alone. I am told that there is something in the vicinity of $110m worth of loans which are perhaps at risk. Of course, I am also aware of the fiasco with Mr Eliadakis who also received a loan initially of $4.3m to build a boat in which he took off to the Greek Islands. Then he received another advance against a further loan, which was approved, of $10 1/2m, and he received $1.2m for a boat that was never built. Those are still matters which need to be investigated as well. </PARA>
<PARA>   We do not know the extent of these loans or whether they have in fact been placed. But I am aware that there are at least two other boats which EFIC has taken possession of and is attempting to sell. I do not know the extent of the loss which will be incurred in that transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>   As I said, the Minister likes to make a distinction about a government business enterprise somehow being a totally commercial exercise. Of course, the Minister was not in the chamber when I dealt with that original distinction. But, whichever way it goes, on page 264 of the program performance statements for the current Budget Papers one will find that the total outlays concerning EFIC by way of appropriation are $258m. Some $264m, less $20m, is in respect of national interest business and a further almost $15m is for interest subsidies. By any account, EFIC must remain a truly accountable body to the Parliament, both through the Estimates committees and in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA>   Another point was raised by my colleague Mr Downer in the other place. It is one which I think is an important point and worth pursuing; that is, it would be interesting to establish a joint EFIC banking industry working group to examine whether the commercial banks can play a bigger role in providing some of the services that EFIC is currently providing or assist with the provision of those services. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said right at the outset, the likelihood of being able to privatise EFIC seems somewhat remote as so much of the business that it does is unattractive to the private sector as much of it is high risk business. The overseas experience is that overseas countries maintain an equivalent to EFIC as an instrument of providing assistance to industry, particularly in the export area. The opportunity to privatise seems remote, but the suggestion as made by Mr Downer in the other place is certainly one that ought to be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Opposition will not be opposing the Bills. We have some concerns about the manner in which GBEs operate. We are most concerned that these organisations remain subject to the proper scrutiny of the Parliament and that, somewhere along the line, we are given some reassurance about the processes which EFIC goes through to choose those people to whom largess is extended, certainly with a component of taxpayers' funds as well as government funds. That is a point which I think needs to be addressed. I trust the Minister will do just that when he speaks on this mater. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today the Senate is considering the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill 1991 and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  These two Bills seek to enact an announcement made by the Government in the March 1991 industry statement. In that statement the Government announced that EFIC, to use the short name, would cease to be a division of Austrade and would be re-established as an independent statutory corporation. This reverses the 1985 decision  incorporating EFIC into Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>   EFIC provides finance and insurance services to Australian exporters. The assistance can take many forms--for instance, subsidised interest rates, guarantees to financial institutions in respect of finance granted to exporters and insurance against non-payment by overseas buyers of Australian exports or national interest insurance. However, GATT and other international agreements limit the amount of assistance which can be granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  It will be useful to review briefly the history of assistance provided to Australian exporters by way of these arrangements. In 1956 the Export Payments Insurance Corporation was established to provide insurance for exporters against the risk of non-payment by overseas buyers. Since then, the range of EPIC's facilities has been extended, reflecting developments in financial and insurance markets and the changing pattern of Australian industry and international competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1971 buyers' credit was made available as an alternative means of financing exports of capital goods. In 1975 the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation was established, replacing the existing EPIC, with increased powers. These included strengthening commercial relations with overseas countries; developing facilities for Australian exporters; facilitating the provision of long term credit sales of machinery and capital goods; and establishing lines of credit to developing countries and State trading corporations. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1978 EFIC was allowed to provide indemnities to private financial corporations which issued tender, performance and related guarantees. In November 1983 EFIC was allowed to provide foreign currency financing and give Australian exporters access to lower interest rate currencies for medium and long term credit which met the terms being provided by competitors. The legislation also removed the restrictions which had limited EFIC's services to those not normally provided by the private sector. In other words, EFIC was able to compete with private insurers, and I will return to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1984 a pre-shipment finance guarantee facility was introduced to assist Australian manufacturers to obtain finance for the production of goods for export. In 1986 EFIC was subsumed into the newly created unified export service provider, Austrade. The current separation of EFIC from Austrade is part of the general reorganisation of Austrade following the McKinsey report which was provided to the Government in December 1990. That report recommended that Austrade should adopt a market driven approach and concentrate on providing better access to overseas customers utilising government clout and in-depth market know-how. This was based on the recognition that Austrade has to deal with both economic and cultural diversity and a very broad and complex range of products. In particular, the report recommended that Austrade gear up its capacity to access and influence foreign governments which are often key buyers or key influences in most countries and assist countries in overcoming, cost effectively, language and cultural barriers in unfamiliar markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  In focusing on these objectives, the McKinsey report recommended that a more critical approach be taken to the selection of markets where Austrade could provide these services most usefully. Thus there should be greater concentration on key markets such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and the emerging economies in Eastern Europe where, at that stage, Austrade's coverage was particularly thin. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is pleasing to note that in today's Australian Financial Review there is an article which quotes the Managing Director of Austrade, Mr Ralph Evans, as saying that Australia will provide a take-off point for American companies in unlocking markets in Asia and, interestingly enough, Eastern Europe, and that in fact the initiative taken by Coca-Cola to buy out a local franchise holder to use it as a vehicle for these activities did include Eastern Europe. It would appear that the tyranny of distance does not apply in modern trade as stringently as it used to. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe the continuing need for Austrade is well documented in the McKinsey report, and it is also illustrated by the fragmented nature of Australian exports and the high proportion of companies where the volume of exports in any given overseas market is well below the critical mass which would justify opening a representative company office. To illustrate that, the report suggests that exports in excess of $10m per year are necessary. However, only 242 exporters have aggregate exports in excess of $10m each and the number that export more than $10m to individual countries is much smaller than that. Hence some form of collective trade representation is essential at this stage of Australia's transition into overseas export markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Welcome though the McKinsey report and the subsequent shake-up and reorganisation of Austrade are, the question needs to be asked whether these support services are all we can expect from this Government. The Australian Democrats believe it is the task of our Government not to achieve a level playing field or to keep it level for our manufacturers and exporters but to tilt it in favour of our manufacturers and exporters. In this regard, it is disappointing that neither the reorganisation of Austrade nor the separation of EFIC from Austrade offers any decisive moves in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will name just two measures which the Government should consider. One would be an export bounty of 5 per cent payable on the value of new exports in any one year. In 1989-90 this would have cost $140m for increased exports of $2.8 billion. It would be a small price to pay if this measure had doubled the value of our new exports at the cost of another $140m. The second measure used by many other countries to gear up their export industries has been tax concessions for profits derived from exports. Such a measure would clearly have to be phased out over time. However, there is a lot to be said for decisive action to assist our manufacturing industry when the country has one million unemployed--a circumstance that does not seem to bother this Government overmuch. </PARA>
<PARA>  I return to the EFIC Bills. To the extent that they increase the range and efficiency of the services provided to exporters, the measures are of course welcome and the Bills are supported by the Australian Democrats. However, they seem to do little more than change labels on doors. If one were cynical, one could even suggest that the measure is an outcome of the bureaucratic wrangle between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which finally succeeded, and I think rightly so, in acquiring Austrade while EFIC has remained with the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I ask the Minister to expand on one statement contained in the second reading speech, to the effect that:</PARA>
<PARA>EFIC will continue to work with the financial sector and not in competition with it, to provide Australian exporters with access to competitive credit insurance and export finance facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may wish to explain what this means in practice. Does he mean that EFIC will not attempt to provide credit insurance which is more competitive than that provided by the private sector, or is he simply going to take the costs up to the level which represents the commercial cost of such services provided by the available commercial facilities? The Minister has said that these services will be provided not in competition with the private sector. I confirm that the Australian Democrats will not oppose these Bills. </PARA>

I suppose there is a political virtue in repetition, even if there is no intellectual one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am not sure of the implications of Senator Spindler's last question. The fact of the matter is that EFIC is very largely a supplier of finance to exporters where the private sector will not be involved. That is true of credit agencies throughout the world which are sponsored and supported by governments. So EFIC is in no different position from other agencies and, indeed, its activities are complementary to what may or may not happen in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take on board some of Senator Spindler's other observations. I must say that I do not embrace Australian Democrat Party policies about tipping the playing field in our favour. I must say that in the debate which takes place about these issues I am very much in favour of having a level playing field. I am not sure that we have that in the international community at present, not because of competitiveness or otherwise but because of practices which are adopted by a variety of countries and which really affect and distort trade movements throughout the world. We can begin by asking our farmers about that because they understand it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation is essentially concerned with the establishment of EFIC as a separate statutory corporation, the question of capital adequacy and the Government providing EFIC with access to the government guarantee. I must say that EFIC has operated for 35 years without a call on the government guarantee. It is anticipated that it will do so in the future. They are the essential points of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the legislation is not opposed--in fact, I understand that it is even supported by the Opposition and the Democrats--I need not go into great detail about the structural arrangements which have been entered into. Let me say, however, that I want to correct some misapprehensions. Firstly, EFIC supports somewhere between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of total Australian exports. A lot of concern has been expressed in the course of this debate about The Other Woman and that particular transaction, which I want to deal with in a minute for the umpteenth time. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that EFIC supports something like 15 per cent of Australian exports. While Mr Cantor might be alleged by some to be a bad risk because of some information which was plucked from a New Jersey newspaper, the fact is that, in terms of EFIC's total operations, the most costly operations that EFIC have had to indulge in over the years have been support for rural exports from this country to countries which are credit risks, either for political or other reasons. That is where EFIC's greatest exposure has been and that is an area which, strangely enough, the Opposition has said nothing about in the context of this debate. The point of an organisation like EFIC is that it does support export activities in a variety of fields that are not normally supported by private sector institutions and are not prepared to take that level of risk. </PARA>
<PARA>  When Senator Bishop talks about the structural arrangements that have been entered into, she ought to get some things right. With her level of experience in discussing this issue, she ought to get a few fundamental things right. For example, she suggested that in 1986 I put Austrade and EFIC together and now, in 1991, I am responsible for taking them apart. Senator Bishop would not by any chance be avoiding the issue of getting the facts right, would she?</PARA>
<PARA>  I make the point that, since its inception, EFIC was a separate statutory organisation until 1986, when it was put together with Austrade, not by me, as Senator Bishop said, but by the Minister responsible. This canard has been circulated by Senator Bishop and her colleague Mr Alex Downer--smart Alex Downer--in a number of press releases and elsewhere. They have said that I have had responsibility for EFIC and Austrade for six years. That is not true; I have had it for four years. There is an important difference in that. Senator Bishop should try to remember that fact in some of her public statements in the future because it is important if she keeps on repeating what is totally untrue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Not at all. That is certainly true of some allegations which have been floated about. Senator Bishop adopts a slightly different line from her colleagues in the House of Representatives regarding the separation of EFIC from Austrade, a decision which has been made by the Government. That decision was made essentially on the basis of two factors. The first is experience. EFIC work took up a great deal of Austrade's time. Austrade has a particular function to perform, which is the promotion of exports. EFIC has a particular function to perform which is different, and it is the financing of exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As we diversify exports from this country, EFIC's role becomes more and more associated with the support of manufacturing and service industry exports. As that happens, the important thing for EFIC is to have a close association with manufacturing exporters, which essentially comes through the industry portfolio. What we have done is restore the position to what it was on the basis of the objective, pragmatic experience of the operation of Austrade and EFIC together. We have made those arrangements which we think will work better in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Bishop said that she wanted to be assured that scrutiny will not be lessened because EFIC has become a government business enterprise. There is no change in the status of EFIC in those terms. EFIC has always been a government business enterprise.

<PARA>  That is not a very sensible approach to policy making; it is quite ridiculous. The suggestion a few months ago was that Austrade should be privatised. Members of the Liberal Party who went to Austrade to talk about that came back with the conclusion, on the basis of a little experience, that that should not happen. It is similar, of course, with EFIC because EFIC supplements and complements the private sector. It does not compete with the private sector; it complements it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The suggestion has been made that there should be discussions with the banking and insurance industries to see where the activities of the two overlap.

We had a review of EFIC--its role and its functions--the banking and insurance industries were asked to make representations and their representations were discussed in the course of the review. What did they say? They said, `We are happy with the operations of EFIC as it now is'. Both industries said that. The only thing they really asked for in their written submission, but not in discussion, was the possibility of further government funding being made available to support private sector activity in making loans in support of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  You pay the piper, you call the tune. They would like us to pay the piper--them perhaps--rather than devote money to EFIC. That was not even raised by the banking or the insurance industries in the discussions which took place; it was only raised in the course of a written submission. For Mr Downer to make this latter day suggestion that there should be some discussions with the banking and insurance industries--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Bishop wants to call it a working party. I do not know how they are going to work; they have to talk if they are going to work. There is too much talk, perhaps, but that is what they have to do. They have to talk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Mr Downer's making this latter day suggestion illustrates how out of touch the Opposition is on some of these issues except where it gets nice little leaks from people who have been sacked by Austrade, or people who have not been promoted by Austrade in the course of the McKinsey review, and gets fed a few little bits of scuttlebutt, most of which are wildly inaccurate. It is these issues which set Senator Bishop aflame with a passion for ironing out all these little concerns which she has. I concede they are important, nonetheless, they can become an obsession in the context of an organisation such as EFIC and an organisation such as Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to go back to the debate about The Other Woman--the ship. We have talked about this ad infinitum. Senator Bishop has publicly accused me of misleading Parliament on the basis of a letter which I wrote to her in which I admitted that there had been an interest subsidy of $268,000 in respect of this ship. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wrote to Senator Bishop--I did not have to--and said, `I stand corrected on this issue'. If she had the grace and dignity occasionally to say, `I stand corrected' on some of these issues, then we would have what she seeks--a level playing field in the course of the debate. But Senator Bishop has made that accusation. She could not wait to put my letter into the public arena and repeat it again and again. Poor old Mr Cantor. She persecuted Mr Cantor around the country in pursuit of her private obsession about this issue, and there is no level playing field there. </PARA>
<PARA>  What she has done time and time again, for a person who purports to know something about the processes of government, is to misrepresent the issue in relation to this ship. She talks about $17m of taxpayers' money. She has included in that an $8m loan which is repayable, but still she publicly says, `$17m of taxpayers' money has been lost'. She misrepresents this issue again and again. It might get her name on the front page of Truth or another newspaper like that, or on some sleazy television program, but it will not do her any good in the longer term to go out misrepresenting these facts. </PARA>
<PARA>  Look at the other money which went into this ship. Bounty money went into this ship. Does Senator Bishop approve of bounty payments or not? She should answer the question publicly. Does she approve or not? She will not go out and say anything about that issue. Since 1949 various governments in this country have paid bounties to the shipbuilding industry and have subsidised it. It was in her Party's rotten period of government, throughout the Fraser period and so on, that the shipbuilding industry went downhill, day after day, week after week and there were no exports. </PARA>

Since this Government came to office we have been supporting exports of up to $250m a year from the shipbuilding industry in this country. That never happened during the period of government of those opposite when they paid the bounty at a much higher rate than we pay it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The bounty is paid as a matter of right, in respect of which there is no discretion in either the Minister or anybody else, provided a shipyard is registered. The conditions under which a shipyard is registered are contained in the ships' bounty legislation. There is no discretion in either a Minister or anybody else about that issue, and there should not be. Senator Bishop's line is that a Minister should have his fingers in the honey pot all the time making decisions about whether Mr Cantor was sufficiently moral to make a loan to, and about whether the colour of the eyes of the proprietors of some shipyard or other was sufficiently blue in order for them to get the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA>  Governments cannot be about that, just as governments cannot be about meddling in the day-to-day business of an organisation like Austrade--who it employs and so on. Senator Bishop and her colleagues should look at the Austrade Act. </PARA>

<PARA>  This legislation is supported by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. It is important legislation. It establishes EFIC as a statutory authority with a new board. EFIC will continue to discharge the same sorts of functions as those it has discharged in the past, together with some extra facilitating arrangements which the Government has made for EFIC in relation to the callable capital and one or two other matters which will enable it to improve its services to exports. That is a very important function. </PARA>
<PARA>  This country is increasingly dependent on diversified trade relationships with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Export credit is a most important issue in those countries if Australia is going to do business. Ship credit--credit for the exports of ships--is a most important issue.   No country in the OECD that builds ships does not provide export credit for those ships. Indeed, there is an OECD rate for exports of ships. It is the difference between that rate and interest rates in the United States and Australia which caused the payment of $268,000 in respect of the ship which Senator Bishop is obsessed about--maybe because of its name, maybe because of other things. I commend the legislation to the Senate and I look forward to its speedy passage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. I refer to a report in the Gold Coast Bulletin of 3 October 1991, carrying a comment by Dr Peter Vidgen, the President of the Gold Coast General Practitioners Association, that `the Federal Government is using tax file numbers and confidential Medicare information to harass outspoken Gold Coast doctors in an insidious invasion of privacy'. I also refer to a comment in the same article about a `plan by the Labor Government to nationalise medicine and institutionalise doctors'. Is there any substance to these statements or are they just hogwash? If the latter, is there any record which shows that the Gold Coast Bulletin sought a comment from the relevant Federal Minister or from the Health Insurance Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1650" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My attention has been drawn to an article in the Gold Coast Bulletin headed `Secret files used to harass doctors', in which a Dr Vidgen has made certain claims that Health Insurance Commission investigators have called on doctors in a way which amounts to harassment and have attempted to intimidate the doctors in the area. Of course, there is absolutely no substance to the claims made by Dr Vidgen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There has been no harassing activity by the Health Insurance Commission, certainly not on him as he claims, and there has certainly been no raid by investigators on his premises. There have been some routine visits by Health Insurance Commission medical advisers to doctors on the Gold Coast over recent weeks. These visits generally involve the feedback of information to doctors on the levels of their pathology offering. A visit was made to Dr Vidgen. I am informed that the medical adviser concerned indicated that the meeting was conducted in a very amicable spirit and he thought it ended on a cordial note.</PARA>
<PARA>  The statements made by Dr Vidgen are simply for the purpose of whipping up some political hysteria on the Gold Coast and bear no relation to the reality of the contacts made by the Health Insurance Commission personnel with doctors practising in that area. As to the claim by Federal Australian Medical Association councillor Dr David Weedon that the Labor Party was attempting to nationalise medicine and to institutionalise doctors, as Senator Herron would know, that is completely unconstitutional and could not be undertaken, even were there the political will to do so. The political will does not exist. It is another example of the political hysteria that is being whipped up in that area.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has made it clear that it wants to consult with the profession to develop more appropriate funding arrangements that will assist the profession in improving the quality of primary care. Structural issues such as practice grants are part of that consultation process which is being undertaken. The intention is not to move away from private medical practice but, rather, to change the way that access to that care is funded in a manner which creates appropriate incentives for improving the quality of care.</PARA>
<PARA>  As to Senator Colston's final question about whether the Gold Coast Bulletin had sought a comment from the Health Insurance Commission about this matter, as I understand it, it certainly did not, although ABC Radio Gold Coast and Radio 2GB Sydney did so and were provided, of course, with a rebuttal of those allegations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At best, I think northern Australia has received spasmodic attention from previous Federal governments. It is my belief that this is one of the reasons why the social, economic and political debate in northern Australia is, in comparative terms, behind the rest of Australia. The Prime Minister has been determined to ensure that this would be redressed and that this Government would pay more than lip service to such an important area of our country. I was deliberately appointed as Minister assisting him for northern Australia as a result of that decision. Indeed, it was the first time that a Federal Minister had been appointed with responsibility for northern Australia since the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975. Since that time the Government has been working on an economic development and social justice strategy for northern Australia to guide this and future Federal governments in assessing the potential of this region to our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The strategies are examining the economic structure and performance of the region, its income and wealth, its contribution to the national economy and the level of government services that are delivered in the region. The economic strategy is being conducted by the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis at James Cook University in Townsville. It is exploring the avenues available for further economic development of the north and the means by which government can assist in facilitating this growth. The Government has recognised--indeed, I publicly stated it--that a study of the economic potential of the region would tell us only half of the story without an associated social justice strategy. As many honourable senators will be aware, the development of the strategy was announced in the last Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>  Late last year, along with others, I expressed considerable interest in broadening the North Australian Development Unit's activities which, until now, have been specific to the Department of Social Security, to encompass other portfolio areas of interest to northern Australia. A particular concern was to provide through NADU some cross-portfolio coordination of these issues. After extensive consultation with the Prime Minister and several ministerial colleagues, particularly Senator Graham Richardson, the Minister for Social Security, it was decided to broaden the functions of this unit to enable it to conduct and sponsor research on potential economic and other developments in northern Australia as well as research on social security and program delivery in line with the economic development and social justice strategies of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  This unit will become part of a new capacity on northern development matters within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from the end of January 1992 and will report to me. The unit will be headed from 1 March 1992 for three years by Mr Bill Gray, who is currently Chief Executive Officer of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Mr Gray will become an Associate Secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am particularly pleased at a personal level about this appointment. Mr Gray is not only a competent and proven administrator of some note--I am pleased to see Senator Tambling nodding in assent to that--but has also spent considerable periods of his life in northern Australia. On a personal level, I have known him for more than 20 years. I am delighted that he has been able to accept this appointment. By the way I point out, for Senator Tambling's benefit, if for no-one else's, that Mr Gray intends to reside in Darwin to fulfil this role.</PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the objective is to provide the analytical research base required for decisions on northern development, that is, to provide more direct support for my role in advancing within the Government the interests of northern Australia. As a consequence, we intend to name this new unit the Office of Northern Development. It is the first unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to be established in northern Australia.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is an important matter and some Opposition senators actually want to hear the answer. The EIS does contain a comprehensive analysis of the alternatives that are available to the Government's strategy of constructing the third runway at Sydney Airport and having a staged development for the airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What the environmental impact statement categorically demonstrates is that this strategy is the most cost-effective provision of airport capacity in terms of construction costs per passenger. It is the better strategy in terms of lower airport construction costs in net present value terms than the Badgerys Creek alternative. It produces lesser numbers of people in Sydney seriously affected by noise than a substantial domestic airport being established at Badgerys Creek. The estimate is that, with the third runway, the current number seriously affected by noise in Sydney would be substantially reduced to 26,900, whereas the number seriously affected by noise with Badgerys Creek and no third runway would be 34,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  Other important economic considerations favouring this strategy include: an immediate large scale development at Badgerys Creek would require a minimum of $800m spent in road construction as compared with about $180m for the roads required for this development in Sydney; travel time from the central business district to Badgerys Creek represents a serious penalty of between 40 and 65 minutes over travel time from the central business district to Sydney Airport; and the immediate development--and this is vitally important--of a major domestic facility at Badgerys Creek would require the major airlines to split their operations--there are a number of examples around the world that can be turned to for the results of that--before commercial market demand said they should, and this would involve serious cost penalties to the operations of the major airlines.</PARA>
<PARA>  The environmental impact statement does demonstrate that Badgerys Creek will not be commercially viable until around 2005 to 2010. Consequently, the immediate construction of a regular passenger transport airport at Badgerys Creek would have to be totally funded by the taxpayer, as opposed to the construction of the third runway at Sydney Airport which will be funded by the FAC in a normal commercial manner.</PARA>

That was the Opposition's policy. Not only did the Government move away from that option but, as a result of the environmental impact statement being conducted, it was decided to widen the space between the runways by an additional margin as distinct from the Government's original decision. This will provide quite beneficial operational benefits to the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to the campaign which, understandably, aims to enable Mr James Savage, whose death sentence has been commuted by a United States court to lengthy imprisonment, to serve his sentence in an Australian gaol. Is there any provision for this to be done?  If not, can the Government take any action to make it possible?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1655" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I understand why Senator Zakharov has asked this question. She refers to some understandable reasons which might lead people to think that a person such as Mr James Savage ought to be transferred to serve his prison term in Australia, perhaps on the grounds that he would thereby enjoy the support of the Aboriginal community in Melbourne and that of his natural mother.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of course, there are other considerations which need to be taken into account. One has to recall that this man was found guilty by a jury in Florida of murder in the first degree, robbery with a deadly weapon and sexual battery with great force, with a deadly weapon, against a 57-year-old woman. I think that we can all take some heart in the fact that the Florida Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence. It is certainly in accord with Australia's humanitarian policy that the death penalty ought not to be inflicted, even for such crimes as those.</PARA>
<PARA>  The question of whether a transfer ought to take place is quite another matter. Indeed, under Australian law at the moment there is no provision whatsoever by way of treaty with the United States, or indeed any other country for that matter, to permit the transfer of prisoners from a jurisdiction in which they have been convicted back to Australia. Even if Australia did have such a treaty on international models, it would require the consent of the sentencing country to allow that transfer to take place. It is by no means clear that the State of Florida, for example, would consent to the transfer of a prisoner who has been properly convicted of the crimes that I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA>  Before Australia would even consider entering into such a treaty relationship, Victoria would be required to pass enabling legislation to make it possible to hold such a person in custody in an Australian prison. Otherwise, if Mr Savage, for example, was simply returned to Australia and taken from the airport to a place of custody in Victoria, he could immediately apply for habeas corpus and be released. There is no law enabling him to be held in Australia for an offence for which he has been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment abroad. There would also need to be laws relating to remissions and so on.</PARA>
<PARA>  The bottom line in all of this is, as far as I am aware, that there has been no request made by Mr Savage; there have been various people purporting to speak on his behalf. As I understand it, there has been no formal request made by Mr Savage. Of course, if such a request were to be made, the Government would take it into account in formulating its policy. The policy of the Australian Government at the moment is that there are no such treaties. I believe that I have indicated a very considerable number of legal hurdles which would stand in the way of their being negotiated successfully.</PARA>

<PARA>  In looking at what ACOSS has done specifically, it is worth noting that the committee of which Senator Walters was a member was very keen to have ACOSS appear before it to talk about disability reforms. In fact, those disability reform issues were matters of considerable consultation between the Government and ACOSS as well as between Senate committees and ACOSS. In fact, ACOSS also made a contribution to the Newstart program; it made a strong case for emergency relief funding, which was something the Government agreed to earlier this year. The truth is that on a whole range of issues ACOSS is asked for its opinion and its input is invaluable. The Australian Council of Social Service has participated in some specific monitoring of such items as child support. It is also represented on the Social Security Advisory Council. Therefore, on a whole range of questions ACOSS's input is very important.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Kemp would never cringe at anything that was happening to the poor. I am particularly interested in Dr Hewson's comments about activity testing. It will be noted that Senator Giles in her question asked about that as well. I find it amazing that in the economy at the moment, according to the ANZ job vacancy survey, there are two vacancies for every 100 unemployed. Is it being suggested that the unemployed could be accused in some way of exploiting the system, or that the Government could be accused of having an activity test that in some way is too weak in allowing them to exploit the system? The great criticism that we get from ACOSS and other groups is that we have been far too tough in making sure that the activity testing requirements are being kept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The truth is that all one is seeing is Dr Hewson displaying a total abject lack of understanding of the problems of the unemployed. I might say that a very different speech was made by Senator Alston to the same congress. He must have been very happy the other night when his boss got up and blew it all apart. He would have been the first to cringe.   I also note the comment that the Government has favoured welfare over work. If the Government had been doing that, one could imagine that the welfare lobby might have treated us a bit differently. The Government does not agree with ACOSS every time. We are often the subject of criticism from ACOSS, but we also acknowledge the value of its work. When it comes to our favouring welfare over work, I would point out that in respect of the figure of 1.62 million people--that is, by how much the labour force rose from March 1983 to August 1991--I would suggest that that favours work over welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>  Dr Hewson, aided by his junior shadow Minister in this place, Senator Richard Alston, is considering knocking people off unemployment benefit after nine months. The Liberals have had a conference in Brisbane to knock sole parents off benefit when the child turns six--when it is six years old! When that happens those opposite want to stop the JET scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have seen reports, which appeared in the Bulletin of 1 October, of an interview with John Howard, the shadow Minister for industrial relations. It is an interesting interview. It is the first time in my reading experience in the past couple of years that I have seen John Howard probed behind his glib slogans and asked to answer in detail what his significant slogans are supposed to mean. He is found extremely wanting on both the facts and on the details. The shadow Minister is pretty good on slogans and one-liners, but they do not mean anything about real things in the real world affecting real people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Among the more startling revelations in this interview was that he said that the Opposition would support a minimum wage, expressed as an hourly rate, to prevent exploitation of workers under the Howard version of workplace bargaining. He said that the minimum wage--and the quote is right, as I understand it--would be within a bull's roar of the mean average wage that is paid at present. That sounds good and caring, but it raises a number of questions.</PARA>
<PARA>  For example, the mean average wage that I assume he is referring to is the current average weekly earnings, which stand at around $480 a week. The lowest award rate--and this is an award rate determined by the Industrial Relations Commission based on justice, equity and the substantial merits of the case in this industry--is around $300 a week. In metals, it is $305 a week; in child care, it is $302; and in clothing, it is $303. So if the average weekly earnings are $480 and the lowest award rate is around $300, does this mean that bringing it within a bull's roar is an increase of roughly $180 a week for those workers? Is that what Mr Howard means? If he does mean that, once the wages of those lower paid workers have been brought up to the average, the average will change and get higher, so will we then bring wages up again--and again and again?</PARA>
<PARA>  It may well be that Mr Howard has invented a new system of wage fixation in this country. It may well be that Mr Howard has invented a new form of wage leapfrogging. It prompts one to ask: is Mr Howard an ACTU stooge? Does the ACTU know about this? Does the Confederation of Australian Industry support what Mr Howard says? Or does Mr Howard mean something much more sinister than what those obvious, literal translations of his words indicate?  Does it mean, for example, that $300 a week is where the minimum wage will be set, and that bringing the minimum wage within a bull's roar of the mean average means that wages in this country will be depressed to the minimum level in order to lower real income levels across the board? Is that what the minimum wage means? I look forward to some clarification on this matter by Mr Howard because certainly wages policy, as articulated by him as an expression of policy on a very important part of the economic policy, is unintelligible at the present time.</PARA>

<PARA>  I believe that the EIS will do that--indeed, I believe that that study will act as a benchmark not simply in respect of Sydney Airport but in respect of, for example, the analysis to be conducted of multi-airport systems internationally. It will stand up as an investigation of excellence in terms of environmental studies into airport construction. I believe that the one element of that examination that is subject to any scrutiny is the degree of community consultation which the FAC provided, and the Government assisted with that extra resource.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Land Transport has provided me with the following response to Senator Kernot's question. The National Rail Freight Corporation has been established by the Commonwealth and the mainland States, except South Australia, to operate all interstate rail freight operations under a single management structure. South Australia supports the Corporation and proposes to sign the agreement after a number of issues under its railway transfer agreement with the Commonwealth are resolved through bilateral negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The NRC will operate under the provisions of the Companies Code as a strictly commercial corporation at arm's length from government, and will be subject to the laws of the Commonwealth and relevant States on the same basis as any private company. It is expected to commence operations in the new year, beginning with marketing and terminal operations. Other functions will be transferred progressively from other rail systems.</PARA>
<PARA>  The NRC will be responsible for its capital investment program and investment in specific corridors, such as the Melbourne-Adelaide line. This will be undertaken, again, on a fully commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  The NRC's charter is to eliminate losses on interstate freight operations within three years and to become profitable within five years. No decision on standardising Melbourne-Adelaide has yet been taken by the NRC. In fact, the Corporation is holding its inaugural board meeting today. Should the NRC decide to proceed with this option, it would only do so if it were consistent with the NRC's charter to eliminate its current losses. On this basis, the benefits of any decision to standardise this rail link would flow to all Australians who currently bear the cost of subsidising interstate rail freight operations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the unanimous decision of the democratically elected Parliament of Croatia last night to activate the declaration of independence made on 25 June. Was this decision taken in face of the continued threats to democracy and peace, culminating in the bombing of the Presidential Offices which are adjacent to the parliamentary building in Zagreb, these bombings having been directed by the Yugoslav high command who are members of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia? What was meant by the Prime Minister's statement last night to cheering Croatian demonstrators here in Canberra that the Australian Government will recognise the independence of Croatia `as soon as we can'? What is preventing that recognition now? When will that recognition take place so as to give a clear message to the hardline Stalinists in the Yugoslav high command that Australia rejects the Maoist notion that power grows out of the barrel of a gun?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We in Australia and the Government accept that the desire for independence by the people of Croatia, and Slovenia for that matter as well, has been popularly and democratically expressed. As the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions, not just last night, Australia will be among the first to recognise Croatia and Slovenia when the conditions are right; as soon as we can, in other words. What is constraining us in that respect is essentially two considerations: one is the need to satisfy ourselves that the formal international criteria for recognition are in fact satisfied, and there is a very real question, certainly so far as Croatia is concerned, on the issue of effective control of the territory in question by the government in question. It is very difficult to argue that there is such effective control in the particular military environment that Senator Harradine has just drawn attention to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  More than that, there is a concern not to go down the path of premature recognition to the extent that this, or in circumstances where this, would in fact prejudice the achievement of a comprehensive settlement of the whole sorry situation in Yugoslavia. That is very much the view that is being taken at the moment by the countries of Europe, with which we are, of course, in close consultation on this issue and with many of the foreign Ministers with whom I have had recent opportunities to talk in both Europe and New York. It is the view that is being taken in North America by the United States and by Canada. It is generally a very widespread perception that as horrifying as the conflict has become, as urgently as we all want to see it resolved, there is no basis for making the assumption that a resolution would be any faster or any more satisfactory were we to jump into recognition.</PARA>
<PARA>  We will have regard to the various considerations that I have mentioned, just as was the case with the Baltic states, as soon as we are satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, as soon as it is possible to do so. As soon as the modicum of conditions that I have identified are satisfied, we will be among the first to recognise the entities in question as sovereign, independent countries. It is not time to do so now.</PARA>
<PARA>   As to the larger question that Senator Harradine has raised about the conditions that are at work producing the conflict that we are witnessing, whether it is an ideological conflict or whether, as rather more people would want to characterise it, it is one involving ancient, nationalist and ethnic enmities, that is an issue I do not think it is necessary to go into on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA>  Similarly, as I said yesterday, while overwhelmingly the concern of the international community at the moment points to the activities of the JNA and, in effect, the Serbian side of the argument, it is not easy to say that has always been the case with every single one of the breaches of the cease-fire or the acts of gross misbehaviour that have occurred during this unhappy conflict. It is not an easy situation in which to cast one-sided blame. Our hope is simply that good sense, moderation and reason will prevail, that all sides will appreciate that this is a conflict which can only be resolved by negotiation, not `out of the barrel of the gun' as Senator Harradine says, and that a negotiated peace that recognises these emerging realities on the ground will certainly be achievable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think Senator Jones is probably principally referring to a Four Corners report recently which covered investment in Australian golf courses and resorts by allegedly disreputable Japanese people and corporations. It appears that the report correctly stated that a number of the Japanese businessmen who have been charged in Japan for company and share market offences have been involved in such investments, but these were made prior to any charges being laid. Nevertheless, the question of money laundering of the proceeds of crime into Australian real estate and tourist developments is a matter which the Government takes very seriously indeed. For that reason, the Australian Federal Police's national intelligence division is compiling a report on the situation. I had discussions as late as yesterday with the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, particularly in relation to the money laundering aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But there are some difficulties which ought to be understood. The first is that the national police agency in Japan is only one agency. There are 47 prefectorial police forces operating autonomously from the national police agency. There is no central intelligence base and the national police agency in Japan has very little of the intelligence held by the prefectorial police or other agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>  Japan also has very strict privacy laws which control the exchange of information; even the information exchanged through Interpol is severely limited. No information will be released by Japan unless there is a specific offence under investigation and that offence exists in Japanese legislation as well. As I am advised that money laundering is not an offence under Japanese legislation, we have some difficulty in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA>  Since February this year the Federal Police has used its liaison officer in Honolulu to liaise with the Japanese National Police Agency. This is relevant because the United States law enforcement agencies have long-established networks of cooperation with Japanese law enforcement agencies based in Hawaii in relation to the overseas activities of the Yakuza. I believe that that sort of comprehensive knowledge possessed by the United States law enforcement authorities as to the penetration of Japanese criminal enterprises overseas is a very useful network into which the Australian Federal Police do tap.</PARA>
<PARA>  Representatives of the Federal Police have attended a number of conferences in Japan on drugs and organised crime, the last one being the Third Conference on Organised Crime in 1990. In November this year the Assistant Commissioner, Investigations, Mr Ian Broomby, will be attending a Tokyo conference on organised crime. I have asked him to ensure that our very real concern about these matters is conveyed to the Japanese authorities and to pursue every possibility of ensuring that current, relevant, timely advice is available to the Australian Federal Police so that we can deal with the phenomenon of alleged money laundering into Australian tourist developments.</PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to the welcome news on page 1 of the Veterans' Review Board annual report which shows that the number of outstanding applications has been reduced by some 15.4 per cent in the last year. However, the average projected wait for hearing is still 10.9 weeks. While this can be compared with the previous peak of 37.2 weeks in 1986, it is clearly still too long. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this context, I turn to page 13 of the report which states that, where material has not been provided by the applicant within two years, the principal member of the board may throw out an application after giving notice that that material needs to be furnished within 28 days. I believe that that is a reasonable provision which should further reduce the number of outstanding applications. </PARA>
<PARA>  On page 18 of the report, under the heading `Section 31 Reviews' there is a suggestion which I believe the Government should consider favourably. The report states that the Repatriation Commission should adopt a policy which would mean that a claim could be conceded by the Commission before the board and that a section 31 review would be the best mechanism for that. I commend this recommendation to the Government and suggest that appropriate steps be taken to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note that the report, which is extremely informative and well put together, also adverts to the avenues of appeal which are open to applicants--the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Ombudsman. It indicates that the Veterans' Review Board is to be congratulated for the work it is doing on behalf of veterans and that, with the exception of the recommendation that I have pointed to, the provisions under which it operates are adequate at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I also wish to speak on the Veterans' Review Board annual report. Twelve months ago when I spoke to the previous report, one of the points I highlighted concerned the question of advocacy at the Board. I was concerned that one of the reasons for delay at the VRB was the inability of advocates to prepare cases quickly enough. I said that the Government, in its response to the Veterans' Entitlements Act monitoring committee reports, had decided that there was no need to increase the resources available to returned service organisations in order to improve their advocacy capacity. This time last year, I urged the Government to look again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am therefore very disappointed to find that there are again criticisms in this report that advocacy organisations and individual advocates are unable to cope with their workload and that there are still long delays before their clients can appear. In other words, nothing much has changed since this time last year. In fact, the Board claimed that 211 hearings which were postponed on the actual day of the hearing were equivalent to a panel losing 14 weeks of hearing. That has to be addressed. I again strongly urge the Government to look carefully at improving the level of assistance to advocates and their organisations so they are better able to meet the capacity of the Board to hear cases. It will be unforgivable if next year on this same occasion I am again quoting directly from the report on a problem that has been around for an unacceptably long time. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also want to look at the eligibility appeals from the decisions of the Repatriation Commission because we find that nearly a quarter of the decisions at the Commission level were set aside at the VRB and a pension was granted. Across Australia, in assessment cases, a remarkable 54.5 per cent of the decisions of the Repatriation Commission were overturned and the rate of pension increased. In Queensland and South Australia the percentages were over 60 per cent and in Western Australia the figure was an incredible 72.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Estimates committee hearings we talked about this and it was clear that it was a major problem getting all of the relevant information to the primary decision maker at the Repatriation Commission. We have had a Repatriation Commission for decades and we still do not have the system right. I think veterans have a lack of confidence in the system. Some decisions are partly rejected and some are delayed. But whatever happens, the judgment of the Repatriation Commission has been found wanting. The Government has to get all of the information to the Repatriation Commission so that it can make its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  I find it absolutely incredible that this whole issue has not been given urgent attention by the Government, which knows only too well the dissatisfaction of veterans with the system. One can only speculate that it suits the Government to leave this system in place, because one unfortunate result is that many veterans do not proceed to appeal after rejection of their initial claim. They tell me that they have not claimed their entitlements all these years and then feel a great sense of hurt and rejection when they finally make a claim in their old age and it is refused. They go through a great deal of stress in this process. That is often forgotten in a system which has become slow, bureaucratic, legalistic and adversarial, and which is very costly to this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Repatriation Commission has conceded that the cost of the determining system and the time taken to process claims are of real concern to veterans. It is a wonder that it is not of concern to the Commission and to the Government. It is not surprising that veterans now believe that the failure to act by the Government is an indication of its lack of concern for veterans and its determination to wind back their compensation, be it in the pensions and benefits area or in the health care and hospitals area. This report raises issues which are a damning indictment of the stewardship of the Federal Government in the care of veterans. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise today to comment on the annual report for 1991 of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, a relatively new body to the economic and social life of this country and to the industry. Unfortunately, the Government has not provided nearly enough resources to enable this new body, capably led by Mr Richard Beetham, to execute its responsibilities in the timely manner required of a service delivery agency of the Commonwealth. However, this lack of resources should not in any way diminish the importance of this new body because it will continue to play a significant economic and social role in Australia, particularly in an environment of potential growth for the insurance and life insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw to the Senate's attention two primary responsibilities of the Commission. Firstly, it has to supervise insurance companies and brokers and superannuation funds in accordance with the requirements of the relevant legislation and, secondly, it has to consider issues of relevance to the insurance and superannuation industries as well as to consumers and beneficiaries of services provided by those industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Labor Government has announced its plans of bringing the annual contributions of the everyday workers' salaries or wages to something like 9 per cent or above by the end of the decade so that superannuation will be by way of future savings for Australia. Unfortunately, the Government has failed to acknowledge a number of problems inherent in this approach. Businesses see this as another type of payroll tax, another impediment to employment and another significant cost to jobs and industry. There are special problems that I do not think have been adequately addressed in developing this approach. There are special problems for casual employees, itinerants and even married women, particularly in their capacity to accumulate adequate funds for a meaningful retirement benefit without losing significant benefits under health care card and pharmaceutical arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, superannuation has now been seen by this Government as a very convenient vehicle for adding significantly to the revenues of government. All too readily, the changes in the last few years have been seen as golden eggs in terms of the potential for revenue collection. They form and are centred basically around the need, as far as the Government is concerned, to get additional revenue from this form of saving. I believe that is regrettable. It is regrettable that we have an entry fee of 15 per cent, which means that for every $100 invested effectively 15 per cent is potentially coming off that investment. So the available amount for investment is diminishing. I believe that we should have a greater degree of flexibility in the range of savings that can be made through insurance plans. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other big problem I see is the very heavy charges made by the life insurance industry in the management of those funds and its impact on accumulated savings, particularly for people such as married women or casual employees. People who move from job to job sometimes find that they are contributing, for example, to a number of casual employee superannuation funds. The companies concerned are deducting portions of their incomes perhaps to put them towards life benefit funds. However, in a few years, the various costs will mean that the investments come back to having a nil value. So as a means of saving for retirement for certain people in our society, I do not believe that these schemes are a very efficient mechanism. The Government should be looking at other vehicles such as savings plans and saving through other avenues in the insurance area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amount invested in superannuation over the years illustrates the growing importance of it. In 1980, total investments in the industry totalled $18 billion. They are estimated to be $130 billion this year with the possibility of reaching $600 billion in another 10 years. Not only management but also prudential standards will be required to make sure that we do not have too many entrepreneurs entering this industry with a view to executing fraud and other offences.

<PARA>  Tomorrow, the Senate will be debating a package of Bills relating to the insurance and superannuation industry, including two Bills that seek to revise and improve in a major way the prudential and supervisory arrangements relating to the superannuation and insurance industry. I will not prejudge that debate here, but I put on the record the importance that I believe attaches to certain threshold questions which we as a parliament and a nation need to address as we move through the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite clear that there will be a great increase in the number of people of retiring age through the 1990s, both in absolute terms and relative to the size of the total population. So the question of how that will be paid for is of great importance. It cuts right across the whole spread of government economic policy, social policy and attitudes within the community towards the provision of care and services for retired people, particularly with regard to the income on which they will live in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is equally clear that the public purse will not be able to sustain the increase in the whole community's retirement income requirements;  so we will have to find ways of increasing the provision of people's own savings for their retirement. In that context, superannuation has had increasing attention. That is right and proper and will continue to be the case. But we ought not to overlook certain things. We ought to be looking at how we can raise the total level of savings in our nation as a whole, because it is only through increasing the total level of savings that we will have the wherewithal to provide for these additional retirement income requirements from either the public or private purse. </PARA>
<PARA>  Within that we have to look at the various forms of savings and the treatment accorded through taxation and other treatments to those savings elements. As Senator Watson said, superannuation is a major element which has increased from $18 billion to $130 billion in the last decade or so, and is suggested by some to increase to as much as $600 billion in the course of this decade, much of it under the control of industry superannuation funds. That raises various questions concerning the fiduciary interests of trustees, their balance of interests and the possible conflicts of interest. Therefore, the role of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in its various supervisory and supervision requirements is of the greatest importance. </PARA>
<PARA>  I look forward to seeing much more attention given by the Parliament to the work of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I congratulate the Commission on the work it has done to date. I am sure that there is much more that we will have to address in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to speak to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission annual report and make some comments in a similar vein to those of Senator Short. The insurance and superannuation industries are growing rapidly in Australia--the total assets under management reached $198 billion by June 1991--and the ISC oversees these industries and recovers its administrative costs by way of levies on industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is a multitude of issues before the ISC and the Government, especially in the area of superannuation. There are totally inadequate prudential standards governing a major sector of our national savings. We believe that the Government has made almost no progress in this area. Similarly, the current rules regarding vesting and preservation of benefits are totally inadequate, although the Government has made some ambiguous statements about this area in the Budget. In contrast, the Budget contained a reasonably detailed statement on the proposed tightening of disclosure requirements by superannuation funds. Whilst not fully endorsing these proposals, I believe that they are certainly heading in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many other areas are in need of reform. The Government's secretive and non-consultative decision-making style in this area led the Australian Democrats to push successfully for the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. There are huge inequities in the tax benefits which arise to members of superannuation funds. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) concedes that the current arrangements are inequitable but says it is too difficult to make them fair. </PARA>
<PARA>  I find that extremely hard to believe and, quite frankly, it is a disgrace for a Labor Treasurer to make such a claim. The Regal and Occidental scandal has again focused our attention on the need for the overhaul of the life insurance legislation. A review of regulatory arrangements has been conducted by the ISC for years. Some minimum capital provisions and pre-vetting arrangements have been announced because of the scandal. Yet we still have no definitive position for life insurance reform, and the tabling of this report is an appropriate time to ask:  when will this emerge?</PARA>
<PARA>  On development capital, Australians are very innovative and resourceful in many areas. Over the years we have been world leaders in research in some fields, yet we lack the patient capital to invest in the development phase of these innovative ideas and inventions. Superannuation is a long term savings vehicle and is hence perfect to provide some of this patient capital, which everybody agrees is needed but which nobody in Australia is yet willing to provide. The free market approach has not worked in this area, hence some sort of Government action is needed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Button has recognised this. Yet his preferred method, that of persuasion, which I agree is preferable if it is successful, has failed on this occasion. Consequently, some sort of public intervention is necessary. Bank deregulation was disastrous. Let us not make the same mistake with Australia's retirement income policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I join the debate on the Insurance and Superannuation Commission annual report because I want to comment on the scandal of the Occidental and Regal life insurance companies takeovers. As the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In September 1990 during the aborted sale of Occidental Life and Regal Life there was an apparent misappropriation of policyowners' funds. The consequent reduction in statutory fund assets was of sufficient concern for the Commissioner to order an investigation into both the life companies in accordance with section 55 of the Life Insurance Act and, following that investigation, to apply directions to the companies to cease writing new business and to stop paying surrender values. The Commissioner also applied to the Federal Court for the appointment of a Judicial Manager as provided for in Part III, Division 8 of the Act. Mr Richard J Grellman of KPMG Peat Marwick was appointed Judicial Manager on 7 November 1990 and is presently in control of the companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Judicial Manager is charged with reporting to the Court on the course of action most advantageous to the general interests of the policy holders. On 21 January 1991 he submitted an interim report which concluded that there is a potential significant deficiency in the major statutory funds of the companies, although the amount of any shortfall would be dependent on the outcome of various legal and other proceedings. He recommended that as the solvency status of the companies would take considerable time to clarify, the companies should remain under judicial management for the time being. At this stage the Judicial Manager is in control of the companies and is still assessing the amount of the shortfall, if any. He has instigated legal proceedings to recover policy owners' funds lost as a consequence of the aborted sale and is endeavouring to recover investments that are outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make with some vigour is that, while the Government is introducing some legislation on this matter, Mr Grellman's report and his comments in that report make it absolutely clear that everything that went wrong at Occidental, and similarly at Regal, was covered by existing legislation that was breached and for which stringent penalties are provided in the legislation as it now stands. </PARA>
<PARA>  This took place in September 1990. It is now October 1991 and the official manager established that everything that went wrong was covered by existing legislation. Where are the prosecutions for the people responsible for the breaches of the law?  Why are people who are alleged to have been involved in this fraud walking the streets instead of being in gaol?  Why has the money stolen not yet been recovered?</PARA>
<PARA>  The problem is that Occidental is only one of a number of corporate fraud cases in Australia which loudly call out for severe punishment of those responsible. Until such punishment is handed out, and quickly, the dishonest people in our business community will continue to cheat and steal. No volume of legislation, new or old, let alone, regrettably, voluntary codes of ethics, will prevent this happening. But at least some of it will be prevented if it is clearly seen by all that the guilty are quickly and severely punished and that they will suffer financially as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned that we are now approaching the issue in this chamber with a new set of laws and regulations as though the existing legislation did not cover these frauds. According to Mr Grellman's report, there are clear breaches of existing legislation. Let us not be confused or diverted from the fact that under that legislation there should be prosecutions. There should have been prosecutions long before this. Regrettably, I do not believe that the Commission is acting in the best interests of Australian policyholders by not pursuing with the greatest expedition the charges that must be laid against people who have breached existing laws. The introduction of new laws does not in any way detract from the capacity to proceed, on the evidence at least given by Mr Grellman, against the guilty people. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the Auditor-General's report on the Australian National Audit Office, I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate a significant disagreement that has now emerged between the Audit Office and the Government which requires early settlement. The Auditor-General, as the servant of the Parliament and, through the Parliament, the people of Australia, has to ensure that public money is spent properly and that departments and organisations and other bodies of the Government behave in a responsible way and within the law in the collection and spending of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, the Government is apparently disagreeing with the Auditor-General about some significant elements of the way in which the Audit Act should be reformed and how the role of the Auditor-General should be protected from the activities of government. In some instances, those activities appear to be aimed at limiting the capacity of the Auditor-General to provide to this Parliament the full and proper reports that this Parliament requires. As the Auditor-General says in the foreword to his report:</PARA>
<PARA>The year saw only limited progress in the development of the new Auditor-General Act to replace the Audit Act 1901. The new Act may not be in operation until 1 July 1993--some four years after the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended its development. This is most unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the proposed Act does not include the most important of the reforms recommended. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He discusses those reforms later in the report. On the question of efficiency audits, the Attorney-General notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any objective appraisal of current achievements in creating the basis for long term benefits to the Parliament through the ANAO can show only limited results because action to achieve the fundamental reforms proposed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its 1989 Report on Reform of the Australian Audit Office is still needed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General is stressing here that we will get only limited results because of the failure of the Government to proceed, as it should have proceeded long ago, with the reforms required in the Audit Act. Some problems remain with the type of mandate the Audit Office should have. The Auditor-General says in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the ANAO's efforts in 1990-91 have gone some way to address the call from all recent external reviews for major increases in ANAO efficiency auditing activity, the return of the Government Business Enterprise mandate to the ANAO has been accomplished by the qualification that efficiency audits may only be carried out at the request of the relevant Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, appropriate inquiries into the Government's organisations can be done only if the Government feels it is appropriate for it to be done. The Auditor-General is acting on behalf of the people, not of the `management'. It is exactly the same situation with the auditor of a public company. The auditor of a public company reports and examines on behalf of the shareholders, not on behalf of the management. The Auditor-General says that efficiency audits may be carried out only at the request of the relevant Minister. He further says:</PARA>
<PARA>This constitutes, in effect, a mandate reduction and will require detailed monitoring on our part of the effectiveness of other performance and accountability mechanisms in place. Any problems arising may require me to consider this restriction more closely. </PARA>
<PARA>He also notes that the Government appears to have some kind of policy of limiting the scope of the Auditor, because in the matters of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Corporation legislation the Senate had to amend legislation to ensure his mandate. This revealed the extent to which the Auditor-General and the Government appear to be on a collision course. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of this I can no longer support the exercise of ministerial discretion in granting choice of auditor. The shareholder, i.e. the Parliament, should be able to indicate its wishes in this matter (as it did for the AWRC and AWC). It is a matter of deep concern that the proposed Auditor-General's Act, which would provide a long term framework for Parliament's approval, is still awaited. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the proposed Auditor-General Act should be changed to provide more effective assurance of the Auditor-General's mandate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition would totally support that view and endorse the Auditor-General's concerns. The Auditor-General also states that the Australian National Audit Office needs to operate as a statutory authority. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of an effective public sector audit office in supporting accountability to the Parliament, to Ministers and to Boards is well recognised. However, if unaddressed, existing constraints on the ANAO's capacity to manage itself will heighten the risk that those served by the ANAO will receive less assurance and protection than they should have. Recent experiences in the private sector and some areas of State Government administration are indeed a warning of the dangers that exist. The Commonwealth administration appears to believe it is immune. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has seen the disasters that have taken place in State Labor administrations around this country where multimillions of dollars of taxpayers' moneys have gone down the gurgler in badly audited, incompetently run and disgracefully managed--in terms of governmental management--organisations. This Government is still shackling the Auditor-General and, as the Auditor-General says, `The Commonwealth administration appears to believe it is immune' from the very same things that have damaged so many State governments. The Auditor-General's report needs to be seriously looked at. I agree with the Auditor-General's comment that the assurance required by the Parliament about the performance of a public sector organisation reflects public accountability and is a higher obligation than that placed on private sector auditors. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Senate knows, there are multimillions of dollars of funds involved in many of these governmental organisations and accountability is absolutely vital. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Parliamentary concerns and interests are of central importance in the planning of the audit work program and, therefore, the Auditor-General's decisions on his work program take into account the views of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt in my mind that the view of the Parliament is clearly that the Auditor-General should have greater capacity to report in an unfettered way to this Parliament. I conclude by requesting the Government to hasten this process. The failure to proceed with this legislation so far is of major concern. As the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>On 30 November 1990--</PARA>
<PARA>almost 12 months ago--</PARA>
<PARA>the Department advised that its aim was to have the drafting instructions for the legislative package to replace the Audit Act. . . completed in sufficient time to permit the legislation to be introduced into Parliament in the 1991 Budget sittings, with a proposed commencement date of 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage we have seen no indications that that legislation will come forward. As the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the introduction of the legislation into the Parliament in the 1991 Budget sitting and the commencement date of 1 July 1992 appear unlikely to be achieved unless the Government and the Parliament increase their priority in the legislative tabling program. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as the Opposition is concerned, we would be very keen to see that legislation come forward. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA>If the legislative package is not included in the 1991 Budget sitting of Parliament, an eventuality that is becoming more and more certain, then the next likely commencement date for the legislation would be 1 July 1993--some four years after the JCPA reported. This is an extraordinary delay for legislation that sets the revised accountability principles for the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA>I say amen to all that. I urge the Government to accept the Auditor-General's strong recommendations and to recognise that his views have generated a great degree of concern within the Opposition about the Government's willingness and enthusiasm to allow itself to be subject to the sort of scrutiny that it requires. I urge the Government to take speedy action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I also want to comment briefly on the annual report of the Australian National Audit Office. I congratulate the Auditor-General and his staff on the production of this report, which I think is an excellent, very comprehensive and informative document, although we have had only a couple of hours in which to look at it. It will certainly bear very careful further consideration because the audit function goes very much to the core of efficiency and propriety in terms of the operations of a parliamentary democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Audit Office runs a very lean operation. Its resources are limited. It carries out a major role for us all. In the past 12 months and beyond it has undertaken a very heavy program. In recent years it has had added the role of efficiency auditing on top of its more traditional roles of performance auditing and the auditing of financial statements. Its complexity of work has also increased greatly over recent years as the complexity of government has increased and as the operations of government have become more commercialised in various areas, therefore requiring a different form and technique of auditing and a different role for the Auditor-General than has perhaps been the case in the past. I congratulate the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, in particular, and his staff on what I believe has been an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following up some of Senator Michael Baume's comments, which were very apt, the Auditor-General has done that job under extremely difficult circumstances. I too refer to the delay in the proposed new legislation to replace the existing Audit Act--legislation which will comprise, as I understand it, three or four new Acts which were meant to be introduced this year so that they could be properly debated and actually operative from 1 July 1992. In any event, that would have been a very long delay since the original decisions were made to go down this new legislative path. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would have to say that Senator Baume's concern and the Auditor-General's concern about the extraordinary push out of the starting date to 1 July 1993 were confirmed by the Government in the Senate Estimates Committee hearings just a few days ago. Senator McMullan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, confirmed to Senate Estimates Committee A that the legislation would not be operative until 1 July 1993 and that this Parliament will not be seeing the legislation in draft form probably until late in the autumn session of 1992. It will take that amount of time to go through all the necessary processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Certainly, the Hawke Government will escape the added scrutiny that will be imposed as a result of these new provisions, but I can assure Senator Baume and the Senate as a whole that that does not mean that its performance will escape very intense scrutiny when it is thrown out and replaced by a coalition government at some stage in the next 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The delay does pose very major problems. It is intended that, as a fundamental part of the Audit Act reform process, the mandate of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office will be made much clearer than is now the case. The problem that the Auditor-General now faces is that the Government has given no firm direction to the Audit Office in terms of its mandate. It has left it being neither fish nor fowl and in a most confused and uncertain situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  That has already had some major implications. We saw some earlier this year, the Senate will recall, over the question of whether the Audit Office would have a role in auditing the functions of the revised organisations associated with the wool industry. We had the situation where the drafting of the legislation relating to the wool industry--very important legislation concerning, potentially, $3 billion-plus of taxpayers' funds lined up by way of guarantees and so on--did not give the Audit Office the prime role in auditing those new wool industry organisations. It was only as a result of an extraordinary and very courageous act by the Auditor-General in bringing to the attention of the Parliament his concern at that situation that the Opposition--I am pleased to say with the support of the Australian Democrats--was able to change the legislation to give the Auditor-General an unequivocal mandate in relation to that wool industry auditing. </PARA>
<PARA>  So long as the new legislation remains a figment of our imagination--which is all it is at the moment--the uncertainty and the confusion will continue, and the prospect of something seriously going wrong will continue because the Auditor-General does not have the mandate and the clarity in relation to his mandate that should exist. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his report the Auditor-General draws attention to the problems as a result of the delay in the introduction of the new legislation. I urge the Government to have another look at this matter because it has obviously pushed the question of the audit function down far too low in its order of priorities. It is a matter that should have almost top priority for the Government. These delays, which now appear certain to occur in the introduction of that legislation, would be unnecessary if the Government were to reorder its priorities. I would strongly urge it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter which is not touched on--from the consideration I have been able to give the report up to date--but which I believe the Parliament needs to address more closely is just where the Auditor-General and the Audit Office ought to fit into the whole structure of our parliamentary democracy. In chapter 2 of his report, the Auditor-General talks about the relations between the Audit Office and the Parliament. He makes some important points there but he does not go on to raise the really important issue of where the Audit Office should lie. At the moment it lies within executive government but the statutory responsibility of the Auditor-General is to report to the Parliament. In many respects it can be argued that the Auditor-General ought to be and is the servant of the Parliament; not just part of the executive government and subject to the whims left open to it at the behest of the executive government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have not yet given sufficient attention to this very important question of whether the Audit Office and the Office of the Auditor-General ought to be located within the Parliament. That is something we need to address. The Public Accounts Committee is also of that mind. In America, as I understand it, the Audit Office is located within the structure of the Congress or the Parliament and is not a creature of executive government. Subject to further consideration, that is something which would be highly desirable in this nation as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  I end where I began:  the role of the Audit Office and the Auditor-General is quite crucial to the efficient functioning of a parliamentary democracy. It is one of the major safeguards that any parliamentary democracy can have around it. It needs to be protected and preserved at all costs. The process is helped considerably with the consideration of this year's annual report by the Parliament and also, hopefully, a consideration by the wider community about the role of the Audit Office and its functions. I congratulate the Auditor-General on what he has done to publicise these very important matters. I hope that we as a Senate and the Parliament as a whole will build on the report and give the function and role of the Audit Office the attention it deserves if we are to preserve our parliamentary institutions and our democratic institutions in the way I know we all wish to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to continue the supportive comments made by my Liberal Party colleagues Senators Michael Baume and Short on the role and important work of the Australian National Audit Office; particularly those comments arising from the ANAOs annual report for 1990-91, which has just been presented to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The extent of the importance, and the degree of frustration, of this public office is adequately portrayed by the photograph at the beginning of this report of the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor. The report reflects and portrays Mr Taylor's hard and conscientious effort in ensuring that the Auditor-General's office maintains the integrity, economy, efficiency and cost effectiveness of the operations of the Commonwealth public sector organisations. But, unfortunately, as that report shows, it is certainly in an environment of limited Government support through both resources and an inadequate legislative mandate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Auditor-General's work is enacted not without a considerable degree of frustration and hindrance. In fact, the office of the Auditor-General is hampered by the very Act under which it operates, assented to in 1901, which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has acknowledged needs to be changed and replaced by several other Acts, because times have changed and a new Audit Act is needed. I therefore agree with the Auditor-General's call within this report for a new Act to be passed expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the Government's initial enthusiasm to replace the 1901 Audit Act with a financial administration Act, an audit Act and at least one other Act, I am sorry to say that more than four years will have elapsed before this Parliament sees the introduction of that legislation. This reflects the low priority given by this Government to the important role of stewardship and independent evaluation that the Auditor-General brings not only to the Parliament but also to the Executive, to the boards of various agencies and GBEs, to the management and to the public in assessing the financial statements, the levels of internal controls and the degree of stewardship that operate within public sector agencies. I call upon the present Government to re-examine these needs and, in particular, the recommendations outlined in chapter 5.3 of this report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problems of mandate under which the Auditor-General's office works are also highlighted. For the benefit of this chamber I reiterate these comments:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the ANAO's efforts in 1990-91 have gone some way to address the call for all recent external reviews for major increases in ANAO efficiency auditing activity, the return of the Government Business Enterprise mandate to the ANAO has been accomplished by the qualification that efficiency audits may only be carried out at the request of the relevant Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>That is indeed unfortunate. I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the continued comments, which state:</PARA>
<PARA>This constitutes, in effect, a mandate reduction and will require detailed monitoring on our part of the effectiveness of other performance and accountability mechanisms in place. Any problems arising may require me to consider this restriction more closely. </PARA>
<PARA>I therefore strongly urge the Senate to note this unfortunate reduction in mandate. The Auditor-General's role should at all times be held in the utmost respect. He should be allowed to investigate wherever he considers necessary. There should be no reduction in mandate. His office is an effective way of keeping the public sector accountable, and this should not be hindered in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that, in the corporate world during the 1980s, we saw Australian corporations through their various managements seek to do away with many of the internal controls, internal audit functions and staff associated with those important stewardship roles, with the result that we saw a corporate cowboy image develop in that environment. Despite pressures within the public sector to provide for such degrees of freedom in the public sector, through such agencies as the Public Accounts Committee and comments by various members in the House of Representatives and honourable senators in this chamber, we continue to press very strongly for adequate manning for internal audits to ensure that we have a continued high level of internal control mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is therefore a tribute to the Office of the Auditor-General, and previous Auditors-General, that we have not seen lapses in stewardship; we have not seen the loss of public funds in the public sector in the same way that money has been dissipated wantonly, recklessly and negligently in the private sector. I think this alone is sufficient testament to ensure that the Australian National Audit Office has the widest field of mandate so far as the public purse is concerned. I refer to the `public purse' as being where the Commonwealth Government effectively has oversight or guarantee, even though it might not make annual appropriations to particular government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I pay tribute to the Australian National Audit Office for the close role that it has with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am Vice-Chairman. I would also like to pay tribute to the calibre of staff who come to our Joint Committee through the Australian National Audit Office. I believe that they have continued to add to the high level and quality of the reports prepared by the JCPA. Parliamentary committees, through their examinations of Auditor-General's reports, play a crucial role in the public accountability process. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report that has been presented today is but one of the many mechanisms whereby this accountability is acknowledged and communicated to the Parliament. This role, I believe, is enhanced by the fact that the Auditor-General looks to the Parliament. He looks to the committees and to individual senators and members for specific direction in the programming, planning and execution of audits. He always keeps the parliamentary interest closely at hand. </PARA>
<PARA>  I again pay tribute to the support given not only by the Australian National Audit Office in providing seconded officers to the Committee, but also by the officers of the Australian National Audit Office who frequently attend the hearings of the Joint Committee in their capacity as observers and witnesses and who provided background papers and other information which is vital to our Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to some of that help, I refer specifically to the Department of Defence project, the annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities, the social responsibility of statutory authorities and government business enterprises, the research and development project, the business migration program and the control of visitor entry. Again, I pay tribute not only to those staff who were employed specifically on those functions but also to the wider role of advice that has been given from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA>  More importantly, the existence of the Auditor-General's Office and the large number of detailed reports issued by his office have allowed the Joint Committee to undertake a number of specific inquiries. There are 10 inquiries listed in the report and I refer the chamber to them. </PARA>
<PARA>  This new Act, which we are hoping will come in the not-too-distant future, should affirm that the Auditor-General is the independent external auditor of the Executive and, as such, has statutory responsibilities to report to the Parliament. I remind the Senate that, as is stated in the report, audit independence can effectively be jeopardised through the imposition of resource constraints in one form or</PARA>
<PARA>another. The complete resource independence for the Australian Audit Office is neither possible nor desirable without having a mechanism which will provide an adequate minimum level of resources for the public sector audit functions. Where we have an inadequate level of resources, we will constrain the level of activity and the effectiveness of this important office of state. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is rather unfortunate that in recent times we have tended to see an unfortunate degree of conflict arising between the Department of Finance and the Audit Office. It is inevitable, of course, that some of their functions from time to time, in this stewardship role and advice role, will tend to run along parallel lines. There is a need for both organisations to continue to display high levels of professionalism in the maintenance of standards which are of the highest order in ensuring the integrity of the parliamentary purse and the confidence that the Australian people have in the administration of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Therefore, I urge that the Australian national auditor be an officer of the Parliament, free of the Executive. In his response the Auditor-General acknowledges that, throughout the goals and corporate plans, his responsibilities are essentially to the Parliament and to the Executive, in that order. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr President, the pundits say that a week is a long time in politics and, whilst I certainly knew this intellectually, the reality of this maxim hit hard and fast seven weeks ago with the sudden resignation of Senator Paul McLean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, who, when speaking of the success of the Arab wars, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act out their dream with open eyes, to make it possible. This I did. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to confess of now understanding a little of what he meant because in my early teens I dreamt of one day participating in public life as a member of parliament. I now stand here before you, some 17 years later, as an Australian Democrats senator representing the State of New South Wales but, unlike Lawrence, this has been made possible not only by my own efforts but also by the one who came before me. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr President, it is a source of deep regret that I stand in this place and speak now as Paul McLean's replacement rather than as his parliamentary colleague. I have known Paul for nearly 10 years; since I first joined the Democrats, in fact. Indeed, it was he who encouraged and fostered my involvement in the Party when I was a new, bright-eyed and bushytailed young member full of ideals, enthusiasm and more schemes than a dog has fleas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Paul is a foundation member of the Democrats and served at all levels of the party organisation prior to his election to the Senate in 1987. He fought many preselections before success came his way in 1986. Many members regarded this as a long overdue success made possible by the retirement of Senator Colin Mason. </PARA>
<PARA>  During his four years in this place Paul's contribution to the Senate and to the Australian Democrats was enormous. As a former Army major his appreciation of the problems faced by veterans and their families ensured that the Australian Democrat contribution to legislation affecting their needs was underlined by a real understanding of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Likewise with defence policy, Paul was able to graft his experience and commitment to peace issues onto new defence models, unencumbered by the rigid thinking of old-style defence planners who saw value only in aircraft carriers, bulky hardware and large numbers of troops. Surely the Gulf War has shown us how out of date this antiquated approach has become. Wars can now be fought and nearly won without a regular soldier firing a single bullet. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is in the economic area that Paul's contribution will be best remembered. As industrial relations spokesperson, Paul's many months of discussions with unions and business groups were about to bear fruit as he prepared for the major industrial relations debate that we are about to embark upon. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps his most memorable contribution was in his vigorous, relentless and dogged pursuit of bank malpractice, culminating in the now famous `Westpac letters' and pressure which was a major factor in the establishment of a parliamentary inquiry into banking. In so doing, Paul uncovered a veritable hornet's nest of shady dealings and gave hope to the hundreds, nay thousands, of average customers and small business people who had been wronged at the hands of banks and financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats will not let up in their pursuit of this issue now that Paul has gone. Indeed, we would fail in our commitment to small business if we let this important issue fall off our agenda. Paul himself will continue to work on his banking material over the coming months. We all wish Paul well for the future and hope that he will continue to contribute to the Australian Democrats and to public life in whatever capacity he feels able. His absence from the parliamentary party will be sorely missed and keenly felt. </PARA>
<PARA>  So here I am, thrust into public life and acting out my dream. And yet my career as a Middle Eastern archaeologist is itself, for many people, a deep desire surrounded by fantasies of fantastic discoveries, exotic locations and a tinge of danger. Mr President, reality never matches the fantasy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many people have commented that my work as an archaeologist makes for an unusual background as a member of parliament. Perhaps it does. But while my archaeological background has received considerable attention in recent weeks, few would be aware that I spent a number of years in the insurance industry as a broker of fire and general insurance prior to changing careers and attending university. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note that here in this place are gathered many people from around Australia with a variety of life experiences; indeed, I believe it is important that the Parliament of Australia should reflect the diversity which exists in our society. Nevertheless, it is a sad commentary on all our parties that Aboriginal people are not currently represented by one member in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the ethnic nature of my surname, I was born in Australia of parents who were very much the classic postwar European migrants from England and the Continent. I am a regular churchgoer and have lived all my life in Sydney's eastern suburbs, close to the beach and deeply influenced by the public school `surf culture' of Bondi and Coogee. In many respects the teenage experiences reflected in the 1970s movie Puberty Blues illustrate the typical struggles that I and many of my school mates faced in our formative years. </PARA>
<PARA>  During this important time my interest in politics, issues and current affairs was fostered by my parents, themselves classic swinging voters living in the soon-to-be-abolished marginal seat of Phillip. My father was insistent that dinner be spent as a family gathered around the table, rather than around the television set. As an early example of my interest in politics, I recall at the tender age of 13 engaging my school colleagues in a vigorous playground debate about the merits of Gough Whitlam's removal from office. Little did I realise that years later I would stand in the House which was instrumental in precipitating his political demise. </PARA>
<PARA>  I joined the Australian Democrats in 1982, after much consideration and thought about the merits of each political party and its policies. What attracted me to the Australian Democrats was the desire to engage in long term policy-making, not constrained by the politics of the next election which seemed to govern so much government decision-making. The Democrats offered new ideas, internal processes which enabled members to have a direct say in policy and party matters, and were concerned about the long term harmful effects of environmental degradation caused by the abuse of the world's natural resources. By way of example, the Democrats were one of the first political parties in Australia to start talking seriously about ozone depletion and greenhouse gases in the early 1980s. We were then branded as merchants of doom, but now these words are part of the political lexicon. Ten years on I remain convinced that the Democrats are the only party concerned about social justice, economic equity and the environment as a total policy package. </PARA>
<PARA>  My work as an archaeologist and historian, intimately concerned with the interpretation of the past, has taught me a valuable lesson now that my work involves planning for the future--that is, that human kind has failed to learn lessons from its history. We have failed to learn from the lessons of Reaganomics and Thatcherism, where supply-side economic policies in those countries have resulted in increased national indebtedness, great social dislocation, even wider gaps between rich and poor and the removal of the state from the provision of essential social services, resulting in a situation where money talks more than social need. That is not my vision for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to see Australia become a more socially just, compassionate, yet economically competitive country where the long term value of preserving our environment and the need to foster creative thinking, innovation and productivity are recognised. Strong steps must be taken to restructure our industrial base by value-adding exports and encouraging innovative environmentally friendly business ventures. Increased productivity on the shop floor must be matched by creative thinking in boardrooms across Australia to develop new products, replace imports and create export markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question of developing solar energy and other renewable energy sources must be urgently addressed by our businesses, researchers and by this Parliament. Long term job opportunities must be created and individual freedoms respected. If we want to become the clever country, education must not be regarded as a burgeoning budget item, but rather as an investment in our country's future, in our young people, and in the intellectual and scientific base of business. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, Australia must stand up for human rights on the international stage. However, we must also become the committed country--a country committed to ensuring that the weak are protected against the strong, that appropriate safety nets prevent poverty traps and that real steps are taken to improve the health, education and employment conditions of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>  It also occurred to me at an early age that, in order to effect any real changes in our society, politics and parliament was the place to be. Real power resides here between elections--not with any number of pressure groups which try to effect changes outside this place. Whilst it is to the Government that people look for vision and direction, it is to the Parliament that voters turn to ensure adequate debate and scrutiny of policy, legislation and government activity. This will perhaps become more critical as Australians are faced with the need to make radical changes in the 1990s, changes in work relationships, expectations and economic focus. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1980s have seen a spectacular revival in the power of parliaments across Australia. No longer are they institutions captive to the will of the Executive and the old major parties, but increasingly they are real forums of debate, reform and public scrutiny. It is worth noting that State governments in four States--Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales--govern in the minority and, contrary to what honourable senators on both sides of the chamber would have us believe, this need not necessarily be a recipe for instability. If instability, as defined by the major parties, simply means an inability of the Executive to force through all sorts of iniquitous legislation with as little scrutiny and debate as possible, then more power to the parliaments, I say. </PARA>
<PARA>  Majority governments in a Westminster system are in effect elected dictatorships which can force through legislation by gagging debate, crunching the numbers and often ignoring public opinion. I am proud that the Australian Democrats have been at the forefront of restoring some measure of primacy to the Parliament by ensuring that it is not a rubber stamp for the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>  As we move increasingly into a deregulatory economic climate, where market forces are given the status of holy writ, the responsibility will be on us as law-makers to ensure equality of outcomes and that the so-called invisible hand of marketplace supremacy does not result in wider gaps between rich and poor, city and rural dwellers and skilled and unskilled workers. Government and the Parliament, as instruments of the people, will have a vital role in ensuring that economic benefits are more evenly distributed and that the powerless--be they workers, businesses, Aboriginal people or struggling families--are not exploited by those in more advantageous positions or more powerful economic relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, I bring to this place very real concerns about the position of women as we move into the 1990s. It is true that over the last 15 years we have witnessed enormous changes in the role of women in society. Improvements and real gains have been made in the recognition of the contribution women make to the economic and social fabric of Australia. The participation rate of women in higher education, for example, has increased from 40.6 per cent in 1985 to 52.7 per cent in 1991. More women occupy management positions and more women are to be found in non-traditional jobs. However, for many professional women the glass ceiling syndrome in promotion and advancement opportunities remains a real issue, no matter how often or how many people say that the glass ceiling does not exist. I have suffered the humiliation of watching my male colleagues in previous jobs receive more pay than I did for exactly the same work. </PARA>
<PARA>  It remains a fact that women still earn only 81 per cent of male average weekly earnings, that only 12 per cent of women hold full time managerial jobs and that women are significantly under-represented in academia. One only has to look around us to see that only 19 of 76 senators or roughly 25 per cent of senators in this place are women. I am extremely pleased to have been the means by which the Australian Democrats can now claim to be the first party with a majority female representation in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much remains to be done in changing community and employer attitudes and even the attitudes of women. The particular concern I raise here is the potential impact of a fully deregulated labour market on female workers. Labour market reform not only is a key economic issue, but also will be one of the key social justice issues of the 1990s. Labour market reform is not a matter of changing some inanimate regulation or business function but involves people--the millions of working Australians whose lives will be directly affected by the changes proposed by all parties in this place. The term `labour market flexibility' must not result in simply giving employers the flexibility to pay their workers less. The potential for big winners and big losers is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that women could potentially suffer most in a deregulated labour market, especially those women whose command of English is poor. Women are poorly represented by trade unions, traditionally the mouthpiece for representing worker concerns and advocating their rights; indeed, only 34.6 per cent of women belong to a trade union. Women lack industrial muscle and currently must rely on the actions of strong unions, representing male workers largely, to negotiate wages and conditions which trickle down through union awards. In a deregulated labour market, women could stand to lose the most if left on their own without the protection of a trade union or the Industrial Relations Commission to oversight enterprise bargaining agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>  In concluding, I would like to congratulate our new Leader, Senator John Coulter, and our new Deputy Leader, Senator Meg Lees. I look forward to working with them and my colleagues. I also thank my new husband, Mr Armon Hicks, and my parents, Val and Helen Sowada, for their assistance and support.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, I pay tribute to those women, my friends, who have been a special encouragement and inspiration over the years--not only my mother but also Janine Haines; Senator Vicki Bourne; Dr Lisa Giddy, a former Egyptologist at the University of Sydney; Margaret Clark at the Institute of Administration; Debra Stirling from Coles-Myer; and Elisabeth Kirkby, member of the Legislative Council and State Leader of the Democrats in New South Wales. Elisabeth has the distinction of celebrating her tenth year in parliament this month. If I can humbly follow her model of honesty, integrity and professionalism during my time in this place, I will have served my country and my Party well. </PARA>
<PARA>  As mentioned earlier, being an archaeologist places time and history in sharp perspective, especially one's own place in the scheme of things. Last year, whilst I was living amongst the tombs of ancient Egypt on the necropolis of Saqqara, it was my habit to stroll across the desert and watch the sunset at the end of a day's work. One balmy evening, I sat upon a mound of sand and looked across to the great pyramids of Giza, sitting large and heavy on the distant horizon as they have done for the last four and a half thousand years.</PARA>
<PARA>  I then glanced down and saw scattered around my feet in the dusty sand fragments of bone bleached to a hard, dry whiteness by the harsh desert sun. On examination, I discovered that these fragments represented pieces of a human skull, probably dating several thousand years BC--a skull which had once enclosed a brain, thoughts, hopes, aspirations and emotions just like yours and mine. One's own sense of self-importance is rapidly deflated when confronted with the stark reality of human history in one's hand. We are all but part of the passing parade of humanity. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a tremendous opportunity to help craft, shape and influence a more socially just and equitable future for Australians living in the here and now, so help me God. I thank you, Mr President, and honourable senators for your attention and indulgence. I am under no illusions about my role in this place or the task ahead. But, like Lawrence of Arabia, I act out my dream with open eyes. Thank you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I also congratulate Senator Sowada on her first speech in this chamber. The Bill that is now before us is the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill has three particular objectives, all of which the Opposition supports. The specific provisions of the clauses of the Bill are set out in just three pages, and they are not at all controversial. They are all positive adjustments to student assistance that I am sure every member of this Senate sees as timely and appropriate and will be supporting. However, the wider context of the Government's education policies does arouse a great deal of controversy and opposition because of the damage that these policies are doing to education at all levels in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  First, I refer to the Bill specifically. The Bill's three purposes are: firstly, to extend Austudy to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands; secondly, to deal with changes to the living allowances for the English as a second language scheme as this scheme is being integrated into the social security payments system; thirdly, to insert an appropriation clause into the Student Assistance Act to replace the existing appropriation mechanism through the regular appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>   As I have said, the Opposition supports these three objectives, and there is no need for me to elaborate. To save time, I will just make a number of general remarks about the failures of the Government in its broad education policies and administration. They are, in fact, a disaster and it is about time the Ministers of this Government took some heed of the criticisms that have been expressed over many years now without any positive response, not only in this chamber but also in the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fact, this amending legislation is put before us by the Government at a time when its policies on education are even more controversial than they have ever been in the eyes of the Australian public and are increasingly deserving of the Senate's criticism and serious concern. Australia is being let down by this Government in every area of education policy and administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  In education debates in the Senate for all these many years now, Opposition senators, including myself, have spelt out the Opposition's objections to what Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin have been doing to Australian education. I briefly summarise those objections again now: the centralising of decision-making; the restricting of important decisions to the Ministers and the bureaucracy here in Canberra when most of the expertise lies out in the cities of Australia where our education institutions are well informed by actual practitioners--not just those who are teaching and researching in our higher education institutions, TAFE colleges or in our schools, but the actual students enrolled who have a direct vested interest to ensure that they are getting valuable education provision, and the families who are supporting those students to a large extent. There are many mature students, of course, who are self-supporting. </PARA>
<PARA>  We in the Opposition have been trying to encourage the Government to see that, given the rationalisations, the improvements that have been made, particularly through the 1970s, in the provision of education in Australia, and I will even include the words `standardisation' and `rationalisation', and with some degree of amalgamation of resources--given these broad achievements in the Karmel years--the time has now long come, and it has been here for at least the last five years, to give back to education institutions genuine power over the conduct of their own programs. In the past this has been called autonomy--what I call autonomy. The framework is already stable and well informed. Instead of keeping decision-making in Canberra with Ministers and bureaucrats, give the power of decision, give the initiatives to those who can be genuinely creative; that is, those who are the providers and users of our education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>   Boringly, we see the centralisation that is sapping creativity, I believe, in the education processes of Australia. We also see the imposition of restrictions through education institutions being required to negotiate their own profiles behind closed doors with public servants who are bound and limited by their Minister's guidance. </PARA>
<PARA>   We have also seen too often the forced amalgamation of institutions for which there is not a voluntary approach and for which there is not any justified educational gain. There has been a complacent tolerance of a failing student support scheme that is full of inequities. There has been the maladministration of the education export sector, a matter which was last evening debated in this chamber and for which on behalf of the Opposition I set out the sorry record of this Government in letting down overseas students and letting down this important export industry, especially to the countries in our region in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The list of the inadequacies of this Government in the field of education goes on and on. But because this is directly a Bill about student assistance I will concentrate the remainder of my remarks on trying to urge the Government to act in the way that the Senate has already resolved with regard to one aspect of student assistance; that is, to make it possible for those in rural Australia who are suffering from the rural crisis to have the same opportunity to be enrolled in education institutions as all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition senators--Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I hear the encouragement of those honourable senators on this side of the chamber who are from the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats. We on this side have passed a resolution calling upon this Government to act to take special hardship provisions to enable families in rural Australia to have their children continue in education, rather than pull them out of it because they cannot afford to continue to pay for university and other courses of education. This Government has let them down. It has not responded to the needs of rural Australia and has not responded to a resolution of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let me remind the Government of Australia, through this debate, that its action in this area is not considered to be action by this chamber or by rural Australia. The hardship that has been felt by so many people in rural areas should be well known to every senator. Whilst I see only two Government senators present, I think many of even the Government senators are aware of the crisis in rural Australia. They are embarrassed; they run away and hide because of the failure of their own Government to act in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the Senate of an excellent speech made by my colleague Senator Olsen during the adjournment debate last night in which he addressed his remarks to a report about education in country areas. He spoke of the scandal of one per cent of rural Australian children gaining education outcomes, when a much greater percentage of Australians from every other part of Australia are gaining educational advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>Of any community group within Australia, I would say that Aboriginal Australians have the worst education outcome. I am glad to say that there have been some very substantial improvements in this area in the last 15 years and they are, in fact, now consolidating into a much improved situation, but Aborigines still have the worst statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second worst statistics belong to that 7 per cent of Australians who live in rural areas. If people live in the bush or in a country town they must be aware that they are likely to find that their children will have a lower education outcome and, for many, that means a lower opportunity to develop their skills and abilities. The Opposition has been complaining to the Government about this for years and we want to see some response. In particular, we want to see an amendment to the student assistance regulations and to the way in which this Government's student assistance schemes are being administered so that students from country areas will be able at least to continue the access to education they had before the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>  This distress inevitably has its effect on those from rural backgrounds who wish to continue their education. Their financial circumstances, and those of their families, can be so grave as to make it impossible for them to continue with their education. No Australian should be denied educational opportunities simply for financial reasons, and we should respond with sensitivity to the plight of the rural community at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is why the Opposition on 19 May--that is five or six months ago--moved a motion, which the Senate passed, calling on the Government to respond to the crisis affecting rural families and to take the initiative in providing hardship provisions to help those who are being denied Austudy because of the assets test. The Student Assistance Act, which we are amending by this legislation, is the basis for Austudy payments; that is, the living allowance payments and some other allowances--such as travel to and from home several times a year--which are made to more than one-third of all of our higher education students and in fact to senior secondary students. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many rural families are being denied these payments because of an assets test. We did not introduce the assets test, but we believe that there is some principled reason for having an appropriately drawn and administered assets test for Austudy. We in the Opposition are opposed to an assets test for isolated children, but we have accepted the principle that there be some appropriately drawn assets test for Austudy. But when, in the present rural crisis, this assets test becomes a barrier to what we expected to be the normal access by students of those families to enrolment in education, we have to be sensitive and we have to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  If eligibility for Austudy were based upon an income test, then there is no way that rural families would not be receiving it because their incomes are zero, or negative, in very many cases. But they are left holding an asset that might be worth $500,000, or even more--the assets test actually starts at $750,000 or thereabouts. Yet a family with that degree of asset is not getting an income and is being denied the living allowance support that its student children would receive if the family were being assessed on income alone. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the time I moved the motion in the Senate and on subsequent occasions I described the details of the hardship that was being caused and we called for a prompt and positive response from the Government. But what did we get? We did not get a prompt response. In fact, we did not get a positive response. The quarter measure that the Government limply offered last August in the Budget assisted only a small minority of those who were cut out. What about the majority? What about the other families and the students who are being denied an equal opportunity to education in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not wish to embarrass public servants who no doubt have wrung their hands and burned the midnight oil trying to work out the best way to formulate the appropriate response to this question. I know that public servants do not have responsibility for policy decisions; it is the responsibility of the Government, the Cabinet and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). From the lack of response, lack of any promptness and lack of any positive measures, we can see that it is a hard-hearted Cabinet, a hard-hearted Prime Minister and a hard-hearted Minister who may be cynically saying,`We haven't got any votes in the country; we won't spend our money helping these suffering Australian families'. How cynical! Perhaps, even more cynically, they are saying, `We are going to lose the next election no matter what happens. Let's not go through the struggle of trying to find the appropriate words to put in place'--through a Bill such as the one before us now, the Student Assistance Amendment Bill--`the hardship provisions for rural Australia which the Senate has called for'. </PARA>
<PARA>   As I have said, the Government waited until the Budget to respond to this matter and, although the need for action had been urged by the Opposition for many months, it was a very weak and inadequate response. Decisions could have been made and announced much sooner when rural Australians were first feeling the pain. I think it is an illustration of the fact that the Government lacked political will. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget decision is inadequate. Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition sees it as in no way fulfilling the resolution that the Senate adopted on 19 May. We immediately pointed this out in the Budget. Let me remind the Senate what my colleague Dr Kemp, the shadow Minister for education, said in his press release on 20 August:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins' acceptance of the Opposition's initiative to introduce a hardship provision for Austudy recipients has failed to provide an adequate response to the problem. The provision does not go nearly far enough in offsetting the difficulties incurred by many students in metropolitan and rural areas in obtaining financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>The narrow application of the hardship provision will mean that only those who are destitute and are already leaving their farms, or whose parents receive a social security or veterans pension will be eligible for student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>`This is completely inadequate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say it again: the Opposition sees the Government's failure as completely inadequate. I am only saying all this now in regard to student assistance because that is what is before the Senate chamber and we still want the Government to respond. The press release further states:</PARA>
<PARA>These are measures designed to enable the Government to appear to be doing something but in no way provide for the many students who desperately require Austudy and will not receive it under the Government's proposals,'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>On the 19th of May 1991, the Coalition successfully moved a motion in the Senate that called on the Government to introduce equitable and fairer educational assistance for families who were forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds. This would involve assistance being made available on a case by case basis, to the many students and families that have been affected by the rural crises and economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead the Government has made hardship provisions available only to those who are completely destitute, are selling their farms and leaving the land. `This is too little too late,' Dr Kemp said today. `We cannot wait until students are completely destitute before they are able to receive financial assistance.'</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government thinks again. Certainly that is what I and other members of the Opposition urge should happen. I hope that we will be gracious enough to acknowledge that when the Government makes some decision in the coming weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also hope that the Government will respond to all the inadequacies of the Austudy scheme. The Opposition has pointed them out and has made a commitment that, when in office, we will properly address them. Our policy at the last election included these words:</PARA>
<PARA>Austudy has been bedevilled by administrative deficiencies and suffers from continuing allegations of unfairness in the award of benefits. The Liberal and National Parties will, in government, thoroughly review the rules and administration of Austudy to ensure that they are fair to all and that the scheme runs smoothly. </PARA>
<PARA>Our policy also states:</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the new assets test on Austudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme recipients has introduced hardship for some Australian families. We will abolish the assets test for isolated children and, for Austudy, establish a realistic assets test provision including a hardship provision. </PARA>
<PARA>So Austudy needs review and reform. I ask the Government plainly to bring before us another Bill to amend this legislation so that we can be a bit more cheerful, speak more positively and have a more bipartisan approach to welcome a program that will meet the needs of these families and the terms of the Senate's resolution. If there is no such response and if there is no further positive action by this Government, I give the assurance that the Opposition, in being elected to government after the next election, will do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As we have been told, the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 has three straightforward purposes: firstly, to provide for the introduction of the Austudy scheme to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands; secondly, to make alterations to the provision of living allowances under the English as a second language scheme; and, thirdly, to introduce special appropriations for Austudy. The Australian Democrats have no disagreement with those particular purposes of this Bill and will be supporting the Bill. However, as Senator Teague did, I wish to take advantage of this situation to describe some of what I see as the shortcomings of the present administration of the Austudy scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I agree with the criticisms made by the coalition speaker on education when the debate on this Bill took place in the other place. The Government's recent actions were described as half hearted in that the hardship provisions were being applied in a very narrow and discriminatory manner. Only those who were already destitute, those who were already leaving their farms or those whose parents already received a social security or veteran's pension would be eligible for emergency education assistance. Such categories of people are really being given, in Senator Teague's words, too little too late. I accept that description. The Democrats are not surprised by this because Senator Teague sounded rather amazed. He was rightly indignant that this Government has paid little heed to the motion passed by this Senate asking for hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although the Democrats supported the coalition's move to establish hardship provisions, we argued at the time--and we have been vindicated by subsequent events--that such a move would not be the most effective option to redress the problems facing rural Australians in providing education for their young people. The option provided by Senator Meg Lees on 13 May was to remove the assets test from Austudy. Having now been subjected to several reminders during Senator Teague's speech that on 19 May the coalition moved to establish hardship provisions, I wonder whether that move was instigated by its embarrassment at not having supported the most effective option obviously available--the option introduced by Senator Meg Lees. </PARA>
<PARA>  The support which should have been given by the coalition to Senator Lees's disallowance motion would have been consistent with the previous action of the coalition, that is, the removal of the assets test from family allowance payments. It would also be consistent with the stated policy which we have had reiterated today by Senator Teague, which is the position of the coalition with regard to the assistance for the isolated children's scheme where it seems that the coalition is committed to removing the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA>  It really does seem to be hypocritically inconsistent for the coalition to play party politics in refusing to remove the assets test from Austudy. That is a move which would have been of most immediate benefit to most rural families. I am not convinced by Senator Teague's reluctance to accept that contention. As the coalition and the Government claimed at the time, it would not require the allocation of an extraordinary level of funding. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We will just look at that contention briefly. The ridiculous figures quoted by our opponents at the time really only served to illustrate their incapacity to understand the nature of our education system and the problem of students, particularly rural students. I will explain why, for the edification of those who are listening. The fact is that, with some 30,000 qualified students unable to be physically located in our higher education institutions at the moment; with very few students being able to survive solely on Austudy; with very few students able to receive full Austudy anyway; with the extra costs associated with travelling from the country to attend tertiary education institutions; and with the retention of the income test to which Senator Teague referred, those who understand education would realise that the system would not be flooded with a sudden overwhelming number of eligible recipients of Austudy. The numbers fail to stack up when considered in light of that sort of information and understanding of our education system and how it works on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Democrats contend that all that would happen would be a more equitable distribution to something of the same order of numbers of students who already receive Austudy. What is really needed in this place in discussion of Bills such as these is properly informed debate conducted by people who understand and are involved in education. If the Government understood, I agree with Senator Teague that the opportunity could have been taken in this Bill to take account of the real problems that are now self-evident in the management of Australian higher education. As Senator Teague reminded us, last night we heard from Senator Olsen irrefutable evidence of our failure to provide the young people of rural Australia with access to education beyond secondary school--our inability to provide meaningful access which can be exercised. This Bill does not improve that access. It could have if the Government had been serious about student assistance. There is little point in continuing; for the little good the Bill does, we support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Fishing, whether it is commercial or recreational, is important to Australia. Very few people appear to understand the size and the operation of the fishing industry. It is large commercially, has a high investment, is a substantial employer and, most importantly, is diverse; it is all around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have been to most but not all the fishing ports. I always concentrate upon the value of the industry and the people that are involved in it. They are real people, they are working people, who are producing something for the national good. I believe that more recognition than they normally get is due to them. There are millions of Australians living close to the sea who have a fundamental interest in doing one of the basic things in life--that is, going out and trying to catch themselves a meal. Those people also cannot be ignored at a time like this. </PARA>
<PARA>  I welcome this opportunity for changes to be made to the administration of the fishing industry; they are long overdue. I will not deal with the details of the Fisheries Administration Bill and six related Bills. We have been over them ad nauseam within the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. However, there is much to be said about the industry at large and the purpose and implementation of the legislation that I wish to put on the record because it is important. </PARA>
<PARA>  Historically, the management of the fishing industry and of fishing generally has been inadequate. It must be borne in mind that Australian waters generally are poor in the production of fish. They are not as well endowed with the appropriate currents, upwellings and so on that make for good fishing in other parts of the world. Australia's opportunity is much less. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are other problems: we have a long coastline; many large and small ports; six States and a Territory to administer; isolation; and poor coordination and communication. Over a period of years Australian fishermen have not adequately protected the stock. They talk and offer protection but the result is there to see: there are more people fishing harder than the stock can provide. With fishermen and people who are after a natural resource, there is always a certain amount of `them versus us' in competing for the stock and in considering whether the administration can be beaten. Beating the system is very much part of the fishing game. </PARA>
<PARA>  Looking back over recent periods, the fishing skills and training have advanced considerably. For instance, the Australian Maritime College has done a lot towards improving fishing techniques and the training of participants. The boats and technology are much better than they used to be. New supreme materials are used in nets and winches. There are new sonar systems. All of these things aid the fisherman and not the fish. </PARA>
<PARA>  The levels and management of stock have declined alarmingly and are still declining. That decline must be reversed. In 1976 the real slaughter of the immature southern blue fin tuna became fashionable in Australia. It followed the closure of whaling in the west and the fishermen concerned turned to the southern blue fin tuna. The prawn industry then collapsed in the Gulf of Carpentaria and that collapse continued with scallops, gemfish, lobsters, prawns and sharks--maybe the orange roughy will be next--all heading in the same downward direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was in this light that the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce produced the report entitled, Development of the Australian Fishing Industry. I thought it was appropriate to look back and see what we were talking about 10 years ago. The Committee, which I had the honour of chairing 10 years ago, made 10 recommendations. I will not read them all, but I will read a portion of three of them. The first one, in part, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . develop and implement a national fisheries policy defining the objectives and strategy for the rational utilisation of Australia's fisheries resources and devise clear guidelines for the management and conservation of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industry direct his Department to establish formal procedures for implementing the Government's long-term policy objectives and priorities for the development of Australia's fisheries resources and the Australian fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The second recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industry, in developing the national fisheries policy and guidelines for the management and conservation of fisheries resources, give particular attention to:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i)  the immediate and long-term effects of various management measures on the biological and economic status of established fisheries;</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii)  the effects of the implementation in management regimes in one fishery on the biological and economic stability of neighbouring fisheries and on other fisheries resources, and the need for a multi-species approach to management. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The third recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industry direct his Department to accord priority to the revision, consolidation and replacement of the Fisheries Act 1952. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we are 10 years later, in 1991, and what have we learnt?  It is a great shame that we have taken so long to do so little. We are suffering from exactly the same problems as we did 10 years ago, but the problems are much bigger as a result of not doing something about them. The new organisation has a big job ahead of it. We have seen a decade of decline. The stocks are much worse;  the capitalisation is much greater;  and the catastrophe in trying to clean it up will be massive. </PARA>
<PARA>  We only have to look at the south-east trawl situation. Three or four or five years ago a stop could have and should have been put to the situation that was developing. The $40m buy back situation in the Gulf of Carpentaria should not have been necessary. I also question the part that the fishermen's own organisation, NFIC, has played, if any. I also look at the management committees and wonder whether they have been successful. The consideration of the resource is paramount. The question of sustainable yield is essential and must rise above all others. </PARA>
<PARA>  We often hear excuses for the over fishing that takes place. All people have a reason as to why they should catch a few more fish or why they should ignore the technical advice that would indicate that there is a problem. This applies to the professional fisherman and it equally applies to the recreational fisherman. The recreational fisherman who goes out in the name of sport and catches fish that he will not be able to use--it will be wasted--is just as guilty as the professional who may catch a boatload of, say, orange roughy and puts half of them on the tip. Every fish caught should be utilised. Conservative estimates must be the basis of the planning, whatever is done. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no easy answer to the huge over capacity of effort that we are now confronted with. There are certainly hundreds and probably thousands too many commercial boats around the Australian coast. At the same time, of course, the number of pleasure craft is increasing. The people on a considerable proportion of those craft also catch fish. Then we have the impact of beach fishing, rock fishing and spear fishing on many of the inner coastal areas around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whether fishing is recreational or professional, the catch is a common resource to all and the rules should apply to all and the costs must be shared equitably by all. Costs cover things such as licensing, surveillance, search and rescue. We must also consider the various support industries--the boats and the gear--and the tourism and all the other things that go with fishing. At this juncture there is no area that offers more room for further discussion than the question of dealing with professionals and the recreationals. </PARA>
<PARA>  I often hear calls from fishermen, particularly those from outlying areas, to leave the industry alone. They do not want to be changed. They say that the administrators should just leave them alone so that they can continue on as they have and, in due course, they will be able to leave their fishing boats, their licences and so on to their sons to carry on after them. I always say to the fishermen that, like farmers, manufacturers or industry--people of all sorts--they are part of change whether they like it or not. They must be prepared for change and they must be able to deal with it as it comes. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the meantime, still better scientific evidence is needed. We need more industry participation in discussions on the management and all things to do with fishing. There must be a much closer relationship between the industry and the new AFMA organisation than has existed in the past with the Fisheries Service. There has to be a much better and closer leadership from NFIC if it is going to remain part of the system. There particularly needs to be more operator participation in the discussions, in the meetings and in the communications generally. Until now, by any standards this has been totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are problems and issues for consideration in many places. We have to look at the effect that aquaculture will have. In the meantime, we have to look at getting this offshore constitutional settlement finalised. We have to do something about the overlapping of the Commonwealth and State functions, to say nothing of the problems that the Government has created--we must do something about those--and the effects of the non-decisions that should have been made. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation came through in various stages and the way it turned up is the worst I have ever seen. We started off with a handbook or policy statement called, `New Directions in Commonwealth Fisheries', which I was told at Estimates committee hearings took seven people a year and a half to produce. The legislation that followed took four people a year to produce. The first Bill arrived in the  Parliament just before Christmas in 1990, with a promise that the balance of the legislation would be here in February 1991. In fact, it turned up just 25 days prior to the date it was planned to be implemented. When it was brought into the House of Representatives, honourable members were given 45 minutes to look at seven Bills and to pass them. It took 15 years of man time to produce this rubbish which, so far, has produced between 80 and 90 amendments, and that is after trying to jam it through with no discussion at all. Prior to getting the legislation, for three months I had been endeavouring to get information from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the officers, without any success. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation as discussed was open-ended with employment problems and had no funding undertakings, no indications on the loss or retention of the rights that the fishermen may have and no information on the taxing measures, et cetera. Between March and June, in spite of considerable effort, we still had no undertakings. As I say, discussions with the officers concerned were fruitless. The industry at operator level was absolutely confused and the ground swell in that area grew and grew. The fishermen were told nothing. I entered into a situation of occasionally writing to any fishermen that I could find just to give them some information. I thank those who took the trouble to keep in touch and raise a lot of issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was very disturbed that the relationships between the industry and the AFS, and the industry and NFIC were so poor. The NFIC officials had no idea of the reaction that was raised out in the field by its ordinary grassroots members. NFIC did not know what its members were saying or thinking. I do not believe that NFIC was seeking any information from its members, although the members in the field were seeking information. They were also seeking ways in which the legislation--or what they believed the legislation would produce--could be improved. All the time that I was getting hundreds of communications from ordinary fishermen, I was getting letters from officers of NFIC telling me that the legislation was okay, and would I please see to it that it was not held up and that it was passed as fast as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  We then had the late entry of the Industry Commission's draft report on cost recovery which confused the finalising of the Committee's contemplation. We also had the draft report from the ecologically sustainable development working group. As a result, the situation is still very far from being satisfactory. I thank the Minister for giving us an undertaking that, in view of all the confusion, he will refer the operation back to the Senate Committee in 12 months' time. I believe that there will be quite a bit to deal with then. </PARA>
<PARA>  When dealing with fisheries legislation, we must take into account the fact that fishermen are individuals--very much so. That is one of the reasons why they are fishermen. Like many other people who are individually inclined, they do have a built-in anti-change factor. They would prefer to go along as they are rather than to change. In this particular case, as I have said, their organisational problem is quite considerable and their representation is always difficult. I find, when I am looking for one, that a good fisherman is usually at sea and seldom wants to go to meetings. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a lot of reasons why we should not be supporting the establishment of an AFMA structure. One of the main reasons revolves around the fact that I see it as producing a career structure for people who wish to work in the fishing environment. A problem within the Australian Fisheries Service, as a division of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which is regularly reported to me is that fishermen who are trying to talk to somebody can seldom talk to the same person twice on any subject. It seems to them that there is a considerable turnaround of staff. Whether staff are moving in and out of the Service or whether they are just moving from desk to desk does not make any difference to somebody who is trying to get an answer. It is very annoying to find that the same person cannot be contacted twice. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that AFMA will do a lot towards giving fishermen the opportunity to develop a closer relationship with the organisation that they see as being theirs. It will do a lot to break down the resistance to change and it should improve communications and simplify all the procedures. There are many things that have to be done in a departmental set-up which I trust will not need to be done under AFMA. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mind you, there are still many problems. We have not really settled on the distribution of resources between fishermen. We have not determined the equity between the State and Federal jurisdictions. We still have many problems with the management of substantial fisheries. One of the big ones is the arrangement between the recreational and professional fishermen. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to acknowledge the flexibility of the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Minister in allowing the many improvements that we have been able to make to the legislation. At this stage, I cannot say that I like the legislation. I think that the Bills before us are confused and complicated. I am disappointed with their development and with the general lack of compatibility between the environmentalists and the industry that is so clearly reflected. </PARA>
<PARA>  I congratulate Mr McColl on his appointment as the AFMA chairman. I wish him every success and express my support for him and hope that the resource and the fishermen will prosper under his administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the legislation aims to safeguard the resource, to secure the appropriate research funding and implementation, to simplify the management structures and to better administer the industry. I see no reason why it should not do that. I would like to thank all those ordinary back-bending fishermen from around Australia for their input, comment and concern and the good officers of the AFS who helped us to see this through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I begin my remarks on this package of fisheries Bills by picking up a point which Senator Archer made a few moments ago. The important function which the Senate plays in relation to the proper consideration of legislation is little realised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Archer mentioned that this package of Bills was rammed through the House of Representatives in 45 minutes. He went on to point out that under our committee system this package has been sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. We have deliberated over a number of weeks. We have taken on board the draft report of the Industry Commission and the draft recommendations of the committee under the ESD process. We have independently, as a result of the recommendations from those other committees, made suggestions for amendments to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and to his Department, as a result of which we now have 80 amendments to this package of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is about time that some members of the press gallery and journalists recognised that the real business of parliamentary democracy is now carried on in this chamber and not in the other place. This is the place where legislation such as this is given proper scrutiny and where amendments and improvements are made to legislation. This package of legislation--like several other packages of legislation, particularly in the area of social security with which we have dealt recently--is a very good example of the appropriate way with which legislation should be dealt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that, and having remarked that we now have 80 amendments to this legislation, I must tell the Senate that the Democrats will be opposing this package of legislation because, notwithstanding those 80 amendments, we still have a totally inadequate package of legislation. This is a very important area. We are dealing with a natural resource which has been woefully and abysmally mishandled but on which this country depends for a significant part of its protein intake. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are also dealing with a resource which is part of the natural environment and which most recently has been shown to have considerable benefits in terms of human health by reason of the quality of the protein and the quality of the fats which fish contain. In almost every instance this resource has been overexploited and in many cases it is on the point of extinction; that is, there will be either a total wipe out or a situation will be reached where unless fisheries are closed for extended periods of time they will simply not sustain any reasonable level of exploitation for a very long period into the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  All the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology have expressed grave concerns about the adequacy of this legislation. We have just heard Senator Archer repeat some of those concerns. I am aware that a number of people on both sides of this chamber have serious reservations as to whether this package of legislation can adequately address the very serious problems that we now face. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Fisheries Service tabled a report in September 1990. I would like to refer to table 3.1 from that report showing the status of Commonwealth, or jointly managed, commercial fisheries. This table refers to both the adequacy of the knowledge in relation to that resource and the level of exploitation in just some of the fisheries. In the northern prawn fishery it is thought that the knowledge is adequate but that the fishery is fully exploited and some is overexploited; in the Torres Strait prawn fishery the knowledge is adequate but it is fully exploited and some is overexploited; for scallops in the south-east fishery there is adequate knowledge but they are dangerously overexploited; and in the southern shark fishery there is adequate knowledge but the fishery is overexploited. </PARA>
<PARA>  In that respect, I would point out that the South Australian Department of Fisheries has developed an excellent computer model which shows the level of exploitation, the level of the activity and the age structure of the population being exploited. This allows one to extrapolate forward the consequences of various management practices. This model indicates that the fishery should really be closed for at least 15 years if that fishery is to recover to a level which will sustain a meaningful level of exploitation from then on. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the southern bluefin tuna fishery knowledge is good but it is dangerously overexploited. It shows that even in the face of good knowledge about the stock, its sexual maturity, the age structure, the migratory practices of the fish, their food habits and various other things, we have a stock which is dangerously overexploited. With regard to the jack mackerel fishery we have inadequate knowledge and uncertainty in relation to exploitation but it is probably fully exploited. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we go on to the orange roughy fishery which was discovered in the 1980s. Against that we have inadequate knowledge and yet the present level is probably not sustainable. Since September 1990 it has become absolutely clear that that level of exploitation cannot be sustained and yet we have totally inadequate knowledge as to the nature of that fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the adequacy of fish as an element in the diet of Australians, and bearing in mind the considerable benefits to Australians of eating fish, it would seem very unwise to continue to increase our population. I just say that by way of parenthesis because, necessarily, that would mean future generations of Australians will have less fish to eat per head of population, even if we were to turn this process around. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has considered this legislation and expressed very serious concerns in its report which was tabled this morning. I will just read a couple of paragraphs from the conclusions and recommendations section of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee wishes to express its unanimous dissatisfaction with the process which has led to the production of this report and the subsequent passage of the Fisheries legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  These Bills represent a fundamental change to the administration of Commonwealth fisheries. Yet, with the exception of the Administration Bill, the legislation was not introduced into the Parliament until 25 days before AFMA was originally due to become operative. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a totally unsatisfactory way for this Government to behave with respect to one of the most fundamental resources which, quite clearly for a number of years, has been grossly mismanaged and grossly overexploited. The Committee goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that the Committee has found it necessary to recommend over 70 amendments--</PARA>
<PARA>that in itself indicates something; the number is now 80 because the Government has continued to heap amendment upon amendment as the Committee was considering these Bills--</PARA>
<PARA>is a clear indication that the legislation was not sufficiently developed at the time of its original introduction. There were many unresolved questions about matters such as the objectives and functions of AFMA and associated organisations, allocation of resources for research and the cost of the proposals to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee report goes on making some very disparaging and damning remarks in relation to the way in which Government has handled this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Democrats concern, shared by many of the witnesses coming before the Committee, is about the dismal lack of recognition that resource management and ecosystem conservation should come first and industry management should follow. The package of legislation which is before us is really an industry management type of approach. Without a resource there will eventually be no industry. On present predictions there will be no fishing industry in this country in the very near future, particularly in relation to specific species.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission draft report, entitled Cost Recovery for Managing Fisheries which was presented to us--the author of that report came before us as a witness--recognised quite clearly the need to separate the two functions: firstly, the functions of managing a resource and managing an ecosystem in a sustainable way; and, secondly, the importance of managing a commercial industry which is based on the exploitation of that ecosystem. The Minister asked the Committee to take specifically into account that IC report. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the recent past I have been extremely critical of the Industry Commission for not adequately taking into account proper environmental considerations, as it is charged to do under its legislation and for which it has a commissioner whose expertise is in the area of the environment. In relation to this particular report, I think the Industry Commission has done an excellent job. We were asked by the Minister to take into account its report. We have done that and, as a consequence, the Democrats believe that the Industry Commission recommendation that this package of legislation should not be accepted is the correct recommendation. We are adopting that and, as I say, we will be voting against this package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>  An indication of just how badly fisheries have been managed in the past was summarised recently by Graeme O'Neill,  the science writer for the Melbourne Age. His article states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The shark boats now venturing out into Bass Strait have been taking younger and younger fish for the past decade. The catch sizes are perfectly legal, but the trend is dismaying. The southern shark fishery is on the brink of collapse from over-exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The collapse of the fishery may only be averted if the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry and Energy, which administers offshore fisheries, drastically reduces the number of shark-fishing licences and limits catch tonnages for the remaining vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>The evidence from the computer modelling in South Australia indicates that the most desirable course would be to close the fishery completely, perhaps for 15 or more years. Of course, that has very significant consequences for those who have invested heavily in boats and equipment to exploit that fishery. That example clearly underlines the difference between ecologically managing a resource and managing the industry which is based on the exploitation of that resource. Graeme O'Neill further states:</PARA>
<PARA>  A similar crash is looming for the orange roughie, a deep-sea species that has been intensively fished for only half a decade. Scientists have recently discovered that most orange roughies in our restaurants are at least twice the age of the people eating them. </PARA>
<PARA>This species is well over 30 years of age before it reaches sexual maturity. On the discovery of that fishery, fishermen went out without any controls at all and grossly over-exploited it before there was any knowledge of the life cycle of the fish, the rate of their growth, the age of their sexual maturity and so on. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Some were fingerlings when John Batman sailed over their spawning grounds in Bass Strait to found the city of Melbourne 150 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>That indicates that we now know how slowly these fish grow. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA>  What is happening in Australia is part of a global trend. Fisheries are being subjected to enormous pressure from larger, more powerful boats, equipped with refrigeration to store their catch, and sonar to find it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Technology has made the contest between hunter and hunted unequal. The imbalance became an obscenity in the 1980s with the advent of drift-netting in the open ocean. Thousands of lethal curtains of fine mesh, up to 70 kilometres long, drape the surface waters of the open ocean, enmeshing millions of fish without regard to their age or rarity, and drowning thousands of dolphins and whales. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are, globally, in a situation where many nations are garnering the last fish out of the ocean. That situation is clearly not sustainable and it flies totally in the face of any concern at all for later generations of humans, let alone the species of fish and the whole ecology of which those fish are a part. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to what the Industry Commission said in relation to this package of legislation. It had witnesses before it, as did the ISTC. The Industry Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Fishermen complained that Commonwealth management was ineffectual, with most fisheries over-fished and all of the developed fisheries grossly over-capitalised. </PARA>
<PARA>Under conditions in which companies are desperately trying to recoup the investment of that capital, it is a very dangerous situation to put the control of those fisheries substantially in the hands of the people who have a financial inducement to regain their capital or at least generate a cash flow so that they can pay the interest on that investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission quoted Crutchfield's summary of the position in 1982--nine years ago--saying that it is still an apt description of Commonwealth fisheries management. The summary states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Given all the time and all the splendid research that has gone into expanding our knowledge of the sea, its living resources, and the technical problems of harvesting them, the results are remarkably disappointing. The number of programmes that have actually succeeded in checking depletion of ocean fish stocks can be counted on the fingers of one hand. And those that have protected the stocks while providing some real improvement in earnings, stability of employment, and ability to withstand the usual economic jolts to which fisheries are subject can be counted by someone with no hands at all. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have a dismal record in relation to the management of our fisheries. The question which must be asked is: will this legislation, which looks to the creation of an Australian Fisheries Management Authority, do any better?  The Australian Democrats believe that it will not do any better and that it will divert attention from the need to set up quite different sorts of structures. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its report, the Industry Commission, pointed, as I have done already, to precisely where that weakness is. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Resource management is a fundamental weakness in current Commonwealth fisheries management. There has been a general reluctance to implement scientific advice where significant reductions in catches are the consequence.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when the management of the ecosystem--management of the fish stocks--from the scientific advice indicates a reduction in catches, if there is a significant commercial element in the control over the decision, the management body, in this case the Australian Fisheries Service, has been very loath to make that hard decision and, in many cases, has failed completely to take it. The Industry Commission goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Recent policy statements have stressed the desirability of a conservative, ecosystem-wide approach to resource management. However, it is clear that this is not done at the moment. The Commission has seen little evidence that coherent resource management is undertaken by the Australian Fisheries Service except perhaps in Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA>It therefore makes the recommendation that:</PARA>
<PARA>  Responsibility for marine resource management should lie with a multi-disciplinary expert body able to determine priorities and integrate scientific, economic, social and policy considerations, reporting to appropriate Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not what we see in this package of Bills. I have criticised the Industry Commission in the past but, in this respect, I believe that it has come down with an excellent report. We put aside its advice at our peril and at the peril of the fisheries which we are hoping to better manage.  The Industry Commission continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The resource management body must have a brief wide enough to span all of these objectives and to deal with foreign and State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The operation of Australian fishermen overseas is something that was ignored in the original package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore not an appropriate function for the body conceived as primarily concerned with a particular objective or sector, such as commercial fishing or conservation. None of the Commonwealth's fisheries management agencies current or proposed meet these criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Industry Commission has said. I turn to the evidence given to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology by Dr Young of the CSIRO. The CSIRO division of fisheries has had a particular and very effective research interest in looking at life cycles of varies species of fish and making recommendations in relation to the sustainability of certain levels of fishing. Dr Young said:</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore doubt that AFMA will have at its disposal either the amount of funds or the continuity of funds to commission the management related research needed to effectively manage the fisheries. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Young points to another defect to which Senator Archer referred earlier. Leaving aside for the moment the question of the confusion over the objectives of AFMA and its membership, Dr Young is expressing grave concern as to whether the structure is such that the funds would be made available. </PARA>
<PARA>  I recall in-committee discussions over this very point. It was stressed that if the funds were to come to some extent from industry, those fisheries which were being better managed and which were generating a cash flow would be capable of also being levied so that they could provide funds for their better management. However, those fisheries that were being overexploited, particularly those that might be closed down altogether, would generate zero funds. Yet they would be precisely the fisheries that would need the funding to learn how better to manage them, supposing that they could be brought back to some sustainable population size which was capable of some sustainable exploitation. Dr Young draws the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>So in the absence of any specific purpose funds for this research in the present Bills, I believe there is a serious deficiency in research funding for natural resource assessment, and the proposed Bills neither recognise the need for this type of research nor identify the agency to set priorities and commission the work. It is my view that an adequately funded resource management body such as that proposed by the Industry Commission would be an appropriate body to determine such research priorities and also to commission the work. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Dr Young from CSIRO supports those recommendations of the Industry Commission. In relation to research, I would reflect briefly on a question which Senator Archer asked Dr Young during that hearing. He asked how well researched the waters were around Australia. Senator Archer will recall Dr Young's reply:</PARA>
<PARA>If we compare them with Europe, North America and the North Atlantic, we are probably 80 years behind them. They are very poorly researched. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only have we a situation that is extremely dangerous in terms of looking forward but we have not done very well in the past. We are building a house of cards on the inadequacy of our previous research. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry, Science and Technology Committee heard calls for a far greater focus on fisheries resource management--from such diverse sources as the Industry Commission, CSIRO Division of Fisheries, public sector union delegates and the Australian Fisheries Service itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government responded with no fewer than 80 amendments, 21 of which are responses to those originally proposed by the Democrats. I stress that very early on we put forward a large number of amendments. Leaving all that aside, we still only put forward those amendments in an attempt to improve this totally inadequate legislation. We believe that the amendments have improved it, but that it is still inadequate. The amendments make significant changes that are consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, but they do not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA>  While we are willing to cooperate with the Government to help it improve its own legislation, we must point out that the Government has ignored our request to take more time to get the matter right. Instead, the Government prefers to push these Bills through at the earliest opportunity. What has happened today with the collapse of one Bill and the earlier debate of this legislation is a further speeding up of this very important package of legislation. Amendments were being drafted and altered shortly before the Committee considered them. Often amendments were given to us that had not been properly considered. It was a messy, breathless process. What was needed was a total rethink, and it is still needed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission has still to come forward with its final report. The ESD process, which the Government itself has created, has not yet come forward with a final report. The Democrats are not convinced that the proposal which the Committee has made and which has been accepted by the Minister to the effect that there will be a review in 12 months time is the best way to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  The basic philosophy in these Bills has been around for a long time. Senator Archer outlined just how long it took to get these Bills in place. We suspect that if there is a review which is started even before 12 months--and it takes a similar length of time to modify the legislation as this package of legislation has taken--by that time it is very likely that many of the important fisheries in this country will be totally beyond the point where they will sustain in anything like the near future, say in the next 100 years, any reasonable level of exploitation. That would be a disaster for the people of this country, for the fish stocks and for the ecosystems of which they are a part. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a reflection on this Government that, having committed itself, at least in principle and in name, to ecologically sustainable development, when actually faced with legislation it is turning its back on such development. This package of legislation puts in place a program for the commercial management of the exploitation of a natural resource. Despite all the amendments--80 of them--that the Minister has accepted, it is still basically a commercial management process that we are addressing here. It ignores the fundamental importance of managing a natural resource in a sustainable way. That is what this Parliament should be attempting to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We should be debating here this afternoon not so much the content of this package of fisheries Bills but the reasons why we have before us and why we have been forced to deal with such an inadequate and incompetent package of legislation. As a member of the Industry, Science and Technology Committee, I have been part of the struggle to salvage something workable and acceptable from a package of legislation cobbled together, for whatever reason, by a special unit which had had no experience in preparing these regulatory Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To that extent, I acknowledge the enormous work put in by the Committee. The result that we have before us is in a far better form than otherwise would have been the case, but it is still legislation with which I have some difficulty. I commend Committee members for the way in which they worked assiduously to look at the flaws in the legislation that had been presented to us and to try to work through a series of amendments to improve the legislation. I single out my colleague Senator Archer specifically for the amount of work he did and the way in which he was prepared and willing to negotiate with the Minister and the departmental officers to work through this maze. Senator Archer deserves commendation for the amount of extraordinary effort that he put in to achieve that objective. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have no idea, nor do I wish to know, what departmental power struggles led to what we have before us. I simply say that I hope the Department has learned a valuable lesson about the far-reaching results, not to mention extra work for the Parliament, that such an incompetent and incomplete piece of legislation can cause. After months of work, weeks of evidence and a mountain of research, we find ourselves at a point of no return. As Senator Coulter said, the Bill, which was originally scheduled for Thursday, has come on at short notice today, which is typical of the whole procedure. Had it not been for the Opposition pressing the point earlier in the piece, since the Australian Democrats supported the Government in the initial stages, we might not have been debating, as we are today, a piece of legislation that has rightly been heavily amended. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that the industry needs legislation, and it needs it now. Even with the 70-odd or 80-odd amendments that we have as part of this package, I still harbour some grave doubts about the measures before us. I suppose that the only saving grace of the whole exercise is that we have extracted from the Minister a promise that the legislation will be reviewed again by the Committee in 12 months time. That state of affairs leaves a somewhat near enough is good enough situation. In fact, in evidence put before the Committee, it was suggested to us that we should put this legislation through without the amendments and then patch it up afterwards. That was the evidence presented to the Committee as to the course of action we should take.</PARA>
<PARA>  Does anyone in this chamber need to be reminded that that is not what is expected of us? I think not. We are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that legislation, when it passes through this chamber, is the best legislation possible for the needs of those in the community whom it will affect. That is our job; that is our responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  Considering that the lifetime of an Act of parliament is some 10 years and that in that time it affects the lives and livelihoods of countless thousands of people, is it any wonder that concern is being expressed by speakers in the debate at the situation that has occurred over recent months with this legislation?  Whilst I have doubts about the net effects of the package before us, I however trust that it will be effective, that it will meet the objectives that have been laid down, that it will be made to work and that we will have the opportunity over the course of the next 12 months to monitor very carefully the implementation of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  While it is one of the worst examples of what I would describe as legislative ineptitude that I have encountered in some 12 years in politics, it is surely symptomatic of the increasing number of bandaid type Bills that the Senate finds before it. Unfortunately, this is no longer the rare, exceptional case. I am uncomfortable, even after the exhaustive resuscitation of this package by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, about letting loose this package on a ailing, $1 billion industry. We are talking about a very significant industry within this country. Frankly, we have been cornered because of the necessity to get some elements of the package operational urgently, and I accept that some elements need to be put in place at the earliest opportunity. If it were not for that promise of another appraisal after 12 months, I would not find myself able to support the package today. I do so reluctantly. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need fisheries legislation--it is long overdue--and we all recognise that the fishing industry is fighting a losing battle, in some instances against the environment and in other instances against its own greed. We know that there are severe problems in many Commonwealth fisheries and that, with a few exceptions, they are overcapitalised and in some instances depleted. We know that the fishing industry has often been unprepared to accept scientific evidence that does not necessarily agree with its point of view in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>  I well understand that because I had experience in the Tonkin Government as Minister of Fisheries. I well understand the implications of trying to advise a fishery and people involved in that fishery that, if they continued to take the resource at current levels, they would have no resource within a set period of time; in other words, they wanted to ignore reality for the short term. I understand the difficulties of having to get that scientific message through to people in some sections of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The South Australian Act introduced in 1981-82 put in place management of the various fisheries throughout that State. It has developed some role models over the course of the last 10 years, which I will refer to in a moment. There ought to be the example that is followed in many instances of putting in place the management plan of the fisheries that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the fishing industry needs good management and it needs it urgently. I do not find that this package, with its complex edifice of power, provides it. So the Australian Fisheries Management Authority replaces the Minister as the maker of day to day administration and policy decisions. We still have huge unknowns and confusion about where the roles of AFMA and departmental officers will overlap. In the confusion of this package, perhaps they will fail to act in time. It is hoped that at the 12-month review we can have some frank discussions on the short term outcomes of some of those structures, which I think are vague. </PARA>
<PARA>  The prime purpose of these Bills is to achieve optimum utilisation of our resources while at the same time preventing over-exploitation. In that respect, I commend the proposal to endorse the banning of driftnet fishing, a practice which could bring about the total destruction of the world's marine resources if left unchecked. It is interesting and commendable to note overseas experience, where a number of countries, including the United States, are moving towards the banning of driftnet fishing. It is a move in the right direction. It is a positive aspect of the package of Bills that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should also be noted that the package is being rushed through before two other major studies on fishery management have been completed. Previous speakers have made reference to that, in particular Senator Coulter. That appears to me to be illogical. One report that we await is the Industry Commission's report on cost recovery for managing fisheries, an exceptionally important inquiry into cost sharing arrangements between the Government and fishermen. It should have been considered. It is an important review. Put simply, it appears to me that the legislation replaces bad and complex management with confusion and is delivered without all the relevant facts to hand. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report of the Industry Commission, which has been referred to, surfacing during the course of this legislation through the committee stage, was another important factor. Many important issues which should have been addressed are not addressed. An example of that is that the Bills do not take the opportunity to regulate activities of our fishing crews around the world, yet the Law of the Sea Convention provides us with an obligation to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think Senator Coulter referred to the need to balance development of the fishing industry, exploitation and sustainability. Marine scientists are urging drastic reductions in catches from Australian fisheries. According to the South Australian Department's model, if the southern shark fishery was closed down today, it would take 15 years for a sustainable level to return in that fishery. That is almost frightening when the implications for that one fishery are considered. It is frightening when we consider the response to a question from Senator Archer in the committee stage that, in terms of available scientific data upon which to base management plans, we are decades behind countries overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I have said much against the way in which this legislation was drawn and presented to us and about the inadequacies of departmental and industry management, I want to take this opportunity to refer to what I think are some well managed fisheries, which were also the subject of evidence put before the Committee. I referred just a moment ago to one such fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>  For many years I have praised the efforts of the Spencer Gulf and West Coast Fishermen's Association in South Australia, which could well be regarded as a role model of how a fishery could and should be run. I hasten to add that I well understand that no two fisheries are the same. One example from Spencer Gulf in South Australia may perhaps not have direct relevance to one in the Gulf of Carpentaria because of the number of boats in the particular fishery and a whole range of competing factors and pressures that are applied, but I hasten to add that, in this fishery, people recognised a depleting resource, were prepared to accept the scientific evidence, were prepared to sit down and put in place a management plan and were prepared to accept the disciplines that a management plan applies to a fishery. Today that fishery and the fishermen in it are reaping the reward, with cost effective fishing in terms of the cost of going out for the catch and the return that they are getting. </PARA>
<PARA>   While much debate on this legislation has referred to the environmental danger of overfishing and the depletion of stocks, the Spencer Gulf and West Coast Fishermen's Association has had in place management strategies which have ensured that it minimise the risk of stock depletion through overfishing by developing appropriate harvesting objectives. It opens and closes the fishery at short notice--at a day's notice. If the size of the stock the fishermen are catching is down, the fishery is closed for one, two, three or four weeks, whatever the case might be, until the stocks are of a size that ensures that there is continuing stock available. The fishermen do not go in and harvest and harvest until the point is reached where they are not getting a return for the cost of going out in that particular fishery. It has also set clear goals to optimise the value of the catch in order to maintain stable economic returns in the fishery. The fishermen have been prepared, as I said before, to abide by the discipline of that fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>   I well remember that once in 1982 when the management plan was put in place a skipper of a particular prawn boat breached the management plan. As Minister at that time, I was asked by the fishery--the fishermen, the association--to apply a severe penalty. It was applied with the support of the association for the breach of that management plan. We took the boat out of the fishery for something like a month in what was the prime prawn catching season. It is interesting to note that since that time no prawn boat has breached the fishery management plan because all the fishermen recognise the bottom line dollar cost of the breach of that management plan. The disciplines can work where there is a coordinated effort and a willingness to understand scientific evidence, to participate in the establishment of the management plans and then make sure those management plans work. They can only work if discipline is applied. </PARA>
<PARA>   In the 1990-91 annual report of the Spencer Gulf and West Coast Fishermen's Association it is interesting to note that the fishermen themselves have allocated $170,000 for prawns statistics and development of a database. They have also allocated $40,000 towards reproductive research. As well as committing their association to a two-year research program into juvenile prawns, they are developing an electronic black box automatic surveillance system. </PARA>
<PARA>  While there are many fisheries urgently requiring more efficient management techniques, it is clear that there are some, such as the Spencer Gulf and West Coast Fishermen's Association, which are operating effectively and responsibly. I suggest to honourable senators that the reason is not only the leadership of the association which recognised that long term planning required management structures such as this, but also that the fishermen in the fishery started to reap the dollar rewards of the management plans. As we see, they are now ploughing dollars back into the fishery for research for the development of databases for this ongoing process so that we get to understand the fishery well. It is fisheries such as this that the Government should be consulting to avoid some of the pitfalls that can come through the establishment of management structures. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the most important components in the management of a fishery is the industry and mutual cooperation between fishermen, biologists, managers and governments. It is of paramount importance that there is a clear understanding and participation in the development of those management plans. This has been exemplified by the fishery that I have referred to which, for the last eight years, has provided vessels and funds for research with the department. It has played an active role in research management and cooperated with the appropriate government bodies at a State and Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA>  I use this example deliberately to highlight what I consider to be the ineptitude displayed by this Government in providing incorrectly drafted legislation designed to make major changes to an industry that recognises there is room for improvement and that sections of the industry are facing extinction. But, at the same time, the industry has areas which have operated and are operating efficiently and profitably. With such a solid base for improving administration and efficiency within the industry, this Government has demonstrated that in those two areas alone it has been incompetent in the way it has handled this matter and brought it before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>   The responsibility surely is that of the Minister and the Government of the day to ensure that the legislation which is presented to this Parliament, guillotined after an hour's debate in the House of Representatives, pushed through as a matter of urgency, introduced within days of the so-called start-up date, to get it right. They should recognise that they have a basic and fundamental responsibility to get it right before the legislation is introduced. A government that fails to at least take those initial steps is a government that is failing the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to make a few short remarks on this package of Bills. I too want to register my protest at the way the Bills were handled today. We were told at only about 2 o'clock today that the package of Bills was coming on. We were also told that the Bills would not be distributed until 5 o'clock tonight. That does not give honourable senators who are interested in this particular industry the time to put in a well-researched contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   We find these Bills before the House today with 79 amendments. These Bills have been scrutinised by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, then reconsidered by the Committee following a request by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). Also, we were asked to consider the Industry Commission's draft report into the cost recovery of management of fisheries. Today, after months of effort--particularly by Senator Archer, who has put in a marathon effort on the Bills, Senator Coulter, Senator Olsen and also honourable senators from the Government side--the Bill was thrust on us with two hours allowed for preparation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Fisheries Management Bill introduces plans of management of the Commonwealth fisheries, the new rights called statutory fishing rights and fishing permits. The Bill also establishes an offence for taking certain species and bans driftnet fishing in the Australian fishing zone. I certainly concur with that. I think it is a very positive step and one that most young people would certainly be supportive of. The new concept introduces statutory fishing rights and will allow access rights to manage fisheries either on the terms of the certificate or, if not, indefinitely. The concept of fishing permits will apply to developing fisheries, even without a plan of management from AFMA. </PARA>
<PARA>   The Fishing Levy Bill provides for levies to be collected to cover the cost of administering fisheries and collecting research and development levies as well as other contributions for specific fishing matters. The other Bills in the package cover payments of levies by foreign fishing boats in the Australian fishing zone and the allocation of statutory fishing rights in the new fisheries by means of auction, tender or ballot where the plan of management provides this. As well, the Bills cover the transfer of administration to the new authority from the Australian Fisheries Service and the establishment of fishing industry research and development corporations under the Primary Industry and Energy Research and Development Act. This has been a long time coming. </PARA>
<PARA>  To this point, the fishermen have had to pay their fees to a government department, but now those fees will be paid to a statutory authority. The fishermen will pay their way and they will have a say in the running of that authority. That is to be welcomed. My Party represents primary industry and it has always believed that those people who grow, hunt or fish have the right to decide the future of their industries. The setting up of the authority by these Bills certainly gives fishermen that right, and I welcome these Bills for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fishing industry is an important industry for Australia. It is worth over $1 billion in exports--although a lot of imports are coming in too. Billions of dollars would come, I imagine, from the crayfish and the prawns which are exported. The industry is worth more than that when one considers the 4.5 million recreational fisherman who take pleasure in fishing. The industry also creates around 8,000 jobs and it makes a massive contribution to the economy through tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>  These Bills give the industry a management system that is both cost efficient and flexible and one which provides for appropriate scientific and environmental input. This is where Senator Coulter and I have a disagreement. We have spent many hours together on the Committee and I know that he is concerned that the scientific input is not sufficient. Therefore, he will not be joining the Government and the Opposition in supporting these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>  Both the Opposition and the Government recognise that it is important that the 600 to 800 levy payers in the Commonwealth fishery have the right to run their own industry. Whilst we have some doubts about the legislation and some regrets that it has not been handled in a different way, that is why both the Opposition and the Government believe it is important to get the Bills through. </PARA>
<PARA>  The industry has been seeking a cost efficient structure; one that is financially accountable to the industry. The Government's system got a little out of control when it ended up with 110 fishing officers--public servants--being supported by 800 levy payers. As the industry rationalised and increased, the system could not continue as it was because there were more and more public servants being supported by fewer and fewer fishermen. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under AFMA, the industry will now be more cost efficient, with important decisions like the setting of the total allowable catch being made by the board with a large input by scientists. I think that will stave off the fears of the amateur fishermen who have expressed some concern. The eco-management will be balanced, and it is hoped this will all be able to be a part of AFMA's management of the industry. This should be assured by the authority's objective of developing and implementing fishing-specific management plans. It will also set sustainable catch quotas, grant ongoing and temporary access to fishing and fish resources, monitor activities of fishermen, and monitor the performance of each fishery where necessary by restructuring programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The present state of the fishing industry is depressed, as Senator Olsen correctly pointed out to the Senate. The northern prawn fishing fleet will be halved by 1993, with a buy-back program to be paid for by levies placed on the remaining fishermen. The southern shark fishery has been reduced from 3,000 tonnes to 800 tonnes, which has been achieved by methods such as net reduction on each boat. The gemfish quota has been abolished upon scientific recommendation; there are quotas on orange roughy and tuna; and bans will also be placed on at least two other species. That is the environment--of reduced returns and major adjustments--which faces the fishing industry at the moment. All over Australia fishermen are competing against a lot of odds. The ecosystems and the breeding grounds are being broken down and used for tourist development, which is having an effect on fisheries. There has been further destruction of the fishing habitat, and that is also having an effect. </PARA>
<PARA>  I support the Bills because I believe the fishing industry requires an authority to run that industry, and this set of legislation allows that to occur. It is very difficult to draft legislation for the fishing industry; it is an incomplete and imprecise industry. It is not as though one plants, grows and reaps; it is a hunting industry where one goes out and takes a chance and battles the elements. For that reason, it is difficult to legislate for. There will be a revision of the Bills in 12 months time, which is also supported by the industry. I have been told, `Let us get in there; there will be mistakes and we will correct those mistakes, but we have to start somewhere. We have to start with some legislation and we will improve on it as we go through'. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is against that background that both the Government and the Opposition are supporting these Bills. In 12 months time we will again review the legislation and if people--whether they be professional fishermen, environmentalists or recreational fishermen--wish to have some input their concerns will be heard. But let us take the first step of introducing these Bills today and launching the fishing industry into a new era. I offer AFMA my good wishes and wish the fishermen all the success that this new statutory authority will afford them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support the Fisheries Administration Bill 1991 and six related Bills. I say at the outset that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology had very useful discussions during the process of examining the Bills and certain very useful amendments were provided. I have never been a great admirer of the Industry Commission, but I pay tribute to Dr Gentle who represented the Commission in giving information to our Committee. I commence my remarks by quoting from the Commission's report entitled Cost Recovery for Managing Fisheries,  which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Crutchfield's summary of the position in 1982 is still an apt description of Commonwealth fisheries management. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given all the time and splendid research that has gone into expanding our knowledge of the sea, its living resources, and the technical problems of harvesting them, the results are remarkably disappointing. The number of programmes that have actually succeeded in checking depletion of ocean fish stocks can be counted on the fingers of one hand. And those that have protected the stocks while providing some real improvement in earnings, stability of employment, and ability to withstand the usual economic jolts to which fisheries  are subject can be counted by someone with no hands at all. </PARA>
<PARA>It is against that background that the legislation was introduced, and it is now before this chamber in its amended form. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation is not just about looking at the way in which fisheries operate now, but also about the way we protect them for future generations. We have no right as a community to deplete those fisheries in such a way that there would be nothing left for other generations. Obviously AFMA, which will be brought into existence as a result of these Bills, will have a great responsibility. It will have to look at the efficiency of the way it catches fish, maintain conditions where there will be sustainable catches and move away from having people rush in with over-capitalisation and a dog-eat-dog attitude. I guess that this attitude was epitomised by one fisherman who was quoted in the press in Queensland some years ago as saying, `If there is one fish out there, I want to be the person to catch it'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand from evidence given by the fishermen that their understanding is now much greater. They are more enlightened and have a different attitude towards the notion of the sustainable catch and looking after the fisheries. They have complained for some time about the fact that they were contributing considerable amounts of money to fisheries management, and that they were not getting the sorts of returns they expected in terms of the quality and quantity of that management provision. With AFMA instituted through this legislation, they will now have that input as individuals to their own organisations and people will be elected to that body. Their organisations will also have input. </PARA>
<PARA>  With those rights to do that will go the obligation to maintain the fisheries, as I mentioned before, and to look at the whole marine ecology. That will not only ensure that there is not the old attitude of considering only whether we conserve or sustain a particular type of fish, but also show how that type of fish or other marine animal fits into the total ecology. Sometimes, depleting one particular species will automatically naturally deplete or eliminate other species. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not think that the legislation is perfect. I will certainly be watching very keenly in the next 12 months to see how those fishermen perform and what they do. As a member of the Committee, it is my view that it should be looking at what is happening much earlier than at the end of 12 months. If the fishermen make mistakes and do not give the sort of quality management that they expect of others, they can expect some really harsh criticism from us and some very forceful changes from the Government. At least it will give them the opportunity to make good on what they say is needed in the fisheries. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the legislation. I wanted to make those points so that people in the industry did not think that now they have the legislation they want, in the main, nobody will be watching to make sure that they carry out those responsibilities they fought so much to get. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to thank those honourable senators who participated in the second reading debate. They were substantially the same senators who participated in the extensive committee process, in which I played a small part at some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Fisheries Administration Bill 1990 and six related Bills that we are dealing with today in the second reading debate are, by their very nature, complex and far reaching. On the one hand, the legislation has to deal with the very important issue of the conservation of a community owned resource and recognise the needs of the commercial fishing industry and those who rely on it for their livelihood, and balance that with the interests of those who engage in fishing for recreation, which is a very large number of Australians amongst whom I am not to be counted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation has been drafted to give effect to a fisheries policy statement first released by the Government at the end of 1989. As will be only too familiar to the participants in the debate, the key elements concern detailed objectives which place particular emphasis on the principles of ecologically sustainable development; the establishment of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority; the creation of the Fishing Industry Policy Council; enhanced emphasis on plans of management as a fisheries management tool; the creation of specific fishing concessions and formal recognition of statutory fishing rights; the enhanced role and recognition of management advisory committees; and new and improved administration and funding arrangements for fisheries' R&amp;, which is very important. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have had the opportunity through the Senate committee process and the winter recess to further strengthen the legislation. I believe that this detailed consultation process has addressed all the major concerns of the legislation and, as a consequence, the legislation has been improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are all entitled to our view. We will see which is the majority view in just a moment. This has resulted in a considerable number of amendments being considered and agreed to. The amendments affect three of the seven Bills, namely, the Fisheries Administration Bill 1990, the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 and the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The explicit recognition of ecologically sustainable development is particularly significant in a policy sense. I welcome those changes. The changes made cover three main areas--more explicit enunciation of ecologically sustainable development principles in the objectives of the legislation; the provision of temporary order facilities; and the extension of plans of management to cover, where appropriate, recreational fishing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology spent a lot of time dealing with this legislation. Many honourable senators obviously put in a number of hours on their own research in addition to that and in consultation with the industry. Many came to it with a background of interest and expertise. It was one example of the Senate committee process making a substantial contribution. On behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), I thank the Committee for its consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>  I should mention before I conclude, in the interests of being comprehensive about the amendments, that there were also a number of drafting and other amendments and related consequential changes, thus meaning a large body of amendments, but the three principles I outlined go to the essence of the changes which the amendments bring about. </PARA>
<PARA>  As has already been mentioned--and this is an important point to make in conclusion--the Minister has given an undertaking that the operation of this legislation will be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in 12 months time. I take it that is because the members of the Committee feel they have not given fisheries enough attention recently and they would like to give it a bit more time. I understand that view. Nevertheless--to be serious--as was mentioned in the debate by honourable senators from all sides, it is an important agreement and it is the sort of process that can emerge from this committee process. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not always regard the standing committee process of reviewing legislation as a gigantic reform, but sometimes it does do a lot of very good work. This ongoing reference is the sort of thing which can flow from it and be beneficial. This is an opportunity to review the legislation as a whole and, in particular, the improvements presented by way of the amendments that are to be introduced when we get to the committee stage, which I understand may be tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>  We now have a piece of legislation that has been improved by the committee process. That will be a substantial step forward in dealing with what is a very important industry for Australia. An undertaking for a review in 12 months time will ensure that, if the legislation has shortcomings which are a source of continuing and justifiable concern to the industry or are in conflict with the ESD principles, we can address them quickly and make the necessary changes. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate and commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>  That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will amend the Broadcasting Act 1942 to:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) require that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal be given prior written notice of acquisitions of interests which could contravene that Act, including a contravention that would arise if the interests of associates were aggregated;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) increase the ABT's powers to gather information on the ownership and control arrangements for media outlets to assist the Tribunal in determining whether the ownership and control rules of the Act have been, or are likely to be, contravened; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) strengthen the powers of the Federal Court to protect licensees and other companies and to prevent, or prevent the continuation of, contraventions of the ownership and control rules, either on an interim basis to enable proposed acquisitions of interests to be appropriately investigated or on a more permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes will not affect the limits currently provided for under the Act. The Government has no wish to interfere in arrangements which comply with the letter and the spirit of the Act. The changes simply strengthen the capacity of the ABT to gather information and ensure that acquisitions which do not comply with the spirit and letter of the Act can be prevented if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the limits will be contravened. </PARA>
<PARA>Persons acquiring media interests in good faith have no reason to fear these amendments, but it is an entirely different case for anyone seeking to acquire real control over media outlets in contravention of the Act. The Government will not stand by and allow the Act to be ignored or circumvented. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will make it more difficult for people to evade the legitimate requirements of the Act. I believe they should, therefore, receive universal support from within this Parliament and from all Australians concerned with the independence of our media from improper influences. </PARA>
<PARA>Passing to the details of the Bill, I refer to clauses 5 and 6, which introduce the prior notice requirement that will apply to the majority of acquisitions. </PARA>
<PARA>Naturally prior notice will not be required of persons who are unaware of an acquisition, which is quite possible given the tracing requirements of the Act. Those people will be required to give notice when they become aware of the acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA>The notification requirements will only apply to interests which could give rise to a contravention of the ownership and control rules of the Act, which include the foreign ownership and cross media rules. It will not apply to the vast range of acquisitions which will not have that effect. But, for the first time, the obligation to notify the ABT will relate to the acquisition of interests, rather than to the more limited concept of a transaction. Persons who will acquire interests by way of gift or through the operation of law will now have to notify the ABT, rather than wait for their interests to be discovered by other means. </PARA>
<PARA>Associate relationships will also be the basis of a requirement to notify the ABT if the aggregated interests of the associates could amount to a contravention of the Act. Those relationships may be evidence of persons acting in concert, but they will certainly not, taken on their own, be conclusive. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of the notification requirements, and of the related information gathering powers, is not to remove the fundamental duty on the ABT to establish that a contravention of the Act has occurred. People will not be required to prove themselves innocent under the Broadcasting Act, any more than they are under other Acts. The aim of the requirements is simply to enable the ABT to gather information in a timely fashion which will enable it to make decisions on an informed basis and, if appropriate, to discharge its onus of proof before the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Because the definition of associates in the Bill is relevant only to a notification requirement, it has been cast widely. However, the Government has no wish to intrude more than is necessary into the legitimate activities of individuals, even that limited class of persons who have interests which fall within the notification requirements. Consequently, the ABT will have the power, by notice published in the Gazette, to exclude certain classes of people. The ABT will be able to exercise this power either in relation to particular inquiries or generally and the Government expects it to use this power to the maximum appropriate extent. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the ABT will not be able to negate the policy of the amendments by use of this power. They can only exercise it in relation to interests not likely to contribute to contraventions of the ownership and control rules and any determination they make will be a disallowable instrument; to be tabled and capable of disallowance by either House of  the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Associate relationships, and evidence gathered as a result of the notification requirements or of the strengthened information gathering powers, will be evidence of the matters to which they relate and will be considered by the ABT in exercising any of its powers under the ownership and control part of the Act, in accordance with proposed sections 90HB and 92EB. </PARA>
<PARA>The strengthened information gathering powers under section 89X (clause 4) will combine with the already extensive powers of the ABT to inquire into acquisitions, and proposed acquisitions, of interests to give the ABT the muscle to discover the reality of arrangements often obscured within a maze of legal minutiae. An important change in the section 89X powers lies in the reduction of the minimum time in which a person must respond to an ABT request for information from 21 days to 7 days, or less if the ABT considers that reasonable. This is essential to enable the ABT to react before acquisitions are completed, at least by applying for interim orders from the Federal Court. However, it does not allow the ABT to abuse its power. Under administrative law principles, the ABT must act reasonably, and I expect that it would be rare for a requirement to supply information in the shorter periods envisaged to be considered reasonable unless there is an urgent need for a decision or court application. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 will introduce new confidentiality requirements in relation to information about prospective acquisitions to protect the interests of individuals during ABT investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 9 strengthens the powers of the Federal Court to make orders. The scope of those orders will now extend to any contravention, or possible contravention, of the ownership and control rules and to actions or things likely to affect the ability of licensees to comply with their licence conditions or to provide the licensed service or choose programming. The orders may be made on application of the ABT and may be either interim or permanent. </PARA>
<PARA>Interim orders may be sought either in their own right as applications for orders of an interim nature under subsection 92P (1) or (2) of the Act as proposed to be amended, or under subsection 92P (6) of the Act as an adjunct to an application for permanent relief under subsection 92P (1) or (2). Naturally, it will be up to the Court to determine whether an interim order is warranted. It will weigh all the circumstances and, I am sure, will act if there are reasonable grounds for doing so, whether in support of an application for permanent orders or in support of an ABT inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed power of the Federal Court to protect  licensees and other companies will be similar to current powers of the ABT under section 92M, but will be able to be made at any time, even before the transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be no requirement for the Federal Court to wait until a contravention or proposed contravention becomes a breach of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The exercise of this extended range of powers by the Federal Court would be expensive and necessarily public. Persons wishing to acquire interests will probably prefer to avoid this. In such cases, it would be prudent for those persons to approach the Tribunal as soon as possible to discuss potential problems. The Tribunal is able to examine proposals and, if satisfied that there are no real causes for concern, can inform those persons of that fact, thus allowing them to proceed with the acquisition in full confidence. The Tribunal's provisional clearance, which I hope will become a normal feature of transactions involving media interests, does not require legislation. It is simply an incident of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA>However, to facilitate this function, and to ensure that conditions can be agreed between parties and the ABT, the Bill includes provision for the ABT to accept undertakings under proposed section 92NA. If the ABT accepts that those undertakings are adequate, there will be no need for the ABT to seek Federal Court orders that might prevent the acquisition. But the Federal Court will also be given powers under section 92P to make orders to enforce, or prevent a breach of, those undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill as an appropriate means of ensuring that the ABT can act to investigate media acquisitions that might threaten the public interest without the unwarranted and draconian step of casting the onus on the purchaser to prove innocent intent. We must never forget that it is for the ABT to establish that there may be contraventions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I expect that the main effect of this Bill will be apparent in the limited number of times the powers of the ABT and Court are used. I feel sure that purchasers and ABT alike will be anxious to sort out any potential problems without the need to resort to those powers, and I think that will be a great improvement on the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>But the powers will be there if needed. And I believe they will ensure that the Broadcasting Act can be applied appropriately and in a timely fashion until the Government's more wide reaching review of broadcasting regulation is in place. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. The greater efficiency with which the ABT will be able to identify matters requiring exhaustive investigation as a result of the prior notification requirement should offset the cost of monitoring those notifications and the potential to avoid blatant contraventions and the expensive process of trying to rectify contraventions through ABT inquiry could result in savings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991 replaces the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1990 which was withdrawn after concerns were raised by the legal profession, insurers, shippers and carriers. One wonders whether the Government is in control of its own legislative program, considering the problems it is having with its legislation and rushing it through, as appears obvious from the previous Bills we have dealt with. This necessitates that they be looked at again at an early stage. I wonder whether that is the situation with this Bill which was brought to the fore last year but was withdrawn after concerns were raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Bill seeks to update the rules regarding the responsibilities and liabilities of those who carry goods by sea and those who consign them. It seeks to incorporate amendments to the current international convention, the Hague Rules, to bring the procedures up to current day practical standards in Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA>  A second part of the Bill seeks to introduce into Australian legislation, but not yet proclaim, a more recent international convention than the one provided for in the Hague Rules. This convention sets out the rules known as the Hamburg Rules. It was the most recent convention and meeting on the carriage of goods by sea. It places a greater liability on the carrier. The carrier's liability is also extended to include the time that cargo is on the wharf. These rules, unlike the Hague Rules, would apply to intrastate trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  In considering this Bill and all of its ramifications, the Liberal and National parties have consulted very widely with a large number of people who are involved in the carriage of goods by sea. We have spoken with such broad based groups  as the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Mining Industry Council, the ANL, the Australian National Maritime Association, the Peak Shippers Association, the Shipping Users Group, the Wheat Board, the Wool Corporation, Conaust, various solicitors who have interests in these matters, the Grains Council, the Insurance Council of Australia, the Law Council, the National Farmers Federation, stevedores and shipping companies. In looking at this Bill, and the Hague Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules that are all the subject of this Bill, the Liberal and National parties have consulted widely. I pay tribute to the shadow Minister for Land Transport, Mr Sharp, for his work and his broad consultation and also for the work done by his office on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current Australian arrangements regarding the liability for cargo carried by sea are based upon the Hague Rules, an international convention agreed to in 1924, which are embodied in the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act of 1924. The termination of the Hague Rules is now outdated. For example, valuations are in terms of the gold standard and have been amended to reflect developments in international finance by the adoption, for example, of the modern International Monetary Fund currency unit--the special drawing right. The Hague Rules were also drawn up before the development of containerisation and cannot accommodate the modern practice of aggregating many smaller packages in one container which, under the old rules, rates as only one package. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments to the Hague Rules which this Bill embraces would bring Australian law into conformity with modern international practice, as reflected in the Visby and SDR Protocols to the Hague Rules. The Hamburg Rules provided for in the Hamburg Convention of 1978, as well as defining the limits of liability, also substantially increase the liability of carriers for loss of or damage to cargo. They extend liability to cover the time that cargo is on the wharf, in addition to the time that it is in a vessel, that is, for the time that the carrier has taken charge of the cargo. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hamburg Rules have not yet come into force. Twenty ratifications are required for this and to date only 19 ratifications have been lodged, although I understand that the twentieth--that of Zambia--is rumoured to be imminent. The Visby and SDR Protocols to the Hague Rules are not contentious in themselves. They bring the Hague Rules into line with modern developments and practices that were not in place and not relevant when the rules were first introduced in 1924. However, shippers, owners and consigners of cargo are concerned that the process of change in the liability regime will stop with these updates, leaving them with imbalances in liability between the consigner and the carrier that in their view exist under the current regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  Shippers see their interests as better served by a new set of maritime laws that were being developed even as the SDR amendments to the Hague Rules were being made. They see their interests better served by the Hamburg Rules. As well as defining more precisely the limits of liability, these rules focus on the liability of the carrier, with a far more exacting regime in that regard. The benefits argued by shippers are that since they know the exact limits of liability and since its coverage is wider than under the Hague Rules, they are able to determine their insurance requirements according to the residual risk rather than take out cover against undefined limitation of the carrier's responsibility.   A problem arises in that none of the states that have ratified the Hamburg Rules are what we might call like countries or countries with which Australia trades a lot or which have the same sort of trading culture that Australia has. That is, I might say, with the exception of the Federal Republic of Germany which in fact hosted the conference at which the Hamburg Rules were obviously adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>  So far, support has been confined mainly to lesser developed countries, although some countries, for example Canada, have shown interest in the development of Australia's position on the adoption of the Hamburg Rules. Bureaucratic obstacles, uncertainty about the commercial impact of the rules, and political commercial conflict between established maritime countries and developing maritime countries have all been canvassed as reasons for lack of support. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides for acceptance of the Hamburg Rules once the appropriate time has been reached for adherence to them by Australia. This would, of necessity, be after their entry into force, that is, one year after the twentieth country has ratified the Hamburg Rules. They would then be implemented by Australia by proclamation, if this legislation is passed, at a time to be determined by the government of the day and without need for further recourse to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill does not specify what criteria would trigger the proclamation. As there was some concern about this, the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communication and Infrastructure for investigation of this and other issues. At that hearing, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown) expressed strong objection to including prescriptive criteria in the Bill on the grounds that trying to define an appropriate spectrum of trading countries could not take into account changing trade circumstances and would cause unnecessarily complicated provisions to be drafted and an attempt made to have them included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister has said that it was important that it be done at a time that was suited to Australia's interests. We in the Liberal Party, the National Party and also the Australian Democrats agree that we would have liked to enshrine that in some sort of legislation, but the drafting of it became very difficult because it was trying to pre-empt or trying to guess now what might be the appropriate set of guidelines to consider in three years time. The Committee went along with the Minister's argument but on the understanding that he will give a specific undertaking that the section of the Bill dealing with the Hamburg Rules will not be proclaimed until it is in Australia's commercial interests so to do. That will be when our major trading partners have also agreed and when it is appropriate for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister also agreed that he would give an undertaking to have comprehensive consultations with the industry and shippers prior to proclamation taking place. That was the result of the discussions on the Bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I must say that there was broad acceptance among the Government, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats of what needs to be done. At the time of speaking we have not yet resolved a form of words which will put into effect what we have agreed upon. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have three amendments to move in the committee stage. As I see it, they are the proper way to put into effect what has been agreed upon at the Senate Standing Committee's hearings into the matter. As I say, until now there has been no resolution. I will speak to and move the amendments at the appropriate time. The Standing Committee and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills were concerned at the open-endedness of the arrangements proposed by the Government for the Hamburg Rules. The Government wanted us to agree with the Bill at this stage but not proclaim it until it suited Australia. To a certain extent everyone is in agreement with that. However, it could mean that legislation passed now could drift on for five, 10, 15 or 35 years without ever being proclaimed. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was particularly concerned that there should be some limit to the time during which that piece of legislation could sit on the statute books without being proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>  By way of amendment, we have proposed that if nothing is done within three years, if there has not been some resolution--I hope that the Minister and the Australian Democrats might just listen to this--that section of the Bill about the introduction of the Hamburg Rules will be repealed. The amendment goes on to say that will be done unless the Parliament or the Government does one of two things:  either resolves that we as a parliament introduce and make effective the Hamburg Rules or, alternatively, both Houses</PARA>
<PARA>of parliament resolve to give it another three years. In that way the legislation has to come back to the Parliament and the Parliament will have the carriage of the Bill;  it will ensure that parliament does not lose control of it and parliament can then decide, firstly, to start it straight away or, secondly, to give the Government another three years to deal with the matter. That is eminently sensible. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister is concerned that if nothing happens the Bill will be repealed. There is also some concern amongst the Democrats that that might be the case. The Minister might try to say that it should be the case that if nothing is done within three years the legislation will automatically commence within three years. It would seem to be inappropriate that a Bill with the consequences of the Hamburg Rules could be introduced within three years simply by the effluxion of time. That seems to be the wrong way to introduce legislation and to make legislation effective. It is my submission that it is far better to have the legislation repealed unless something is done, rather than--as the Government proposes--to have it start unless something is done. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might also add that the Minister may say that we will provide that the legislation starts in three years unless something is done, but if the Government does not like it at the time, it can move to have it repealed. If that happens and the situation in parliament is the same then as it is today, the Senate may well decide that the Bill should be repealed. The Bill would then go to the lower House where the government of the day which has the numbers would not decide that. The Senate will be saying that the legislation should be repealed and the lower House will be saying that it should not be repealed. Therefore, nothing can happen because it requires both Houses of parliament to agree. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the eventuality that the Government's proposed amendment succeeds, the Bill will have commenced. The legislation would be introduced even though this independent chamber of the Parliament has decided that it should not be. What we are trying to achieve is best achieved by saying,  `Look, it is repealed; but if both Houses of parliament then decide that it should be commenced, it can go ahead or if both Houses of parliament decide that it should get another three years, it will go ahead'. Having the automatic repeal provision ensures that the Government brings the legislation to the attention of the Parliament. It makes sure that the Parliament then has the opportunity to consider the situation as it applies at that particular day. The Bill then stays within the control of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The concern of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was that this legislation should not just be passed today and possibly proclaimed at any time between now and anywhere up to 35 years time. By having an automatic repeal provision that the legislation can be introduced straight away or it can be given another three years would seem to me to be the best way of ensuring what all parties--including the Government, the Opposition, the Democrats, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Standing Committee--want. It is my submission that that is the best way to achieve it. No doubt, we will talk further about that when the Bill comes to the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has stated that there will be no costs, revenues or savings to the Government arising from the Bill. This does ignore any longer term tax revenue implications resulting from the transfer of insurance writing offshore that might result from any liability transfers to carriers. I might add that only 4 per cent of Australian cargo trade is carried in Australian ships. The Insurance Council of Australia Ltd has estimated that the value of this lost insurance business could be as high as $60m per year. In general, both shippers and carriers are in favour of the adoption of the first part of the Bill;  that is, the Hague Rules and the Visby Protocol. The legal dispute that surrounded the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1990, as to whether it would achieve the desired result, has been settled to the satisfaction of the industry, shippers and the legal fraternity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Several shippers and their representatives have expressed concern that the issue of liability for damage to and loss of cargo should not end with the Hague Rules and the Visby Protocol.  However, the Government argues that the concern of shippers for a clearer definition of the distribution of liability is met by the Hamburg Rules as their stated wish is for a more equitable distribution. Shippers generally endorse this view, although some qualify their support with the proviso that it should be at such a time when there is international acceptance of the Hamburg Convention, particularly amongst Australia's trading partners. Neither the Bill nor the explanatory memorandum indicates just what would constitute international acceptance of the Hamburg Rules. In our consultations no-one has been able to suggest a benchmark. That is the problem I mentioned before which precludes us from trying to include something in the legislation to address that in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>  The explanatory memorandum does indicate that taking into account the international acceptance of the Rules and domestic interest would trigger the proclamation. The Bill makes no provision for the means by which the government of the day would be expected to gauge and determine acceptance by industry and the community, although this was indicated as a condition for the proclamation in the departmental briefing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under these circumstances the reasons for tying a substantive matter in the first part of the Bill, dealing with the Hague Rules and the Visby Protocol, to the second part of the Bill, dealing with the Hamburg Rules, are not clear. It would have been the hope of the Liberal and National parties that this was divided into two separate Bills. That was spoken about by the relevant shadow Minister's office with the Minister's office. Apparently there could be no agreement reached and the Opposition is not prepared to move to split the legislation into two Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to place on the record that the Opposition's preferred position would have been to have the Hague Rules and the Visby Protocol in one piece of legislation and the Hamburg Rules in another piece of legislation. We have had reservations about the wisdom of the linkage which does not allow discretion to accept one or the other while reserving judgment on or rejecting the other.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I have mentioned, the Minister has given undertakings to set out clearly in his speech the need for general acceptance of the Hamburg Rules by our trading partners before the proclamation is made, to include a commitment that it will be introduced only when it is in Australia's interests to do so and, further, that the legislation will not be proclaimed until Australian industry and users have been consulted. Whilst the Minister has given those undertakings, the Senate will also note when my amendments are moved that we have also included those undertakings as part of my amendments. It is not that we do not accept the Minister's undertakings. On the contrary, they can go into the Bill without any difficulty. One of the amendments we are proposing reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A proclamation must not be made under this section--</PARA>
<PARA>that is relating to the Hamburg Rules--</PARA>
<PARA>until the Minister has consulted with representatives of shippers, cargo owners, carriers and shipowners, being representatives nominated by those groups. </PARA>
<PARA>A particular result is not required from those consultations, but it does impose upon the Government at least the obligation to go and talk to them. Even if the industry says no, the Government is not bound by that, but we wanted to make sure that the Government did at least consult. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have mentioned, the absence of a sunset date was also a matter of concern for the Liberal and National parties and for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. That matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee. We have reached agreement on it, although we are having some difficulty in getting the proper words to put into the legislation to reflect the agreements that were reached. I will deal with that matter further in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the few minutes left to me, I will make reference to another matter, which does not relate directly to the Bill before us on the Hague Rules, the Visby Protocol or the Hamburg Rules but is relevant to the legislation in so far as it affects the waterfront. Of course, one carries goods by sea and they are put through the waterfront. I have had for some time a concern about the waterfront reform process in the part of Australia I come from--that is, the north Queensland area--and particularly in relation to the Cairns port. </PARA>
<PARA>  Cairns has been typical of the Government's disastrous record on waterfront reform. When the media focus was on the port of Cairns it all got a bit hot for the Minister, and a provisional agreement was stitched up by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, with the approval of the Minister, which incorporated a deal to cut the port labour force from 23 to 10. That should have been done 12 months previously when the John Burke shipping company collapsed and left the port with twice the amount of labour on the port that was required. </PARA>
<PARA>  That deal did almost nothing to redress most of the rorts and inefficiencies which have plagued that particular port, and many ports, for years. The deal, rather belatedly, cut the work force from 23 to 10. Users of the port are still saying that 10 is twice the number of people required. This provisional agreement, which seems to have been stitched up in somewhat of a hurry, does not show any progress on the issue of double-headers before supplementary labour is required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991 will be supported by the Australian Democrats. I want to make it clear that we see this Bill as seeking to replace workable but out-of-date rules from 1924 with new but already out-of-date rules from 1979 to protect shipowners from the legal consequences of their actions. The Democrats accept this Bill, which is really a compromise, only because the way it is now written includes an intention by the Government, at some point in the future, to ratify the Hamburg Rules. As the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said in his second reading speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The main feature of the Hamburg Rules is to transfer the burden of liability from shipper to shipowner while the shipowner has care of the cargo. While this convention has been developed by the United Nations it is not yet in force internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, we would prefer that Australia lead the countries which have already ratified the Hamburg Rules and tip the balance of legal protection away from the shipping carrier nations in favour of shipper nations such as Australia. However, the Government, in its wisdom, awaits a decision by our major trading partners to ratify the Hamburg treaty first. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before Australia ratifies the Hamburg agreement, clause 8 of the Bill gives the Hague-Visby Rules statutory force to reduce the shipowners' liability of approximately $12,000 per package at present by one-tenth to $1,200 or $3.50 per kilogram, whichever is the greater. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill's main advantage appears to be in its definition of a package or a unit of cargo which is important to Australian shippers because of the difficulty of quantifying raw materials. The Bill's legal liability limits were first established in 1979 and do not adequately reflect today's monetary values. However, the SDR Protocol does base the monetary values on a more stable international currency. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new liability limits are also unsatisfactory when compared to the liability limit in the existing Act--one hundred pounds per package to be taken at gold value in 1924 prices; $11,760 as determined in 1986 by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the Brown Bovery (Australia) Pty Ltd v. Baltic Shipping Co. Ltd case. Few shippers have the inclination, opportunity or financial wherewithal to sue a carrier in Australia where this provision applies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Cargoes of manufactured goods are most likely to suffer as a result of the reduced liability. Fortunately for the Government, shippers of manufactured goods do not, as yet, constitute an effective lobby group. I am sure that the Australian shippers will wisely take out extra insurance to cover manufactured goods at sea, as the Bill does nothing to encourage shipowners to take care of Australian cargoes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 11 of the Bill does not include the same provision for Australian jurisdiction over contracts relating to the carriage of goods by sea to and from Australia as currently applies in section 9 of the existing Act. Clause 11 applies only to bills of lading, whereas section 9 of the current Act applies to bills of lading and voyage charter parties. In effect, voyage charterers--for example, Australian bulk commodity importers or exporters--will not be protected by the right to use Australian courts. A voyage charter party may provide for arbitration in London, New York or Beijing and the Australian voyage charter will be forced into commencing or defending foreign proceedings before an inconvenient forum to protect its rights. It is perhaps appropriate to mention that Japan, New Zealand and the United States have not adopted the Hague-Visby Protocols. The present Act, based on the original Hague Rules, currently operates among 85 countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats would prefer to keep the existing Act intact until the Hamburg Rules apply. The Hamburg Rules, to our mind, actually redress the balance in favour of shipper nations with its comprehensive scope of coverage. Deck cargoes and live animals--much as they should not be shipped--are covered by Hamburg Rules but not by the Hague-Visby Protocols. Modern electronic forms of transport documentation are also covered by Hamburg Rules, but not by the Hague-Visby Protocols. Claims can be made for delays in the delivery of cargo under the Hamburg Rules, but not under the amended the Hague Rules. The Hamburg treaty extends the liability of shipowners and does not reduce them, as do the Hague-Visby Protocols--a relationship which better suits Australia as a shipper nation. It is important to make clear--as perhaps what I have said already does--our support for the Hamburg Rules. As far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, this Bill does not satisfy our support for those rules. However, we accept it because it indicates an intention by the Government at some future date to implement. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill has been before a committee, as Senator Macdonald has said. There have been deliberations and there appears to be considerable agreement about what should occur by way of amendment. What I can make clear at this point--and what I will elaborate when it comes to the committee stage, in response to the amendments that will come forward--is that the Democrats will support strong amendments which will lead to the implementation of the Hamburg Rules. That has been our goal all along. It is what we will be looking for in amendments that come forward. The deliberations in the Committee, I believe, made that clear. Certainly our discussions in our party room support that approach. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent hours there has been some confusion about how subsequent amendments should be worded. We will continue our discussions on that. When we come to the committee stage, Democrat support will be gained for amendments which ensure, to the greatest possible extent, the implementation of the Hamburg Rules on the basis that we believe they provide the most appropriate framework for the situation here in Australia. </PARA>

At present, our marine cargo liability regime is covered by the Sea Carriage of Goods Act 1924, which is built around the 1924 Hague Rules. The Hague Rules is the common name given to the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Bills of Lading of 1924. They limit the extent to which shipowners are liable for loss or damage of cargo in their keeping, and impose an upper limit on claims that can arise from loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Hague Rules were the first attempt by the international community to find some means of dealing with the situation of shipowners who, if they had a free reign, liked to exclude themselves from any responsibility for the cargoes they had on board with respect to loss or damage. Many countries with which Australia has a seaborne trading relationship also support the Hague Rules--for example, Japan, which took about 27.6 per cent of the total Australian seaborne trade; and the United States which took 13.2 per cent. There are many nations which are not party to the Hague Convention, or the modifications to it that have taken place over the years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hague Rules have been modified by international protocols: the Visby Protocol in 1968 and the Special Drawing Right Protocol of 1979 which updated the Hague Rules by increasing the liability limit, replacing the gold standard and redefining the cargo terms to take account of modern use of containers. The protocol to amend the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading, signed in Brussels on 25 August 1924, was amended on 23 February 1968 by the incorporation of the Visby Rules to become the Visby Protocol. The Visby Protocol contains technical amendments, rather than any adjustment to the basic matter of liability for the cargo. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The overriding concern of the international community remains to secure Iraqi compliance with Security Council Resolution 687 which, among other things, demands Iraqi cooperation in the removal or rendering harmless of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. President Bush first referred to the threat of military action to enforce compliance in July 1991, though he said on 28 July that it would be preferable not to use force if other methods could be employed. There is, however, continuing international concern over Iraq's lack of cooperation with visiting UN inspection teams, most recently demonstrated in the detention of a team in Baghdad. Security Council Resolution 707 of 15 August condemned Iraq for serious violations of a number of its obligations under Resolution 687, which Iraq has unconditionally accepted. In September, the Security Council and President Bush again called on Iraq to comply with the UN Resolutions. United States Government representatives said that the United States had not ruled out any options to ensure compliance. The international community hopes that, in order to avoid the risk of further military confrontation, Iraq will start complying fully with the UN Resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Resolution 687 provides for the periodic review of economic sanctions by the Security Council `in the light of the policies and practices of the Government of Iraq, including the implementation of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council'. Australia does not separately stipulate conditions for the lifting of sanctions. Foodstuffs and materials for essential civilian needs are specifically exempted from sanctions. With the approval of the UN Sanctions Committee, Australian entities and companies have made sales to Iraq of wheat and other materials which meet the UN criteria. Security Council Resolution 706, adopted on 15 August 1991, allows Iraq to export up to US$1.6bn worth of oil over a six-month period in order to purchase food and humanitarian items. Resolution 712, adopted on 19 September, approves the Secretary General's detailed plan for implementing Resolution 706.</PARA>
