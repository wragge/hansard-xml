<PARA>To the Honourable President and senators in the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesmanlike leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:-</PARA>
<PARA>The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.</PARA>

<PARA> (v) the final comments of the outgoing Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) who suggested that people were merely `talking up' the rural crisis; and</PARA>

<PARA> (iv) that the Federal Government is actively collaborating with the South Australian Government to so jeopardise the important mangrove fish nursery areas of Gillman and Port Adelaide by proceeding with the proposed Multi-Function Polis that both the recreational and commercial fisheries of St Vincent Gulf will be progressively and seriously depleted; and</PARA>

<PARA>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL</PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill relates to Local Government funding arrangements and has four main objectives. In brief it:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) gives effect to the Special Premiers' Conference decision to untie local roads funds and pay these via general purpose grants;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) rectifies the unintended consequence for Local Government arising from the transfer of the Debits Tax base to the States and Territories from 1 January 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) provides the Treasurer with a discretion to set general purpose assistance to Local Government at a level consistent with the underlying growth in general revenue assistance to the States and so avoid the need for frequent amendments to the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) provides for the movement in general purpose assistance to Local Government to be directly linked to the movement in general revenue assistance to the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also makes minor procedural and technical changes to the Act and deletes obsolete provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of local roads funds, the Special Premiers' Conference of October 1990 decided that funds for local roads would be untied and paid to Local Governments, or to State Governments where they are responsible for local roads, via general purpose grants. The decision indicated that funds would be paid at the same real level as at present. </PARA>
<PARA>Following consultations with Local Government and the States, the Government has agreed on the means by which it will give effect to the Special Premiers' Conference decision. It will introduce interim arrangements for 1991-92 under which:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) local roads funds would be untied and the bulk of funds currently provided for local roads under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 will be provided as general purpose assistance under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an additional $296.lm in base funding for councils will be provided under the latter Act in the 1991/92 financial year. This figure represents an adjustment of 1990/91 funding levels for inflation with funds to be further adjusted in 1991/92 and subsequent years in line with existing general purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) existing State distributions will be maintained and inter council distributions will be in accordance with relevant principles currently operative under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988. Of the additional $296.lm in base funding, $272.7m relates to funds that will be provided to councils using a formula based on population and road length and $23.4m relates to funds that will be provided to councils on the basis of an assessment of special works needs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in the case of monies allocated to both Local Government and the States, the former local roads funds would be separately identified within general purpose assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>The interim arrangements will provide a period of stability while consultations proceed with Local Government and the States on the detailed arrangements to apply in 1992-93 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government expects to decide on the longer term arrangements by the end of 1991 following further consultations with Local Government and the States and following consideration of a wide range of options. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, at this point I would want to stress that the arrangement we are proposing in relation to local road funding have been developed with the full co-operation, assistance and advice of Local Government through the Australian Local Government Association. I would want to place on record the Minister for Local Government's appreciation of this Local Government contribution and to note that it is a practical reflection of the aspirations for a more effective partnership between the Commonwealth and Local Government that both spheres of government are seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA>The second major objective of the Bill is to adjust the funding formula in the Act to account for the transfer of the Debits Tax base to the States and Territories with effect from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in general revenue assistance to the States to compensate for the transfer of the Debits Tax Base would have, under the current funding formula, the effect of reducing general purpose grants to Local Government. The Bill provides for the effect of the transfer to be disregarded in 1990/91 when calculating Local Government funding entitlements. In the absence of any remedial action, the consequential reduction in general purpose grant entitlements for Local Government would be $9.1 million in 1990/91 and $21.8 million in 1991/92. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for legislative changes to the Act to accommodate changes in funding arrangements with the States highlights the need for more flexible provisions to be included in the legislation to cover contingencies of this type. </PARA>
<PARA>The current formula allows the Government no flexibility to vary the level of payments to Local Government as a result of changes to the basis on which payments to the States are made. </PARA>
<PARA>Such changes have been required in each of the previous two years-in 1988/89, because identified health grants were discontinued and, in 1989/90, because of the transfer of payments under the State Governments' Loan Council program to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement, and now a further change is necessary in respect of the Debits Tax base. The Special Premiers' Conference reforms could also require further changes. </PARA>
<PARA>The third major objective of the Bill therefore is to provide the Treasurer with the discretion to set the level of general purpose assistance to Local Government at a level consistent with the underlying growth in general purpose payments to the States. This is the outcome intended under the existing funding formula. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer would be able to make adjustments to reflect changes in the classification of payments or in the distribution of expenditure responsibilities and revenue powers to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer would consult the Minister for Local Government in making the determination of the funding adjustment factor and the Bill requires that a copy of the determination is to be delivered to State and Northern Territory Treasurers, including an explanation of the use of any discretion. The Minister for Local Government would of course ensure that Local Government was also advised of any changes. </PARA>
<PARA>The fourth and final major objective of the Bill is to extend to Local Government the same commitment announced by the Treasurer at the June 1990 Premiers' Conference that general revenue assistance to the States be maintained in real terms for the next three years, that is, 1991/92 to 1993/94. That commitment was conditional upon its not applying if Australia were to experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing arrangements under the Act effectively provide Local Government with close to a real terms guarantee with approximately 97 per cent of the funding formula linked to the level of general revenue assistance to the States. However, general purpose capital payments which currently comprise the balance of the funding formula have been nominally fixed in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill therefore proposes that a new set of comparable grants for the States, including the Northern Territory, be defined for the purpose of calculating the factor by which Local Government grants change. The Bill makes provision for the movement in general purpose assistance to Local Government to be directly Linked to the movement in general revenue assistance to the States and Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This move would greatly simplify the funding arrangements with Local Government and provide greater certainty in funding for the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA>The financial impact of the changes proposed in the Bill are relatively minor.</PARA>
<PARA>As already outlined, establishing a direct link between the movement in general purpose assistance to Local Government and the movement in general revenue assistance to the States and the Northern Territory will effectively provide Local Government with a real terms funding guarantee for the next 3 years. The estimated cost of this move is $0.9m in 1991/92 and S1.9m in 1992/93. This results primarily from the removal from the funding formula of the non-indexed general purpose capital assistance payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the changes that we are proposing will simplify the administration of the legislation and will provide benefits for Local Government. </PARA>
<PARA>They reflect the importance which this Government attaches to the role of Local Government in our Federal system of government. </PARA>
<PARA>They are another measure in a long list of measures which successive Hawke Governments have taken to strengthen the capacity and raise the status of Local Government. They are measures which, when combined with the very positive developments that are continuing to occur in Local Government in a wide range of areas can only lead to a better Local Government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN WOOL REALISATION</PARA>
<PARA>COMMISSION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>There are 9 Bills in this package of wool industry legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991, establishes the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC). The Commission will take over the $2.7 billion debt and 4.7 million bale stockpile presently held by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), and be responsible for the discharge of the debt and disposal of the stockpile and other assets. The Commission will cease when the debt is discharged. This Bill also repeals the Wool Marketing Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991, will establish the new Australian Wool Corporation which will be responsible for wool promotion and facilitation of marketing, including quality control. </PARA>
<PARA>The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development (Amendment) Bill 1991 makes a number of changes to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 which are necessary to allow the creation of the Wool Research and Development Corporation by regulation under that Act. The Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation (AWRDC), will be responsible for investigating and allocating priorities to research and development projects. It will also be responsible for funding projects and subsequently monitoring and evaluating them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Primary Industries Councils Bill 1991 provides for primary industries councils to be established by regulation for various industries. This will then enable the creation of the Australian Wool Industry Council, which will provide advice to the Minister and the industry on the overall strategic directions of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Wool Tax Amendment Bills (No's 1-5) 1991 provide for the setting of the Wool Tax at a rate of 15%. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the existing legislation concerning arrangements for the marketing of Australian wool, the Wool Marketing Act 1987, commenced on 1 July 1987. That legislation was enacted to govern the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Reserve Price Scheme among other things. It is well known to the Senate that for many and varied reasons, pressures on the Reserve Price Scheme became too great and the Scheme became unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1987, wool was re-emerging as Australia's leading rural export industry and contributed almost $4 billion to our balance of payments. The Reserve Price Scheme (RPS) had been operating effectively for 13 years, and wool had a strong position in the world textile market. </PARA>
<PARA>As has been explained to the Senate in detail on several occasions over the past twelve months, the demise of the RPS has been brought about by an unprecedented combination of factors, some were at work even before the 1987 legislation was introduced and some were totally unpredictable. </PARA>
<PARA>With the floating of the exchange rates, the RPS was no longer able to stabilise prices simultaneously for both growers and buyers. </PARA>
<PARA>In the mid 1980's wool was cheap in terms of buyer currencies and demand was high. Ill-conceived optimism led to a change in the role of the Minimum Reserve Price (MRP) from that of a ``safety net'' to that of an instrument to chase up the market. The then Wool corporation lifted the MRP by 71% over 2 years on the basis of a corporation and grower assumption that a ``new price plateau'' had arrived. The value of the $A rose, our wool was less attractive and the high MRP encouraged supply. More recently, unprecedented political changes occurred in the USSR, Eastern Europe and China, which led to a substantial decline in purchases of our wool. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year the Government, after considering industry proposals, subsequently made a number of decisions including increasing the wool tax from 8% to 18% and then to 25%, lowering the MRP from 870 to 700 cents a kilogram, removing the ceiling on AWC borrowings and guaranteeing those borrowings, enabling the Wool Corporation to establish a Flock Reduction Scheme, and also considered the introduction of marketing quotas. The Government also set up the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the wool industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite efforts by industry to introduce measures to curb supply and efforts to provide enough confidence in the market to boost demand, backed strongly by Government, it was clear by early this year that the RPS had collapsed. With the spiralling level of debt and market forecasts at the time, the AWC announced on 1 February that auction sales were to be deferred. The Government subsequently suspended the RPS until at least 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Since February, interim marketing arrangements have provided for the continuation of auction sales without the RPS, pending the determination of future institutional and marketing arrangements. During this period the Supplementary Payments Scheme has been in operation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now a new era. The recriminations and disappointments of the past eighteen months should remain in the past and all efforts and energy should be devoted to building a revitalised and sustainable industry. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been considerable effort put into determining the wool selling arrangements to apply from 1 July 1991. Numerous submissions were made to, and taken up by the Vines Inquiry, extensive consultations with various sectoral interests in the wool industry have taken place and numerous reports and proposals about how to handle the problem have been received. All have been carefully considered. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided on the structures appropriate to take us into the next century. Some of the details in the reports received focus on operational details or strategic directions which Government considers can be best addressed by the proposed new Corporations. When they are in place, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will recommend to each of the Boards that these issues, including many of the matters in the Vines Report, be specifically addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the issues facing the wool industry can be divided into those which require strategies over the longer term and those which are more immediate, although they are of course not mutually exclusive. </PARA>
<PARA>The longer term issues relate to the share of wool in the world textiles market and the most appropriate industry structure and institutional arrangements to support a sustainable and viable wool industry. To address those issues the Government has taken decisions setting up the new AWC and a separate Wool Research &amp;Development Corporation which are covered in this package of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now more important than ever that the industry thinks creatively about its future and determines new possibilities for boosting demand for wool to ensure its long term viability. </PARA>
<PARA>Wool's share in the world fibre market is declining but the rate of decline is misleading because of the large and growing markets in industrial, home and medical textile products for which wool is quite unsuitable. When you take account of those uses for which wool is suitable, it retains a very important market share, especially in the premium sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>Promotion, quality assurance and control and research and development, are all essential in the endeavour to sell more wool and improve returns to the industry. Under the proposed package of legislation the new Australian Wool Corporation will have a facilitating role in the areas of promotion, marketing and quality control. </PARA>
<PARA>It will oversight the activities of the International Wool Secretariat and have a major role in influencing the policies and strategies the IWS adopts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be recommending to the Board of the new AWC that it closely considers the recommendations of the Vines Committee relating to the governance and management of the IWS to ensure that the IWS gives Australian woolgrowers the best possible value for their promotion dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>To date the wool promotion strategy has been to concentrate on top end quality markets to support a price premium over other fibres. It is only lately that the industry is putting more effort into increasing the volume of wool sold into the apparel and non-apparel wool markets. This involves rethinking promotion strategies and resource allocation. For example, the role of blends and the opportunities offered by branding, are now beginning to receive close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Australian Wool Corporation will set quality standards for wool and ensure those standards are met. In conjunction with this, the Corporation will have the power to prohibit the sale for export of wool which does not meet the quality standards set by the Corporation and also order the withdrawal from sale for export wool that does not meet the standards. Substantial penalties for offences will apply. The Corporation will be working closely with industry regarding efforts to lift the quality of Australia's woolclip. </PARA>
<PARA>Part of the creative thinking to be done by the industry will include better production methods and the adoption of new technologies to improve the efficiency of wool marketing. An obvious means to achieve a high degree of efficiency is to ensure that commercial activities, to the maximum extent possible, take place in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Australian Wool Corporation will be required to adopt the role of a catalyst in facilitating activities in the market including the increased acceptance by the private sector of responsibility for marketing. The full implementation of sale by description is one such area where this could occur. Another is for increasing responsibility for quality control to be placed with industry participants. Both have moved along the track in recent years, but much more needs to be achieved and the pace of reform speeded up. The structure of the new Corporation means that it will be well placed to ensure this occurs. </PARA>
<PARA>The development and application of new technological innovations in the industry will be the responsibility of the new Wool Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Australian Wool Industry Council (AWIC) will form the primary focus for the co-ordination of all aspects of wool industry policy. As a properly constituted policy and co-ordination body for the industry it will replace the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council which has been in operation since September last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The AWIC is a consultative body, which will not override the other corporations. It will be a source of advice to the Minister and the industry and will provide a forum within which the various sectoral bodies can discuss matters of overall industry significance. It will, either on its own initiative, or at the Minister's direction, examine matters affecting the interests of the wool industry and propose overall strategic directions for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Wool Industry Council will be required to review the corporate plans of the Corporation, the Commission and the Research and Development Corporation and provide advice to the Minister. It will also be required to hold industry strategic review conferences every 3 years. The Council itself, will be required to meet at least once every three months and there will be monthly meetings of the Chairperson of the Council and Chairpersons of the other three wool statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Council will be required to provide leadership for the industry in a balanced and well informed manner. It has been set up so that the broad range of wool industry interests are represented and well informed decisions affecting the long term interests of the industry can be made by industry itself and by government. This arrangement can only benefit all those participating in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the significant issues facing the wool industry in the short term are the $2.7 billion debt and the 4.7 million bale stockpile. Also of concern is the rate of tax to apply in coming years and the ability of growers to pay it. This package puts in place measures to deal with these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>A balance has had to be found between the national interest objectives of debt management and the health of the industry on one hand, and the management of the debt and stockpile and consequent financial burden on growers on the other. It is this balance that the Government has sought in its recent decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>The management of the debt and stockpile is central to recovery from the present crisis in the wool industry. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has stated on a number of occasions, the Government has taken the decision that responsibility for the debt and stockpile must remain with industry. Any further capitalisation of debt would delay recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>The industry is confronted with a series of balancing acts. The elimination of the debt versus the level of tax we can reasonably expect growers to be able to afford; the use of the stockpile as an asset to reduce the debt versus the potential to adversely affect market prices for wool; the immediate sale of non-wool assets of the AWC versus the realities of the current property market are all factors in the equation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has had to make decisions which are in the best interests of both present and future woolgrowers, processors, merchants, and all Australian tax-payers. </PARA>
<PARA>To make our balancing act even more difficult, none of us is able to predict with any degree of certainty what the future holds. Our projections can essentially be regarded as best guesses only, albeit guesses based on past knowledge and detailed analysis. </PARA>
<PARA>We have decided that a debt repayment program is the best way to address the debt and stockpile, because of its flexibility and the elimination of any possible increase to the debt. </PARA>
<PARA>A debt repayment program which allows the stockpile manager to meet debt targets with the best mix of property asset and wool sales is more robust and better able to adjust to market circumstances than other mechanisms considered by Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Disposal of wool from the stockpile will need to be managed carefully. The Wool Realisation Commission will be required to maximise the value of each of its sales. The announcement of an annual debt reduction target, together with a known rate of tax, will enable the market to make an estimate of the sales required from the stockpile to meet the target. The Commission will not be a mystery player. Its annual bottom line is already public. </PARA>
<PARA>If, at the end of the repayment period and discharge of the debt, there is a surplus, this surplus is to be redistributed in a way which best benefits woolgrowers. The actual mechanisms for that redistribution will be worked out co-operatively at the time. The guidelines for the AWRC will provide for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the question of what is an appropriate tax rate, and in particular what is the rate that growers can afford, is critical. If the rate is too high there is a risk that the viability of the industry could be placed in jeopardy. Alternatively if it is too low, Australian tax-payers will be required to assume part of the debt on behalf of the industry and the stockpile will remain overhanging the market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has announced a rate of 15%. A number of proposals for other tax rates, which include to a greater or lesser extent assumptions about the complex or currently uncertain issues of the starting debt, production, markets and price, have been put to the Government. These proposals have been examined. However the one thing they have in common is that they increase the risk bourne by the Government on behalf of the tax-payer, when the Government is already considerably exposed as a result of the wool industry debt. </PARA>
<PARA>On current estimates any wool tax under 15% incurs additional risk for both wool growers and the Government in the event of a market downturn. Such a downturn would require either an increase in the wool tax or the sale of more wool from the stockpile. Both would reduce returns to growers. The only responsible approach for Government and industry is to adopt a wool tax rate that is both prudent and sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>The 15% tax rate is integral to the package adopted by the Government and the government does not intend to resile from it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts that a 15% wool tax means that significant numbers of specialist wool growers will have no farm cash operating surplus in 1991/92. However that would be the case whether one were to adopt 12% or 15%. In practice the effect of the difference on farm cash operating surplus for the average grower is in the order of hundreds of dollars, not thousands. </PARA>
<PARA>The hard reality is that the Government is not looking to preserve each and every person in the sheep industry who was there at the 870 and 700c/kg floor prices. There have been many new entrants in recent years taking advantage of the high prices. It follows that some woolgrowers must leave the industry irrespective of any action by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has announced significant increases in the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS), which will assist these woolgrowers. Commonwealth funding for RAS has increased from its current level of $64m to up to $160m in 1991/92. Commonwealth funding could be increased further up to $240m in the next year should conditions so warrant. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is still negotiating with the states over the application of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision on wool tax also reflects its decision that responsibility for the debt will remain with the industry and the 15% reflects in part the requirement to rely principally on the wool tax to service the debt. </PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the position woolgrowers face in the first year, the Government will facilitate a $200m interest free loan and has required the debt to be reduced by only $20m in 1991/92. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new legislation, the tax will be apportioned three ways between the AWC, the AWRC and the R &amp;D Corporation. Each year the AWC, the AWRC and the R &amp;D Corporation, will recommend the appropriate level of tax for their requirements. Those recommendations will be taken into consideration in prescribing the rate of tax under the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill provides the institutional framework to address the debt management and stockpile issues through establishing the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. On the day of commencement, the assets and liabilities of the Australian Wool Corporation, with the exception of the R &amp;D and promotion reserves, will be transferred to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The objective of the Commission will be to manage and eliminate the debt and stockpile in a manner that is in the best interests of the nation and woolgrowers in particular. The Commission will be required to acquit the debt within 7 years or less and will itself cease to exist upon the sale or transfer of all assets and repayment of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will have the flexibility to determine the timing and combination of asset sales and stockpile sales that can best achieve the debt reduction schedule. In the first two years it is expected that the Commission will negotiate the sale of most of the non-wool assets including warehouses and wool stores. Wool House in Melbourne will be transferred to the Commission, but it is anticipated that it will continue to be the office premises for the Commission, the Corporation and the Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will have operational flexibility in managing releases from the stockpile, but will be subject to a set of Ministerial Guidelines to be formulated between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will regularly publish figures on the stock sales achieved, the quantity remaining in the stockpile and the balance of the Stockpile Fund. Operators in the market will therefore have up to date knowledge of the levels of stocks held and the amount of debt remaining to be paid off, as well as likely income of the Commission through asset sales and tax levies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will also have a discrete task in the management and wind up of the Supplementary Payments Scheme. As that Scheme is presently being funded by the Market Support Fund it is most appropriate, with the transfer of the Fund to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, that the Commission see the Scheme through to completion. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides that the Commission will be required to develop and update annually, a 5 year rolling Corporate Plan which will be prepared after consultation with industry. The Plan will be reviewed annually to ensure that the strategy for management of the debt and stockpile remains relevant, and protects the interests of all participants in the industry and those of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>An annual Operational Plan will also be required and will be regularly reviewed. As part of this process, the Commission will be required to report annually to the industry on the results of the year's trading. </PARA>
<PARA>The Board of the Wool Realisation Commission is to be made up of a part-time Chairperson and 8 other Members. These Members will comprise the Managing Director of the AWRC, the Managing Director or another Board Member (other than the Chairperson) of the new AWC, and five Members with experience in designated fields of activity. In the case of the Commission the emphasis will be on financial and business expertise as well as commodity trading, storage and distribution, property management and woolgrowing. Two Members of the Board will have experience in woolgrowing. As well, there will be a Government Member. </PARA>
<PARA>These arrangements place greater emphasis on a broad base of expertise and experience among Board Members so that the wider interests of the industry can be taken into account in decision making. </PARA>
<PARA>The first Board, with the exception of the Managing Director, will be directly appointed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, after receiving advice from a selection committee which the Minister has already established. This committee has the same form as that provided for in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has established this selection process in advance of the legislation to enable the Boards of the Commission and the two Corporations to operate from 1 July 1991. This committee is well into its task and Honourable Senators will be aware that Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has already announced the appointment of Mr David Clarke as the Chairperson designate of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision is made in the Bill for Selection Committee arrangements relating to subsequent appointments to the Board. Each selection committee will comprise 7 members, a Presiding Member appointed by the Minister, plus 6 other persons appointed by the Minister, three of whom are to be appointed after consultation with Wool council. It is the Minister's intention that the Chairperson for the AWRC will be one of the Minister's nominations for the Committee making selections for the AWRC Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Selection Committee arrangements for all Statutory Marketing Authorities (SMAs) are under review in the context of the Government's decisions on the Davis Report's recommendations on Statutory Marketing Authorities. The role of Annual General Meetings of SMA's are being reviewed and this may have an impact on the way wool industry representatives are nominated to selection committees. Government will assess the implications of this for the wool industry selection committee arrangements at that time. The proposed arrangements in this Bill will remain until then. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides that the staff of the current AWC who transfer to any of the three new organisations will preserve their rights and entitlements throughout the transitional period. The revised institutional structure will present many challenges for the staff who transfer to one or other of the new organisations. It will be with their cooperation and support that much of the success of the new arrangements will rest. </PARA>
<PARA>It is vital that the expertise and experience of the professional staff of the AWC is retained. The mistakes of the past cannot be laid at the feet of the staff, many of whom counselled against them. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Government is now putting in place new institutional arrangements which will take the industry into the next century. The short and the long term issues have been addressed and appropriate arrangements decided. It is up to all individuals and organisations interested in the future of the industry to get behind these arrangements and make them work. The Government is heartened by the response from industry to date, and we are sure that with the right decisions by the new organisations the wool industry will recover to regain its place as Australia's premier rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill establishes the new Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). </PARA>
<PARA>The new Australian Wool Corporation will facilitate the adoption of appropriate strategies for the promotion of wool, the efficient marketing of Australian wool, and the adoption of proper measures to ensure a high quality for Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I have already outlined how this particular Bill fits into the total package of legislation for the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make quite clear that the role of the new AWC will not include any direct participation in the process of buying and selling wool in the market, other than for technical development purposes and market feasibility studies. The marketing of wool is a matter for the commercial sector to undertake. It is this fundamental aspect that will make the new Corporation entirely different in function and character from its predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead of participating in the market the new AWC will have a role as a market facilitator and will act as the catalyst to ensure that the market is operating as efficiently as possible. As part of the function of encouraging the Australian wool industry to adopt plans for the improvement of the marketing of Australian wool, the Corporation will be required to encourage the adoption of sale by description. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is recognised that the commercial sector may have difficulties in being able to fully take on, at least in the short term, responsibilities associated with programming of wool sales. For this reason the new Corporation will continue to be a major participant in this process for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to promotion, the new AWC will have the function of promoting or arranging for the promotion of all Australian wool to ensure that these programs serve the best interests of Australian woolgrowers. Currently programs are primarily carried out by the International Wool Secretariat (IWS), based in London, but the present AWC carries out domestic promotion of wool in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Vines Committee made a number of recommendations in relation to the governance and management of the IWS and considered that the organisation needed to come under close scrutiny to ensure that we are getting the best value for our promotional dollar. The Minister for Primary Industries and energy will be asking the Board of the new AWC to take up these issues with the IWS as a matter of urgency including the issue of whether, as Vines recommended, the IWS should take over responsibility for wool promotion in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The new AWC will also be required to develop and implement programs to safeguard and improve the quality of Australian wool. Part of this function will be to set appropriate standards for ensuring the quality of wool and woolpacks, ensure that wool offered for sale meets relevant standards, to keep a register of woolclassers, and to encourage and facilitate the training of shearers and shedhands. The Corporation will have appropriate regulatory powers and functions in this area but the government would wish to see it adopt a co-operative and consultative role in seeking to encourage rather than impose change in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Australian Wool Corporation will be required to encourage the commercial sector to take responsibility for the efficient marketing of wool and will act as a catalyst in preparing the commercial sector for the acceptance of this responsibility. There is no doubt that there will be changes in the coming years. In the absence of the Reserve Price Scheme, the futures market is likely to play a key role in the new market structures. Those companies that take the lead and offer the most efficient and effective service to their clients will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA>The new AWC will be required to prepare both Corporate and Operational Plans each year. The Corporate Plan will be a 5 year rolling plan and will be prepared in consultation with the wool industry. The Corporate Plan will define principal goals, outline strategies, and nominate performance indicators and must receive Ministerial endorsement before coming into effect. The annual Operational Plan will detail the activities required to give effect to the matters set out in the corporate Plan, but consistent with the Davis Committee recommendations it will not specifically require the endorsement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA>The new AWC will hold an Annual General Meeting no later than 1 May each year. A register will be established of all woolgrowers who have paid wool tax and who have applied to be registered for AGM purposes. The AGM will provide an opportunity for registered growers to debate and vote on motions to receive the annual financial statement and annual report of the AWC, to vote on recommendations relating to the prescribing of a wool tax rate, and have the capacity to propose motions of no confidence in the AWC Board. </PARA>
<PARA>These arrangements reflect the Government's decisions on the Davis Committee recommendations to improve accountability of Statutory Marketing Authorities (SMAs) to their shareholders, who in this case are the woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA>The constitution of the Board and Board Selection arrangements will be similar to those for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The Board will be made up of a Chairperson and 8 Members. These will include the Managing Director of the new AWC, the Managing Director or another Director (excluding the Chairman) of the Wool Research and Development Corporation, and 5 other Members with special expertise or experience. The special expertise required will be in wool growing, wool processing, marketing of commodities, finance, product promotion, business management, and industry standards and quality control. There will also be a Government representative. </PARA>
<PARA>In an endeavour to make appointments to the Board so that it can operate from 1 July 1991, the initial Board will be directly appointed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy after receiving advice from a selection committee which the Minister has already established. That process is already underway. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has already announced Mr Mac Drysdale as the Chairperson designate. </PARA>
<PARA>The appointment of the Managing Director will be up to the Board, and the Managing Director of the Research &amp;Development Corporation will of course be appointed by the Board of the Research &amp;Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Appointments to subsequent Boards will be made through the selection process outlined in the Bill. As I mentioned earlier, these selection committee arrangements may be varied if and when changes are made to selection arrangements for other SMA's. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill and the package of associated legislation provide for an institutional structure and market arrangements which enable the wool industry to recover from the present crisis and establish a sustainable and viable future for the Australian wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY</PARA>
<PARA>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 to provide the establishment, constitution and operation of a Wool Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>The only provision in the Bill which applies to all Research &amp;Development Corporations established under the Principal Act, not just the Corporation to be established for the wool industry, is a provision removing the 65 years age limit for directors of R&amp; Corporations. </PARA>
<PARA>In February the Government announced its intention to establish a Wool Research and Development Corporation to replace the Wool Research and Development Council. </PARA>
<PARA>This recognised the need for an independent commercially oriented body which was removed, as far as possible, from industry politics and equipped with the expertise and powers necessary to effectively encourage commercialisation of R&amp; results and to forge appropriate links with the International Wool Secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA>In April the Government announced the structure of the Wool R&amp; Corporation board and the structure of an industry selection committee to provide nominations for that board as well as for the boards of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the new Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives effect to those announcements and makes the Wool R&amp; Corporation accountable to the woolgrowers who fund the Corporation by way of an annual general meeting (AGM). Direct accountability through an AGM was recommended for statutory marketing authorities by the Davis Committee of Review of Commonwealth Statutory Marketing Authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The logic of an AGM is as strong for R&amp; Corporations as it is for statutory marketing authorities and in time all R&amp; Corporations will be required to hold annual general meetings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains parallel provisions to those in the Bills establishing the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the new AWC which provide for the transition to the new structure, including a provision preserving the rights and entitlements of employees of the current AWC who transfer to the Wool R&amp; Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of its charter, the Wool R&amp; Corporation will need to establish direct links and better co-ordination arrangements with the International Wool Secretariat. The Chairman of the Wool R&amp; Corporation will be asked to take this matter up with the Board and with the International Wool Secretariat (IWS). </PARA>
<PARA>Such a realignment of the linkage with the IWS will ensure that R&amp; work done by the IWS is fully in accord with R&amp; Corporation priorities and will facilitate better co-ordination of R&amp; commercialisation done by CSIRO and IWS. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to Honourable senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA>COUNCILS) BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of industry councils for certain primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA>There are already industry councils for the meat, horticulture and pig industries. These councils have made significant contributions to policy development in their respective industries. </PARA>
<PARA>In October last year, as part of the response to the recommendations of the `Davis' report on statutory marketing authorities, the Government foreshadowed the extension of statutory policy councils to the wool and grains industries. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides a legislative framework under which industry councils can be established by regulation for particular primary industries. The Government will be taking early action to establish wool and grains industry councils following passage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of wool, the Australian Wool Industry Council will replace the Interim Wool Policy Council established in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The object of the industry councils established under this legislation, as is the case for the existing industry policy councils, will be to facilitate the development of sound government policies for these industries by bringing together representatives of different participants in an industry to have an active role in advising the Minister the on policy formulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The functions and powers of the councils, set out in part two of the Bill, provide that the industry councils will be given a more central role in reviewing and coordinating industry policy than is the case for the existing policy councils. </PARA>
<PARA>This is reflected, for example, in the first function listed in the Bill, under which an industry council is required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry. In carrying out this function, a council will need to review the activities and general strategies of the other statutory authorities in the industry, specifically the statutory marketing authorities and the research and development corporations and councils. </PARA>
<PARA>The coordinating role of the industry councils will also be strengthened in a number of other ways. </PARA>
<PARA>The councils will be able to convene industry review conferences and can be required to do so under the regulations. It is intended that the Australian Wool Industry Council will convene such conferences every three years. </PARA>
<PARA>The convening of review conferences by the Grains Industry Council is a matter for discussion with the grains industry. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also provision for the councils to convene regular meetings of the chairpersons of other statutory bodies in the industry and the regulations may require that such meetings be held. The purpose of these meetings is to enable the chairpersons of each of the industry's statutory authorities to be well informed of the activities of their counterpart organisations and thus ensure the coordinated development of industry strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the Australian Wool Industry Council, in order to maximise consultation and coordination in the wool industry at this critical time, monthly meetings will be held of the chairpersons of the council, the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Part three of the Bill provides for such matters as the composition of industry councils, appointments to the councils and meetings of the council. The membership of each council will be determined in the regulations following consultation with the industry concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>In a media release of 30 April 1991, the Government announced that the proposed membership of the Australian Wool Industry Council would comprise a chairperson selected by the Minister; the chairpersons of the new Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Wool Research and Development Corporation; as well as the Presidents of exporters', brokers', private treaty merchants' and processors' organisations; and a Government member. </PARA>
<PARA>Membership will typically cover the major industry sectors which together make up the particular industry or industries covered by the industry council. This will of course include representatives of key industry producer and processor organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>The membership is also likely to include the chairpersons of relevant statutory marketing authorities and research and development corporations or councils. Depending on the particular circumstances of the industry, members may take office in their capacity as office holders in industry organisations, may be appointed on the nomination of industry bodies or may be appointed directly by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Meetings of an industry council will be held on a regular basis and at such frequencies as may be required by the regulations. Regulations will be prepared which will require the Australian Wool Industry Council to meet at least four times a year. </PARA>
<PARA>Part four of the Bill provides councils with the power to establish committees and working groups. This is intended to ensure that, if required, the council can set up functional committees or subject specific working groups. Provision is available under this Bill for working groups to actively involve a broad range of people including council members. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of part five of the Bill include arrangements for employing and hiring staff and requirements for an annual report to be prepared and submitted to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Funds allocated for the Interim Wool Policy Council of $250,000 in 1990-91 and $300,000 in the two subsequent years, will be carried over to the new Wool Industry Council when it is established. Funding will be reviewed in 1992-93. The operating costs for the Grains Industry Council will be met by the Government and are estimated at this stage to be $430,000 in 1991-92. Subsequent funding of the council will be reviewed during 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>Funding arrangements for any other councils established under this Act will be considered prior to their establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that industry councils established under this Act will provide an important focus for the industries they are set up to serve as well as providing an important link between industry and the government in the development of national policies relevant to those industries. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>WOOL TAX (NOS. 1-5) AMENDMENT BILLS 1991</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills will make a number of amendments to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos. 1-5) 1964. </PARA>
<PARA>The rate of wool tax that can be imposed on shorn wool other than carpet wool under each Act will be reduced from 30% to 15%. </PARA>
<PARA>The actual rate at which wool tax is currently imposed will be reduced from 25% to 15% for shorn wool other than carpet wool. The rate for carpet wool increases from 3.85% to 4%. In addition the Bills provide for lower rates of tax to be prescribed by regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Wool tax comprises three components-debt management, promotion and research and development-and the components for 1991/92 will be set at 11%, 3.5% and 0.5% respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>The increase in the rate of tax for carpet wool represents an increase in the research and development component for all wool, including carpet wool, from 0.35% to 0.5% in an effort to maintain an adequate level of funding for research and development projects. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes will take effect on 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing Wool Tax Acts include a provision for the imposition of an additional tax surcharge of 20% on shorn wool other than carpet wool. The surcharge has never been imposed and the Bills will remove the surcharge provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bills to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memoranda. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending 5 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments are highly significant, they are important for the functions of the portfolio. Details of the amendments follow. </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA>The Civil Aviation Act and regulations contain numerous offence provisions. There is, however, no clear articulation in the legislation of the powers of investigators when they are investigating alleged breaches of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the ramifications of this has been that, recently, prosecutions for alleged dangerous goods offences were unable to proceed because of doubt regarding the extent of the search and seizure powers of investigators. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, in its second report on air safety regulation, the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force expressed concern that the powers of investigators were not clearly set out in the Act and recommended that the Act be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed to the Act will provide investigators with adequate and clearly defined powers. These will be subject to strict safeguards to protect the rights of individuals against whom the powers may be exercised. The safeguard provisions proposed by this Bill are in line with similar provisions found in other Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 98 is also to be amended in order to clarify the power to make regulations dealing with the Authority's powers in respect of the preparation and approval of various technical documents specified in the Bill. The Bill also allows for the making of regulations via the adoption of instruments, or other documents, as in force at a particular time or from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA>A major effect of these amendments will be to ensure that a person selecting a particular system of aircraft maintenance will comply with subsequent changes to the system as determined by the aircraft manufacturer or the Authority to be necessary in the interests of safety. </PARA>
<PARA>The Act provides that, where assets are transferred from the Commonwealth to the Authority, the Minister administering the Act and the Minister for Finance may determine the value of assets as on the day of transfer and may determine an amount which is deemed by the Act to be a loan from the Commonwealth to the Authority. On 20 June 1988, a determination was purported to be made determining the value of assets intended to be transferred to the Authority at 1 July 1988, the date when the Authority began operation, and the loan in respect of those assets. The Attorney-General's Department subsequently advised that this determination is invalid, as a consequence of technical deficiencies in the procedures originally used to transfer the assets. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill allows the Ministers to now make a valid determination of the value of those assets at the values set in their determination of 20 June 1988. This action is intended to merely affirm the Authority's initial capital structure.</PARA>
<PARA>Federal Airports Corporations Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Airports Corporation Act is to be amended to make airport security a function of the Corporation. It will also be a function of the Corporation that it be responsible for the provision of aviation security safeguards at all Federal airports. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to rationalise responsibilities for airport security by making airport operators, including the Federal Airports Corporation, responsible for the counter terrorist presence, overall access control and security of the air side areas of airports. </PARA>
<PARA>In making this decision, the Government had two main objectives in mind. The first was to provide a single point of responsibility for security at each airport. The second was to ensure that there was a cost discipline on the provision of security measures, particularly in relation to the counter terrorist first response presence. I consider that the airport operator is in the best position to integrate the various security functions at the airport and to ensure cost effective delivery of security services. </PARA>
<PARA>Airport operators will be required to ensure that the aviation security functions are performed to minimum standards being developed by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 July 1991, the Corporation becomes subject to income tax and its taxation year will be 1 July to 30 June. Consequently, this Bill will change the Corporation's financial year from one ending 31 March to one ending 30 June. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment will preclude the Corporation from having two balance dates each year, one for statutory financial reporting purposes and one for taxation purposes, being just three months apart. </PARA>
<PARA>If the two years did not coincide, there would be significant inefficiencies and a substantial increase in costs to the Corporation owing to it having to duplicate many of its financial and administrative accounting and reporting functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act enables Australia to adopt the three recent amendments to the Annex to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973. These amendments also substantially increase the level of penalties for pollution offences and will allow summonses to be served on the master, owner or agent of a ship when prosecuting such an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>As well as the above amendments, the Bill will make some minor amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment making the Federal Airports Corporation responsible for airport security at, and in relation to, Federal airports will save the Government $15.9 million in each financial year. The other amendments will have no effect on Government revenue or expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator McMullan) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That Regulations 17, 19, 28 and 31 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 60 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion for disallowance on behalf of the Opposition because we believe that these regulations are entirely misconceived. They will introduce inequity and unfairness into Australia's migration policies and they are out of touch with general community values. These four regulations that I am moving to disallow are part of a larger set of regulations that make further changes and refinements to the migration program. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time that changes to migration regulations are laid before the Senate we can reflect on the confusion of this Government and the confusion and uncertainty that have been occurring-and I see Senator Robert Ray sitting opposite-throughout all of the eight years of the present Government's term, particularly in the rearrangement and reconstruction of the Migration Act from mid 1989 on. Successive Labor Ministers for immigration have brought in new approaches, new policies and new regulations. I have had cause in the past to describe to the Senate the inconsistencies and the difficulties that have arisen as a result of these often ill- thought-out, incomplete regulation changes. But there is no time to put the general case, which has already been well established in the Parliament. I am to confine my remarks to the disallowance of these particular regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations we are considering today are yet another example of blundering ministerial thinking. They raise the issue of the grounds upon which homosexuals can seek to come to reside in Australia. It is, therefore, an issue which we would all wish to approach with carefulness of judgment and without stridency or bigotry. The word `homosexual' does not itself appear in the regulations. The criteria set down for these new, `non-familial emotional interdependency' visas and permits are that the sponsor and the applicant have a relationship which is acknowledged by both and which involves residing together, being closely interdependent and having a continuing commitment to mutual emotional and financial support. As well, the sponsor may not be a relative of the applicant, so we are clearly dealing here with relationships that are not of a family nature. It is obvious that homosexual relationships are the ones that will, on the whole, be relevant under these proposed new criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of the entry into Australia of the homosexual partners of Australian citizens and residents is not a new one. For some years it has been possible for ministerial discretion to be exercised on compassionate grounds to admit a limited number of homosexual partners. It is the Opposition's view that that is the most appropriate way in which to handle these matters, and thus we do not approve of the new policy embodied in these new regulations. Our approach is nondiscriminatory. In our view, no applicant under any of the categories for entry now in place should be discriminated against on the grounds of that person's sexual preference. However, the use of a homosexual relationship alone as a basis for admission to Australia is a quite different matter. The proposed regulations would give a particular advantage to this category of applicant, and we reject the creation of such a legal category, of such a particular advantage. The Opposition rejects the creation of a specific homosexual visa category, which in effect and incontestably is what these regulations would achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most detailed information about past practice in this area was given by the Government in 1989 in answer to a question on notice asked in the other place by Mr Michael Cobb, the honourable member for Parkes. The then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Ray, who I am glad is in the chamber now, supplied via his representative in the House of Representatives, Mr Holding, a lengthy answer on this topic. I seek leave to incorporate the question and the answer in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Immigration: Homosexuals</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>(Question No. 1743)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 April 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) What procedures must be followed before homosexuals may enter Australia as immigrants and become Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Have Members of Parliament sponsored such immigrants; if so, (a) how was this done and (b) how many has each Member sponsored. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has a program been initiated through which homosexuals may enter Australia and become Australian citizens; if so, (a) what are the details, (b) when was it initiated, (c) by whom was it initiated, (d) as a result of what demand, (e) how many immigrants, (i) from which countries and (ii) in total, (a) for each year and (b) in total, have entered Australia under the program since its inception, (f) how many applications does the Minister have before him now, (g) does the Minister personally approve all applications or is this done by his Department, (h) what public announcements have been made by the Government regarding this program, (j) what response has the Government had to the program since its inception, (k) does the program allow homosexuals into Australia over and above other immigrant groups or do these immigrants replace other groups and (l) does the Government intend to maintain, increase, decrease or stop the program. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is any provision made, or intended to be made, for testing homosexuals for AIDS before immigration is permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Holding-The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) People are not prevented from migrating, nor from obtaining citizenship, because they are homosexual. The procedures applying to homosexuals are identical to those applying to any other applicant: that is, for migrant entry they must satisfy policy requirements for the category under which they are applying and they must meet health and character requirements; for citizenship they must meet residential and other requirements, including a good character requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Homosexual relationships are not equated with marriages or heterosexual de facto relationships for migration purposes. An Australian citizen or resident cannot sponsor a homosexual partner under the criteria relating to spouses and heterosexual de facto partners. Nor is the homosexual partner of a principal applicant eligible for entry as the ``spouse'' of that person. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) An individual's sexual orientation is not a relevant factor in considering an application for migrant entry and hence may not be known to my Department, and is not recorded. Hence, while it is conceivable that people who are homosexual have been sponsored by Members of Parliament in accordance with normal procedures, the incidence of this occurring is not documented. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no special program through which homosexuals may enter Australia and become citizens. However, once in Australia the homosexual partners of Australian citizens or residents may apply for the grant of resident status (GORS). In answer to the specific points of the question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Applications for GORS on strong compassionate grounds under Section 6a (1) (e) of the Migration Act 1958 may be lodged in Australia by homosexual partners of Australian residents and citizens who have entered Australia as visitors or temporary residents. Where an application for entry as a temporary resident on the basis of such a relationship is lodged overseas, it is submitted to the Minister for personal consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Applications for GORS on strong compassionate grounds based on a homosexual relationship have been considered personally by successive Ministers since September 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The first applications were considered by the Minister at the time, the Honourable Chris Hurford. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Arrangements to consider applications of this kind were discussed by Minister Hurford with a task force made up of representatives of interested groups. The Opposition has been kept advised of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) The following table gives details of the numbers of GORS applications lodged, approved in principle subject to outstanding requirements being met, refused and lapsed or withdrawn since September 1985. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I quote from part of this answer that needs to be very carefully read by those who are interested in the best way of dealing with this immigration matter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>People are not prevented from migrating, nor from obtaining citizenship, because they are homosexual. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement given by Senator Ray at that time. It is a statement that is still true of the procedure available to government without these new objectionable regulations. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The procedures applying to homosexuals are identical to those applying to any other applicant: that is, for migrant entry they must satisfy policy requirements for the category under which they are applying and they must meet health and character requirements; for citizenship they must meet residential and other requirements, including a good character requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Homosexual relationships are not equated with marriages or heterosexual de facto relationships for migration purposes. An Australian citizen or resident cannot sponsor a homosexual partner under the criteria relating to spouses and heterosexual de facto partners. Nor is the homosexual partner of a principal applicant eligible for entry as the `spouse' of that person. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer goes on to state that applicants for grant of resident status on strong compassionate grounds based on a homosexual relationship have been considered personally by successive Ministers since September 1985. The Opposition argues that this established approach is a fair one and that to change the policy in the way the Government is now doing is not warranted. Our view is supported by the first report of the all-party Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations in November 1989. The draft regulations before that Committee included a provision for a homosexual category and the Committee rejected such a concept. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of that Committee, the first committee on migration regulations, and I am very aware of the arguments that took place at that time. I am very aware that not only I but also the Committee rejected such regulations. It is not two years since that time and we have regulations in a similar form, although without explicit use of the word `homosexual'. I believe that they should still be rejected by the Senate. I quote from the Committee's report of November 1989. The relevant paragraphs are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Committee's view that the provision of a specific category of visa for homosexuals does not reflect current policy or practice. The Committee argues that although homosexuals should not be discriminated against for migrant entry, neither should they be specifically advantaged. In the past in exceptional cases where an application is based on a relationship with a strong and compelling compassionate ground, or like grounds which apply to all relationships, entry has been allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 64u, if amended in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, would give the Minister an adequate discretion to admit those applicants who would have applied under this category. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee therefore recommends that: the homosexual visa category and the consequential definition be deleted from the draft regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister at the time, Senator Ray, accepted the Committee's recommendation on that matter, and it is with great regret that we now see that the succeeding--</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Robert Ray interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the interjection from Senator Ray that he then sought this shift in the words so that the word `homosexual' was not explicitly included, but he acknowledges that the concept that was explored at that time and then rejected by the Committee is the one that he personally favoured then and now, and the current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, has agreed with Senator Ray's personal position. I rejected it then, the Committee rejected it then-that is, the Joint Committee of the Parliament from both Houses and from all parties-and I, on the Opposition's behalf, reject this approach, this addition to the regulations, now. As I say, the one firm recommendation from the Committee was then to admit a specific homosexual category. The Minister at the time accepted that, and the present Minister would, I believe, have been well advised to leave things as they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The creation of this non-familial interdependency category, even without the word `homosexual' explicitly used, is clearly designed nevertheless with homosexuals in mind. These regulations seek to give a particular new advantage to homosexual applicants for immigration in Australia, and the Opposition soundly rejects that innovation. I believe that the Senate should soundly reject that innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to Senator Spindler, Senator Bourne and, of course, Senator Harradine that the Australian Democrats and Independents should make the comparison between this quite new regulation that would give a specific advantage to homosexuals and the established procedure and reject that new approach on the ground that it was rejected by a former Democrat, the then immigration spokesman just two years ago-that is, that there should not be such a specific advantage given to homosexuals on immigration matters and that, rather, we can rely upon the general compassionate circumstances in the consideration by the Minister when an application that is deserving of approval comes before him. The established procedure, which is quite satisfactory, is the one that is set out in the material that I have already incorporated as being the then answer to the question of the honourable member for Parkes, Mr Cobb. </PARA>
<PARA> The proper exercise of ministerial discretion remains the most appropriate way of dealing with the cases where there are strong and compelling compassionate reasons. These regulations place homosexual partners on a similar basis to heterosexual partners, and that is a precedent of considerable significance. I put it to the Minister and his advisers, I put it to all honourable senators in the chamber, that we are now going over a line. The Government is leading us over a line which we in this country have never gone over before. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in Australian law homosexual partners are not regarded as spouses for tax purposes. They are not regarded as spouses for social security benefits. There is no area of Australian law in which homosexual relationships lead to any family based benefits, indeed, I believe, to any benefits at all. This is the first occasion on which, by new regulations, the Government is giving an explicit, specific advantage to homosexuals in Australian law. I think we are entitled to be told if the Government has in mind to make changes in these other spheres, such as tax, social security, marriage-in any area of family law. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard Senator Harradine say, `Adoption'. I am asking, plainly: is there an intention by the Labor Government to bring in parallel specific advantages and benefits under any other laws of Australia in the way that it is doing with the migration regulations? I argue that to equate homosexual relationships with heterosexual relationships would not be in accord with the values in the general community at this time. The galleries of this chamber are representative of the public and of visitors to this country. I would go out to people in the electorate at any time and put to them the view, `Is this consistent with your values?'. I am saying here in the Senate that I do not believe that the Australian public wishes to see any discrimination against homosexual Australians, but they do not want to see any specific advantage given to homosexual Australians. There ought not to be a recognition in Australian law of any specific advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe, therefore, that it is right for the Senate to reject these regulations, not least because they are not in accord with community values in Australia. To make such an equation is rejected by me; it is rejected by the Opposition; it is rejected by the Liberal Party of Australia; it is rejected by the National Party of Australia; and it ought, I now argue, to be rejected by the Senate-that is, by honourable senators agreeing to support this disallowance motion now before us. It is in the hands of the Democrats. It is in the hands of the Independents. If they support this motion within this hour, they reject this innovation in Australian law and we fall back on the current procedure that I have already outlined, which is perfectly satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also questions of fairness and equity when we compare those benefiting from this new non-familial emotional interdependency category with those who are family members who are denied consideration under the present rules. I make this point about equity and fairness equally strongly. I refer to people such as sisters and brothers. An adult brother or an adult sister will not have the advantage that these regulations would give to a homosexual partnership that might have existed only as long as six months or even less if the Minister agrees to its being less. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet an adult brother and an adult sister, between whom there can be an emotional dependency, a closeness, will not have this immigration advantage. I believe that that is unfair. Many thousands of people from any number of 50 countries around the world who want to immigrate to be with their brother or sister in Australia will not have the advantage that the regulation gives to those in a homosexual relationship. It will certainly seem unjust to those people if this new non-familial emotional interdependency category is allowed to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that concessional family reunion allows entry only after quite rigorous points-testing requirements, based upon education, skills, age and employability have been satisfied. The numbers of brothers and sisters who aspire to entry are so substantial that any relaxation of these criteria, if it were a parallel to that applying to homosexuals, would lead to an avalanche of applications. Thus the system does not make it easy for those closer relations to gain admittance to our country. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that, while so many immediate family members are excluded from entry, introducing very relaxed criteria requiring only six months cohabitation for homosexual partners is impossible to justify on grounds of fairness, reasonableness or equity. I note that in fact the period of time does not even have to be six months if the Minister judges that he can accept a lesser period in a particular homosexual relationship. It would be interesting to hear some explanation by the Minister when he responds as to what circumstances would be likely to trigger a decision to reduce the time below the six months which is set out in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one further observation. The Opposition's stance is to support the previous system of access to ministerial discretion. It was claimed in the other place yesterday by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) that this reliance I have on established procedure is out of tune with, or not accepting the thrust of, the new regulations' approach to the Act, which is to have everything specified and to minimise ministerial discretion. I am not seeking such a comprehensiveness or consistency as to deny what is lawful, and that is, that there is an exercise of ministerial discretion that can be fair and open, and even reported to the Parliament if the Minister wants to make sure that there is no backroom deal for which he does not want to be held possibly liable. </PARA>
<PARA> That kind of openness can be achieved by the Minister saying on a quarterly basis, `I have given consideration to this number of applicants in this area, and I have approved this many and not approved that many. I bring to the Parliament's attention that these are the principles that have guided me in every instance'. He can be quite accountable, and I believe that there is nothing inconsistent with that in the general thrust of the present Act as it is structured and the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition rejects that claim by the Minister. It is clear that the procedures of the last six years for ministerial consideration of these matters is still fully available and is the procedure actually being used by the current government and the current Minister. He can continue to use that. I put it to the Democrats again: let the Minister continue to use that procedure. There has been no complaint. No-one has complained to the Opposition. Is anyone going to bring a complaint into this debate? Why change, and so break with principles, and bring an innovation into Australian law that we ought not to accept, which is not fair and not consistent with community attitudes?</PARA>

<PARA> There ought not to be a change. The Opposition rejects these regulations. We call upon the Senate to reject these regulations.

It happens to be the case in the Australian Labor Party that it is--(Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is appropriate that this disallowance motion be decided on the basis of a conscience vote. I appeal to Government senators who have come in to form the quorum that this not be regarded as a party block matter, but that individuals can exercise their own conscience votes, as is appropriate in matters that relate to these kinds of relationships, according to the individual dispositions of honourable senators who are elected to represent the Australian public in this place. I believe that Government senators should be able to exercise their own individual conscience votes as to what their attitudes should be to this innovation-this first occasion on which a specific advantage is being given to a homosexual relationship in Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition rejects these regulations that would establish a non-familial, emotional interdependency category for visas and permits because it will introduce unfairness into our migration program and is out of touch with community values.

It is process that he is going on about, and he is not going on about the principle involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition often claims that no migration applicant should be discriminated against because of a sexual preference. Quite clearly, the interdependency regulation is mostly directed at giving homosexuals rights. The Government does not walk away from that. Let me outline to the Senate how these cases have been dealt with in the past and how that has changed under the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> For people to come to this country to be permanent settlers and be the beneficiaries of ministerial discretion requires them to start off with a lie. They cannot say on their application forms that they are coming to this country to apply for permanent residence on the grounds of ministerial discretion. They cannot do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters is not going to interrupt me today on this important issue. These people start with that particular lie, and that is one of the problems. Secondly, under the new regulation regime these applicants must then apply against a false criterion in order to have a reviewable right before the matter can ever get to the Minister. That is the nub of the question: do we force applicants to apply to come here as a spouse? Do those opposite really want that to be put into the system? There is no reviewable ground directly on compassion. People must apply under one of the criteria as set down in the regulations. So these people have to apply under a false regulation before their case can ever come before the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

I know that because I know what other people in the Liberal Party, when they brought these cases to me when I was the Minister, think about that.

Some 467 applications were approved, 37 were refused, 46 were withdrawn or lapsed and 71 were awaiting the Minister's decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have attempted to do in the immigration field is establish a set of regulations which make it lawful to enter this country. Whilst no-one will agree on the overall regulations, I think most people accept that that is a proper regime. But once we make it an immigration regulation that people have to meet a specific set of criteria, the system Senator Teague has outlined-and I agree that it has occurred in the past-cannot occur in the future. The first attempt made was to address this question absolutely directly by putting in a regulation for homosexuals. The Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations rejected it. I do not know whether it was the general view of the Migration Committee, but some members of the Committee-including someone from the honourable senator's side of politics-asked me, `Can't you just dress it up slightly differently? Can't you come up with an approach that doesn't recognise it directly?'. That is how this regulation emerged-it took a long while, but things do in this regard. It was in response to that that this regulation appears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress that what Senator Teague is doing if he goes back to the old system is saying, firstly, someone will come to this country, will set out the wrong reason for coming here and will then live in terror that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs can use that as a reason to remove that person from the country at any time. Secondly, if a person does seek permanent residency here, that person will have to apply into a category that does not apply to him or her. People will have to say that they are tradesmen or that they are brother and sister when they have no relationship. We commit them to the second falsehood before they can get to the Minister and the Minister can use his discretion. To me, it is absolute hypocrisy to do it in that way. If we are going to grant these cases we should put them up front. If this Parliament decides that we should not, then we will not do it and no-one will have that particular right. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague went on to say some other things. He said, `It's only six months'. It takes six months to get a temporary entry permit, but it is another 24 months before a person gets permanent residency. So it is not six months-that is a ridiculous argument to introduce. If that six months can be reduced there is still that other 24-month period before permanent residency comes into effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears to us that the migration regulations that we are discussing today were specifically designed to remove an inequity and an unfairness. They have been specifically and carefully designed to be non-discriminatory. Basically, the regulations allow the granting of an entry visa or an entry permit to someone who is over the age of 18, has satisfied the normal health and public interest requirements and has been, for at least six months before, in a genuine and continuing relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident which involves residing together and having a commitment to mutual, emotional and financial support.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have spoken to former Senator Jenkins who was on the Migration Regulations Committee at the time to which Senator Teague refers. She said to me that the problem with the 1989 regulation was that it was called a homosexual visa and the majority of those on the Committee-I am taking her word for this, but I trust it-and that included her, opted for a more general companionship visa because they thought that it was unnecessary to make a public declaration of one's sexual preference before one could get this visa. That seems to us to be entirely reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> These visa regulations certainly create no new advantage. They just take away the disadvantage that existed beforehand. As far as we can see, they do not alter policy at all. They just take the matter out of ministerial discretion and put it into accessible regulations. The current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and past Ministers have been very good in this area, but Mr Hand might fall under a bus tomorrow. I hope he does not, but what if he does? Who comes up next? Will they be people who want to have ministerial discretion for these sorts of visas? If not, we should have the policy set out in the regulations. It should be accessible to people who want to come into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot see any reason for using, in the migration regulations, terms related to a person's sexual preference. So we think that this is a perfectly reasonable way to set out these regulations. The regulations can-and I image they will, as most others do-be used by homosexual partners as well as by people who have completely platonic relationships, such as two elderly widows, but are emotionally interdependent. They appear to us to be very reasonable and a mature step away from discrimination. Consequently, we will not be supporting this motion for disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that Senator Bourne was going to give us some reasons as to why the Australian Democrats were going to support these migration regulations. Senator Bourne's main view appears to rest on the fact that her reading of the regulations does not mention homosexuals. My reading of the regulations does not either. We have heard Senator Ray's response to what Senator Teague said. Senator Teague pointed out that, two years ago, the Migration Regulations Committee had a proposal before it to establish a new homosexual migration category. Senator Teague told the Senate, as is the case, that that was rejected by the Committee. Senator Ray interjected and said that whilst that was rejected, we were looking for another form of words to cover the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray says, `Exactly'. So in fact we are really dealing with the proposal that was before the parliamentary committee to establish a special homosexual category of migration. That is what we are dealing with here-to put homosexuals into a special category with a special advantage. I hope the Senate will excuse me for having repeated several times to Senator Ray the words, `What about sisters and brothers?' He has not responded to that because there is no response to that. The fact is that these regulations will give persons with homosexual relationships an advantage over hundreds of thousands of sisters and brothers of Australian citizens. In other words a homosexual will jump the queue as a result of this particular regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How many of us have been repeatedly asked by Australian citizens whether we could please do something about their loved ones, their family, their brothers and sisters in other countries with whom they have close interdependent relationships? I particularly refer to the large number of people who have come from Greece, from Italy, from China and from a number of other areas where the extended family is so important, so interdependent. </PARA>
<PARA> How many of us have fought, on behalf of those constituents, to have their brothers and sisters being able to come to this country and have been rejected? Yet here we have special regulations which give an advantage to homosexuals over sisters and brothers. Senator Bourne's contribution falls to the ground because Senator Ray made it fall to the ground. He has admitted that this is precisely the same proposition that was put before the parliamentary Committee on Migration Regulations and which was rejected by that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that it is ironic that we should be allowing this new category at a time when immigration to Australia has been savaged by this Government. The number of people coming into this country has been savagely cut. It is of no use Senator Ray saying that sisters and brothers might get into the country in the last few places that have not been filled. The places will be filled, all right-by others-because of the savage cuts to immigration that have been announced by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also rather sobering to reflect that one of the reasons for the development of the immigration programs of Australia-as in a number of countries throughout the world-has been to build up the population in this country to offset the decline in the number of births. That has been one of the reasons for maintaining a level of immigration to this country. It would be obvious to anybody listening to this debate on a moment's reflection that this special category will hardly contribute to increased population or birth rates in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I want to make is that I believe that this will open the way for a scam. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has recently been trying to curb the scams and rorts that have occurred in the immigration area. I refer to comments that were made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) in the House of Representatives on 3 June when he referred to the disturbing number of scam marriages between Australian nationals and partners from other countries. At pages 4609-10 of the House of Representatives Hansard, he is recorded as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>One of these recent scams involved a company which operated for a number of years in Victoria, where fees up to $16,000 were being paid for marriages of convenience to enable Fijians and Indians to migrate to Australia. The sum of $4,000 went to the Australian partners, some of whom were mentally handicapped, and the rest to the Melbourne principals of this particular marriage fixing racket. Millions of dollars were made over this period from customers applying through the company in Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA>If these regulations are adopted, what is to stop the homosexual liaison business from thriving? What is to stop a scam of similar proportions from developing? At the very time when the Government has attempted to prevent the scam, how will it prove it? I believe that the Government needs to come up with the answer, that the Minister needs to enlighten the Senate as to how scams will be stopped under this new category, particularly, as Senator Teague pointed out, as the period of six months or even less was mentioned. Whatever happens with these regulations, the Government will have to live with the situation. If these regulations are not disallowed, questions will be asked of the Immigration Department as to their operation because of their potential for scam. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come back to the major question of principle that was referred to by Senator Baden Teague. Senator Teague said that, for the first time in Australian law, the Government is placing a homosexual relationship on the same basis as a legal marriage. In so doing, it is giving that relationship an advantage over other familial relationships. In the very definition the Government talks about non-familial relationships, which, as I said, excludes brothers and sisters. It is significant that Senator Ray refused to answer my interjections on the discrimination that will be felt by the brothers and sisters of those Australian citizens who are seeking to come to Australia because of their emotional dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate to consider what it is doing if it accepts these regulations. It is establishing a precedent in placing homosexual relationships on the same basis as marriage. It is opening the way for rorts and scams, which the Department is trying to close down, and it is discriminating against familial relationships, including brothers and sisters of those Australian citizens who are currently seeking to come to Australia on emotional and dependent grounds. For those reasons and the other reasons that have been given by Senator Teague, I believe that the Senate ought to reject these regulations, which are simply homosexual category regulations rejected by the parliamentary Committee but now dressed up in other words and in other terms, as admitted by Senator Ray here this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In asking us to disallow the migration regulations before us, Senator Teague, speaking for the Opposition, said that we were being invited by the Government to cross a line and that the Opposition parties were not willing to do so. I am rather sad that the Opposition parties are not prepared to cross the line of enlightenment. I believe that we are no longer in the Middle Ages. We should take account of the personal rights and liberties that are guaranteed by our Constitution and would be guaranteed by a human rights Bill if we had a human rights Bill that had not been frustrated so often in the past by the efforts of the Opposition parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that it is incumbent upon a civilised society to ensure that any person may exercise his or her political and civil rights regardless of nationality, race, religion or sexual preference. It is a great pity that the Opposition parties cannot lift themselves out of the steeped prejudice of the past and look in the face of the clear principles of human rights. It is no wonder that they want to abolish the Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to some of the points that were made by Senator Harradine and, firstly, to his suggestion that Senator Bourne did not advert to the intent or definition of these regulations. Senator Bourne simply drew a wider ambit, saying that the regulations were not specifically directed at homosexual people-although it was clear from her remarks that they could be used in that way. She pointed to the fact that the general terms in which the regulations were couched left it open for them to be used by people other than homosexual couples who were in a situation of emotional interdependence. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine further adverted to the numbers conjuring up in some way a floodgates argument. That is hardly the issue here. As we have heard from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), currently there are some 180 or 190 individual applications for couples on the board. The conditions imposed on couples and the matters that they need to prove, emotional as well as financial interdependence, will be strictly enforced. There is hardly a danger here of upsetting the numbers of our immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also pointed to rorts and scams which certainly are in existence. But, no doubt, any regulation or piece of legislation admitting people to this country would be open for unconscionable operators to exploit. We should not hide behind that danger and neglect the principle that is at stake here. I believe it is incumbent upon us, upon the Parliament and upon the Government to ensure that the laws of this country are observed. The danger that they may be subverted by some people should not be a reason not to do what is right. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect about which I personally feel strongly-and I express a personal view here because I am no longer the spokesperson on immigration and ethnic affairs-and that is, that brothers and sisters should be added to the categories available for family reunion migration. I am on public record as having said that. I would be happy to take whatever action I am able to take in that area to achieve that. I will lend my support to Senator Harradine in any efforts towards achieving that additional category. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect was raised: is this regulation opening up a direction towards the introduction of consideration of homosexual couples in other pieces of legislation? Adoption was raised. This is a matter that I personally have not considered in detail. I would like to defer comment on that. I believe that each piece of legislation and its potential consequences should be looked at separately on a case by case basis and in some detail. Taxation and social security were also raised. Here, I personally believe that there are grounds for considering homosexuality, and homosexual relationships should be taken account of in legislation that deals with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I fully support my Party's rejection of the disallowance motion. It is time that our society took account of the political and civil rights that every person in it should be guaranteed, regardless of race, religion or sexual preference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In responding to the debate, because of the pressure on our time I must be brief and confine my remarks to only a few matters that were raised by each of the speakers. First of all, there are many Opposition members who would have wished to speak on this motion but they were ruled out by the arrangements between our Whips to confine our time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were two Aunt Sallys put up by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, on behalf of the Government. The first was `while Senator Teague has got good values, good arguments and is in a sound position on these matters, he has given in to redneck pressure'. Let me assure this chamber that none of us in the Opposition, least of all myself, have given in to any kind of redneck pressure. I genuinely believe that the views I express are leading the Opposition and are also the views expressed by our spokesman in the House of Representatives, Mr Ruddock. They are views held by all of us. This Aunt Sally gained more from louder speaking on the part of my good friend Senator Ray, than from any actual logical or factual base. I also reject Senator Spindler's uncalled-for remarks about `lack of enlightenment', `lack of a support for human rights of every individual in this country' and that there has been a `steeped in prejudice approach' from anyone in this debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Aunt Sally the Minister put up was that the present procedure-the one that has been used for six years-requires applicants seeking compassionate consideration to put themselves into a position of basing their application on lies and then living in terror. Let me make it entirely clear: nothing that the Opposition is putting forward wishes any person to ever put forward a lie or to ever live in terror. Under the present procedure we seek-and through you, Mr Deputy President, I note this to the officers who are present from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and to the Australian public-to have an application made for permanent residence in Australia which is to be a truthful statement. That application comes, through the procedures as outlined in my speech and incorporated as the procedure from 1985 on, as an application for compassionate consideration by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. We do not accept the Aunt Sally that Senator Ray referred to in regard to lies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister gave two non-answers, despite my explicit request that he address himself to the matters. The first matter was the unfairness to sisters and brothers. Senator Harradine has also rightly made that point in support of the principle that I outlined on behalf of the Opposition. Senator Spindler has agreed that there will now be an unfairness with regard to sisters and brothers. I would say to the Australian public-and not least to the Italian, Greek and Chinese populations-that sisters and brothers of the world should unite and act to get this inequity thrown out because they will be jumped in the queue by those advantaged by this procedure that the Government wants to foist upon the Australian immigration system. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area which the Minister did not answer was my reference to the conscience vote. Maybe the Labor Caucus is prickly about this matter and maybe Labor senators have got individual views but are just hoping that no-one will refer to the subject or require them to be of personal account. Rather, they will hide behind a general Government position. I regard the failure of the Minister to refer to or allow a conscience vote as a serious failing in the Government party. We believe there ought to be the ability for individual senators to determine their own position in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I thank Senator Harradine for his remarks supporting the thrust of the Opposition's argument. I acknowledge Senator Bourne's remarks, which I found brief but not convincing. It is true that Senator Jenkins, with us all, did refer to the notion of a companionship visa. But I assure Senator Bourne that we rejected not only the term `homosexual' but also any notion of a homosexual visa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will call for a division on this matter. We hope that individual Government senators may accept the disallowance motion that the Opposition is moving, and that the Australian Democrats and Independent senators also support the very sound views which I believe that I, on behalf of the Opposition, have brought to the Senate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>1. Clause 7, page 5, proposed subparagraph 513(d) (ii), line 34, omit ``12 months'', substitute ` `9 months''. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Clause 7, page 5, proposed section 513, add the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) For the purposes of calculating the period of time required by paragraph (l) (d), such period of time during which a person was in receipt of unemployment benefits in accordance with the Social Security Act 1947 immediately prior to receiving either job search allowance or newstart allowance shall be included.''. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Clause 7, page 6, proposed subsection 514(1), definition of `change day', lines 5 and 6, omit ``12 months'', substitute ``9 months''. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply indicate that the amendments give effect to our view that there ought to be a finite cut-off date in relation to payment of unemployment benefits or their successor, the Job Search allowance. In so far as registration with the Commonwealth Employment Service is tied into eligibility for the Job Search allowance, that reference to 12 months ought to be amended to nine months and in so far as previous receipt of benefit is to be taken into account, unemployment benefits ought to be relevant in that exercise, rather than simply a reference to the Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The same goes for the changeover day. We take the view that there ought to be a cessation of entitlement to the Job Search allowance after nine months and, therefore, the Job Search allowance ought to expire at that time, rather than after 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also think that the Government's position on this is fairly well-known. Obviously we do not agree with the amendments. The important thing to note-while I would love to take up the politics of all of this, I will not do so-is that, internationally, nine months is just not an accepted benchmark. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development accepts 12 months. I do not understand why Australia is in a unique position to take a lesser figure. In any event if one looks at the percentage rates of long term unemployed, one will find that, even since the recession began, the measures of the existing Newstart strategy are working. I cannot understand why we would want to change.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now may not be the time to discuss this question. I have a real problem about flexibility of the Government's program in relation to the availability of courses for those who are in receipt of the Job Search allowance. The current situation is that many people who may have had intermittent employment over a period of, say, less than 12 months, are denied entry into training situations which are available for persons only after 12 months. I know that this is probably not the time to debate that. I will oppose the amendments that have been moved by the Opposition; but I just wish to foreshadow that in view of the fact that I did not have the opportunity last night to speak during the second reading stage of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain that I can satisfy all of Senator Harradine's concerns but I will have a go at doing so. Flexibility will have to be central to the administration of the whole Newstart strategy. In the way it operates, there will be plenty of flexibility in the administrative guidelines that will be used by the Commonwealth Employment Service and my Department. Obviously, where there are no courses, people will not be required to do them. The point about the Job Search allowance is that it is not as if people are denied access to training. In fact, it is possible that after six months some disadvantaged people will be given access to the courses anyway. We will be flexible. We will not be setting impossible requirements on people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the same token, we have to have some relationship between courses available and numbers. If we are to have a number of people on whom we are supposed to concentrate, I think that it is better that we concentrate on the longer term unemployed than on anyone else. I do not for a moment believe that we ought not to be concentrating on everyone in making courses available. It is to be hoped, of course, that over the next year or two we will continue to increase the number of places in training courses, and we shall attempt to do so. Senator Harradine does have my assurance that flexibility will be the hallmark of all of this. We will not be imposing impossible duties on anyone. We will certainly be encouraging as many people as we can to take up training where it is available, whether they are in the Job Search or Newstart schemes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are talking about that particular situation, could the Minister tell me whether at the moment a 19-year-old person, who has been unemployed over a period of, say, eight months, with the odd job in between, is not entitled to enrol in training courses. This is the situation in Hobart at the moment. Along with Senator Harradine I am asking: will the Job Search allowance change that? Will those people be able to enrol in that particular training under the Job Search allowance? Will it be flexible enough to pick it up? Are there, indeed, enough places to cope with people who are very keen to get a job, having left school and not being fully employed? Are those people entitled to enter that training area?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it stands at the moment, the situation is that if the relevant Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) personnel considered that the training course would enhance the person's capacity and the probability of securing employment, under the Job Search allowance rules as they currently apply, that person would be allowed to do the course. I have not said that there would necessarily be enough courses for every person who wants to enrol. That is something we addressed in March and may have to look at again. I am saying that could be done now. In any event, as a result of the legislation here today, the CES personnel will be making certain that enough flexibility applies so that if courses are not available, once people have been on the Job Search allowance for a little longer than the person in Senator Walters's example, we will not require them to do the impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thing is that it is at the discretion of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) office. I shall give the Minister an example. A young 19-year-old had been engaged in casual work over the previous eight months and was looking for full time work. He found a training course, a short course in horticulture, which was his preferred option. He immediately went along and applied for entry to that course but was told by the CES officers that he was not eligible to enrol because he had not been unemployed for 12 months. That situation is unacceptable, and I am asking whether that is the fault of the legislation or the fault of the CES officers. What is going to happen under the new scheme? Will that be corrected or is it correct the way it stands at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would appreciate the honourable senator giving me details of the case later so that I can have it checked out. No, that is not right as things stand at the moment. What the person was told by the CES officer, if in fact that is the case, was not right, and that disturbs me. I should make the point here that, under the Job Search allowance (JSA) rules, after six months people who are particularly disadvantaged can get access to courses, and they will be urged to do so. The sort of people I am talking about are sole parents, and most of us would concede that those people are at greatest disadvantage, that sole parents and their families have a real struggle on their hands. Also, ex- prisoners are in a very vulnerable position, particularly in a recession, as are some disabled people and some Aboriginals. If there is a special disadvantage, after six months those rules can apply.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current rules would enable these people to be given access to courses, and we do not change any of that. If the facts are as Senator Walters says, the CES officer involved gave the wrong information to the 19-year-old. Perhaps, though, it was the case that the CES took the view that the course was in some way unsuitable for the person. I have no idea. I do not know the individual circumstances of the case. But had the CES believed that this course would enhance the possibility of the person gaining employment, I am sure they would have said yes. So there must have been some reason; I just do not know what it was.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reluctant to go any further on the individual case. However, with the employment access program, there is an establishment of priorities. I have just gone through some of the categories relating to how they are established. I do not want to suggest that a course will be available for every person who wants one. We cannot pretend that that is the case and I would not seek to do so. What I am saying is that it relates to where a course is available and where we consider the person eligible. Based on the facts that Senator Walters has given us, the 19-year-old to whom she referred is eligible. I would say, by the way that, from her record here we know that Senator Walters does not misrepresent the facts, so I accept that the person has told her that. So, I think, on that assumption, a mistake was made. As I have said, if the honourable senator can give me the details I will check the matter. However, our view is that if a place is available for a person in that category that person would be sent to it. But a judgment would have to be made that it would enhance employment prospects, that the person would be capable of doing the course and that it was suitable for the person, et cetera. That is a decision that has to be made at the shopfront level. It is not one that can be made here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Walters has outlined correctly the particular case relating to this matter. In her contribution in the second reading debate, Senator Patterson emphasised the need for flexibility in these training arrangements. I am sure we all appreciate the fact that, where a person has been intermittently unemployed for a period of eight months, it indicates a couple of things. One is that the person is really trying to get into the paid work force and trying to make a contribution. Secondly, it probably indicates, more than anything else, the state of the economy, and today there are examples of people who have had three or four jobs over only a few months. Because of an industry going out of business or transferring to the mainland or somewhere else people are finding themselves out of a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that, psychologically, it is important to give those people the opportunity at that stage to train in a preferred area. I accept what the Minister says but, notwithstanding, I feel that the Department has some sort of priorities in this regard and that the people who have perhaps been intermittently unemployed over a period of eight months are pretty low on the priority list when it comes to training programs. I would be disappointed to find that that was in fact the case. I am interested in what the Minister is going to do about the case raised by Senator Walters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want anything I have just said to be read as meaning that a person in the category referred to by Senator Walters is a low priority. A person in that situation is not a low priority. He would not be as high a priority as someone who had been unemployed for three years and who was perhaps in greater strife but nonetheless he would be a priority. Let me make this clear: after six months, anyone who is unemployed can get access to a labour market program. It is then a matter of priorities at the local level as to whether or not a decision is made to send the person along. That has to be made at the local level.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let's not argue semantics; I do not think anyone here misunderstands what I am saying. As an example, ex-prisoners can get access after a month. So the CES is trying to give priorities to the very specially disadvantaged first, and I have referred to the main categories and after that at six months CES can assess the work history of anyone who is unemployed and can recommend a program if it is available or, if a person comes in with a place lined up, the CES can make a decision on whether that person's opportunities would be enhanced by doing the course. So, it is not a matter of a low priority. But it is a semantic argument, because I am acknowledging that I do believe that there will be sufficient courses for every person at the moment. I am acknowledging that. That is why it is not semantics when I say `can get access to'. I mean that they would be able to get access; it is just a question of whether or not a course is available for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Am I right in saying that after six months it is at the discretion of the CES officer concerned whether people are eligible to enter a course if that particular officer believes that it will be to that person's benefit-that, no matter what the unemployed person feels about it, if that officer does not think it is suitable he or she has no hope of joining a course? I know the Minister would agree with me that CES officers are under a lot of pressure and strain. Someone may kick up a bit of a fuss because he has not been allowed to go on one course. If he is denied access he may believe that he has been discriminated against because he has had a bit of a blow-in with one of the officers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult for people who are out of work and struggling to get on to a course. The moment their six months is up they want to get on a course but they are denied access because a CES officer believes it is not in his best interests, no matter how much they think it is in their best interests. How do we get over that feeling, whether it is true, of discrimination that that unemployed person is going to accuse the officers of?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first question asked me to repeat what I said before. I thought everyone understood it, but I will say it again. It is not the case that everyone is eligible for a training course immediately upon becoming unemployed; it is the case that after six months everyone is eligible. That is subject to availability; we have been through this. I have explained that after a month a number of--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After 1 July it will be six months continuous unemployment. I did not specify that before because it was not that way before. After one month some special categories of people, which I have been through, become eligible. After six months everyone becomes eligible, subject to priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then Senator Walters moved on to the question of individual officers and the kinds of decisions they make in situations where they are under stress, as I think she put it. In both the CES and Social Security offices at the moment there are obviously thousands of people coming in who are under great stress, who have not been unemployed before and who, naturally enough, are finding times very difficult. That stress is communicated to staff. That is why I have so much admiration for the staff. We have beefed up training for staff to make sure that they are able to cope with these situations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that staff at the CES are accustomed to people coming in with a burden, coming in angry, and are able to cope with it. Not every officer in the service will cope as well as the next. By and large, though, I think the evidence is that the CES copes very well indeed, and we will continue to train our staff on the best way to handle the more difficulty situations. I think we are doing that reasonably well. Sometimes it is worth the effort to go out into Department of Social Security or CES offices and to watch the system at work. Under difficult circumstances, I think we cope well. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt very much that there will be officers who will simply give in to those who yell the loudest about their disadvantage or difficulty. Those officers have to work within the guidelines they are given, take those into account and then make a judgment. It will always come down to a judgment, but if the guidelines are written properly it will be possible to administer the system with some compassion. I doubt very much that we will be getting too many complaints that one person is unfairly treated as against another. There will always be the complaint that there is unfairness because many people will obviously feel that it is unfair that they are unemployed at all in the first place. </PARA>

We have had a number of people write to us asking that they be permitted to do courses in the private sector; for example, people who have run a small business and who are seeking to do specific small business management courses.

What people at the volunteer centre are asking, and also people wanting to do courses are asking, is if a person fulfils the requirements, or whatever is in the agreement, in perhaps five hours a day, can he therefore do maybe five hours every day of voluntary work or perhaps five hours of other part time study outside what is actually in the agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>

Any suggestion that the norm is that the unemployment benefits of anyone who has done part time voluntary work were cut off is simply not right. The overwhelming weight of cases goes against that. That does not mean that there is not some dividing line at which an officer might have to look at what is part time and what is full time. It is not always the case that those who ring or write and complain to us or to welfare rights centres are necessarily totally truthful about every element of their being.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figures in the 1990-91 explanatory notes of the Department of Employment, Education and Training for program place allocations for the long term unemployed are listed as follows: Job Clubs and Job Search Training, 6,800; Jobtrain, 16,000; Jobstart, 15,000; and Skillshare, 44,000 which, on my reckoning, is 81,800 in total. In addition, a number of places are allocated to young people who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer which include Job Clubs and Job Search Training, 6,200; Jobtrain, 5,000; and Jobstart, 6,500 which comes to a total of 17,700, the grand total being 95,500 places for 180,000 long term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On an absolute base reckoning this is a 55 per cent place to long term demand ratio. That does not take into account the many long term unemployed people who would gain access to two or more of the government programs during a 12-month period, plus those that the Minister has just mentioned in special categories and those who have been unemployed for more than six months. For example, many people might undertake Job Search Training within a Job Club, then undertake a vocational training course through Jobtrain or Skillshare. It is not unreasonable to assume that such a person may then enter a subsidised employment position under the Jobstart program.</PARA>
<PARA> I guess I can understand how the Minister gets the 30 per cent figure, but I would be interested to know exactly how he gets it. Also, I would like to hear his response to the comments I made last night about the pig in the python. That means the unemployment increase which has occurred over the last six months and which, down the track in another six months time, will be a bulge of long term unemployed, will hit this program with a great force. What is going to happen then? What plans does the Government have to deal with that? Now that 30 per cent have access to those programs, what will it look like in three or four months time?</PARA>

All we are talking about here is ensuring that people make reasonable efforts to find work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The liquid assets test was debated in the chamber some time back. There has been a modification to the arrangements that were announced in the Budget which were carried here in the chamber. I do not think there is much point in going over the ground which we traversed then. The reality is that the liquid assets test was introduced in order to prevent payments being made to those people who earned fairly high incomes over part of the year. I think the modifications which were made to the test are pretty reasonable in protecting families, in particular. I do not think it is unreasonable-nor apparently did the Senate-that those people who have sufficient liquid funds should maintain themselves for a short period. Therefore, we reject the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment picks up a matter which was canvassed with the Government when the liquid assets test was introduced. It seemed to us at that time-and it still does-that there is an inconsistency of approach in saying that we ought to limit the ability of an applicant to dispose of certain liquid assets to spouse or children, but that we ought to turn a blind eye if the assets are disposed of elsewhere. Our amendment, therefore, simply seeks to broaden the ambit so that we uphold the principle which the Government espouses- that is, if we are to have a liquid assets test that is to be effective, we ought to ensure that people cannot simply bypass it by disposing of assets to friends, relatives or anyone other than spouses or children. We, therefore, move this amendment in the spirit of trying to assist the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>The first of the three amendments omits the words `not required' and substitutes the word `taken' from proposed subsection 523(1).

<PARA> The second amendment refers to the concept of remote areas and remoteness. It is trying to bring in some symmetry between the reference in proposed section 522 to the activity test and to remoteness in proposed subsection 523 (2). We are trying to clarify this matter and refer to an area where there is no locally accessible labour market and no locally accessible vocational training. We are just giving ourselves some consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment omits from proposed subsection 523 (2) the words `the person is not required' and substitutes the words `then, unless the person has been notified of a requirement under subsection 522 (2) in relation to the period, the person is taken'.

<PARA>This goes back to the question of voluntary work. I will just explain again the way in which the current Act has been interpreted by the Department of Social Security. The 20 days has not been taken by the Department to mean 20 days in a block. It has been taken as written to mean 20 days in the same calendar year; in other words, less than half a day a week. Totals have been kept in some offices and therefore people have been at risk of losing their benefits once that total is accumulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, looking at the way in which the current Act is interpreted, the Australian Democrats are moving this amendment to increase the number of days from 20 to 65 and, in particular, to allow this option to people other than those under the age of 18. At the moment the Bill reads, `certain allowees under 18 engaged in voluntary work'. I ask the Minister: why has the Government limited this exemption to people under the age of 18 and over the age of 55?</PARA>

The answer to that question is no because we saw the precedent of the Fraser Government, which in 1982-83 sought to spend its way out of trouble and left this country with an enormous deficit, high unemployment and high inflation. We saw the dangers of all that in a sensible and moderate way, not like the current Opposition, which sees the dangers of the Fraser period as the dangers of a government that did not have the guts to do anything. It now goes around mouthing tough rhetoric out of the lips of the Dollar Sweets man, Mr Costello, and out of the mouths of Ian McLachlan and people like that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The claims by Mr Rundle are hysterical nonsense, with no basis in fact at all. I do not know where he dragged that story from. Over the past 18 months I have received continual representations from all the Labor Tasmanian senators, including, I might add, my ministerial colleague Senator Tate, on the issue of the freight equalisation scheme. The Federal Government remains fully committed to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme provides essential assistance to Tasmanian industry and $36.5m was provided under this scheme in the last financial year to assist in the equalisation of freight rates for Tasmanian industry. No consideration whatsoever is being given by the Federal Government to reducing the assistance provided under this scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the earthquake was quite a while ago. I cannot remember exactly when. But if one drives through Avellino the staggering thing is that the effects of it are still everywhere to be seen. That community was totally devastated by it. It was obviously an event of mammoth proportion in Italy. My understanding is that the hospital at Avellino had previously been visited by Senator Grimes once and by Mrs Hawke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would imagine that every few years, for a while yet, the Italian community and the people of Avellino would be expecting the odd visit from an Australian Minister and they got one. So far as Salerno is concerned, I will tell the honourable senator what I did in Salerno. I arrived when it was dark and left early in the morning. All I did was sleep there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4372" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the size and composition of the Government's capital works program is a matter which will be considered by the Government in formulating the 1991-92 Budget. The Government does not see a general case for increasing government spending as a way out of the current recession. In formulating the coming Budget, the Government will be guided by the need to maintain budgetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any further loosening may provide a temporary stimulus to activity but this is likely to have its major impact at the same time as the economy is recovering and therefore jeopardising the goal of a sustainable recovery. The Government has indicated its commitment to preserving the structural integrity of the Budget during this recession while not attempting to offset the cyclical fiscal deterioration. The Government is not inclined to proposals which would undermine this principle. In any case, new capital works are only considered by the Government if they are economically justified; that is, if they will provide a satisfactory rate of return.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="4372" SPEAKER="Lees Sen M.H." NAMEID="8U4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health to an article on page 3 of today's Australian entitled `Unofficial AIDS drugs to be imported privately'. The article reports that exasperation with the nation's inappropriate drug approval system has prompted the AIDS Council of New South Wales to establish a system to make it easier for AIDS sufferers to import the AIDS-fighting drugs DDC and DDI which are currently not available in this country. I ask the Minister: first, does the Minister consider it a desirable state of affairs that a system which promotes the precedent of patients having to pay for HIV and AIDS drugs is being established? Secondly, can the Minister understand how the frustrations and anger of HIV-AIDS sufferers, their families and supporters have led to such a move? Finally, if, as is expected, the drugs DDC and DDI are approved in the United States of America within the next eight weeks, can the Minister give Australian HIV and AIDS sufferers a guarantee that they will not have to wait the 2 1/2 years that they had to wait in the case of AZT for the drugs to be approved?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4372" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Brian Howe, does understand the frustration experienced by those who are suffering by either carrying the HIV virus or actually having contracted fullblown AIDS. No doubt, their families, supporters and friends-the networks which are built around those who are suffering this particular disease-would also be likely to experience that sense of frustration because of the possibility of not having drugs which can assist, as much as they would wish, in combating the AIDS virus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do believe that the Australian Government, and the whole of the Australian Parliament, has been very supportive in the management of the HIV virus in Australia. In Australia, we do have an excellent record of care for people suffering in this particular way. This is not least, of course, because Medicare itself provides free and comprehensive care for such people; unlike countries such as the United States which is put up by some lobby groups as apparently some sort of model that we should follow in relation to the care of those who suffer from HIV or AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there is a sense of urgency amongst those sufferers and their supporters about the need for access to any drug which might assist them. It is important to emphasise that there is only one treatment presently approved in the United States specifically to act on the virus HIV and that is zidovudine or AZT. This treatment is also approved in Australia with a government subsidy. In the United States, most people must pay to access the drug or go without. That is something which has to be emphasised to those who are sufferers from this disease.</PARA>
<PARA> It has also been suggested, not by Senator Lees but by some of the lobby groups, that around 100 drugs are available in the United States compared with only seven in Australia. That is also misleading as most of these are treatments for opportunistic infections associated with HIV. Again, many of these are available in Australia through a variety of measures to those patients who need them.</PARA>
<PARA> Statements which imply that the AIDS drugs have been approved in the United States but not in Australia are misleading. Once again, Senator Lees has not said so, but some have claimed that DDI and DDC, for example, are available. But they are not yet approved for marketing in the United States, as Senator Lees indicated in her question. Issues relating to the situation are being looked at by former Senator Peter Baume in his review which is expected to report to the Minister on 1 July. I believe that may be a very helpful review as far as getting access to these drugs is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees will be aware that an application by a drug company to trial DDC in Australia was agreed to by the Federal Government in January this year but this did not proceed because there were not enough patients in the right circumstances to contribute to the trial. I am sure that both Mr Howe and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, are concerned that Australians should have early access to creditable treatments. They have made considerable changes in the interests of early access to those treatments. When one combines the fact that Australia does subsidise drugs that are approved for marketing, with changes recently made to import regulations to enable individuals to have access to drugs not approved for marketing-and, of course, they have to pay-one sees that the Government is most concerned to alleviate the suffering of those who have contracted the virus, and that it will continue to try to ensure that sufferers have early access to any drug that can help in fighting this terrible disease.</PARA>

<TITLE>ENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHT GLOBES</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="4373" SPEAKER="Devereux Sen J.R." NAMEID="1G4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services been drawn to correspondence from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works (PWC), to which was attached a report from Australian Construction Services on the use of energy efficient light globes in government buildings? Does the Minister agree with the view expressed in the report that if all government buildings were to be fitted with energy efficient light globes it would be detrimental to the future of Australia's only globe manufacturing industry in Newcastle? Is the Minister therefore prepared to initiate discussions with the various levels of government and the manufacturing company concerned with a view to securing all governments agreeing to guarantee that all buildings will include energy efficient light globes, provided that the company agrees to expand its activities to manufacturing these globes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4373" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Works Committee has written to me raising some concerns over the future viability of the Australian lamp manufacturing industry unless, as it has expressed to me, it is encouraged to invest in additional plant to broaden its productive scope. In its correspondence, the PWC asked that I consider using the Government's public purchasing policy in conjunction with the Government's so-called green team to provide an incentive to the local lamp industry. The particular concern that the Committee has is that energy efficient globes can be imported to replace the globes manufactured in Australia. As Senator Devereux has indicated, such action would place in jeopardy the Australian lamp manufacturing industry, particularly since energy efficient globes are not produced here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two globes that can be used-the compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and the high technology fluorescent lamp-are produced overseas. The compact fluorescent lamp is a suitable substitute for the domestic incandescent or tungsten filament lamp. Although the CFL is expensive-it costs about $20, compared with 75c for a regular globe-it uses something like one-fifth the energy of and lasts something like six times longer than a normal globe.</PARA>
<PARA> The other lamp which has been suggested to me, the high technology fluorescent lamp, has been developed to provide a marginal energy reduction. It is also three or four times the price of the Australian standard product. The higher costs are, of course, attributable to the advanced technology used in their manufacture. I am also advised by my Department that they are imported because the Australian lamp industry does not have the technology or the market to justify the establishment of facilities in Australia to manufacture these energy efficient lamps. It should be recognised in this instance that it is the practice of most Australian companies and government to use Australian manufactured fluorescent lamps. Commercial office buildings, as well as government buildings, have used those lamps.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that a number of principal initiatives have already been employed to contribute to energy efficient lighting in government-owned and private sector buildings. The three main features in this endeavour to cut back on energy consumption are: firstly, the design of light fixtures has been modified to direct, distribute and use light efficiently; secondly, there has been a move towards the placement of switches to allow easier local control to save energy and, thirdly, there has been the installation of automatic controls. In fact, some of these experiments have been so successful that they have been applied by Australian Construction Services in buildings recently. Savings accruing from such modifications, in terms of energy costs, are as much as 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Devereux mentioned the Public Works Committee's suggestions. In response to the Committee's correspondence, I have asked the Environmental Futures Group-the so-called green team-to investigate the scope of enhancing the viability of the local lighting manufacturing industry in the context of the production of energy efficient lighting. This reference from me sits very well within the green team's proposal to conduct an energy audit into office buildings with lighting being, of course, a major factor of that audit. Following the report from the Environmental Futures Group, it would be my intention to raise this matter with State and local governments to ensure that we can meet the twin objectives that have been expressed by the Public Works Committee-that of providing lighting and also ensuring the continuing viability of local manufacturing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support to the announcement last Friday of major job losses in the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Can the Minister confirm that the Bird Hazard Investigation Unit is to be disbanded? Is this disbandment a result of the unit's consistent professional advice that the area between the existing and proposed runway at Sydney Airport must be filled to minimise the risk of bird strike-advice that the pro-third runway CAA board virtually disowned in its submission on the draft environmental impact statement on the proposed third runway?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I cannot confirm that. What is happening at the moment, as I have advised the Senate previously, is that the CAA has undergone an exhaustive and complete evaluation of all of its operations. At the end of last month, it produced a comprehensive and detailed report covering every single aspect of its activities across Australia. The organisation is currently going through the very difficult process of implementing those recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only this morning, in this building, I addressed a seminar of industry groups involved in the aviation industry. A significant number of senior figures in the aviation industry expressed, only this morning, their full support for the operation that the CAA is currently engaged in. There has been no specific or particular attention paid to the singling out of this particular unit for special attention. No final decision has been taken on what will happen to it or, indeed, any of the other sections of the operations of the CAA that have been evaluated in precisely the same way. The negotiations that are going on now, as to how the implementation will actually occur, I would think, will take at least several months to complete. No final decision will be made until those consultations are concluded.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must agree with my colleagues who have indicated that this is a good question, a timely one and one which is quite appropriate. In asking this question, Senator Childs does recognise-I am getting a lot of assistance from behind me in answering this question-as I do, that the Department of Administrative Services does have a critical role in ensuring that the goods and services used by government do conform with the wider government policy. For instance, in respect of that broad objective, on a number of previous occasions I have outlined the way in which my Department integrates its purchasing policy with the industry policy of my colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a similar way, DAS has an important role in ensuring that the goods and services provided by it conform to this Government's environmental objectives. It is best placed to perform that role because of the central role that DAS has as a provider of basic services. As a consequence of such a role, DAS also has an enormous potential to influence positively the operations of other public sector departments and agencies and also to develop domestic industries which can meet such demands.</PARA>
<PARA> We have already used our position to encourage environmentally sensitive practices and the Department will continue to develop this potential in order to make a positive contribution to the Government's environmental objectives. The Department of Administrative Services is not a newcomer to environmental issues. Over a number of years, we have been promoting environmentally sensitive practices throughout the public sector. Many of DAS's divisions continue to work on environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, yesterday in Question Time in response to a question from Senator Bell, I informed the Senate of DAS's initiatives in the area of recycled paper and products and made reference to the Environmental Futures Group, a group which has the role of making recommendations and examining ways in which DAS can develop environmentally responsible workplaces. It has the role of making recommendations on the promotion of the use of suitable goods and services and, of course, it has a role in making recommendations on how DAS can contribute to the Government's environmental objectives.</PARA>

There are also a number of other initiatives within DAS. The scientific services laboratory is currently working on a project to alleviate the threat to the ozone layer with its ground-breaking research into a better, safer alternative to the firefighting gas halon 1301. The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories is working on environmental hazards including asbestos in buildings. A part of the Department which does have a fundamental role in this area is Australian Construction Services (ACS), which has undertaken studies into the use of rainforest timbers in construction and also energy conservation in buildings, a factor which I mentioned in response to a previous question from Senator Devereux. In fact, energy audits in government buildings undertaken by ACS have saved already not only millions of dollars but also scarce resources. I should also indicate that another section of DAS organises ecologically sound recycling or disposal of petrol, oil, tyres and other waste products, such as paper and printing offsets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, DAS does have a central role in realising the Government's broader policy objectives. As I have indicated, it does so on the industry front. It also has a central role, not only in terms of being a leader within the public sector, as I indicated, to other government departments but also in supporting local initiatives by industry. Those roles dovetail pretty well to ensure that, as a department, we do play an environmentally sensitive role.</PARA>

However, now Mr Kennett has come out and said that he will not legislate. Therefore, which of the promises is to be believed?

The implication of what Senator Alston is saying is that the withdrawal of the threat is not going to be honoured and, when Mr Kennett gets in, he will pass that sort of legislation.

We are not referring to Federal or State or any other politics; we are talking about politics as a whole.

There is no inconsistency in the two statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inconsistency lies with the hypocrites opposite, not willing to dissociate themselves from one of the most gross distortions in Victorian political history, where Mr Kennett said that he would retrospectively take superannuation from the defeated members of parliament-not the successful ones but the defeated ones. He then said absolutely, `Take my word, I will resign if I don't legislate' and then, like a sleazy cur dog, later on he slips into the press and says a la Nixon `That is no longer operative'.</PARA>
<PARA> What do senators opposite say about that? They have never been quoted publicly about it. They have never asked questions about absolute promises in politics in relation to Mr Kennett and many others. What all this is about is where is the consistency in the Opposition's position in the questions that they seek to ask here? I can assure Senator Calvert of one thing: there is no inconsistency in my two statements, that is, that there is no such thing as an absolute promise in politics, which Mr Kennett and many others have proved, but some people who make absolute promises can always be relied on to keep them.</PARA>

Do some of those who went over to the Peacock camp want to say that no promises were made to induce them to vote?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, and I suggest that it is time the Senate turned its attention to the unemployed people out there after this selective morality mud slinging. I refer the Minister to press reports describing the new Treasurer as one who is more inclined to manage the economy out of trouble rather than leave it to the `do nothing' level playing field. I ask the Minister: can we now expect the Government to make employment its top economic priority by using specific targeted measures, in particular the phasing out of payroll tax, which is a tax on employment, and placing banks under the Prices Surveillance Authority to achieve lower interest rates? Secondly, can the Minister advise which other measures the Government is planning to use to reduce unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Senator Spindler's question, he has been quite specific about two points. I point out to Senator Spindler that payroll tax is a tax on employment, but it is a tax raised by the States. Without some extraordinary measures being taken by the Commonwealth Government in terms of raising alternative tax revenue, there could be no measures to totally wipe out payroll tax which, I think, in some States amounts to one-third of their budgeted revenue. So, it is not a matter that is susceptible to easy solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the question of placing the banks under the aegis of the Prices Surveillance Authority, I answered a question about this from Senator Spindler last week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Jones has had a longstanding interest-I think he asked a question on this subject earlier this year-about the provision of health services in outback Queensland. The Federal Government is very well aware of the difficulty of people in those provincial and outback areas obtaining access to health services, and there are problems for the health professionals in those areas, whether one is talking about doctors, general practitioners or nurses. Quite often they have to operate with limited support services and provide a range of practice in fields that cover many more areas than would be the case with their city colleagues. I believe they ought to have that professional support and access to continuing education to enable them to undertake those wider fields of practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are particular problems faced by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who comprise a substantial proportion of the population in some of the more remote areas of Australia. Their health concerns are a matter of some concern to the Federal Government. Therefore, the Government is attempting to redress some of the problems faced by country people through a number of different mechanisms. Senator Jones will know that funding was provided for the Rural Doctors Association of Australia to organise the first national rural health conference, which was held in Toowoomba last February. The conference was attended by over 400 people, representing wide-ranging interests and health professionals from rural and remote areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> A national health strategy endorsed by the conference has been accepted by the Australian Health Ministers Conference as a guide for future action. In addition, special support has been given through funding of initiatives designed to improve the education and training of health workers in country regions. For example, the Department of Community Services and Health has established the rural and remote areas unit located in Darwin, which after consultation with local communities will develop arrangements to improve access by rural and remote people to services provided by the Department. The Department is also setting up a pilot scheme in Queensland, which will be of great interest to Senator Jones, to examine options for regionalising its programs and services.</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that real improvements can be achieved in improving the quality of health services to those people living in country Australia. I am sure that, with Senator Jones and other honourable senators keeping the pressure on governments at the Federal, State and local levels, there can, with consultation and cooperation, be a great improvement in health care for those in country Australia and in the circumstances of health professionals practising in those areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday during Question Time Senator Lewis asked me a question, the essential point of which was whether in an election the end justified the means. My response to that question was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Without referring to the original question which Senator Lewis asked me, let me say that, in the context of an election, politics is not a fine art in which the truth is always paramount.</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition senators interjected saying, `Oh!', so Hansard records. I went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Just a minute! There are stacks of examples in Australian political life of people making misleading statements in the course of an election campaign. That has been apparent in each of the recent elections with which I have been associated and remains so.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not retreat from that answer, and I regret that it has been misinterpreted in a number of papers-not in all. I refer to some examples of what I meant by misleading statements in elections. Firstly, there was the massive deception by the Fraser Government in the 1983 election campaign as to the true state of the Australian economy. Secondly, there were the attempts in both 1983 and 1990 by the coalition to mislead in relation to the cost of its Medicare program. There are a number of other examples which I will give in the course of the forthcoming debate.</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Lewis had phrased his question more precisely-for example, asking whether I believed that deliberate lying is an appropriate standard in Australian public life or whether in public life the end justifies the means-my answer to both those questions would have been no.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Lewis on 4 June, relating to the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>For the sake of the Senate, let me repeat the opening paragraph of the question to Senator Button yesterday, in which I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has confessed that he believed it was acceptable for him to mislead the people of Australia about his leadership deal with Mr Keating otherwise, according to the Prime Minister, `We would not have won the election'. </PARA>
<PARA>This goes to the kernel of democracy in this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was saying that this was not a minor lie; this was not even a major lie: this was a lie of such magnitude that, had the people known the truth, the Australian Labor Party would have lost the election. That is how big a lie it was. It was an absolute fraud on the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button is saying that he did not understand what I was saying. The Prime Minister himself had confessed, saying, `Look, if I had told the truth about this matter, the people of Australia would not have voted for us. We would have lost the election, so I had to lie'. Is that the basis of politics in this country? Is that the standard the Labor Party has set for this nation, this democratic nation with a famous tradition and history of democracy. Is that what those in the left wing and right wing of the Labor Party are saying? Is the state of affairs, the state of democracy, in this country such that we are pushed into the situation where a Prime Minister says, `Look, there is a fundamental matter here. I have to tell an absolute lie to the people of this nation. Otherwise, we won't get elected-and it is all right for me to do that because we do not want the other side to win.'? Is that the standard that the Government has set? Let me assure the Government that it is not the standard on our side of politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support what Senator Lewis said. There are many broken promises of this Government. One reflects upon such statements as: there will be no gold tax; there will be no wine tax; there will be no capital gains tax; no child shall live in poverty; and so on. There have been many breaches of promise, but there is a distinction between those and what has occurred on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In each instance the Prime Minister has said, `I did not lie to you when I made the statement. What has happened is that subsequently the circumstances have changed and, as a result of the changed circumstances, we have had to change our policy'. This is different. This is a circumstance in which the deal was made and, at the time of making the deal, the Prime Minister knew that he would be going to the Australian people and subsequently lying-and that is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The other distinction is that in this instance the Prime Minister has admitted that he lied, but he said that the end justified the means. He had the gall to stand up in the other place and say, `Yes, I lied to the Australian people because it was in their best interests. Had they known the truth, they may not have voted for me, so I admit I had to lie to them.' He does not even have the courage to say that he now apologises to the Australian people for that lie. He still stands by it. He says that it is justifiable and in their own interests. I suggest that there is something slightly frightening about a person who adopts that attitude, this demagogue who in some way puts himself above the rational interests of the Australian people, who enters into this pact with the former Treasurer to deceive the Australian people about what was to occur after the election. He so deceived them, and he now acknowledges that he deceived them. That is why Senator Lewis distinguishes this fraud from the previous many broken promises of this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Button gets up to justify what he said or to try to explain away what he said yesterday, he selectively quotes from the last part of his answer. He does not quote from the former part. I will quote from the former part. Senator Button might refer to this when he participates in the debate today. As Senator Lewis said, he asked about the deliberate lie of the Prime Minister. What was the answer of Senator Button to that question? Trying to explain away the situation, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>With the wisdom of hindsight, I see the situation as understandable on the basis of the information which I currently have from reading newspapers and things of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA>So he is linking himself with the Prime Minister's lie. He is saying that in the circumstances which the Prime Minister put to us-that it was in the people's interest that they be deceived-he could understand what the Prime Minister had done. Later on, in answer to the supplementary question, Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the context of an election, politics is not a fine art in which the truth is always paramount. </PARA>
<PARA>That in itself is of great concern, but I draw attention to what he said earlier where, specifically in answer to the question about the fraud of the Prime Minister, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>With the wisdom of hindsight, I see the situation as understandable--</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I think is appalling. That is why I got up in the Senate this morning and gave notice of a motion calling upon the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button)-someone we have always regarded with some respect, I might say-to dissociate himself from what the Prime Minister has done, and to say that it is not too late to invite the Prime Minister himself to apologise to the Australian people for the deceit that he has performed and at least start trying to clean up his act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add some brief comments to what has been said about Senator Button's answer during Question Time yesterday. The supplementary question that was asked of Senator Button by Senator Lewis was quite clear: does the end justify the means? It was the answer to that supplementary question that Senator Button got dreadfully wrong yesterday. I have to say that when I listened to Senator Button today, I rather hoped that he had seen the light and had seen what terribly low standards he had pitched on his Government by that answer yesterday. Then I re-read what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noticed that Senator Button's final comment was that misleading of people had been apparent `in each of the recent elections with which I have been associated and remain so'. He was referring to the elections since 1983. I regret to say that through this exercise that Senator Button has embarked upon today to try to fix up the record, in some senses, he has made it even more grubby. What he referred to yesterday, of course, was the misleading statements and lies that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made successively in all elections since 1983; Senator Button yesterday was not referring to elections in the 1970s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Button speaks to the motion that Senator Lewis has moved that the Senate take note of Senator Button's answer-this deplorable situation in which the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has tried to tidy up a gross statement that he made in answer to Senator Lewis's question yesterday-I wish to add a few remarks about the sequence of events that we have seen this week and the sequence of statements that have been made this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was present in the House of Representatives on Monday, 2 June 1991 when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) faced Question Time. I heard him confess to lying on a significant issue during the last election campaign. No-one could deny that in answer to questions from the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, the Prime Minister acknowledged that he had lied to the Australian public in the last election campaign; that it was a significant lie; that it was, in fact, the difference between his winning and losing that election; and he did not go on to make any apology. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the former Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is on the public record as saying that he finds that lie acceptable behaviour. So we have both Mr Hawke and Mr Keating saying that it is acceptable for the Labor Government part of the Parliament, if not for all politicians, to lie in election campaigns. That is not the view of the Opposition. It is not the view of the public at large. I have never, in my time in Parliament, heard any politicians make any kind of admission of, or give any justification for, lying whether as a Minister of the Government or in an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> To top that off, today we have heard the only clear answer given by one Minister of this Government and that was by Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. He was asked to give a very clear statement as to whether the end justifies the means and he said, `I never believe that the end justifies the means'. It is only after Senator Tate's clear and applaudable statement that Senator Button comes in now to jump off the coalition he has been involved in up to this point with Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. Senator Richardson is in the chamber. On John Laws's radio program today he made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, when you're putting the nation first, as (Mr Hawke) believes he has, then I don't know if you want to put it as `the end justifies the means'- all I know is that the betterment of Australia will justify almost anything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In drawing even further attention to the answer Senator Button has enabled people to make the distinction between this particular lie that has now become part of the history of Australia, and the attempt that is being made to try to fudge this lie with the general question of promises made in election campaigns. It is most important that we look at precisely what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in answer to the question from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on Monday, 2 June 1991. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I assume that the Leader of the Opposition wants a full answer to his question . . . The election was already being run in terms of `A vote for Hawke is a vote for Keating'. It was accepted as politically suicidal if that was the case. It was agreed at the meeting at Kirribilli that no reference would be made to this fact, and for that obvious reason, I have said-and I repeat in this House-that it was a matter of deep regret to me that those political realities forced me into that situation. </PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that it was acceptable to lie to try to refute an argument that was being put to the Australian people and put, I might say, in paid advertising. If we knew of that lie at the next election-after the Government's broadcasting legislation has been passed-we would be unable to put it in paid advertising and tell the Australian people about it because the Australian Labor Party would have gagged free speech. That is the salient lesson of this example. That is why we must have the right to put paid advertising to air. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the only statements that would be made about these matters would be how the press would let statements by people be interpreted. There is no way, if the banning of paid political advertising through television and radio comes into force, that the truth to refute a lie will be able to be given in this country again until that legislation is repealed. If we ever wanted an underlining of the perfidy of the statements that lie behind the introduction of the banning of free speech by this Government, the words of the Prime Minister give it forever:</PARA>
<PARA>The election was already being run in terms of `A vote for Hawke is a vote for Keating'. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of their secret agreement it was. In the terms of their secret agreement we were not allowed to know about the fact that what we were saying had been proven and underwritten by an agreement given in a secret place. </PARA>

The bottom line is that the Australian people were fooled and the Government won an election on the basis of a lie.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Kennett himself telephoned me last night and took objection to my describing him as boofhead--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I seek clarification of a matter of practice. It relates to the order of call of speakers. In this last debate, as I understand it, the normal practice would have been for you, Mr President, or the Deputy President, to call speakers from either side. The last speaker was Senator Button on the Labor side. Senator Walters had clearly indicated her desire to speak, yet the Deputy President called another speaker on the Labor side, Senator McMullan. Is that in accordance with the normal practice or, if the practice has changed, would you advise the Senate what is now the practice? If you need to confer with the Deputy President as to why he took this most unusual course of action in this instance, would you do so? Can I respectfully request that you report to the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to further answer a question asked of me yesterday by Senator Baume in relation to former Senator Morris and some colleagues from the Liquor Trades Union. Honourable senators will recall that Senator Baume has raised in the Senate in the past the matter of internal disputes in the Liquor Trades Union. On this occasion, I understand that the charge laid against each of the persons referred to relates to an event alleged to have occurred in August 1984. That was some time before former Senator Morris was elected to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that no brief of evidence will be provided until the end of July, but the allegations do not concern union funds. I am covering some of the points that Senator Baume raised in the question. Peter James was appointed by me as a board member of the Australian Tourist Commission in May 1988. No approach was made to me by former Senator Morris concerning his appointment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) has advised me that the Australian Tourist Commission Act provides that the Minister may terminate an appointment for misbehaviour. Since there has been no finding against Mr James arising out of these charges, there are no grounds for requiring Mr James to stand down from the board of the Australian Tourist Commission. The Government is considering the question of Mr James's reappointment when his term of office expires on 30 June.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I have spoken to the President and suggested to him that I should make a statement in relation to the matter that was raised by Senator Hill. In relation to the call in the recent brief debate, I noticed that several speakers from my left had spoken in succession. Senator Button then spoke. After Senator Button spoke, Senator McMullan rose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my practice that, if a Minister rises, the Minister receives the call. Senator McMullan is a Parliamentary Secretary and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. Under those circumstances he has the same procedural status, in my mind, as a Minister. Therefore, I gave him the call. Those are the circumstances surrounding the manner in which I gave the call on that occasion. If there had not been several speakers in succession on my left, I may have called differently.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston-I want to clarify one matter, Mr Deputy President. It is my recollection that Senator McMullan approached the Chair prior to rising in his place. I therefore ask whether he indicated to you that he was proposing to close the debate and whether you called him on that basis.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Alston-Mr Deputy President, I do not think that anyone on this side is quarrelling with your recognising anyone on the other side, for that matter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator Bishop</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like you to make a point of clarification, Mr Deputy President. I was concerned by your statement that you regarded a Parliamentary Secretary as equal in status to and the same as a Minister. Yesterday, I shared a platform at the Australian National University with Senator McMullan, who explained very succinctly during the process of his address that he did not have the status of a Minister. He explained very specifically to a group of senior public servants precisely what that role entailed, including the fact that he was unable to answer questions at Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to examine that ruling and perhaps qualify it in some sense because, from the way in which the Government has structured itself, I put it to you that it is really not possible to regard him as `the same as', `equal to in status', or other such phrases, as a Minister, which he clearly is not. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, on Senator Bishop's point: I think that there would be general agreement on this side. With respect, Mr Deputy President, I think you should take on board the point Senator Bishop has made as being generally right. There was a statement made in the House of Representatives a year and a half ago on the duties and roles of Parliamentary Secretaries, but I do not know whether we dealt with it here. That may have been an oversight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the general running of this place, people accept that Parliamentary Secretaries can be very good for any future government because of the chamber duty business and the rest of it. I very much appreciate the attitude of the Opposition to this-not so much in the licence given to us to operate this place in the way we have. I very much want it reinforced that, whilst we may not have defined the role of the Parliamentary Secretary as precisely as we should have, by practice we have. That practice is that a Parliamentary Secretary is not equivalent to a Minister. Whether that is good or bad, I am not to comment. </PARA>
<PARA> I also say, Mr Deputy President, that you have been placed in a difficult position in the call because when leave is given, as it was in this case, and there are six speakers in one direction, the question of fairness comes in. Further, as was accurately pointed out by Senator Baume, the question of tradition in here is that it is one side to the other. I think the Procedure Committee should look at that as much as possible. People were not taking their full time in these circumstances, so that also could have been a factor that we would try to use in this matter. I do not think there was much malevolence on the other side in regard to the tactics in this regard. We should be able to sort it out and lay it down for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be long, Mr Deputy President. For a start, there is no suggestion of ill will. The next point is that you have made a ruling and rulings are important. Irrespective of whether this matter goes to the Procedure Committee, rulings are important because they create a precedent. Part of your ruling, Mr Deputy President, was that when a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary-and let us forget the distinction for a movement-is on his feet, that person will get precedence. To me, that is inconsistent with the practice of this place if we are in the middle of a debate. In other words, the normal practice, as I understand it, is that you would call from one side of the chamber and then the next, irrespective of whether a Minister wants to participate in the debate. I ask whether you would be prepared to reflect on that and, upon reflection, advise the Senate whether you wish the ruling you have made to stand. If you do, there may be other action that we would think should be taken as a result of that. As it is a ruling that has not been made, with the opportunity for careful thought, I invite you to reconsider that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last point I want to make relates to the fact that there were six speakers in a row, or whatever number, on this side. The only reason there were six speakers in a row on this side is that nobody was rising on the other side. I respectfully suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, that that does not mean that, if six people walk in on the other side, you should automatically call them. I do not think it is the correct procedure either and I do not think it is the practice that has been adopted in the past. The practice is that, nevertheless, the occupant of the chair would go back to the normal procedure if speakers were rising on both sides of the chamber. I ask you to consider that as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one further point I wish to add in support of Senator Bishop's statement. It is accepted by the Senate that Parliamentary Secretaries are not Ministers and therefore do not have the entitlement to precedence of the call that Senator Hill referred to. But there is a further point: the reason for giving the call to Senator McMullan apparently is that he is the Manager of Government Business. Our Standing Orders and other orders do not recognise the Manager of Government Business. The reason why the Manager of Government Business has had the call in the past has turned on the fact that it has always, in my experience, been a Minister of the Labor Government. We are taken down a path where we are undone because we now have a Parliamentary Secretary who simply is not a Minister. I do not see that on those grounds you, Mr Deputy President, can treat him with any precedence over any other senator.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that I regarded the Parliamentary Secretary as having the status of a Minister because he was Manager of Government Business in the Senate. It was because of both roles. I believe that the Opposition has tacitly accepted that from time to time. I have noticed that Senator McMullan has moved for the adjournment of the Senate and nobody has complained about it. Technically, not being a Minister, he is unable to do that and he would have to seek leave to do so. I do not consider I am the first to regard him as having the same procedural status as a Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The little debate we have had here earlier this afternoon underlines the desperate need for leadership with integrity in Australia and certainly leadership with some integrity within the Government in this chamber-</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>in order to restore the trust in government that has been destroyed by Labor's state and federal deal-doers, secret negotiators, king-makers, numbers men and `mates'.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to quote from a speech two years ago:</PARA>
<PARA>This motion is about standards; it is about truthfulness; it is about trustworthiness; it is about the quality of Australian public life; it is about fitness for office; and it is about leadership. These matters are decidedly the people's affair, the people's concern, the people's business and, therefore, very properly the business of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are all in a position of service, responsibility and duty to the nation where there is a fundamental requirement for integrity, probity, the ordinary decencies of public life and honourable conduct. It is a special responsibility of the leadership on both sides to protect those values by setting standards and by enforcing them. </PARA>
<PARA>Who said that? That was the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hawke) in one of his more exquisitely hypocritical efforts. The ultimate hypocrisy of this Prime Minister was evidenced in that statement, although I must say there is something prophetic about one of the following sentences where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is already a tawdry, tarnished and, indeed, temporary leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever a man could identify his own problem, that is the man. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Prime Minister, we have had eight years of deals and deception. He began with a deal to dump Hayden. Then he had a deal with big unions, big business and big government, which was called the accord. It is ending now in a deal in which Mr Hawke and Mr Keating deceived each other; witnessed by the way, of course, by representatives of big business and big unions in a big lie. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just a question of broken promises, as has been raised here earlier today, although they are bad enough. But there is a legion of broken promises which we learn to expect from this record breaker of promises. We all remember `there will be no capital gains tax' and we remember that he said that `in words that the Opposition could understand'. We watched his lips. We saw them curl into the usual sneer and then we heard the lie. There is a whole host of lies of this order, but the key lie is the lie which goes to the heart of this Prime Minister's integrity. He is obsessive about the words `lie' and `integrity'. Honourable senators might remember his first significant speech, or his first significant eruption in the House of Representatives, which was to call across the chamber, `He lies and he knows he lies'. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at answers to questions, one finds that on 72 occasions in two years the Prime Minister has used the word `integrity' when referring to himself. The fact is that the Prime Minister has paraded his so-called integrity; he has relied on it; he has used it as currency to buy support. We now find that currency is totally counterfeit. Let us look at the quotes of the Prime Minister over time which, I might say, are fascinating. In 1984, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am proud of my reputation. I will fight to the utmost to defend my integrity against slurs and smears . . . But beyond that, those of us who hold high office have even higher obligations. While we have a right to protect ourselves, we have a duty, a trust placed in us by the people, to protect the office.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that Mr Hawke has done lots of things to protect his office; he has lied to protect it. This is the man who dares to use the word `integrity'. In 1983, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I remarked earlier on the right of the public to have confidence in the integrity of its elected representatives. While that confidence demands particularly high standards in Government Ministers it also demands certain standards of each and every member of this House and each and every member of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the man who lied because he knew that if he did not lie he would not win an election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He got caught out. In 1989, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . we have had the competence, the wit, the intelligence and integrity to work out relevant policies and, secondly and importantly, we have had the capacity to work with the great Australian trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the great Australian trade union movement is one of the groups that the Prime Minister has done deals with. Its representative was one of the people who witnessed the big lie. In 1988, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>My Government still stands . . . as a government of stability and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know which is the more ludicrous of those two statements. Stability? We have the revolving door out of which the former Treasurer has, presumably, temporarily exited before returning and, no doubt, replacing the Prime Minister. Here we have the Prime Minister saying, `A government of integrity'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The standards, integrity, and competence of the ministries that I have had the pleasure, pride, and privilege to lead compare more than favourably with any Government in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>If those are the standards he is setting, what does that say for every other government in this country? If he is the best, God help us from the worst. The fact is that the Prime Minister has grabbed the word `integrity' to wrap around his otherwise clothesless body. This man is like the emperor with no clothes. He claims that he has integrity surrounding him and protecting him. That integrity has been totally wiped away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No members of the Labor Party-apart from the Deputy Whip and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button)-have any interest in the concept of integrity. They do not understand it. They have all, in fact, defended the Prime Minister in his lie. Not one of them-with the possible exception of Senator Tate, I suppose, who today indicated that he was not in favour of that kind of behaviour-has come out strongly, clearly and unequivocally against the Prime Minister. We certainly cannot count Senator Button's quaint comments today as any unequivocal rejection. Not one of them has come out and done so. In 1991, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Only this remains to be said: much of what has been insinuated by the Opposition has sought to question my personal integrity and reputation and to impugn my conduct as the Prime Minister of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the word `integrity'. If we want to play that game, let us go back to the Blanche d'Alpuget biography and see whether we are all still surprised. Let us see whether the leopard has really changed its spots. The fact is that the biography revealed the real Bob Hawke. We are now seeing in the Parliament the real Bob Hawke-the man who will lie in order to win an election because he knows that the truth would defeat him. It is because of this continual appeal to integrity, this continual claim to have integrity, that the hypocrisy that is involved in that man's claim is exposed dramatically by what has happened here. I must say that when Mr Hawke said, `People are cynical about parliamentarians-and with good cause in some instances', I can understand his awareness of that fact because his leading Ministers-for example, Senator Richardson today-are saying that the betterment of Australia will justify almost anything. It reminds me of `what is good for General Bullmoose is good for America'. They are the ones who are to judge this. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>

The arrogance of anyone daring to get up and say, `I have the right to lie because it will be in your best interests if I lie to you, if I mislead you, if I deceive you'. I suppose we could paraphrase Hamlet: `To lie, or not to lie; that is the question'. We know Mr Hawke's answer to that question. We know that he will lie to protect his mates. We have seen the quaint conflict of evidence emerging out of the gold lunch fiasco in Western Australia and we have seen the whole question of mates. We saw Laurie Connell appointed by Mr Hawke to the Board of the Australian National Gallery; Senator John Morris's sidekick on the Board of the Australian Tourist Commission; mates like Burke and the gold lunch; mates in gaol; mates on fraud charges. Now, with the King Hawke, it is almost checkmate-and it will be quite soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Canberra Labor sleaze and lack of integrity simply reflects what has been happening around the whole of Australia: the sleaze of WA Inc.; the collapse of Victoria; the Wran Labor Government in New South Wales, where a Minister was thrown in the clink. While Mr Hawke remains as Prime Minister, he is a hostage of the Left. His promises are subject to its approval because that is all that keeps him in power. He can deliver no longer, so he can promise no longer. What we do know is that we need something better than this perpetual lack of integrity. What we need, of course, is John Hewson as Prime Minister. </PARA>

One can do that with many people involved in politics and come up with the same sorts of quotations which Senator Baume gave from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over a period of time. Taking any Prime Minister or any leading politician we could probably find the same sorts of quotes. If we had the time to do the research on Senator Alston's silly interjections, we could make a case which would be extremely damning to Senator Alston's continuing tenure on the front bench. Senator Baume said that Laurie Connell was appointed to the Australian National Gallery by the Government and that became a sin. After that, Laurie Connell was good enough for the Liberal Party to bot $50,000 off for its election campaign. So let us not be too pious about that sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the appointment to the Gallery was such a terrible thing for a government to do, one would have thought that it would have been known that it was a bad thing to send a former Senate leader to bot money from Laurie Connell. Of course, that is what happened. Senator Baume should not start this debate on high moral ground and sink too quickly into the gutter, because that is a mistake. I am talking about Senator Baume's speech which, of course, has been very interesting. Let us look at this matter of public importance which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The desperate need for leadership with integrity in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that anybody could disagree with that in political life. Wherever it is, there is always a need for leadership with integrity. There is always a need, irrespective of political parties, for trust in government. Senator Baume went on to make his point saying that this has all been destroyed by Labor's State and Federal deal doers, secret negotiators, king-makers, numbers men and mates; no mention of a Prime Minister, about which Senator Baume devoted the whole of his speech. They are the words that Senator Baume put forward and he just ignored every one of those issues. Senator Baume refers to the deals being done by these various people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be, as Senator Button said, that the wording of this particular matter of public importance is somewhat loose; nonetheless, it does raise a very important issue. It goes well beyond the integrity of the leadership; it goes to the very heart of the integrity of the political process. One only needs to go outside this place for a few moments to witness the cynicism and the disillusionment with which the Australian public currently holds the whole political process, not only here but in virtually every State in the Commonwealth. The lack of integrity, to which the discussion refers, is right across the board and is particularly evident in both of the old parties. Both of the old parties have damaged the trust which the public should be able to have in the political process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, this morning Senator Baden Teague called for a conscience vote when we were dealing with the immigration regulations. I note that in doing so he clearly and tacitly admitted that in most instances, because of the party solidarity principle, many members in the old parties vote against their conscience. Indeed, immediately after that vote was taken I was out in the front foyer and I heard a former Minister in the present Government say, `Do you know what we just voted for? We voted to allow poofters to bring their boyfriends into this country'. That former Minister voted for those regulations and, clearly, voted against his conscience. That is what is going on in both the old parties, and that is one of the things that have brought the political process into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to Mr Hawke's promise to Mr Keating. It has been clearly established that Mr Hawke and Mr Keating entered into an arrangement that was witnessed by Sir Peter Abeles and by a person from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) on behalf of Mr Keating. We now know that, while that undertaking was given in 1988, Mr Hawke went to the public in 1990 stating that he would stay for the full term of the incoming government, should he win government. It has now been admitted-and I think it is common among all parties in this place-that that lie was significant and was accepted as a significant element in whether or not the Government could win the election, in a prospective sense, and whether in fact the Government did actually win the election, in a retrospective sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the Government and many Ministers who have defended that lie have argued here that the end indeed does justify the means. Of course, that is an incredibly slippery road on which to embark, and raises the question: what size lie is justified in terms of what the end might be? It reminds me that a few weeks ago a story was circulating in this Parliament House to the effect that God appeared before Mr Hawke and that God said to him that the world would end in 30 days. Mr Hawke then went on television and said to the Australian public, `I have two pieces of news for you, one is that God exists and the second is that no child will be living in poverty more than a month from today'. Having embarked on that slippery road that the ends justify the means, it raises the question of what size lie is justified. No lie, of any size, can be justified in political office. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button raised the matter of honesty in electoral advertising. It is a matter of record that repeatedly in this chamber the Australian Democrats have attempted to introduce into electoral legislation precisely the same terms which successive governments have seen fit to incorporate into the Trade Practices Act, and to impose, on every other person in the community who advertises, the same standards with respect to honesty in advertising, and both the Government and the Opposition have voted against that provision. In other words, the Opposition is just as guilty as the Government in voting to leave open the ability to lie when it comes to political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate that preceded this debate, Senator Bishop used the word `perfidy'. I think that word applies very adequately to Senator Bishop, when she ignores the fact that the Opposition just as much as the Government has voted against the matter of honesty in political advertising. As I have indicated, and as other senators know, Sir Peter Abeles was a party to the agreement between Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. As others have pointed out, that raises the serious question of the Government's ability to make decisions, very important decisions, without being influenced by the very significant power which that witnessing of that undertaking gave to Sir Peter Abeles. </PARA>
<PARA> We need think only of the compensation that the Federal Government provided as a consequence of the airline pilots strike to recognise the enormous power that was being exercised by Sir Peter Abeles owing to his having witnessed that undertaking. Whether that power was ever exercised is beside the point. The point is that the Government chose to give that power in a totally deceitful way. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter in which the Government and the Opposition have combined to defeat the proper democratic processes in this country. One need look only at the processes of democratic representation and recall that, despite very strong evidence that, in the case of the Australian Capital Territory election system, the people of the ACT preferred the Hare-Clark system, which has been in place in Tasmania for many decades but, nonetheless, both parties imposed on the ACT this stupid d'Hondt system which was put in place quite seriously and deliberately to ensure the preservation of the power by the old parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when proposals are put up in many other electorates to adopt a fair system of representation, a system of multi-member electorates and proportional representation, we find that both the Labor Party and the coalition, the Laboreals, as one of my former colleagues called them, have voted against a fair system of electoral representation and have sought consistently to ensconce an unfair and unrepresentative system. These are just some of the processes that give the public no sense of trust-to use a word of emotion-in the integrity of either this Government, the Labor Party or, indeed, the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> One could also go on to mention the question of media ownership, which has been very much to the fore in the news in the past 24 hours and the way in which this Government and the Opposition have consistently supported monopoly media ownership, against the proper democratic interests of the people of Australia, something that the people outside this place are very concerned about. The Government and the Opposition have shown an enormous degree of carelessness in relation to this and it is something which, again, has brought the Government and the Opposition into disrepute as regards the lack of integrity and as regards the lack of trust that the public can place in Government and the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me read out the important first two lines of this eloquent matter of public importance of Senator Baume:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The desperate need for leadership with integrity in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate of comments made by former Finance Minister, Senator Walsh, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald not so long ago:</PARA>
<PARA> The former Finance Minister has said a principal reason why he left Cabinet was because he could not stand another three years of sitting through Cabinet meetings with Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Walsh is utterly contemptuous of Hawke: `Old Jelly-back', as Walsh has been calling Hawke . . . needs `a spine transplant' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether he is a jelly back, a jelly bean, a jelly belly or a jelly baby, but I do know that this Government is led by a Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who has lied to the public and that the ex-Treasurer conspired with him in that lie, that duplicity, for the personal ambitions of both men. </PARA>
<PARA> Remember that it was in November 1988 that Mr Hawke told Mr Keating that he would step down after the 1990 election and that he did not intend at that point to serve his full time if he were elected. Was this a private chat between two honourable men, whose handshake was their word or whose bond was their word? No. This was a meeting which demanded seconds. This was a meeting that demanded witnesses-not a Minister of Her Majesty's Government, not a colleague, not a member of parliament, but people from outside parliament. What did their choice show us? It showed us who is running the country-Bob's rich mates and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> What does the fact that they both need witnesses mean? Here are two men who have known and worked with each other intimately, hand in glove, as the Prime Minister would say, for the past eight years. The Prime Minister of this country and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country were meeting to make an agreement and they needed witnesses. They simply did not trust each other. Perhaps that it is not the greatest sin. The greatest sin is that they did plot, conspire and plan in secrecy about the future of this Government and then lied to the public. Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister, tells us that he governs for all Australians, but now we know that he governs for himself and his mates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His rich mates. Why did the Prime Minister enter into this conspiracy with the former Treasurer? It was simply because he was being threatened, because he was being blackmailed. The Prime Minister was forced to lie to the people of Australia because he was being blackmailed by the then Treasurer. Why was he able to be blackmailed? It is simply because he could not do without Keating as his Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here is a Prime Minister who has based his whole career, his whole reputation, on integrity, openness and frankness. He thinks of himself as having a love affair with the Australian public. The public has certainly been jilted and cheated on this occasion. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A breach of promise. This is a Government of bullies and brutes. This is a Government that puts the interests of mates ahead of the interests of government. This is a Government of eight years of broken promises. What explanation are we given for this bizarre conduct? What explanation are we given for the Prime Minister entering into this conspiracy? We are told it is because the Prime Minister believed that, if he told a lie long enough, even Paul Keating would believe it-even the then Treasurer would see the virtue in his arguments. He thought the Treasurer would decide it would be in the nation's interests if the Prime Minister continued to be Bob Hawke and not Keating. We all know what a modest, self-effacing, reluctant pretender the former Treasurer is-how in the fullness of time he would come to understand that Hawke's strengths and abilities were inevitable and so compelling that he would ultimately respect that!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us remember that it was in November 1988, over two years ago, that Paul Keating went to the Prime Minister. Two years ago he came to the conclusion that the Prime Minister was old, tired, lacking in direction and inspiration and over the hill, had served his purpose and ought to go. Notwithstanding that, the public is expected to repudiate that close-up, microscopic, forensic judgment by the former Deputy Prime Minister of his own Prime Minister that he ought to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Prime Minister tell 16 million people that enormous lie? Why did he so emphatically and categorically tell the Australian people a lie which led them to mistakenly vote one way rather than the other? It was not in the national interests. It was not to the good of the country. It was a grubby, grotty deal, done for self-interest, done in the interests of the Australian Labor Party. Now we are told that it was an aberration; it was a one-off. I remind the Senate of the Channel 9 Sunday program of 11 March 1990 in respect of another matter. The Prime Minister was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Does it worry you that you have to tell fibs to people to win their votes? Hawke: `Well I don't tell fibs to win their votes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is his second great lie. He has not told one great lie; he has told two. The tragedy is that this was not a lie that needed to be told because it was in the national good; it was not a fact that had to be disguised: it was a squalid lie, told for the selfish ambitions of the Prime Minister and the indulgence of his Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if the Treasurer was a wilting flower in this matter. He was not, as he pretends and purports to be now, on the edge of this. He was the instigator; he was the initiator; he was the provocateur. It was a result of his bullying and bludgeoning that he managed to intimidate and coerce this fragile, frail, weak and desperate man, who ultimately succumbed. It was he, as well as the Prime Minister, who was involved in the consummation of this evil plot, which had to be witnessed by rich mates and the ACTU. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought over the last few days that we could expect the Liberal-National Party coalition to get on the front foot because of events that occurred on Friday and Monday but there has been no sign of it at all. I expected a bit of dash and elan and-dare I say it-a touch of excitement from the Opposition, but there was nothing at all. I expected that on Monday, after a challenge to the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), there would be a matter of public importance or an urgency motion, but there was nothing at all from the Opposition. I thought there would be a few tough questions during Question Time but there was nothing at all from the Opposition. I thought that on Tuesday we would get another rough day-a tough matter of public of importance with all the heavyweights from the Liberal Party and the National Party throwing themselves into a debate, but there was nothing then. There were no tough questions asked of the front bench and no urgency motion-nothing at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, on Wednesday, nearly a week after this matter blew up, Opposition senators have brought on a matter of public importance. They have missed the main game, the big chance, yet again. I say to them: well done, fellows. You have your strategy right again. Honourable senators opposite have come in today to tell us that leadership challenges are not the nature of politics; that does not happen in the dynamics of the political process. They have already told us that it is only the Australian Labor Party that from time to time has the odd leadership challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one thing that is different about a leadership challenge in the Labor Party from what the Opposition has been able to throw up over the years. The main difference is that in Mr Hawke and Mr Keating we have two people with the capacity to easily fill the position of Prime Minister of this country. What we have had with the coalition is a series of duds who have been put up for the leadership. Members of the Opposition change their leadership quite often. Malcolm Fraser was a dud who gave us double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment. He was replaced by Mr Andrew Peacock, another absolute dud. He was then knocked over in a leadership challenge by Mr Howard in 1987, 41 votes to 29-another absolute dud from the Liberals. Then they had a look at the public opinion polls and decided that Howard could not lead them to victory in the 1990 Federal election. So he was replaced by Mr Andrew Peacock recycled, whose winning margin was 44 votes to 28-again an absolute dud. </PARA>

But the Opposition is not into backroom deals; it is not into backroom politics at all; it is not into worrying about negotiations, mates or doing things behind closed doors-not at all. This could not be the Liberal Party that Milton Cockburn was referring to on 12 May 1989 in the Sydney Morning Herald in an article headed `Peacock's troubles begin'. It could not have been the Liberal Party that he was talking about when he mentioned the votes that were switched and those who changed their vote. Milton Cockburn said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is not a small deception. This is not even a major deception. This is a conspiracy to defraud the people of Australia. This is a lie of such magnitude that the Prime Minister has acknowledged that he considered he would have lost the election if he had not told that lie to the people of Australia. This was the big lie. He believes that if the lie is big enough, one can get away with it. Mr Hawke has conducted himself on that basis all through his career, including when he was president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions as well as now as Prime Minister of Australia. He deliberately set out to deceive the people of Australia so that he could win an election, and Mr Keating joined with him in that deception. It was a conspiracy to deceive the people of Australia. The explanation of this Prime Minister, who thinks it is perfectly acceptable to defraud the Australian electorate, was given in the House of Representatives yesterday. He defended himself on this matter by saying:</PARA>

Senator Collins is yet another Government Minister who is saying that. Senator Richardson has said it; Senator Ray has said it; Senator Button said it yesterday but qualified himself; Mr Howe has said it over in the other place; all of these Ministers are saying, `Yes, that is right. The end justifies the means and we support what the Prime Minister has said'. Stalin and Hitler also believed that they were right. They also believed that their actions were in the best interests of the people. This Prime Minister really thinks that he can walk on water. Again I quote from what the Prime Minister said in the House of Representatives yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I profoundly believed . . . that only Bob Hawke could have won the 1990 election. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he thinks. He thinks that he was the only person who could have won the 1990 election. At no stage has he ever said in his defence to this charge of perjuring himself to the people of Australia that he has done anything wrong. He is still saying that it is all right, that he is quite justified in doing this because ultimately it was in the best interests of the people that he led the Australian Labor Party and won the election for it. He made two points in his speech yesterday. These were his only defence-if we can call it a defence. He now claims that he will serve the full term and that he could not have delivered the prime ministership to Mr Keating and could have only created the vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to those statements. Does anybody believe him? Does Senator Collins believe that both Mr Hawke and Mr Keating did not believe that Mr Hawke could deliver the prime ministership to Mr Keating? Of course Mr Hawke believed it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Faulkner said a short while ago in his brief remarks, it is a pity that the Opposition did not come here today with a sense of vision. All the Opposition does is continue to ebb away. I must say, I have always been intrigued by the utter fascination of the Liberal Party of Australia with the internal processes of the Australian Labor Party-an utter absorption with the internal processes of the ALP. Politics on the other side of the chamber must be absolutely tedious-not to say boring-given the amount of time that the Liberals spend talking about the internal processes of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that there is no sense of vision opposite at all, not only on this issue but on virtually any matter that comes before the chamber, I thought I would see if I could find an appropriate quote on leadership, given that Senator Michael Baume raised the issue of leadership in his proposition. That is precisely what we are talking about. That is precisely the issue that is before us. I know that when one weighs up the value of leadership, few people could put words together better than the great American political writer, Theodore Sorensen, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>This planet has no dearth of powerful figures, wealthy figures, even wise and worldly figures.

<PARA> It has been a feature of the leadership and the decision-making processes of this Government since 1983 that leadership with integrity has been demonstrated time and time again. Five examples will suffice. In industrial relations, surely the processes of the prices and incomes accord is an area where negotiation is far more appropriate than the adversarial and confrontationist policies that we see opposite. Again, in the area of trade, the focus on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; on building the Cairns group of countries to participate more effectively in arguing our case in the Uruguay Round; and on being forthright with the Americans, the Japanese and the Europeans-that is leadership with integrity. So is micro-economic reform and pushing along those processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the people opposite is that all they are capable of doing is making empty sounds. No alternative policy ever emerges from them on anything and they know it. That is why they have just gone silent. </PARA>

<PARA> During the Gulf war, leadership with integrity was offered by this Government and accepted by the Australian people in terms of the manner in which we contributed and participated, and lived up to our international obligations. We did not take the easy options. We offered leadership with integrity. The same can be said in the Defence area when one looks at the Wrigley report, coming hard on the heels of the Dibb report; and the full impact of the full structure review. These are difficult issues that are being approached on the basis of leadership underlined with integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Opposition. This is a coalition that gave us tax cuts which disappeared in five months. Tax cuts offered at the end of 1977 to win votes in an election, as Senator Foreman and Senator Collins will recall, disappeared in the mini-Budget of May 1978. This is the coalition which gave us Phil Lynch's rubbery figures in Budget after Budget. This is the coalition which gave us the capital gains tax scare of 1980 to steal the election. You have to have an institutional memory in this place-it is not a matter of talking about the politics of last week, it is a matter of talking about the politics of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the coalition which has produced the most dishonest State government in the history of the country, the Greiner-Murray State Government in New South Wales, which has broken over 200 election commitments from 1988 to the present time, and it is still going strong. This is the coalition which sustained the Bjelke-Petersen Government in Queensland until 1986-the most cynical and contemptible State government on the continent, ever. The Bjelke-Petersen Government raised the doing of deals, mentioned by Senator Baume, to a science of grubby manipulation and sleazy self-reward. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the coalition that gave us Robin Gray's Liberals who published phoney advertisements at the time of the last Tasmanian State election in the names of dummy organisations that were simply fronts for the Liberal Party. For the coalition to talk about leadership with integrity is akin to Jim and Tammy Bakker talking about religious inspiration. It is a sham, it is phoney and it is based on a fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the coalition that gave us the treachery of Fred Chaney. This is the same coalition that gave us Billy Snedden murdered by Fraser. Then Peacock attempted to murder Fraser. Then, of course, Howard killed Peacock and Peacock killed Howard. Hewson tried to exhume Andrew Peacock and failed. It is a record of utter treachery. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 May 1991 the Senate resolved that the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before 30 September 1991: the question of whether there are effective legal and administrative deterrents to prevent the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information as discussed on pages 14 to 16 of the Privacy Commissioner's 1989-90 annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Committee has recommended that the Government provide as a matter of urgency its response as to action it has taken, is taking or intends to take, in relation to the matters raised in the report: in particular, sanctions against public servants who disclose personal information held by a government agency without authorisation; the criminal law as it applies to those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency; and the coverage of the Privacy Act in relation to the Privacy Commissioner's power, firstly, to investigate the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of personal information held by a government agency and, secondly, to award damages to those who have been harmed by the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee reference stemmed from the Government's failure to address the concerns that were expressed by the Privacy Commissioner in two annual reports about the unauthorised disclosure of government information by Commonwealth public servants. Not only has the Government ignored the recommendations of the Privacy Commissioner, but also it has failed to address the problem despite five months of continuing evidence of unauthorised disclosures of the Commonwealth Government brought before the Independent Commission against Corruption in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no positive action from the Government, despite evidence that confidential information is being leaked from a host of Commonwealth agencies, including the Department of Social Security, the Australian Taxation Office, the Health Insurance Commission, the Australian Customs Service, Telecom Australia, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government pays marvellous lip service to the role of the Privacy Commissioner. Whenever privacy concerns are expressed in the public arena the Government does not hesitate to jump on the Privacy Commissioner's back. Whenever privacy issues endanger Government legislation, Ministers claim-without fail-that they are earnestly consulting with the Privacy Commissioner. However, when there is no political mileage to be made from the Privacy Commissioner or when his privacy concerns do not suit the Government, we witness a complete change of tune from the Government benches. Senator Richardson's argument last year about the role of the Privacy Commissioner in the formulation of Government policy is testimony to this change in tune. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's deaf-eared response to the Privacy Commissioner's repeated concerns about the unauthorised disclosure of Commonwealth information is a clear example of its blinkered approach to his public and legislative responsibilities. I note here that it is not an easy task. The Privacy Commissioner is charting totally new waters-where I am sure he has met with complaints from both sides of this chamber. Yet when he asks for assistance and presents an annual report to this Parliament, on two occasions he has not been heard. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the conclusion of its report the Committee states that it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has sought to amplify the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner. It notes the government's commitment to respond to committee reports within three months of them being tabled and now seeks a response from the government. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to put on record my appreciation of the Committee's expeditious and efficient consideration of this matter. I particularly congratulate the staff of that Committee. They were considerably over-loaded with work. I urge the Government to respond within the three-month deadline. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President this Bill reflects the Government's commitment to the continuing process of fine tuning the migration legislation. In particular, it seeks to improve the efficiency of processing people who wish to travel to, enter or leave Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are essential to ensure Australia continues to have the flexibility in law to be able to respond to the pressures of migration of people from all over the world:</PARA>
<PARA> . those seeking to visit Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> . those who are seeking to make a new home in this country; and</PARA>
<PARA> . others who simply seek refuge here. </PARA>
<PARA>The previous Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs made it clear on a number of occasions that there would be a continuing process of fine tuning the major and far reaching reforms brought about by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. That Amendment Act removed from the Migration Act its wide discretionary powers, and provided for the policy to be translated into law in the form of regulations. These regulations which are subject to parliamentary scrutiny, have brought uniformity and consistency to decision making. </PARA>
<PARA>In the present Minister's statement to the House in May of last year he detailed a 3-phase approach to changes to the migration legislation. Some decisions that the Government took at that time required changes to the Migration Act itself and this Bill deals with some of those. This Bill also deals with Government decisions taken since then on such matters as merits review of decisions and illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions in the Bill fall mainly into three broad areas. </PARA>
<PARA>First and perhaps the most significant feature of the Bill, is the introduction of a new regime for the immigration processing of undocumented and unexpected arrivals, such as `boat people', where, because of timing, numbers or needs, it is not appropriate to process in the rigid custodial regime of the existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Those provisions are primarily designed to handle people whose claims have been determined and who are awaiting removal from Australia or whose claims can be determined in a relatively short time. The new regime will enable their processing in a fair and orderly way, including the provision of humanitarian assistance and medical treatment on arrival, without releasing those people into the broader community before their claims have been properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA>Second, the Bill introduces some important changes to merits review. It will allow for:</PARA>
<PARA> . a significant increase in the time given to seek review of decisions;</PARA>
<PARA> . a broadening of the classes that are reviewable; and</PARA>
<PARA> . a modification of the Minister's unique public interest powers to protect the interest of applicants for merits review. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes take account of submissions from the community and advice from the Administrative Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Third, the Bill introduces other important concessions and measures to improve efficiency and enhance the Act's operation. These include the protection of returning residents from innocently falling foul of provisions which could cause them to become illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Bill will assist people who are ordered to be deported. They will have the right to request or consent to their deportation before the expiry of the period of grace and thereby minimise their liability for custody costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also making provision to require all visa and entry permit application forms to include a requirement for a declaration to be made about the applicant's character or conduct or both. All non-citizen applicants or, in some cases, another person on the applicant's behalf, for example the parents of children, will be required to make the declaration. The making of the declaration will be a precondition to the existence of a grantable application and a false and misleading statement in a declaration will make the applicant an illegal entrant. The provisions enhance existing administrative practice by making the declarations a statutory requirement and linking false or misleading statements directly to the sanctions of becoming an illegal entrant. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, perhaps the most significant feature of the Bill is the introduction of a new regime for the orderly processing of persons who arrive in Australia without documentation. I speak primarily of persons who arrive by boat at our northern shores such as the Cambodian boat arrivals. It is important that such people be treated sensitively and yet in a manner which is conducive to orderly migration procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Such persons require immigration processing before they can be allowed to enter Australia-that is entry according to the Migration Act-as distinct from being physically present in Australia. It is often inappropriate to process them within the custodial regime of the existing provisions of the Act at sections 88 and 89. Those sections are more appropriate for cases where a decision to turn around the person or to allow the person to enter can be quickly made. Recognising this, the Bill also makes it possible to transfer a person from section 88 or 89 custody into what will be called a processing area. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of their immigration status, persons being processed under the new regime will be called unprocessed persons. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will appreciate that when such people arrive in Australia it is necessary to check their identities and that their claims for entry to Australia be thoroughly investigated. To do otherwise would provide Australia with a reputation for being a soft target for persons simply wishing to find a better place to live. </PARA>
<PARA>The new provisions will allow immigration officials the time necessary to make fully informed decisions about the entry of these people to Australia. Until these people are properly processed for immigration purposes they will be regarded as not having entered Australia for the purposes of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>To support these procedures the Bill provides for them to be kept in processing areas. These processing areas will be gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA>Under these provisions a person will be removed from Australia if they become a prohibited person. </PARA>
<PARA>A prohibited person is defined as someone who:</PARA>
<PARA> . Has requested to leave Australia. I make the point that they are free to leave Australia at any time they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> . Has not applied for an entry permit within the prescribed period of time. These time limits will be specified by regulation. This prevents an unprocessed person from stalling processing by not applying for an entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> . Is refused an entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA>The status of prohibited person is most likely to arise where a decision is made after identification of the individual and full consideration of the individual's claims. </PARA>
<PARA>In common with certain other provisions in the Migration Act there are penalties provided to deal with people who bring undocumented people to Australia. They will be responsible for meeting the costs associated with the processing of these persons' claims, including accommodation and other maintenance costs. </PARA>
<PARA>I have mentioned section 89 of the Act-the turn around provision which primarily deals with persons who arrive undocumented by air. This section has been amended to make it clear that its notice provision in relation to carriers is not incorrectly linked to the ability to remove and keep in custody persons who are not allowed to enter Australia. The notice provision in section 89-as in the comparable new processing area provisions-was only intended to render the carrier liable for the costs of removing the person and the custody and maintenance of the person while awaiting removal. </PARA>
<PARA>I now wish to address in some detail the changes to the merits review system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Amendment Act of 1989 made provision for a statutory two-tier merits review system of certain decisions under the Migration Act. The aims of that system-not just independent review but review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick-continue to be met. These changes are in the nature of fine tuning but at the same time give significant benefits to applicants. </PARA>
<PARA>The time in which review can be sought has been effectively doubled. At present a review applicant in Australia has 28 days in total in which to seek review both at the first tier and if necessary at the second level of review. Any delay by the applicant in seeking a review at the first level effectively runs down the time they have to seek any review at the second tier. These provisions are difficult to explain and confusing to applicants. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill means that there will be 28 days for each level of review for applicants in Australia and in the case of applicants not in Australia 70 days for each level of review. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the classes of decisions that can be reviewed have been broadened. Section 120 of the Act does not allow for review of certain classes of would-be review applicants, in particular illegal entrants who have had an earlier entry permit application rejected. This Bill will allow:</PARA>
<PARA> . humanitarian consideration to be given to applicants whose refugee claims have been rejected; and</PARA>
<PARA> . access to merits review to longstanding illegal entrants who came forward as a result of the Government's concessions that took effect in December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>I have previously referred to the Minister's special public interest powers which can be exercised following merits review of a decision. The kind of decision that the Minister can now make under section 115 following first tier review is on the basis `that is more favourable to the applicant'. The amendments to this Bill will allow the Minister to set aside a review decision that is unfavourable to the applicant and substitute a decision favourable to the applicant and which is one the applicant initially sought, or one that the applicant agrees to. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to recognise however that the exercise of the Minister's special public interest powers at sections 115 and 137 of the Act are non-compellable and the Minister has no legal duty to consider their exercise or to exercise them regardless of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>While speaking of the Minister's unique powers, the Bill introduces an amendment which makes it clear that any reference in the Act to the grant of a visa or entry permit is subject to sections 24 and 34 of the Act and therefore subject to control by regulations under the Act. However, the amendment also recognises that the Minister's special powers in sections 115 and 137 are an exception. </PARA>
<PARA>While on the subject of merits review, the Bill brings the remuneration and allowances of the members of the Immigration Review Tribunal-the second tier of merits review-into line with changes to the structure of the Senior Executive Service brought about by amendments to the Public Service Act 1922. This is not a pay rise but simply a realignment to continue the original parity with the Senior Executive Service. </PARA>
<PARA>I finally turn to detail some of the other important concessions and measures to improve efficiency and enhance the operation of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The concept of entry visas is expanded by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The entry visa was introduced into the Migration Act in December 1988 as part of the `Master Plan' for passenger processing at Australian airports. It was a most significant step then as it enabled a single document to be issued for travel to Australia which also operated as an entry permit on entering Australia. There was no need to separately issue an entry permit at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA>That arrangement has been very successful and the Government has decided to take the concept a stage further with this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill amends the entry visa provisions so that an entry visa can be issued to a person in Australia to operate immediately as an entry permit and should the holder leave Australia, as an entry visa. </PARA>
<PARA>This will greatly simplify the documentation regulating travel to and stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>While on the subject of the `Master Plan' for passenger processing and visas, an extended definition of `valid visa' has been provided to include those documents which, prior to November 1979, were issued administratively to enable non-citizens to travel to Australia. While there may only be relatively few of these documents still in existence the amendment is necessary so that they may be removed from circulation by cancellation and replaced with the current return visas. This will ensure that procedures for re-entry into Australia are standardised. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of adjustments are made by the Bill to the section 20 provisions which can, in conjunction with section 14 of the Act, cause a person to become an illegal entrant where the person has failed to make certain disclosures to immigration officials. Currently, an Australian resident, who has, either in Australia or during a visit abroad, contracted some disease or condition which had to be disclosed to the authorities would become an illegal entrant if the disclosure was not made. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment recognises that a returning resident should not be subject to this provision and provides an exemption from the consequences of not making a disclosure of his or her disease or condition unless he or she was suffering from that disease or condition when they originally entered Australia and did not disclose that fact. </PARA>
<PARA>These concessions do not disturb the broad coverage of section 20 in relation to people who do not notify certain health and character conditions prior to or on arrival in Australia. However the amendments mean that permanent residents who return to Australia after travelling overseas will not suffer as a result of innocently falling foul of section 20 on medical grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>Other words have been inserted into section 20 to emphasise the point that a person on each and every entry and re-entry to Australia comes within the reach of the section and requires the appropriate official endorsement under the section on each and every entry and re-entry to avoid `breaching' it. </PARA>
<PARA>A technical amendment is also made to the section 20 provisions to stress that a person making a false or misleading statement in a declaration about character or conduct in a visa or entry permit application form is in `breach' of section 20 and hence becomes an illegal entrant. </PARA>
<PARA>I spoke earlier of the changes the Bill makes in the wake of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 which fundamentally changed the nature of decision-making under the Act. That Amendment Act meant that a decision under the Act to grant or refuse a visa or entry permit, with the exception of the Minister's special public interest powers, is controlled by regulations. Section 47 of the Act-which deals with the grant of permanent entry permits after entry to Australia-has consequently been left with some redundant provisions. These are now being removed. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other important though somewhat technical amendments which are set out in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this package of amendments will allow for the more flexible and efficient processing of persons who wish to travel to Australia or who seek to remain in this country after arrival by air or sea or who are required to leave Australia whether voluntarily or otherwise. Importantly, it introduces additional controls on the flow of potential illegal entrants into Australia while at the same time allowing Australia to uphold its reputation as a country prepared to treat justly and fairly people who seek to enter it. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill first makes an amendment to the Social Security Act 1947 so that, with effect from 15 April 1991, a special benefit will be payable, at the discretion of the Secretary to the Department of Social Security, to a person who is the holder of an extended eligibility (spouse) entry permit on the basis of a relationship with an Australian resident where the application for that permit was made on or after 15 April 1991. This coincides with the commencement of the Migration Regulation that operates in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA>The new clear English Social Security Act 1991 reflected the 1947 Act as it stood at the end of the Autumn Sittings 1990. The 1991 Act will come into operation on 1 July 1991. Amendments made to the 1947 Act during the Budget Sittings 1990 and the Autumn Sittings 1991 need to be incorporated into the 1991 Act before then. The exercise is a straight translation of existing policy and is being done in two stages. </PARA>
<PARA>First, the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for amendments made to the 1947 Act by the Social Welfare (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1990, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1990 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1990 to be incorporated into the 1991 Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Second, this Bill will provide for amendments made to the 1947 Act during the Autumn Sittings 1991 to be incorporated into the 1991 Act. To that end, the Bill makes amendments to the 1991 Act to exclude approved scholarships from the definition of income, to exempt moneys invested in certain funeral bonds from the ordinary income and assets tests, to confirm the primacy of Commonwealth legislation in relation to recovery of overpayments from compensation lump sums, to provide for the qualification for special benefit of certain holders of extended eligibility (spouse) entry permits and to provide for some minor policy and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also makes some amendments to the 1991 Act to give effect to policy initiatives. The maintenance income free areas for pensions and benefits are to be indexed on 1 July each year. The maintenance income free area is the amount of maintenance or child support a person can receive before affecting the rate of her or his pension or benefit. This annual indexation will ensure that the allowable level of maintenance or child support is not eroded over time by inflation and will maintain consistency with the introduction of annual indexation of the basic pension free area for ordinary income from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The pharmaceutical allowance is to be indexed from the first pension or benefit payday after 20 September each year. This will ensure that a person is compensated fully for any increase in the concessional beneficiary charge on 1 October each year. The Bill makes amendments to give force to this change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1990 provided that, as from 1 July 1990, portability of wife's pension and class B widow's pension would be restricted to 12 months. Payment would cease after 12 months' absence where a person leaves Australia on or after 1 July 1990. Where the person left Australia before 1 July 1990, payment would cease on 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government undertook to revise these provisions following concern expressed by, and extensive consultations with, various community and welfare groups. The amendments to be made by this Bill give effect to that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA>Also included in the Bill is the insertion as a Schedule to the 1991 Act of a social security agreement with the Netherlands, an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 to ensure that a person is not disqualified from enjoying the benefits attached to holding a pharmaceutical benefits card because of the operation of the deeming provisions in either the 1947 Act or the 1991 Act and provisions to make some minor policy and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY (DISABILITY AND SICKNESS SUPPORT) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would implement further significant reform to the Australian social security system. It would give effect to the major initiatives announced in the 1990 Budget to restructure income support for people who are disabled or sick. It would see the introduction of an entirely new strategy-which will help us deal far more effectively with the needs of people disabilities in the 1990's. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not need to remind members of the urgent need for these reforms. For many years now, the basis for, and the operation of, invalid pension and sickness benefit have not been satisfactory. With invalid pension, the problems stemmed from the qualification criteria set out in the legislation, and subsequently elaborated in administrative law. With the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) gaining jurisdiction to hear invalid pension appeals in 1981, a solid body of principles regarding the key concepts of invalid pension were erected, such as the terms ``permanently incapacitated for work'' and ``85% incapacity''. </PARA>
<PARA>The AAT went a considerable way in taking account of socioeconomic factors and the labour market in assessing a person's incapacity for work. We reached the stage where a person could suffer from a minor medical condition but, because of a combination of age, education, lack of skills in English, work history and worker's compensation, could end up receiving invalid pension. Subsequent legislative amendments in 1987 went some way to reducing the impact of socioeconomic factors by introducing a requirement that at least half of the permanent incapacity had to be directly caused by a physical or mental impairment. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, there were a small but significant percentage of cases where relatively young people, even people in their 20's, who were not manifestly impaired but were being awarded invalid pension with the expectation that they would continue to receive it on an indefinite basis. The concept of permanent incapacity for work became self-fulfilling and only some 2 per cent of invalid pensioners went off pension because of their return to employment. Overall, there has been minimal movement into the labour market by invalid pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Another important issue has been the failure of any significant number of invalid pensioners to benefit from rehabilitation. Very few were referred or, if referred, accepted for rehabilitation. This was basically due to a lack of motivation which again appears to be linked to the fact that invalid pension was regarded as a permanent payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Sickness benefit has also had a number of problems. The first problem is a matter of statutory interpretation as the level of incapacity is not specified in the legislation. Although some AAT decisions have agreed with the Department of Social Security that the level intended is total incapacity, the issue should be beyond question. </PARA>
<PARA>Another problem has been that the medical certificates provided by the beneficiaries' treating doctors are often vague and of very little assistance in assessing qualification. This has led to routine referral to a Commonwealth Medical Officer, in particular where a person is on sickness benefit for an extended period. The end result of these problems has been that there have been many cases where clients with impairments too insignificant to warrant grant of invalid pension have continued on sickness benefit for several years, in a manner which is inappropriate to the intentions of the payment. Although recent review measures have significantly reduced the number of long term beneficiaries, it is important to make the short term nature of the payment clear in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The major changes introduced in this Bill build on the successful social security reforms of recent years which have received widespread community support. The changes are based on the report of the Social Security Review, ``Income Support For People With Disabilities'', extensive community consultation and the work of the inter-departmental Disability Task Force. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the replacement of invalid pension by disability support pension (DSP) which will have revised qualification criteria. It will also provide for the replacement of sickness benefit by sickness allowance (SA) which will be more clearly defined and will not be payable on an indefinite basis. Other changes will include an increase in the rate of mobility allowance from $22 a fortnight to $40 a fortnight, and the phasing out or abolition of incentive allowance, rehabilitation allowance and sheltered employment allowance. The portability provisions will also be tightened. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill would also provide that children who are attracting child disability allowance are eligible for a Health Care Card. The extension of eligibility for Health Care Cards is an important element of the Disability Reform Package and would assist those families providing daily care for children with disabilities and who, therefore, incur higher medical and pharmaceutical costs. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives effect to a wide ranging strategy for a comprehensive reform of disability support. The main features of the new disability support pension are that, to qualify, a person must have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20% or more and a continuing inability to work for the next 2 years. A permanently blind person will automatically qualify for a disability support pension, under provisions similar to those current for invalid pension. Those in receipt of invalid pension just before the commencement of disability support pension on 1 October 1991, will automatically be granted disability support pension without having to lodge a fresh claim. </PARA>
<PARA>A key aspect of the disability support pension is that the inability to work as defined in this Bill must stem completely, or virtually completely, from the person's impairment. Non-medical factors will not be considered in the process of assessing a person's inability to work except that, for people aged 55 or over, consideration will be given to the connection between their age and the likelihood of their finding work in the local labour market. This Bill would include the provision for the deferment of disability support pension payments for relevant persons who do not take reasonable steps to meet the active requirements of the pension-to receive treatment, undergo a program of assistance or undertake job search and work. However, these provisions will not commence until 1 October 1993 when the infrastructure for the reforms will be complete. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an initiative aimed very much at providing real hope and assistance for people who are disabled or sick. It offers assistance and scope for people who are disabled or sick to acquire skills so that they will be better placed both now and when the labour market starts to improve. To encourage transition to work, a disability support pensioner who finds employment will, in the majority of cases, have his or her pension suspended for up to 2 years rather than cancelled outright. </PARA>
<PARA>For those who are completely, or virtually completely, incapacitated for work temporarily because of sickness or accident, a sickness allowance will be payable. This allowance will generally be payable for periods of up to 13 weeks at which time fresh medical and other evidence will be required. Payments will not extend beyond 12 months except in exceptional circumstances where it is clear that the person's incapacity will end during the next 12 months, or where the existing condition seriously worsens or a new condition develops. </PARA>
<PARA>An employment entry payment of $200 will be paid to any qualified person on a disability support pension who finds full-time work or whose earnings from work exceed the level of income at which either job search or newstart allowance ceases to be paid to a person aged 21 years or over. This, as well as the suspension rather than cancellation of pension for disability support recipients trying out work, will encourage a person in receipt of a disability support pension to take up work to the extent possible and prepare the person to enter the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would continue the development of a common allowance structure for income support given to young people. This will be done by aligning the rates of disability support pension for people who are under 21 with the rates of job search and newstart allowance payable to people under 21. However, this Bill recognises the extra expenses that have to be borne by young people with disabilities and it provides for the payment of a youth disability supplement to people under 21 who will be receiving disability support pension. The supplement is to be aligned with the rate of child disability allowance. Also, the income and assets tests will not apply to the maximum basic rates of disability support pension payable to a person under 21 who is permanently blind. Additionally, a disability support pension recipient aged under 18 is, for similar reasons, not subject to a parental income or assets test. </PARA>
<PARA>A central feature of the Disability Reform Package is a greater emphasis on rehabilitation and assistance to return to the labour market. This will not of course be possible for invalid pensioners and disability support pensioners residing overseas. Unlimited portability for all invalid pensioners would, therefore, be inconsistent with the present direction of reform. This Bill will limit the portability of invalid pensions to 12 months for new pensions granted on or after 1 July 1991. This limitation will not apply to pensioners who are assessed as severely disabled or where a social security international agreement provides otherwise. This amendment will also bring the rules for portability of invalid pension into line with the 12 month limitation for sole parent and wife pensions. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by emphasising the positive directions of these reforms. There must be no impression that this Bill will penalise those who are disabled or sick. Rather, the Government's desire is to avoid the problems of the past where, too often, income support has been seen as the final and only solution, with no integration with rehabilitation or labour market assistance. The provisions in the Bill would signify a new deal for people who are disabled or sick to help not only their participation in the labour force, but in the broader life and work of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY (REWRITE) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The clear English Social Security Bill 1990 was introduced into the House of Representatives during the Budget Sittings 1990 and reflected the 1947 Act as it stood as at the end of the Autumn Sittings 1990. The Social Security Bill 1990 is now the Social Security Act 1991 and will come into operation on 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments made to the 1947 Act during the Budget Sittings 1990 and the Autumn Sittings 1991 will need to be incorporated into the 1991 Act before it comes into effect. This involves a straight translation of existing policy and will be done in two stages. </PARA>
<PARA>First, the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for amendments made to the 1947 Act by the Social Welfare (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1990, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1990 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1990 to be incorporated into the 1991 Act. This covers initiatives such as:</PARA>
<PARA> . tax file numbers;</PARA>
<PARA> . deeming (loans and deposits);</PARA>
<PARA> . liquid assets tests for sickness beneficiaries;</PARA>
<PARA> . recovery of overpayments;</PARA>
<PARA> . employment entry payment for sole parents;</PARA>
<PARA> . disaster relief payments;</PARA>
<PARA> . extension of qualification criteria for remote area allowance;</PARA>
<PARA> . extension of qualification criteria for carer pension;</PARA>
<PARA> . pharmaceutical supplement and allowance; and</PARA>
<PARA> . the amended international social security agreement with the United Kingdom and the new one with Malta. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget 1990 initiatives which affect the unemployment benefit and job search allowance structure in the 1947 Act are incorporated into the new provisions for job search allowance and newstart allowance to be inserted into the 1991 Act by the Social Security (Job Search and New- start) Amendment Bill 1991 which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 April 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 will also provide for some minor technical refinements to be made to the 1991 Act to make sure that it correctly reflects the current legislation and policy. </PARA>
<PARA>In the second stage of updating the 1991 Act, amendments made to the 1947 Act by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 (introduced into the House of Representatives on 13 March 1991 and dealing with initiatives such as exemption from the income and assets tests for certain funeral bonds, approved scholarships and compensation recovery) will be incorporated into the 1991 Act by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Social Security Act 1991, the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 and the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains a number of minor changes to improve the administration of benefits for veterans and dependants under Veterans' Affairs legislation. These relate to the repeal of obsolete provisions for Boer War Veterans, the payment of pharmaceutical allowance to orphans not in receipt of orphan's pension, indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance, amendment of the Repatriation Commission's review powers to allow certain decisions to commence from a date earlier than the date on which the decision is made, the removal of an anomaly affecting the adjustment of pension following lump sum compensation payments under the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, amendment of the definition of ` `disease'' and indexation of the maintenance free area. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of other minor amendments to the provisions for service pension have been made to bring these into line, and maintain consistency with, the Social Security Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The most important and far reaching change, however, relates to the Government's decision, announced on 22 January 1991, to extend benefits to dependants of female veterans on the same basis as applies to dependants of male veterans. These changes will remove a longstanding area of discrimination in the payment of benefits to the dependants of veterans and will ensure that the dependants of servicewomen who served in the Persian Gulf, as well as dependants of female veterans from earlier conflicts, will be entitled to benefits under Veterans' Affairs legislation. This will include entitlement to Defence Service Homes loan and insurance benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The extension of benefits to the dependants of female veterans will cost an estimated $1.601m in 1991/92, $1.847m in 1992/3, $2.094m in 1993/4 and $2.339m in 1994/5. The indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance will cost an estimated $1.127m in 1991/92, $2.524m in 1992/93, $3.821m in 1993/94 and $5.079m in 1994/95. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will not have any other significant financial implications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking when this matter was adjourned some hours ago, so it is difficult to recall exactly where I was, but at the time I think I was commenting on the Australia Democrat amendment about voluntary work. I explained the situation for people under 18 years of age and over 55 years of age. So I believe the question that Senator Lees would wish to be putting to me, were she on her feet, would be, `What happens to the rest?'. I was about to explain that. I was saying that any age that we decided on for the cut-off point would be a problem. I do not think that the ages of 18 or 55 are any worse than any other age that one might try to set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the question then is why should we do this at all, the answer is that the group of people between the ages of 18 and 55 are those who are the most employable. They are the ones who, with assistance in labour market programs, et cetera, would be most likely to find work. So, for that group of people, we want to place the emphasis on the provision of courses and work placements, et cetera. That is the reason for the difference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To continue on the issue of voluntary work, it goes back to an earlier question I asked regarding the actual number of hours per week people are expected to be looking for work. I agree that it is very difficult to set a specific figure. However, if we take Adelaide as an example, people get the Adelaide Advertiser on Wednesdays and Saturdays and they can check through the jobs. That probably takes no more than 15 or 20 minutes. A person may be lucky enough to find something at the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) but, out of all those jobs suitable, they would be very lucky to rate one or two interviews. The whole process of continuing to look for work will not take more than half the time. Here we are coming back to about 20 hours a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we also need to note some earlier comments the Minister made about a very few people on Job Search allowance actually being able to access any of the training options. Therefore, what does the Government suggest people do with the remainder of the time? If they fulfil requirements with regard to looking for work, are available for interviews, and attend the CES or Department of Social Security whenever required, why can they not then do voluntary work in their remaining time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just been told about something I said earlier that I am not sure I said. So I am not sure whether this is a correction; it depends on what other senators may remember. The figure of 30 per cent is an overall figure of the number of courses that would be available. For Newstart the figure is 38 per cent and that is somewhat higher than that 30 per cent overall figure. Obviously the numbers of those on Job Search allowance (JSA) are lower, hence they bring that average down. It is by no means the case that from that one could glean that no-one on JSA gets an opportunity for training, because plenty will. I will make sure that, in the course of Budget discussions, along with my colleague Mr Dawkins, that more people do get that opportunity. Again, that is something that we have to address in the Budget process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no doubt the case, as Senator Lees says, that the Adelaide Advertiser-not that I am a particular fan of that newspaper at present-does not have a long list of vacancies. I do not know what the main paper is in Geelong, but I am imagine that if I were looking at it, the list of vacancies would not be too long, either. So one could look at a the situation in a number of places and find the same problem. I have said here that the Government's view is that, during the rest of this calendar year, the economy will improve and, in the rest of the financial year, it will get better. So people will be looking at more advertisements in the Adelaide Advertiser and more possible placements through the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask the Minister his opinion of voluntary work. Does he see it as a worthwhile occupation or pastime for those who are unemployed? I would certainly argue that it would give the unemployed a chance to keep in touch, particularly with other people. The risk, particularly with those who are getting into an unemployed way of life, is that they tend to become more and more disheartened. They suffer further and further rejections. One real opportunity for them to feel that they are taking part is to do voluntary work. This is why the Australian Democrats will push ahead with these amendments and hope that, if the Government does not support them now, when the Budget considerations are being made-as I do not believe these proposals have any financial implications-the Government will consider permitting people to do voluntary work as long as they fulfil other requirements of the Government.

<PARA>These amendments refer to the more controversial waiting period, which is for education leavers. I firstly refer to the Minister's answer in this place on 15 May. We are very pleased to note that there has been some improvement in that now only 63 per cent of education leavers are actually serving the waiting period. However, I emphasise that there are still large numbers of young people who are severely disadvantaged by this provision. When the waiting period was initially discussed, what was the reasoning behind it? Why was this waiting period of 13 weeks put in place?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That 13-week period is, of course, existing policy. It is there because at the end of a school year it roughly corresponds with the holiday period that goes between the end of school and the start of universities, colleges and the like in the new year. Generally speaking, there is something like a 13-week gap, so it roughly corresponds. There is a difficulty here in that, if we do not have that kind of waiting period, those who have not genuinely left school and intend to go back will be able to claim a benefit to which they would otherwise not be entitled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister agree that it also catches those who leave school with genuine reasons or in fact graduate, be it from a school, a college of technical and further education or a university? It also catches those young people who decide to leave school specifically to seek work and those who may not fulfil requirements for staying at school. It is causing quite considerable hardship. I can quote a number of cases, particularly country cases. I will pass these to the Minister later rather than reading through them now. But one young gentleman asks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What am I supposed to do? I didn't choose to give up my education and I don't choose to be unemployed. How am I supposed to survive?</PARA>
<PARA>The examples go on. I ask the Minister: if these amendments are not accepted now, will he again look at this matter in the Budget? If he does not reduce the 13-week waiting period to six weeks, and the six weeks to four, what other measures, other than the ones now in place, can he put in place to ensure that everybody who needs to access the benefit under the hardship provisions is actually able to do so?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did explain this some weeks back. Senator Lees has referred to an answer that I gave about the numbers of school leavers. I think I extended the example beyond school leavers. From memory the question went into other areas too. I explained that quite a few are able to use the hardship provision to escape the waiting period. As far as I am aware, that hardship provision is being administered with some compassion and fairness. I am not aware that we are being overly harsh; the provision is there for a particular purpose. We need to remember that it is being exercised not simply in a third of cases-we are talking in round figures; I do not intend to be exact. The truth is that not everyone applies for hardship provisions because not all school leavers consider themselves to be in hardship, or could possibly demonstrate it if they did. But, where there is a demonstration that hardship exists, the record shows that the Department is prepared to accede and grant a benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Lees is saying that she does not think we are doing enough in that respect, then I am more than happy to look at the cases and talk to the Department about a change in attitude. But I am, as we speak, satisfied that enough is being done. Just so that I have answered the whole question, let me add that I do not believe that this is going to be a matter for discussion in the Budget discussions. I have decided not to raise it. So another colleague would have to for it to come up. </PARA>

<PARA> 8. Clause 7, page 31, after proposed section 542, insert the following section:</PARA>
<PARA>Requirement to attend for counselling</PARA>
<PARA> ``542a. (1) Where a person is receiving a job search allowance, the Secretary must, on the expiration of 6 months from the day on which the person commenced receiving the allowance, notify the person in writing that he or she is required to attend an office of the Department or of the CES for the purpose of counselling and advice in respect of that person's attempts to obtain employment. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) Where a person has received a notice under subsection (1) and has not, without good reason, within 14 days from the day on which the person was issued with a notice, attended an office of the Department or the CES for counselling and advice, a person will cease to be qualified for a job search allowance until the person attends for counselling and advice.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is to insert a proposal in the legislation that would require the Secretary to invite those who have been unemployed for six months to attend an office of the Department or the CES for the purpose of counselling and advice in respect of a person's attempts to obtain employment. As I understand it, the Government's proposal is simply that after six months one is able to take advantage of various labour market programs. But the weights, in a sense, are not really placed on those who are out of the work force until the 12-month period has expired. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly take the view that it is leaving the matter far too late. People ought to be made aware of their options, which ought to be explored with them. People ought to be given a realistic appraisal of their prospects and the best way of seeking to re-enter the work force. Perhaps judgments should be made at that stage about where and to what extent they have been looking. Ultimately, of course, they would be made aware that there is a cut-off point. In line with our announced policy on the matter, we believe that it is necessary that this happen at an early stage rather than waiting until the horse has bolted. </PARA>

<PARA> At six months, the CES will then interview each recipient to explain what labour market programs might be available to them and what kind of assistance the CES might be able to give.

There will be times when, say, a course suddenly becomes available and the CES wants to ring and say, `Look, here is the situation'.

<PARA>These amendments would remove, if passed, the compulsory element in Newstart. Newstart certainly does have some positives: it offers increased training opportunities; it offers some paid work experience; and, I think, from answers that we had earlier today from the Minister, it will improve the situation for those who wish to undertake voluntary work. The Australian Democrats, however, see no need for compulsion. Only about 30 per cent of unemployed people will get an opportunity to partake in one of the approved courses. Looking at the number of people volunteering, there are already too many for some of the volunteer centres to accommodate because there are so many asking to take part. The Government's work experience program is also limited. There are more than enough unemployed people to fill every possible type of program that the Government has on offer. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore see absolutely no need for compulsion. We believe it is a slap in the face for the unemployed to suggest that the only way we can get them to do anything is to enforce it. We hope that the Government will rethink the whole idea of compulsion. We believe unemployed people are only too willing-and, in fact, extremely anxious-to either get back into the work force or do something useful and productive. </PARA>

These agreements will be positive in assessing what the Department and the client can do together to assist the client in getting some work. It must be remembered at all times that the client will be negotiating the agreement.

<PARA>The Minister commented earlier that the Newstart agreement would be entered into in a spirit of cooperation between the Department and the unemployed person. This amendment seeks to put that commitment into legislation. This amendment, if successful, does formally place some reciprocal obligation on the Commonwealth Employment Service to provide services and programs to the person signing the agreement. A person can then only be held to have failed to comply with the agreement if he or she has failed to take reasonable steps to comply and the CES was meeting its side of the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just very briefly; as I said before, I do not regard these agreements as punitive; they are about the Commonwealth Employment Service and the client sitting down and sorting out what an appropriate, proper agreement can be. It is a principle of administrative law that we must be reasonable. To cut people off payments for not attending a course that is not available will never be considered to be reasonable. We could add clause after clause to this legislation, along those lines if we wished; but they do not change anything; they do not add anything. It is just an absurd proposition that people will have their benefits cut for not attending non-existent courses. That is clearly unreasonable. The appeals process would knock it out immediately.

<PARA> I can assure Senator Alston and the Opposition of our determination to get the job done as quickly as possible. If we set blanket rules, we can disadvantage some individuals. In some circumstances it will not suit. In any event, even for people who are not in remote areas, it may be the case that trying to get the agreement exactly right for an individual may require more assessment, more examination, and could take a little longer.

<PARA>I know that I have been going through a lot of individual amendments and I guess it is difficult to categorise some as being more important than others. This particular amendment would eliminate the broad catch-all clause, perhaps the one that is still of most concern to the welfare agencies and those who work with the unemployed. This would enable the Government to ensure that people undertook any measure designed to eliminate or reduce any disadvantage the person has in the labour market. Listening to the Minister's earlier answers today, I can understand that he will again make comments about fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that many of the people who are seeking assistance do not have a background in law, do not understand exactly what is being required of them and, therefore, I think it is extremely important that we spell out here and make it very clear exactly what the Government does mean to happen under this clause. Could the Minister please provide us with some information as to what types of activity he sees coming in under this clause?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this case, I do not agree with what Senator Lees is trying to do, in any event. This clause had to be drafted as a pretty open-ended provision, because for some clients there are barriers that they will have to overcome-remembering at all times that agreements have to be negotiated between two sides. But there are barriers to be overcome, such as difficulties with the language or literacy or numeracy problems. They could also relate to people with disabilities and what type of rehabilitation they might have to undergo. I believe that this clause is to the advantage of clients, not to their disadvantage and in that respect its drafting is quite deliberate. The other comment that I make on the clause, even though Senator Lees has not raised it, is that later in the debate-and I am not sure what the order of amendments is; there are too many of them for me to keep up with them-the Government will move an amendment to ensure that work for the dole is not a possibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition takes the view that it would be unworkable to try to specify every possible instance whereby it might be reasonable to require cooperation and participation. It is always a concern that these sorts of provisions can be abused, and that is why we have a system of administrative law to read down if necessary. I would think that we would all be very vigilant to ensure that these provisions are not used to compel people to undertake activities that are clearly unreasonable. But unless these provisions are included, I suspect that the balance would swing very much the other way, and we would find all sorts of excuses being used to explain why a person was not caught by any one of the litany of items that are specified. We will certainly be vigilant in seeing how this is applied. We do not think there is any alternative other than to allow broad discretion at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

Before that can I say that, on this whole score, every person with whom we will be negotiating an agreement will know of the appeal process. We will tell them about it. It is not as though they will not know they can appeal. I really worry about the attitude. It is almost as though the CES and, in some cases, my own Department are being seen as some kind of enemy of the unemployed and are out to crush them. That is not what this is about. Certainly, there is an element in this of making sure that people take advantage of opportunities to improve their skills. Certainly, we will continue to ensure that people are subjected to activity tests to ascertain suitability for work. But that does not make us an enemy. It is not as though we will be sitting down as adversaries, across the table, to fight it out to the last drop of blood. That is not what the officers in the CES and the DSS are about.

I cannot rule out the possibility, though, that on some occasions it might be suggested to a client that something might be done about appearance.

I ask Senator Alston specifically now why he opposes the cutting out of compulsory work for the dole when voluntary work was ruled out by him earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the question is directed to me, I should at least attempt to answer it. As I understood the Democrats' amendment, it was not couched in terms of their supplementary notes. They were suggesting that the amendment would allow people over the age of 18 on JSA to undertake voluntary work for up to 60 days. I can accept that there are circumstances in which people may well find that an extended period of voluntary work is appropriate. That may well be the case, for example, for people over 55 years. But to bring it down to people aged 18 years seems to be going against what the Democrats are trying to do in the first instance; that is, having them focus all their efforts on looking for work. If they cannot find that down the line, judgments can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has explained that it is a balance between part time and full time-that one cannot do voluntary work on a full time basis-and again that is reasonable. It is a question of how much part time work is being done before one is effectively disqualified from being able to search actively for employment. Whilst we want to encourage as much voluntary work as possible, we take the view that the priority ought to be looking for work in the first instance. The Democrats' amendment, which would have allowed people to work for up to 60 days per calendar year when they are aged 18 and have only been on JSA for two months, seemed to me to be premature in the extreme. Voluntary work ought to be a last resort. An 18-year-old doing it two months after he or she has joined the dole queue is almost encouraging that person not to find the work that he or she ought to be looking for. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point that Senator Lees put forward in relation to our opposition to the amendment is that we should not take this view at all, that somehow we should not insist that people look for work at any stage. The way she couches her argument here is the way she consistently couches it; that is, to categorise all the unemployed as having precisely the same attitude. We just do not accept that. We certainly accept that the great majority of people want to get into the work force. It makes obvious commonsense to all of us. Most of us are rational human beings. Most of us appreciate that one is better off getting a decent income than trying to subsist on 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. But we cannot generalise across the board. We cannot lump all the unemployed together and say, `All of the unemployed desperately want to work', any more than we can say, `All the unemployed are determined not to work'. </PARA>
<PARA> Human nature varies enormously. We ought to tailor our attitude to a judgment that we make about a particular individual or groups or classes of individuals. To apply a rule of thumb or a starting prejudice that somehow all of one group of people are wonderful and all of another group are terrible is almost to guarantee that one will get it wrong. We do not start on that premise. We do not make prejudgments. We simply say that at the end of the day we ought to have the power to require people to do certain things when we judge that all else has failed or that proper efforts are not being made. That is an appropriate response to a situation. One does not rush into it; one assesses what one thinks is reasonable. As the Minister constantly says, no-one is in the business of forcing people to do something. In a Western democracy in the twentieth century one could not get away with it. We are nowhere near that sort of a state. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the accusations and the Democrats' criticism, no doubt, of the Government would be that it has moved across to our view of the world because that is overwhelmingly the view of the community-that there ought to be these sorts of pressures and responses that reflect individual circumstances. There might be a red-necked minority who think that everyone on the dole is bludging. We do not take that view for a moment. Neither do we give people this wonderful, unquestioning benefit of the doubt across the board. In the same way that it cannot be said that everyone on an invalid pension is malingering, it cannot be said that no-one on an invalid pension is malingering. If the Democrats want to approach the debate in that way, they will simply provoke extremist and emotive responses. We do not think that helps. We will continue to argue that there ought to be a lot more sensible discretion applied-and not just to a certain point. We think that, where the political advantage might weigh against going farther down that logical track, rather than backing off, we should go the whole way through, give ourselves a range of options and apply them responsibly and sensitively so that we achieve what we claim to want to do-that is, to maximise everyone's opportunities to ensure that the taxpayer is not left holding the can for those who somehow are not making the effort that is expected of the great majority of others. </PARA>
<PARA> A poll conducted by Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd in 1988 not only showed that something like 80 per cent of the community thought that work for the dole was a good idea but also that 71 per cent of the unemployed thought it was not a bad idea, either. I am not taking a broad brush approach and saying that everyone ought to be working for the dole. I am simply saying that, if one is fair dinkum about one's policies, one ought to be prepared to examine all options and look at the best ways in which one can assist. Therefore, one should not rule out an option, as this Government has chosen to do, for political purposes. </PARA>

We covered quite a bit of this ground earlier when the Minister said that flexibility was needed.

The Bill provides that the Secretary has to look at a persons's needs in assessing that person's capacity to undertake some sort of activity. It is all there. This all goes back to what I have said on about a dozen amendments so far: the specifics of the agreement will always be subject to negotiation between the client and the Department. Surely that is the crux of the issue. I am not even sure what this amendment is supposed to do. Already the Bill sets out what the Secretary has to take into account. In any event, if clients do not like it, we are telling the clients about their right of appeal, and clients will not sign it if they do not like it.

That is the emphasis of this. That is what it is all about. I can assure honourable senators that we will be looking at this constantly and so will Minister Dawkins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Senate adjourned last night at midnight I was outlining how the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and the six associated Bills, by the merging of Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd and the introduction of a competing second carrier, were in fact introducing sweeping reforms. While indicating our reluctant support for the Bills as the lesser of two evils, I outlined some of the problems that the Australian Democrats have with these Bills-namely, the extraordinary amount of ministerial discretion whereby the scrutiny of Parliament is bypassed; the need for increased consumer protection; and the fact that we are being asked to accept in good faith that the Government, with major pieces of the overall plan missing at this point in time, would, without question, do the right thing further down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now want to turn my attention to what tangible action can be taken to assist Australia's potential to develop a valuable export-oriented telecommunications equipment and capabilities industry-and I believe that potential is enormous. Australia's exports of vital telecommunications equipment have increased three-fold in the last four years. Compared with the outstanding balance of payments debt, the $240m worth of export earnings of this industry last year is a mere drop in the bucket. But it is an industry which produces tangibles, and while the entrepreneurs were assets stripping in the 1980s local telecommunications manufacturers were growing an industry producing export quality, innovative and diverse products, along with skilled employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill 1991 omits all references to this $3 billion growth industry. Lip service has been paid to preserving a telecommunications manufacturing base as the spearhead of Australia's launch into the global telecommunications markets. In November last year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claimed that the introduction of deregulation would be a major boost for Australian industry, particularly telephone manufacturers. But the United States example shows that because of imports of cheap equipment from South East Asia, the majority of telephone manufacturing companies in the United States no longer exist. Since this Bill makes no specific reference to the protection of Australia's equipment, skills and capabilities in the telecommunications equipment industry, the Democrats will be moving two amendments which we feel will give both flexibility and a guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, it is the nature of this Bill that it deals exclusively with the needs, desires, wishes and wants of the network carriers. That is its priority and it leaves little room for the needs of the Australian community for a locally-based high technology telecommunications industry. We argue that once the knowledge base, skills and ideas have been lost they are irretrievably lost. In addition to including new clauses in the objectives of the Act, I intend to move an amendment to the carrier licence conditions which will require carriers to bias their purchases in favour of Australian manufacturers where they are able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Another potential problem we see with the Bill is the impact Austel's regulatory powers of technical planning would have on the broadcasting industry. Broadcasters are licensed under the Broadcasting Act 1942 which is currently under review. Technical conditions pertaining to licence warrant are determined by the Minister. Notwithstanding the fact that there is a Minister in common, the technical regimes are currently quite different and will remain so unless the Broadcasting Act 1942 is amended-which we expect will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill puts the broadcasting industry in the invidious position of being answerable to two statutory authorities at the same time. Under this Bill, Austel will be responsible for the planning and technical regulation of broadcasters. We believe the potential for conflict is enormous. For these reasons we believe that the Telecommunications Act should be subject to the Broadcasting Act in the same way as the Radio Communications Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night Senator Alston spent a considerable part of his speech talking about the inefficiencies of Telecom and the successes of OTC and stating again, as we know, that the Opposition will privatise Telecom and OTC and anything else. I want to state again our view that Telecom, whilst a monopoly, has not been as inefficient as its critics claim and that there is still a role for a public monopoly. We have lost that battle so we are now in the process of salvaging what I think is best for the new, merged public utility. </PARA>
<PARA> We think it is a bit of a cheek to charge two public utilities, which have already been paid for by the public, a merger fee of around $1 billion simply for the luxury of implementing Government policy. We do not think it is at all ethical to use this Bill as a backdoor revenue raising measure, so we will be denying the Government this form of revenue raising. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, these are tremendously important Bills and the focus of the Democrats' amendments to these Bills is to reduce the unseemly high level of ministerial discretion, to ensure environmental protection, which my colleague Senator Coulter will address, to facilitate public input, and to maximise consumer protection so that some years down the track we will continue to have a healthy, viable and competitive telecommunications industry in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address some fairly brief remarks tonight to the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and related Bills. I want to dwell, as Senator Kernot may have expected, on some of the positive aspects of the coalition's policies in relation to telecommunications, specifically the need to privatise telecommunications and create a more competitive market. Senator Kernot mentioned some matters which are of concern to all Australians. She dwelt initially on the potential for these matters to affect the quality of life of virtually every Australian.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. That is particularly the case in relation to people in the Asia-Pacific region. Senator Kernot sparked a thought in my mind when she mentioned the capacity of the telecommunications system to affect people's lives. As I looked across the chamber last night, I saw Senator Richardson sitting there. I am sure that he would have liked the phone system to have had the capacity to affect people's lives in a far more effective way over the weekend. But I will get on to the more serious issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition speaker before me, the shadow Minister responsible for telecommunications, Senator Alston, referred to some of the inefficiencies of Telecom Australia. On a number of occasions the Opposition has applauded the increases in efficiency in Telecom. They have been numerous and there has been an increase in productivity and efficiency within Telecom. Most people who are affected by the telecommunications system in Australia do, however, recognise that further reforms could deliver benefits to the consumers. The Opposition argues that, unless we privatise Telecom and allow it access to capital without the restrictions imposed by government and the fiscal constraints imposed upon this Government at the moment, we will not get an increase in efficiency and productivity that we need. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent study by the Australian Telecommunications Users Group estimated that competitive reforms within Telecom could secure a 20 per cent reduction in labour and capital requirements. This would give a 15 per cent price reduction and save users in the order of $1 billion. That equates to about 18c per day per user of telecommunications. If we stretch the bow a little bit longer, that is almost one free call a day per user in Australia or 30 free calls per month. That would be of significant benefit to both business and normal residential users of the telecommunications network. That example illustrates the potential that can be achieved if we have a competitive telecommunications system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition fears that the Government proposal-the megacom proposal, the duopoly proposal-will be unable to deliver the sort of competitive environment that Australia needs. Senator Kernot and Senator Alston have both referred to the great potential for a telecommunications industry in Australia to become a global industry able to compete on the international stage and able to create rapidly growing employment opportunities for Australians. As I said, it would provide a very positive input to Australia's export income during the next 10 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting the amount of telecommunications in Australia in comparison with our near Asia-Pacific neighbours. In Australia and New Zealand, there are roughly 50 lines per 100 people; I think it is something like 45 in Australia and about the same in New Zealand. In comparison, Indonesia has 0.5 of a line per 100 people; Malaysia has 7.4 lines per 100 people- clearly more developed; the Philippines has 1 line per 100 people; China has 0.2 lines per 100 people. When we bear in mind that China has a population of 1.1 billion people, if that figure increased just marginally, the potential for growth in the Chinese market alone is quite phenomenal. The nation of Vietnam, which is now rapidly opening up, has is only 0.1 of a line per head of population.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators who had the chance this morning to read Newsweek, the magazine in The Bulletin, would have noticed that it featured an article about Vietnam. The prediction was that Vietnam could easily become another Korea within the next 10 to 15 years. That sort of rapid development creates enormous potential in the telecommunications business. There are already a number of companies in Australia trying to get into Vietnam's telecommunications market. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not really need to be an Einstein to work out that, in the business of telecommunications, there is potential for growth, potential for export earnings for Australians and potential for employment which is very significant in this Asia-Pacific region. Australia can quite readily service this need, particularly when we consider that we are in the same time zone. We have a lot of common links with the region. The Minister at the table, Senator Collins, who lives in Darwin when he can, would realise that the closeness of Australia to Asia certainly makes this a market which we can develop very rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to look at what has happened with employment in Australia. There has been a terrible downward swing in employment levels and an upward swing in unemployment levels. For example, in the agricultural sector, there has been an increase in unemployment of 163 per cent and, in agricultural services, 345 per cent in the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are two sectors that have shown an increase in employment. It would not surprise many of my colleagues to know that the public administration and defence sector is one of the few areas where there has been an increase in the employment levels over the past 12 months, whereas just about every other sector has shown a massive decline in employment. One other sector which is a bright light in the Australian employment scene is the communications sector. I cannot quote any national figures, but I do have in front of me the figures for Western Australia where in 1990 there were 9,384 people employed in that sector. That figure has increased to 12,401 in the current year. So just over 3,000 more people have become employed in that sector in my home State of Western Australia. Even though Telecom is a monopoly, the changes that are about to come about as a consequence of this legislation, it is fair to say, indicate that the communications industry is a bright light for an improved employment and economic outlook, and it will continue to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other example that highlights the potential for Australia's telecommunications industry internationally and that relates to the international traffic that flows through Australia. We compare very favourably with some of the rapidly expanding economies in our region. Japan, for example, has 319 million minutes of international traffic through its network. Singapore, a much smaller country, has an international traffic level of 99 million minutes through its network. Australia, by way of comparison, has 239 million minutes of international traffic through its network. So here is another area where Australians demonstrated a clear comparative advantage. We must ensure, moving into the next decade, that we can take advantage of that situation. We must then ask ourselves what the Government's approach is to maximising these export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the telecommunications market is set to expand to a level of about $178 billion by 1995, just in the Asia-Pacific region alone. The growth in gross domestic product of those nations in our immediate backyard, as I term it, is about 10 per cent per annum. The international traffic increase is expected to be about 25 per cent in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is the Government's approach? Its approach is to set up a duopoly instead of a monopoly. I guess that a duopoly will be epitomised by the fact that Telecom-which is capital starved at the moment; no-one would deny that-would be combined with OTC, which has already been described as a relatively successful organisation, and a duopolist competitor would be created based on the debt-ridden Aussat Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly from the Opposition's point of view, the outcome from setting up a structure for the future of telecommunications would probably be far from ideal. Desirable outcomes would be to increase competition; to increase the number of opportunities for all people wanting to play the telecommunications game to get involved; to ensure that we have the most efficient production and delivery of telecommunications services, both within Australia and internationally; to reduce prices to the Australian people, which I have already demonstrated could take place; and to make us as competitive as possible internationally in an area in which we have already proven that we have a comparative competitive advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's ability to compete has already been severely affected by its financial constraints. Clearly, by retaining it in public ownership, those financial constraints will remain. By subjecting it to further competition, I guess that it is fair to say that its current financial disadvantages can only be increased. I suggest that privatising telecommunications and creating fair and open competition will give Telecom and other players in the game the ability and advantage of being able to move right out to the leading edge of technology and export capabilities and competition within the region. I do not think it is fair to the telecommunications industry as a whole to allow it to have the shackles which would be associated with the highly regulated duopoly which we are about to enter into under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by reiterating some main fundamentals of the Opposition's approach to this area. That approach does not, of course, follow the United Kingdom example of creating a highly regulated duopoly or of privatising an authority such as Telecom before creating a fair playing field, to use an oft-stated cliche of this year. We believe that the Government has firstly to create a fair playing field to create an environment where there can be full and effective competition and then to privatise Telecom-cum-Megacom. We have specified in our policy that Australian ownership would be maintained in a majority and that the employees of Megacom or Telecom would be given preference. Our privatisation of Telecom would take into account the state of the Australian capital markets and the potential of those markets to absorb the float of that body. We have also specified that community service obligations would be met in a most politically accountable, clear and visible manner and appropriated from the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which is obviously a very important part of that process is to allow the private sector, the capital markets and small, medium-sized and big investors to put the capital into this body, which is clearly demonstrated as being in an industry where there will be growth and profits in the next 10 to 15 years. That is something that cannot happen under the public ownership scenario that we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comments relate to the ideological battle between the political parties at the moment and how this relates to efficiency, the future of Australians and their future potential employment prospects. We clearly have a leaning towards more competition and privatisation, getting public ownership out of these trading type enterprises where we see that there is no role for government. There is clearly a role in the regulation area to ensure that there is a fair playing field, but certainly not in running an operation and being involved in service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Government have often accused this Opposition of having a high esteem for the Thatcher solutions and turning to Margaret Thatcher's examples in the United Kingdom whenever we talk about privatisation. One of the benefits of having been in opposition for eight years is that we can learn from some of the mistakes made not only in Great Britain with privatisation but all around the world. One of the great mistakes, which is certainly recognised here and by the speaker before me, Senator Kernot, was that a duopoly was set up. I must admit that private monopolies are not a hell of a lot better than public monopolies, and duopolies are not a hell of a lot better than monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA> I am asking this Government to learn from the United Kingdom example. A comparison based on the scale of world local call charges shows that Australia has the second highest local call charges and that Great Britain has the highest, taking aside all the reasons for that, be it the size of the nation or how far apart we all are. If we look at all the empirical evidence, the call charges and how much we pay out of our pockets at the end of the month, we can see how that affects the average consumer in Perth, in Darwin or in Melbourne. Great Britain has the highest local call charge in the world and Australia has the second highest. So why do we not as a nation put aside ideological considerations and our attachment to the members of the telecommunications unions and try to create a structure for telecommunications that will deliver benefits to the people of Australia-the users of the telecommunications system-and create export opportunities? I put it to the Government that the example that occurred in the United Kingdom would lead us to believe that the industry does require as much competition as possible, that a duopoly is not the ideal outcome and that a vigorous telecommunications structure which allowed as many players to get involved would certainly increase competition, lower prices and benefit consumers by increasing service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with pleasure to speak in support of my colleagues in this telecommunications debate. This is a very interesting subject. Obviously, the purpose of the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and allied Bills is to provide competition in the telecommunications field. For far too long we have had a monopoly in the telecommunications system in Australia. Telecom Australia is providing a top service. However, it has been controlled by the telecommunications union, resulting in a lot of inefficiencies. For example, as Senator Campbell has told us, Australia has the second highest local call rate in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of these Bills is to provide some competition by replacing the current regulatory regime. The central proposals are a scheme of licensing of general and mobile telecommunications service providers; the reservation of certain telecommunications services to licence holders; the provision of access to rights to networks; and a scheme for the subsidisation of standard telephone services for remote areas. This legislation came about as a result of a statement made back in 1988 by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans. To achieve the aims of this legislation, obviously a cartel such as the Australian Telecommunications Authority has to be the instrumental body to regulate the industry. The Government is going about it by merging Telecom and OTC Ltd, which, incidentally, the Opposition opposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said a little earlier, Telecom does provide a good service. If one travels around the world, one will find exactly how good it is. In the deregulated system that America has, people who want to telephone out of the country are indeed very lucky if they happen to have the call number for OTC. Immediately they get that OTC connection, they have no further trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> But when one tries to contact Australia from America, Europe or other countries through their systems and using their carriers, I am afraid that one runs into nothing but trouble. I am full of praise for the way in which both Telecom and OTC operate. Unfortunately, as I have already mentioned, Telecom charges for internal service calls are certainly too high. There are also other regulations that annoy one in these deregulated times. Australia has either the highest or second highest call rate but, when one compares our subscriber trunk dialling charges with some of the European charges, especially those of Switzerland, Germany and Italy, we come out very well. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to merge Telecom and OTC and then provide another competing carrier. Here we have a forced marriage, a shotgun marriage or whatever one likes to call it. Not only is it a shotgun marriage but there is also a forced dowry of $1 billion which has to be paid for the combination. In moving towards the duopoly system, we find that the competitor will come from the sale of Aussat-including its debts-to a willing buyer. To sweeten it up a certain amount and hopefully get someone interested, the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel) will provide, through the Bill, a cellular mobile telephone service to go along with it. Because of the duopoly, Austel had recommended that there should be three carriers allocated simultaneously around the time of deregulation but, unfortunately, as a result of this Bill, there will be no other competition until 1997. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the basics of how it is going to operate. The competitor, having been set up, will have a right of access to use the current Telecom network in connecting at a determined cost-which could be called an access cost, for want of a better word-but Telecom will have to make that very transparent and have a cap on the charge for that calling. I fail to see how that is really going to be carried out because Telecom, or Megacom-the OTC-Telecom combination-will be the big dealers in a situation with the new competitor not even hoping to achieve more than the 30 per cent of the play by 1997, if I have got it right.</PARA>
<PARA> The Telecom-OTC combination will be in a position to provide other than good competition to the competitor, depending on the price of that connection fee. Let us hope that good competition will come about, particularly in view of the non-competition from cellular mobile telephone systems. We do not quite know how that cellular mobile system is going to operate; whether it is going to cover all Australia, certain areas of Australia or, indeed, be restricted to the capital cities. That is where we could have got the necessary competition to the Telecom-OTC set-up. I believe that we will get that competition in time if technology is allowed to take over but technology can be held up by regulation. Whether the prevention of other mobile cellular systems until 1997 will stop other technology coming forward, I do not quite know. </PARA>
<PARA> Just getting away from technology, I note that one of the measures that goes along with the deregulated system will be that the two carriers will still provide the connection to the first telephone in a property until 1993. After that it will be only to the boundary of the property. Let us talk more about remote areas. I welcome this measure because if Telecom, or whoever it is, is supplying a service for telephone connections to a rather large property where the homestead is 20, 30 or 50 kilometres away from the boundary-although, if one gets to that distance one is more likely to use radio telephone connections-this is a step forward. Those property owners can be connected a lot more cheaply by using licensed private technicians-telectricians, or whatever word one likes to use. The property owner would simply have to buy the suitable approved cable at the best available price and find a contractor or someone who has got the equipment to plough it in so as to bring the connection to the homestead. Then the first telephone and the other necessary material can go in from there. I welcome that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the duopoly and the sort of competition it may not get, I do believe that technology will take over in time and provide a certain amount of competition. If we look back over the years we see that Telecom was saved from the progress of technology by the advent, some years ago, of the optic fibre. If the optic fibre had not come along when it did, we would have had a greater extension of the satellite technology. I believe that the satellite technology in Australia has been neglected to a certain extent. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that price is a consideration, but with our Aussat system we could have made greater use of advancements in satellite technology. Unfortunately we did not. I believe that Telecom had a lot to play in that line by making sure that satellite technology did not get off the ground too much. Of course, its efficiency in the provision of services was increased greatly by the use of the optic fibre. But the advanced state of optic fibre will not last forever. I believe that the Aussat II systems of satellites which are due after 1992-or some time like that-will make a lot of difference. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some information that I received from Telecom as a result of questions I asked at Estimates committee hearings. While I am on the subject of Telecom at Estimates, I give credit to Telecom because this year it was much more forthcoming with its information than it was the previous year when I gave it a blast and put a reservation in the report that it had not been too cooperative and forthcoming. However, this year Telecom was certainly 100 per cent better in answering the questions that I asked and it has made me far more aware about a lot of the up-dated technology. However, we should bear in mind that the cellular mobile system can never get beyond 20 per cent of the geographical area of Australia. In other words, the remote geographical areas covering 80 per cent of Australia will never have cellular telephones as we know them now. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain projects are being considered. One is the Iridium project, which is a low earth orbit mobile satellite technology which Motorola developed in the United States of America. It uses a constellation of satellites which we are able to make great use of. The unfortunate part about it, even though it has application in Australia, is that it cannot be used for a favourite subject of mine; that is, safety precautions, where we could have a safety network by using certain receivers or transmitters-not that we use them to broadcast or receive-to notify a certain location. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another mobile system which Telecom is experimenting with, along with others, using cellular mobile phones with the Inmarsat satellite system. With the technology available that could be used in remote areas but the cost would be around $70,000 per service and $10 per minute to use. Of course, in this day and age that is out of the question. I believe that in three to five years time those sorts of things will be viable for use in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another project involves Mobilesat, which is to be provided on the B-type series of Aussat satellites and which is due to be launched in early 1992. I believe that these projects will be useful in providing the technology to provide communications in remote areas. OTC is experimenting with another set-up called Fleetcoms. Those are the sorts of innovations, developed partly by Telecom, that I believe are around the corner and will provide services in remote areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the community service obligation, which is the provision of telephones and other equipment that are not readily available in certain areas. My fear is that, with the privatisation of communications, those areas may miss out. After the merger it will be mandatory for Telecom and OTC to provide those services, but it is not quite spelt out to what extent and to what areas they will be provided. From my reading of the legislation, any proposed new carrier has not quite spelt out how it will carry out community service obligations. Perhaps it will just rely on the Telecom-OTC combination or it might be fulfilled by others on contract. I have heard various explanations of how it might work. Indeed, an American group gave our interested back bench committee a run-down on how it could work. But it was never spelt out to me. One of the biggest reservations I have with this sort of merger is how those community service obligations will be kept in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we are opposing the merger of OTC and Telecom because we believe there are many other ways of going about it. I have grave reservations about not making more cellular mobile systems available. All in all, we will have to see how this duopoly performs a few years down the track. I have very grave fears that we will finish up with an English type of duopoly system. Probably, once it has been in action for a few years, the Government will have to look at changing the current measures and conditions. However, I look forward to seeing how it will work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to place on the record the success of the corporatisation and then privatisation of Telecom in New Zealand and to say that I think we have some good lessons to learn from the manner in which it has proceeded-which is to deregulate to a far greater extent than the Government's proposal does. Indeed, it is much more in line with Opposition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular aspect that I want to deal with is the proposal to not only retain the Australian Telecommunications Authority-Austel-in the new scheme of things but, indeed, to beef it up, as it were, and give it more powers and more scope for regulating. Looking at the explanatory memorandum to the Telecommunications Bill at page 27, one sees that the sorts of powers that are set out there make it judge, jury and executioner. The inevitable result of establishing such a body, to my mind, and looking at the international experience, is that we build a bureaucracy which, in one way or another, can end up a captive of the industry which it is meant to serve. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest a proposition which I think is worthwhile; that is, having a study to determine whether we require Austel at all. I think there is a very good case to be made out for following the New Zealand example. It has no industry specific regulating body but simply uses the Commerce Commission, under section 36 of the Commerce Act, to perform the regulatory functions. Similarly, in Australia, we could use the Trade Practice Commission to carry out any regulatory function which is indeed needed. As I have said, to have an industry specific regulator does not serve the interests of the people who are operating in the field, nor is it of particular assistance to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting fact that I was able to discern from looking at the New Zealand experience and how, indeed, closer economic relations ought to be able to allow a greater across-Tasman liberalisation of the telecommunications industry to the benefit of Australia, was one very simple statistic. The one that impressed me most was that the cost of a toll call from New Zealand to Australia is 99c in New Zealand currency, which is about 75c in Australian currency. But the cost of a toll call the other way-from Australia to New Zealand-via OTC Ltd-is $1.50 in Australian dollars. In other words, it costs twice as much to call New Zealand from Australia as it does to call Australia from New Zealand. When we look at the other statistics, which perhaps I will have to deal with when we resume our consideration of the legislation, we see that the picture that can be painted for greater deregulation rather than less is the way we ought to go. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to raise some matters which particularly affect my State. I believe that an unforgivable fraud has been perpetrated against the South Australian public. South Australians have been led to believe, by and large, that `their bank', the State Bank of South Australia, was properly managed. They have been led to believe that the bank's problems are relatively new and the impression has been created that but for high interest rates and a falling property market everything would have been okay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certain information available to me leads me to conclude that all has not been well for some considerable time and that the bank's problems spread far wider than rising interest rates and falling property markets. For management and the board to manage properly, they must be able to rely on the information available to them. While shareholders-you and I-rely on external auditors to ascertain the veracity of public accounts, management and the board have internal audit to ensure that the information on which they base their decisions is accurate and reliable. </PARA>
<PARA> In an entity such as a bank, and especially a bank determined to grow and grow fast in a risk laden competitive market, internal audit should be given the highest priority. It should have the resources, the qualified staff and the independence to do its job. Above all, it must have free and ready access to the board. It now appears that the bank's internal audit department had none of these requisites. The information available to me indicates that the internal audit function was regarded by some not as a friend but as a foe. While Australians have been watching every dollar they earn, desperately trying to meet their mortgage payments, the State Bank has not watched taxpayers' dollars anywhere nearly as carefully as it could have. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of points I want to put before the Senate that I think justify the claims that I have made, and I will deal with them seriatim. Point one: prior to January 1989 internal audit was not conducted with appropriately skilled or qualified people in all entities. A comprehensive report was prepared into the operations of the department and included a series of recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 2: Since January 1987, some time ago, there has been significant change in the emphasis of the internal audit department, including the introduction of an internal audit charter, organisational structure and staffing changes, and a reappraisal of audit approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 3: An internal audit committee was established from a proposal by Ms M. Chin and Mr Tim Marcus Clark's initial response-I stress, initial response-was that it was unnecessary bureaucracy. The committee was established after Ms Chin held discussions with other members of the board to rally support. Prior to this, internal and external auditors made representations to the board, but this may have been restricted, depending on the board's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 4: On 28 September 1988 the board minutes indicated that the board was to meet on a six-monthly basis with both internal and external audit, following completion of accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 5: The audit committee was formed with terms of reference, drafted by Ms Chin, including, firstly, that an internal audit committee cover the financial affairs of the bank and the bank group, and, secondly, a requirement that the committee consider any matter relating to the financial affairs that it determines to be desirable and any matters referred by the board. The terms of reference for this audit committee have an overriding limitation that the committee has no executive power as to its findings and recommendations and Mr Marcus Clark stressed that the audit committee was not to take over the board's responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 6: The committee consisted principally of non-executive directors; however, the general manager of group finance had the right to attend and to speak at all meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 7: Ernst and Young-one of the bank's external auditors-was unable to assess the follow-up of a number of issues raised at the audit committee, namely, a review of corporate banking and the large number of unsecured loans; concern over the lack of global risk management systems; a review of delegation of authorities for lending approvals in offshore offices; London's external auditor's concerns about the lack of proper systems, especially treasury, management of interest rates, foreign exchange trading and large exposure to the property market; the New York auditor's concern about large write-offs and tax losses; and, lastly, concern regarding Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd about joint venture projects and off balance sheet companies-something much discussed in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 8: The internal audit charter was in existence but not approved by the board until, as I understand it, 28 June 1989. This may reflect the lack of importance afforded the internal audit function by senior management. With respect to the reporting line detailed in the charter-that is, the reporting line of the internal audit where it goes through the organisation-there are a number of points. Firstly, the charter is not up to date as the audit committee is not reflected. Secondly, the line detailed is not flexible enough to ensure independence; that is, to the managing director through the Chief General Manager, Global Risk Management, or, if necessary, the Chairman of the board. In addition, the reporting line-a term I stress that is much understood by auditors-is further removed as it goes through the Chief General Manager of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 9: The internal audit department was fragmented, with data processing audit separately housed until 1989. It was not until July 1990 that the varying degrees of internal audit departments, namely, Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd, Executor Trustee Australia Ltd, Oceanic Capital Corporation Ltd and United Banking Group Ltd were progressively brought together under the control of group internal audit. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 10: Prior to July 1985 personnel were recruited from within the bank to staff internal audit and it is only in recent times that people have been employed with tertiary qualifications and/or specific audit experience. At the board meeting of 22 August 1985 the external auditors indicated that there was a need to increase the expertise of internal audit with respect to corporate and international banking, data processing, foreign exchange and money market operations. On 25 August, I think last year, the board also noted that the skills of internal audit had improved, though treasury was still a problem. A review by KPMG Peat Marwick in August 1989 of treasury audit staff concluded that staff did not have the necessary skills and experience. In a memorandum written by G. Yelland, on 6 September last year, it was indicated that audit staff did not have the qualifications to handle the strategic risk management.</PARA>
<PARA> Point 11: A significant proportion of the senior staff did not have formal qualifications and the qualified staff the bank has are generally new and lack experience in bank auditing. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 12: Ernst and Young identified that training was provided to internal audit staff; however, it did not proceed further. Given that its review identified a lack of skills, further explanation needs to be carried out on that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 13: The internal audit department has conducted a series of reviews in the group members; however, these were only recently completed. Reviews that have been undertaken include a review of the Ayres Finniss Group in December 1990, of Ayres Finniss Information Systems in February 1991, of the Day Cutten Group in December 1990, of the Executor Trustee Group on 1 October 1990 and of the Oceanic Group on 11 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 14: The audit of Beneficial Finance Corporation may have operated ineffectively-and I stress `may have'-for two reasons: first, that the focus may not have been on the high risk areas and, secondly, that findings may not have been communicated to the board in their entirety. That is a very serious allegation to make, that findings may not have gone to the board. I refer honourable senators to my initial remarks about the importance of internal audit. It is there as a friend of management and the board and if findings are not passed on it is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 15: While the bank rapidly expanded offshore and increased its treasury and international banking activity, the internal audit department had limited involvement in these areas. As to internal audits conducted overseas-for the London office, which was established in 1878, the first internal audit was in April 1988. For the New York office, established in November 1987, the first internal audit was in April 1988. For the Hong Kong office, which was established in May 1986, the first internal audit was in April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The external auditors Ernst and Young indicated that these reviews were relatively brief and for treasury and international activities the first audits of the New York and London offices were April-May 1990. They also noted that a reason for the lack of audit was a reluctance to provide overseas holidays to internal audit. In May 1990 the internal audit manager Ms Chin noted that there had never been any audit of information systems of the international offices. That is a damning indictment of a bank wanting to expand in a risky and competitive market internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 16: Corporate banking was not subject to review by internal audit until June 1990. Again, can I say that that is where the banks problems have been, in corporate banking, the area of greatest expansion, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 17: There have been a number of instances where management was reluctant to allow internal audit unrestricted access. That is what I believe it should have. In May 1989, G. Abbot commented on not assessing group human resources information. On 20 November 1990, there was a file note by Ms Chin on the audit committee meeting that clarification was required as to `areas of restricted information'. On 21 September 1990, there was a memo from Mr S. Paddison:</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to sound a word of caution that I will most strongly resist the intrusion of Group Audit into areas which I believe are the proper province of management. </PARA>
<PARA>On 13 March 1991, apparently there was in existence an internal memo to the Chief Executive Officer advising that Mr Malouf, who I think is now the Managing Director of Beneficial Finance Corporation, but I may be wrong in that respect, was still refusing access to the Beneficial Finance Corporation salary packages. If the importance of that is lost, I remind honourable senators that Beneficial Finance Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 18: The report on internal audit to the board for the year ended 30 June 1990 indicated that there was a shift from compliance type audits to a broader risk-based approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 19: A number of special investigations were undertaken including, first, the board requested an investigation of Beneficial Finance Corporation and, secondly, it requested a review of group exposure to various key employees and directors. That aspect has been the matter of much public discussion in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 20: The audit planning process appears not to be adequate. Audit planning has originated primarily from within the internal audit department and has not had strategic direction. From the aforementioned comments one could conclude that internal audit was not properly planned to do a number of things: first, to cover all areas and functions both within the bank and across the group and, secondly, to give appropriate emphasis to tasks based on risks to the individual organisations and the combined risks faced by the group as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 21: Three external reviews of work done by internal audit have been done so far. They are: the review of treasury and internal audit function by Peat Marwick Hungerfords in August 1989; a review of the Reserve Bank reporting functions by Touche Ross on 28 November 1990; and a review of internal audit assignments at Beneficial Finance Corporation by Price Waterhouse, dated 22 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Point 22: There are indications that audit memoranda were circulated and that management did not respond, and the response received may not have always been in the spirit expected. </PARA>
<PARA> I assume from the information available to me that this list of allegations, which I have put as neatly and as closely to the original form in which I received them as possible, is known to the Auditor-General of South Australia, and that at least brings me some comfort. Indeed, these allegations may form part of the Auditor-General's investigation into the State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, all I can say is that the internal audit function of any company, especially one that is seeking to expand in a high risk, international and competitive market, must be given all the resources, qualified staff and independence necessary to do its job. It must have free and ready access to the board. From the 22 points that I have referred to, from information available to me, it appears that the State Bank's internal audit department had none of those requisites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Where trade and industry flourish, society prospers. That makes it easier to develop a fair, gracious and civilised community, to the advantage of all. The public interest requires that trade and industry be carried out in a context most conducive to their success. The general good is prejudiced where trade and industry are damaged by the delinquent conduct of individuals or groups. The common law holds that restraint of trade is against public policy. It has done so for centuries. It holds that contracts are sacrosanct and that penalties should be visited on those who interfere with them. That, too, is an ancient maxim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These two concepts have done much for the health of industry. They have helped producers and traders to carry on their businesses free from unfair competition and have assured that commercial agreements will be honoured. Consumers have benefited as a result. But there is a dark side to these concepts. They have kept other much needed ones from influencing the common law. This has left an unhappy bias in that grand institution. While it can be called in aid by those whose commercial interests are threatened, it gives little help to those whose wages and conditions are poor, to the environment when it is put at risk, or to animals faced with extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the common law pay much attention to the interests of commerce and industry and much less to the welfare of workers and the conservation of the world about us? Why does it give marked consideration to but one dimension of an issue? Part of the answer lies in the history of the common law. Much of its development took place in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution, an event which brought about dramatic changes to which the common law did not adequately respond. It allowed the shopfloor to develop into a place of horror, where men, women and children were dehumanised. Massive legislation was needed to counter the disaster it made possible. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 June 1919, in a case between the Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union of Australia and the City of Melbourne, two High Court judges, Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Rich, had the following to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Revolution for a long time . . . made workman's labour a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers would permit. The degradation and suffering that ensued, the revolt against the system, the repression of illegal acts, the amelioration of the law, the organisation of labour, the gradual recognition of collective bargaining and the introduction of private conciliation and arbitration as well as of industrial laws securing better conditions for workers are all well known historical facts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industrial Revolution raised many legal issues. The common law resolved these in ways highly prejudicial to the interests of workers. It provided actions for conspiracy, inducing breach of contract and intimidation which paid scant regard to any poverty, degradation or danger with which they were faced. It applied doctrines of common employment, volenti and contributory negligence to the great ruin of many injured at work. </PARA>
<PARA> Judges of today are captives of their predecessors, who gave a bent to the common law which favours trade and commerce over fair wages and conditions or a healthy environment. What dominated the courts of yesterday were the concepts that contracts were sacrosanct and trade was to be unfettered. They were little moved by concepts that people should receive fair wages or work reasonable hours or in decent conditions. They were influenced even less by concepts that the environment should be heeded or native animals preserved. The law dealt with issues arising from the making of contracts and the plying of trade well before it did so with those from the development of modern industry and the massive exploitation of the physical world. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently a Melbourne judge, in dealing with the issue of scallop dredging in Port Phillip Bay, gave great emphasis to the economic benefits that would arise from that activity were it allowed in the way pressed for by the industry. From media reports he gave scant weight, if any, to the effect dredging might have on the bay environment. In doing this he was acting in the tradition set by his predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislators have moved again and again to remedy the shortcomings of the common law. They have countered the harsh effect of the doctrines of common employment and contributory negligence. They have made laws for safety in the workplace. They have introduced compensation schemes for people injured while employed. Outside Australia they have given a right to strike. They have moved to protect the environment. They have looked to the protection of native animals. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 the Whitlam Government enacted the Trade Practices Act. Its purpose was to ensure fair commercial activity and to protect consumers. It has achieved much in both areas. On 3 May 1977 Mr John Howard, then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Fraser Government, introduced amendments to the Act. Two of the amendments, sections 45d and 45e, brought a new and unhappy dimension into the legislation. They went beyond setting out how trading companies were to conduct themselves in the marketplace and proscribed actions workers might want to take for better conditions or conservationists for a healthier environment. The use of sections 45d and 45e in industrial disputes is well established. Mudginberri is the most famous example. But it is only this year that the Trade Practices Act has been deployed against conservationists. BHP Petroleum Ltd recently sued Greenpeace pursuant to the provisions of section 45d following actions by it against the company's seismic testing ship Western Odyssey in waters off Warrnambool in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian community cannot survive without trade and industry. They must be properly protected, but they are not the sole foundation for a fair, healthy and cultured society. It also requires that there be fair working conditions and a sound environment. People need the ability to see to it that these are achieved. There are laws which enable people to pursue better wages and conditions and safety in the workplace. There are laws which enable them to pursue the well-being of the environment. But these are not always enough to achieve the proper outcomes. This is due mainly to the common law and sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act giving ascendancy to the interests of commerce and industry over the welfare of workers and the health of the environment. This can result in there being a dramatic lack of balance in the weight given to each of these matters by courts when deciding cases involving them. </PARA>
<PARA> The common law needs reform and the Trade Practices Act amendment to eliminate the bias that they now have against workers, conservationists and their organisations. Were this done, the community generally would benefit. It would be well done if it were done quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to detain the Senate for too long this evening-I know Senator McMullan said that he is hungry-but I should like to say a few words because I believe that it is important that my colleagues, all three of them on the Government side of the House and one on this side of the House, are aware of some tragic events that have happened in Tasmania over the last couple of days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most honourable senators would be aware that Tasmania is in the midst of the nationwide recession which we had to have. Because of our isolation, we tend to suffer these consequences much more seriously than our fellow Australians. It has already been mentioned on several occasions in this chamber-I have mentioned it myself-that Tasmania has the dubious privilege of having the second highest unemployment rate in Australia. At this point we trail Western Australia by only a minor part of one per cent. But in the light of recent events over the last few days I predict that, when the next set of figures is released, we will not see Tasmania second but at the top of the unemployment list. I refer briefly to the absolutely magnificent document, called Small Business in Australia, that David Beddall has produced. I quote from his opening remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>For the first time, we have a clear statement from the Commonwealth Government on what it sees as the state of small business in Australia, and the policies needed to enable small business to prosper. For too long this important sector of our economy has been ignored at all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA>You can say that again. I hope the outlook for small business improves and is as bright as some of the photos in this document. I should like to know how much it cost. The fact of the matter is that, because of this Government's policies, yesterday Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd announced the closure of its operation at Port Huon. I am sure that was prompted by some of the polices of the Green movement. That will add 116 workers to my State's dole queue in the Huon Valley-an area which has been devastated by an abnormally high unemployment rate over the last few years. The announcement by APM follows disclosures early this week that the Electrona silicon plant is to close, along with the Ovaltine factory at Spreyton. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that there is not one section of the State which is isolated from this economic catastrophe. Sixty-four jobs are to be lost at Electrona and a further 100 jobs are to be lost at the Ovaltine factory. The people who lose those jobs will join the 200 forest contractors and mill workers who have already been stood down because of an industrial dispute. If that does not clear up in the next few days, I am sure that further jobs will be lost in the forestry industry. On the front page of today's Mercury is a photo of a furnace worker whose job loss at the Pioneer Silicon Industries Pty Ltd smelter is his fifth in five years. That shows the mess that Tasmania is in. The only person cheering about this is a former Australian Democrats candidate in Tasmania, Patsy Harmsen, who spent thousands of dollars on trying to close down the smelter. She has had luck with the help of the State Labor Government and the ex-Treasurer's policies. She has had her day-100-odd jobs have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> To compound the problem, Pasminco Metals-EZ operation at Risdon also announced yesterday that it would not be reopening its ammonia and hydrogen production divisions. The consequence of this is that 27 employees in this area have been placed at risk and Pasminco EZ will be obliged to bring its ammonia from the mainland. This is a tragedy the likes of which Tasmania has not known for many years. In fact, the events of recent days are probably the biggest employment tragedy in Tasmania's history. Over recent months, in addition to what I have mentioned, 90 workers were retrenched at Rosebery's Pasminco mine and Savage River closed for four weeks. Tioxide Australia Pty Ltd near Burnie shed 160 jobs and is destined eventually to close entirely, while the Renison tin mine has had to shed 150 jobs to stay viable. </PARA>
<PARA> Individually these events may not seem that big on the national scene, but when compounded they total 907 jobs. Tasmania simply cannot afford to continue to lose jobs at this rate. The State is threatened with closure. Our 10.8 per cent unemployment rate, which transposes to 23,700 individuals, is our highest level since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sad to say that whilst this crisis has been going on, the Premier, Mr Field, and the Federal Labor Government seem to have proven themselves unable to provide a solution. It seems that both State and Federal Labor are locked into a state of inaction. There has been plenty of action up here in the last few days, but certainly not the sort of action we like to see in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the governments in my own State and here to respond to this disaster in Tasmania. I call upon those who have some power to take action to assist in this matter. It is very easy for us in this place to forget the human nature of unemployment, but I remind the Senate that yesterday 116 workers at Port Huon were obliged to return home to their families and children and say that they no longer had a job, that they no longer would be able to provide for the family at this time. I am sure that they also told their families that the prospects for the future were similarly very bleak. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, once again I call upon the governments to act because I believe the plight of Tasmania is being ignored. The last depression we had in Tasmania was under a previous Labor government, but at least the Labor Premier of the day, the late Albert Ogilvie, had a few brains. He borrowed 60,000 pounds from the Federal Government and he built a road up Mount Wellington. It is there for everybody to see. It is still benefiting tourism in our State. The Premier that we have in Tasmania at the moment seems to be worried only about sacking teachers and running around making statements-nothing is happening. Until we get some positive policies and some action between the State and Federal governments, I am afraid to say that all we are going to see in Tasmania is a graveyard of empty shops and broken businesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My Department does not consider ``direct marketing'', as such, an appropriate or effective means of informing the community about the goals of the department as a whole, or about individual departmental programs. It utilises press releases or statements to the media for disseminating information on specific issues. For matters of interest to specific groups various Branches distribute newsletters or similar publications to individuals or organisations that have expressed interest in receiving that type of material.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, no and see my previous answer at (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) My department does prepare and distribute a number of publications that provide information on Australia's foreign relations. These publications include ``Backgrounder'' and ``The Monthly Record''. They do not, in my opinion, constitute a form of ``direct marketing''.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The Department operates mainly on the basis of providing information directly to clients through its offices and staff. This involves direct contact with large numbers of people across many benefit categories. Offices make available a large range of information products to ensure that clients are fully aware of their entitlements. This includes providing information in a variety of languages. In addition to this direct contact approach, some client groups are targeted for the provision of particular information. For example, ``Age Pension News'' is very effective in providing information about Social Security entitlements and changes to age and service pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Department uses direct marketing to ensure that information is provided to those who should be aware of it. For example, details about changes in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme were sent to all pensioners. This method of marketing has proved to be effective in distributing detailed information to specific clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Apart from direct public contact by staff, the direct marketing methods considered most effective for my Department's purposes include:</PARA>
<PARA> * direct mailing of correspondence and other information material such as ``Age Pension News'' and inserts; and</PARA>
<PARA> * mailbox drops which can be used as part of publicity campaigns targeted at the general public, for example, for child disability allowance where the target audience is not readily identifiable through departmental or other records.</PARA>
<PARA>Telephone canvassing is not used currently by the Department because of possible privacy implications. A more effective and less intrusive mechanism has been to encourage clients and the general public to phone the Department's telephone information services, including the Multi-lingual Telephone Information Service for people who have difficulty understanding English. Direct marketing, such as inserts sent to clients with regular advice letters, has been used to promote these services.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The Department has not separated direct marketing as a budget item in Budget expenditure terms. It does not anticipate doing so as direct marketing is integrated within the whole of the Department's operations. Only large separate expenditure items are identified. The Department's largest direct marketing exercise, ``Age Pension News'', is currently recorded under ``Printing''.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Department maintains a database of all clients for purposes of making payments under the Social Security Act from which it could operate direct mailing projects based on predetermined client characteristics with full protection of privacy of clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department has completed the following direct mailing projects since 1 July 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> * ``Age Pension News'' is a newspaper designed to keep age and service pensioners up to date with issues that affect them. Editions were issued in July, September and December 1990 and February and May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> This publication has a circulation of 1.4 million which includes age and service pensioners and community and business organisations which have asked to be placed on the mailing list;</PARA>
<PARA> * Family Allowance Supplement and Child Disability Allowance information was sent in September 1990 to all Family Allowance recipients;</PARA>
<PARA> * A Family Allowance Supplement guide for tax professionals was sent in September 1990 to all tax professionals;</PARA>
<PARA> * Bulk mailouts about the Social Security Amnesty were sent in September 1990 to the following:</PARA>
<PARA> - unemployment beneficiaries with fortnightly mailouts;</PARA>
<PARA> - pensioners living in Australia with CPI increase advices; and</PARA>
<PARA> - pensioners living overseas with their cheques;</PARA>
<PARA> * Budget information material was sent in October 1990 to all Federal Members of Parliament and Senators, media outlets and welfare and community organisations;</PARA>
<PARA> * An advice about Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes was sent in November 1990 to all pensioners;</PARA>
<PARA> * A leaflet about Job Search Allowance, Young Homeless Allowance and JET (Jobs, Education and Training Program) was sent in January 1991 to all youth refuges in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> * Information about the deeming of income was sent in February 1991 to age pensioners whose circumstances indicated that they would not be affected by the deeming provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> * Information about the deeming of income was sent in February 1991 to pensioners whose circumstances indicated that they may have been affected by the deeming provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> * ``Streetwize'' comic books were sent in April 1991 to teenage sole parent pensioners; and</PARA>
<PARA> * The Child Disability Allowance publicity pilot which is currently taking place includes the distribution of an information sheet on the payment to households in Area West of Victoria and Area South of Queensland through a mailbox drop.</PARA>
<PARA>These specific activities are in addition to the Department's continuing program of sending individual advices to clients.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) With reference to a recent report about North Korea's suspected military strength possibly including nuclear weapons, and the fact that that country has the fifth largest army in the world, could this intelligence be a further threat to stability in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does the United Nations have the right to inspect countries who signed the Non-proliferation Treaty in 1985 to ensure they have not violated that document; if so, what is the latest information regarding nuclear weapons in both South and North Korea.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) What efforts, if any, are being made to forge peace between South and North Korea.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4449" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Any serious challenge to the security and stability of Northeast Asia would have a major impact in the wider Asia-Pacific area and in the world as a whole. The Korean Peninsula has for long been a serious potential flashpoint, because of its division and the engagement there of the interests of four major powers (the United States, the USSR, China and Japan). It is true that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains a large military capability in terms of both personnel and military hardware. While the armed forces of the Republic of Korea (ROK) are smaller, they are technologically superior and military deterrence is strengthened by the ROK's security relationship with the United States. Moreover, all the major powers with strategic interests in the Korean Peninsula have a strong interest in avoiding increased tensions and possible conflict there. Nuclear proliferation in the Peninsula would, however, be seriously destabilising.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Under Article III of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), each non-nuclear-weapon State Party undertakes to conclude an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the application of safeguards by the Agency on all of its present and future nuclear activities, in order to verify that its obligation not to develop or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons is being met. The IAEA is an autonomous intergovernmental organisation of the United Nations. IAEA safeguards inspections are conducted on the territory of the state concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The DPRK adhered to the NPT in 1985. It has so far failed to conclude its obligatory safeguards agreement with the IAEA, due by mid-1987, despite persistent representations by Australia and other countries, both bilaterally and through multilateral action. Therefore, no inspection procedures have been agreed between the DPRK and the IAEA pursuant to that country's NPT obligations. IAEA safeguards inspectors conduct inspections on certain nuclear facilities under safeguards agreements concluded by the DPRK prior to its accession to the NPT, but the DPRK continues to undertake some nuclear activities not covered by IAEA safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA> The ROK adhered to the NPT and concluded its safeguards agreement with the IAEA in 1975, so that the IAEA regularly inspects all nuclear material there. The ROK has strictly abided by its obligations not to develop or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other explosive devices. In accordance with its long-standing policy, the United States neither confirms nor denies that it has nuclear weapons stationed in the ROK.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been persistent reports that the DPRK is developing a capability to produce nuclear weapons. Australia and other countries are deeply concerned about the regional security implications of such a move and the obstacle it would pose to the improvement of relations on the Korean Peninsula. They have urged the DPRK to fulfil its NPT safeguards obligations without further delay in order to dispel suspicions that it is developing a nuclear weapons capability. This position was reinforced in May 1991 in the resolution on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction which was adopted at the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Pyongyang.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The two Koreas have remained in a state of armed truce since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Three rounds of North-South talks at Prime Ministerial level were held in late 1990. While there has been no specific outcome, the talks were an initial step towards a less confrontational relationship between North and South. The dialogue was suspended by the North in February 1991 following the start of the annual ` `Team Spirit'' military exercises between the ROK and the United States. No date for its resumption has yet been agreed. Some little progress has been made in other areas, especially sports contacts.</PARA>
<PARA> Recent changes in the external situations of the ROK and DPRK may also help to lessen tensions on the Peninsula. The ROK has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and exchanged trade offices with China. The DPRK's links with the former Warsaw Pact countries have been weakened, but it has been negotiating with Japan on the normalisation of relations and has had contacts with the United States. Australia also favours efforts to draw the DPRK out of its isolation, but progress will be impeded as long as there is uncertainty about the DPRK's nuclear intentions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (to) (4) The Department of Social Security has not awarded any consultancies to non-government welfare organisations since March 1990. From time to time, however, it has paid for staff to attend training courses or conferences run by organisations as diverse as the Red Cross Society, the Brotherhood of St. Laurence and the Dominican Sisters (or for representatives from organisations such as these to appear at Departmental venues) addressing areas such as counselling, client services, first aid and the like.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4451" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is aware that Setia Kawan has condemned this bid by Drs Cosmas Batubara. This happened after we announced our support for Drs Batubara in late March. Setia Kawan's opposition to Drs Batubara's candidature to head the International Labour Conference was expressed by its Chairman, HJC Princen, in an interview with an AAP correspondent in Jakarta on 1 May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The legal position of Setia Kawan is uncertain. Under Indonesian law Setia Kawan is required to register its existence with the Department of Home Affairs. While the Department has not yet accepted registration of Setia Kawan, it has also not formally outlawed it and Setia Kawan continues to operate. According to HJC Princen, Setia Kawan now has 30,000 signed up members. The only registered trade union in Indonesia is the All Indonesia Workers' Union (SPSI) which works in close cooperation with the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government is aware that HJC Princen's passport was withdrawn in 1985 and he has since been on a list of persons not allowed to travel overseas. The Government notes, however, that the Secretary General of Setia Kawan, Saut Aritonang, attended the International Non-Governmental Group meeting on Indonesia (INGI) in Washington on 29 April-1 May 1991 and attended an International Trade Union Conference in Perth in late May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Each year the Presidency of the International Labour Conference rotates between the four regional geographical groups of the International Labour Organisation. In 1991 it is the turn of the Asia-Pacific Group to provide the President. Indonesia has not previously held the position of President, and within the Asia-Pacific Group, of which Australia is a member, very considerable support emerged for Indonesia's candidacy. Australia therefore supported the candidature of the Indonesian Minister of Manpower for the position.</PARA>

DSS staff accompany the magnetic tapes from the Department's computer centre to mailing houses for the production of ink-jet address envelopes. Once the magnetic tapes have been used, DSS staff ensure immediate return to the computer centre.</PARA>
<PARA> The mailing houses are highly secure and are subject to strict privacy conditions, similar to those that apply to Commonwealth Public Servants. Any duplication and further use of information on the tapes would be in contravention of those privacy conditions and would also compromise their integrity as a mailing house.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Data held by DSS can be disclosed to the Minister or any person outside the Department only in accordance with the provisions of section 19 of the Social Security Act or as otherwise required under law.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) The Department has not provided any mailing list to the Minister or any other person, party or organisation. Some information from the data base may be used in preparing replies to Ministerial correspondence. In these circumstances the use of such information is regarded as being authorised by the correspondent. It is used only in responses to the individual clients who are the subject of the correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA> Although information from the data base with all identifying personal details removed can be made available for research purposes, this is done only in accordance with section 19 of the Social Security Act and the Privacy Principles. Such data never include client identifiers such as names, addresses or pension numbers. It is strictly demographic information from which it is not possible to identify individuals.</PARA>
<PARA> Information on individual cases and bulk information may be disclosed where it is lawful to do so under the applicable legislation. See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) See (3) above.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) (b) DSS data bases have been used to:</PARA>
<PARA> - write to clients about individual eligibility and entitlement;</PARA>
<PARA> - advise in general terms of changes to DSS programs (eg FAS, deeming);</PARA>
<PARA> - advise in general terms of concessions offered to pensioners and beneficiaries by other agencies;</PARA>
<PARA> - ask clients to provide information on a voluntary basis for research purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>(7) If a letter signed by the Minister is sent to clients the mailing is done by the Department usually with the assistance of a mailing house. See (2) above. The Minister does not have access to the mailing list. The Privacy Commissioner has not published any guidelines relating to this matter. Use of information by DSS is in accordance with Information Privacy Principle 10 in the Privacy Act.</PARA>
