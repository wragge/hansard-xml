<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to his news release dated 12 April concerning Ambassador Burke and to the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The decision to approve paid special leave was in accordance with the normal terms and conditions applying to all heads of diplomatic missions.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask: will the Minister table in the Senate those terms and conditions? To what extent is the Minister's discretion operable in this area? Given the obvious requirement for Ambassador Burke to be present in Australia from time to time for the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters throughout this year and, possibly, even next year, will the provision of special leave be available to him for those other occasions at an approximate cost of $3,000 a week?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is no difficulty about tabling the terms and conditions and I will do that as soon as I have a copy to hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The discretion vested in me so far as special leave is concerned follows from a reference in one paragraph of those terms and conditions to matters which would, in the case of the Public Service generally, be for determination by the Department of Industrial Relations but are, in the case of ambassadors, matters for my determination. Accordingly, special leave-which is one that is applicable for the Public Service generally, and involves an authority vested in the Department of Industrial Relations-is an authority, by virtue of those terms and conditions, vested in me.</PARA>
<PARA> That provision is not unique to Mr Burke's terms and conditions. It is a standard clause. The kind of discretion that one exercises in this instance depends wholly on the circumstances of the particular case. There is no obvious pre- cedent to call in aid in this instance. I did so exercise my discretion in this case on the basis of advice tendered to me by my Department which had carefully reviewed the nature of the public and departmental interests as well as, of course, those of Mr Burke himself, involving his coming back to deal with these matters before the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as possible future appearances before the Commission are concerned, I have no information as to what the nature, extent and duration of those subsequent appearances are likely to be. It may be that we will be better informed about that towards the end of the present period of his appearance back in Australia. I simply say that the decisions about that are to be made in all the circumstances as they exist at the time, and no decision has been made to this point, nor any understandings reached, as to the nature of further special leave of this kind.</PARA>

I am pleased to advise the Senate that, following reforms in the grain handling terminals generally which resulted in manpower reductions of between 50 and 80 per cent at those terminals, agreement was reached last week in South Australia to expedite a process of continuous pour in South Australian grain ports. This will enable pours of 14 continuous hours to be achieved, which will add greatly to the further efficiency that is being achieved in waterfront reform in those ports, and I understand that that has been warmly welcomed by the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Is the Minister aware of an article in the Australian Financial Review on 2 April 1991 by Alan Kohler, which points out that the equity base of the Adsteam group of companies has been wiped out? The article states that in six months the shareholders of these companies have lost $3.5 billion, almost entirely because of the decline in value of cross-shareholdings in each other company, which predated the last balance date. The article states also that the equity collapse was hidden by its exploitation of hopelessly inadequate accounting and reporting rules. Therefore, what action is the Government taking, in light of the Adsteam group of companies collapse, to require companies to consolidate the accounts of entities they control?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2414" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should not comment on the specific case because legal proceedings are afoot. I can comment on some of the wider implications of the matters of concern that Senator Schacht has raised and the Government's plans in that area. It is true that current law requires companies to produce group accounts only in relation to their subsidiary companies. It does not cover unincorporated entities like trusts or partnerships. Further, companies have an option in producing group accounts in deciding whether to produce a single set of consolidated accounts or separate accounts for each subsidiary. Even before the establishment of the new national scheme for corporate regulation on 1 January this year, the Attorney-General, Mr Michael Duffy, had publicly identified reforms to this area of the law as a priority for the new scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can now foreshadow-and it will be of interest to Senator Schacht-that the Government will be introducing, in its first amending legislation under the new national scheme, amendments to require companies to produce a consolidated set of accounts covering all the companies and other entities that they control, including providing a broad definition of control. This directly tackles the use of off balance sheet vehicles like trusts and partnerships. It also does away with the option that holding companies have had until now about whether they consolidate the accounts of the companies in their group. Consolidation will now be compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments will permit the effective operation of an accounting standard on this issue which was approved by the Accounting Standards Review Board in the late 1990s and which I understand was the subject of the discussions between the Attorney-General and the chairman of the Accounting Standards Review Board. So I believe that between the profession of accountancy and the national Parliament-under the new regulation framework provided for companies and securities throughout Australia-we will be able to provide a remedy for the situation that Senator Schacht has described.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. In light of concerns expressed last week about the future of Australia's telecommunications manufacturing industry, can the Minister indicate what sort of role Telecom Australia might play in the continuing development of the Australian telecommunications industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2415" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of ongoing discussion as the telecommunications industry evolves. Both Telecom and OTC Ltd have been important agents for the growth of the local telecommunications industry as they purchase an estimated $2.6 billion worth of equipment in the equipment market. Local content in this equipment can be as high as 70 per cent in the case of small earth stations and optical fibre submarine and transmission equipment. Under such schemes as the offsets program, partnerships for development and the industry development arrangements, local suppliers-both Australian and overseas owned-have built a world competitive manufacturing base, with exports of nearly $200m in 1989-90. The introduction of a second carrier will provide greater opportunities for the equipment suppliers. As part of the process of selecting a second carrier, the Government will require prospective carriers to outline their industry development proposals which might include measures such as local sourcing, local research and development, local investment, and the export of local goods and services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom will also be required to continue to play its part in industry development measures. Given the competitiveness of the equipment supplier industry and Australia's acknowledged leading role in telecommunications technologies, I can see little need for Telecom to change its level of local industry support. We would therefore expect Telecom to continue to play a major part in the development of a stronger local telecommunications industry. Senator Kernot asked Senator Collins a question about a similar matter last week. This comes to me as industry Minister, and I am just fleshing out some of the points that Senator Collins made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say that trade union and employer associations are, I am advised, exempt from income tax by specific provision of the law. Political parties are not exempt, but member subscriptions and voluntary donations would not be income for taxation purposes, and periodical subscriptions by members of trade unions and employer organisations generally are deductible. Voluntary donations to political parties are not considered to relate to the derivation of assessable income by individual donors and are not deductible. Special levies or contributions by members of trade unions or employer organisations to assist a political party are not deductible as they do not relate to the derivation of assessable income by members.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is the Minister aware of Senator Hill's criticism over the weekend that the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process has not lived up to the expectations created for it by the Government and is not making any progress in dealing with the issues of regional economic concern?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2416" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the moment APEC is going more or less exactly as planned and hoped. Senator Hill's comments about it over the weekend show that he either does not understand the concept, does not understand anything about diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region, or that he does understand all of that but simply cannot forbear from making silly, partisan, political point-scoring comments because he cannot stand seeing Australia have any diplomatic success under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make four points as quickly as I can about APEC's progress. In the first place, since November 1989, 10 major work projects have been set in train, on nearly all of which substantial progress is expected to be reported at the forthcoming ministerial level meeting in Seoul in October. Those projects deal with the following subjects: review of trade and investment data; trade promotion programs and mechanisms; investments and technology transfer; human resource development; regional energy cooperation; marine resource conservation; telecommunications; fisheries; transportation; and tourism. I am not suggesting that the results in the short term will be spectacular under any one of those heads. It would be a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the work that is in progress to expect that. But I have every reason to believe that progress under each of those areas will be both steady and constructive.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, while the APEC group has voiced very strong support for the principles of the Uruguay Round-and most APEC members are, of course, key players in the Uruguay Round in their own right-it was anticipated from the outset that its major trade liberalisation activity as a group would have a post-Uruguay focus. With this in mind, at Australia's initiative there has now been set in train at a recent officials' meeting a major exercise in examining the scope for non-discriminatory regional trade liberalisation. Again, movement on an issue as complex and delicate as that can hardly be fast, but it does have the potential over time to contribute immense benefits and very important momentum to international trade liberalisation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the participation in APEC by the three Chinese economies of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong is the subject right now of active discussion and negotiation. The hope still is that that issue will be able to be resolved in favour of the admission of those three economies at the Seoul meeting. That was always the timetable. All the issues involved in that exercise are hugely complex, given the political dynamics in the region. We simply do not solve these sorts of problems by `bull at a gate' political rhetoric of the kind that Senator Hill is advocating.</PARA>
<PARA> The final point I specifically make is that APEC itself has now firmly consolidated regional political support behind it, something which obviously could not be taken for granted, even in the aftermath of the inaugural conference in Canberra in November 1989.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell honourable senators something about the Malaysian trade bloc. The Malaysian proposal for an east Asia economic grouping is now being looked at from all sides in terms of how it fits within or alongside APEC, rather than the converse. If Senator Hill does not understand the significance of that, he knows even less than I thought he did about the currents at work in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me finally say this: I genuinely believe that Australia's interests are best served by a bipartisan approach in external affairs issues so far as that is humanly possible. I do not mind, nor could anyone, honest differences of opinion or honest criticisms by the Opposition, but I do mind, here as elsewhere, pathetically unsupported and ill-judged attempts to talk down foreign policy initiatives which, if they are successful, are initiatives very much in the interest not of the Government but of Australia as a whole.</PARA>

It was accepted by a number of commentators that Dr Hewson may have won a victory in his party room on disclosure. The press statement that came out reflected that victory. I made the point at the time that the press statement was loaded with a number of qualifications which, in time, would develop and lead to a situation where the Liberal Party would not support the Government's full disclosure provisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that most of the small batteries do contain some quantities of mercury and that when those batteries are discarded they will mostly finish up in a land fill of some form around Australia. I have to say that that is not highly desirable but it is probably the most effective form of containing the damage that that mercury can do, provided that the land fill is the right kind. Studies in Australia and overseas have shown that disposal to controlled land fill is still the best way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem overseas is that in countries such as Japan waste disposal is done by means of incineration. That can be quite dangerous with mercury batteries. The truth is that rather than looking for a better way of disposing of these batteries-and the Government is committed to a proper national strategy on waste minimisation and recycling-we might be better off getting a better product in the first place. I would hope that efforts can be made to look at successful battery recycling for certain, but also looking at batteries which do not require mercury in the first place. If we can have a combination of controlled land fill now and a proper waste minimisation strategy and recycling, we can do something about products that do not contain mercury at all, and the world would be a better place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Section 422 of the corporations law to which Senator Boswell referred substantially covers the duty of company receivers to do two things: first, to lodge a report with the Supreme Court where it appears that company officers may have committed an offence and, secondly, to provide the Australian Securities Commission with such information as it requires. Section 324C of the Companies Code, as I understand it, is substantially the same. It is apparent, therefore, that the receivers are not required to report to either the Minister or the Department on this matter. The receivers were appointed by the Westpac Banking Corporation, not by the Commonwealth. Therefore, questions on how its receivership is proceeding would be best directed to that corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health to reports of three studies published in the British Medical Journal that found that people who reduce their salt intake can lower their blood pressure even more than with drug treatment. Although individuals can choose not to add salt to food, their ability to do so in respect of processed foods is more limited. Could the Minister advise whether there are any plans in Australia to encourage manufacturers to lessen the amount of salt they put into processed foods?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire points to one of many studies which support the use of dietary measures to control blood pressure. There is no doubt that sodium intake is an important factor in hypertension, though it is not the only factor. Many individuals with high blood pressure-some 40 per cent, I am told-do not respond to dietary salt reduction, just as some individuals who consume considerable amounts of salt do not have high blood pressure. The importance of encouraging people to quit smoking, for example, cannot be underestimated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Government recognises the importance of salt as a factor in hypertension, as well as in stroke and heart disease. This is reflected in the Australian dietary guidelines as well as in Government support for community education initiatives to this end. In fact, one such initiative is being undertaken in Tasmania, in its community education program called the salt skip program, which promotes a healthy diet and emphasises lowering of salt intake.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Maguire suggested in his question, processed foods are a major source of salt in our diets and reducing the amount of salt in processed foods is to be encouraged. One approach already taken by the Government, I am advised by the Minister for Community Services and Health, is to establish under the better health program a food industry strategy task force whose aim is to foster communication and cooperation with the food industry in health promotion and consumer education, as well as the development of new products, such as low salt or no added salt processed foods, and the reduction of the salt content in existing products. In addition, the National Food Authority, which should commence operation on 1 July, will provide a forum for the Government to consult and communicate with the food industry.</PARA>
<PARA> That answer is from a brief provided by the Minister for Community Services and Health. But, of course, there is only so much that governments can do in regard to persons taking steps to reduce the possible incidence or the onset of various diseases. I believe that the choices that people make in the marketplace as to the goods they purchase, particularly food products, will in the end probably do more than regulations and penalties to ensure that they, as well informed consumers, purchase and eat the foods which will best promote their good health.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no greater penalty for businesses than losing a market share. If consumers insist on a range of choice, which includes salt reduced or salt free foods, I believe that that action in the marketplace will have a pronounced effect in ensuring that Australians eat healthier foods and, therefore, that many are in a position to reduce or control blood pressure and hypertension problems.</PARA>

Certainly, it will be well advised to be guided by the submission that the Commonwealth has made to that inquiry, because ours is indeed a thorough and full submission.

So far 30 of those have been considered, with 26 being granted exemption and one a partial exemption. So only three so far have been rejected. Two of those were rejected because the funds were not used for capital expenditure on schools, nursing homes, churches and the like, and one because the funds were spent outside Australia. At the moment there are a further 16 applications for exemption under consideration and the remaining eight after that are awaiting further information from the applicant organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third part of the question related to when the exemption would apply. Where an application for exemption is granted, the date of effect will be the date that the application was received. It should be noted that back in January we wrote to approximately 40 organisations that we knew of at the time saying that they ought to apply. So they had an opportunity to apply well in advance of the date when these provisions came into effect. As far as the client is concerned, a review is noted for the client so that the assessment can be altered once the exemption is granted. For these organisations we will apply that from the date on which the application was received.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had an opportunity to peruse the article in today's Sydney Morning Herald, but I believe that it is true that Mr Howe has written to the Treasurer, Mr Keating, expressing concern regarding the scope of the issues paper recently released by the Industry Commission. His concern, as I understand it, is related to possible duplication between the issues to be considered by the Commission and work currently being undertaken by the national health strategy inquiry. In particular, the Industry Commission's issues paper suggested that amendments to the objectives of the Australian health care system were to be canvassed by the inquiry. Obviously in the view of the Minister for Community Services and Health those issues are being considered in a far more appropriate and detailed context by the national health strategy inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Howe certainly endorses, as a matter of principle, any strategy which will improve this country's balance of trade, particularly where it can be shown that spare capacity exists within the health care system, which can be utilised without disadvantage to Australian patients. Mr Howe is concerned with the suggestion that trade-offs may have to be made between exporting health services for profit and the provision of basic health services to all Australians at subsidised prices. I think that, as a doctor, Senator Herron can see the basis for that concern.</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of Mr Howe, I reiterate that the objectives of Medicare should in no way be compromised by inappropriate export strategies.

He has made it very clear that he wants to get that balance absolutely right. If that assurance can be given, then quite clearly the export performance which Australia needs to achieve should not be confined to products, but can also find ready expression in the provision of services into foreign markets or by allowing foreigners to come to Australia to take the benefit of those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Health services provided by Australia are of international reputation and quality, and there is no doubt that considerable money could be raised by the provision of such services.

It has obviously named the wrong person. On the second page it has got `Mr Graham Glenn' and, of course, that is Mr William Gray of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. With this erroneous naming I did not regard this as an authoritative article in the first place. I do not know whether that reflects on David Barnett, who is attributed to be the author, or on some nameless subeditor who just does not know who he is talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This question from Senator Reynolds contains the relevant point that none of the Sir Humphreys referred to in this article were women. Interestingly, no women are regarded by the authors as being in list of the power elite either. It does reflect, I think, on the sad inheritance that we, as a government, have picked up in terms of the number of women in the composition of the upper levels of the Australian Public Service, and provides a graphic example of the reason we introduced equal opportunity legislation and a program on equal opportunity in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> I think, coming off a very low base, that there will be-and there are now-in the upper reaches of the Public Service, a number of women serving in quite senior positions. Maybe we will see some Dame Helens instead of Sir Humphreys coming through the ranks in the future.</PARA>

Last night I noticed the Yes, Prime Minister program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The program last night was the famous program entitled `The Key', in which the Prime Minister's political adviser was a rather formidable woman. That very formidable woman in Sir James Hacker's office succeeded in winning one of the very few victories any of the bureaucrats in the place have had over Sir Humphrey.

<PARA>REGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION:</PARA>
<PARA>WHITHER APEC?</PARA>
<PARA>AN ADDRESS BY SENATOR ROBERT HILL, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TO THE NORTH QUEENSLAND ZONE CONFERENCE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY</PARA>
<PARA>CAIRNS</PARA>
<PARA>13 APRIL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>I want to address the issue of regional economic relations and the importance of regional economic cooperation to Australia. In Queensland, as in the rest of Australia, we are feeling the bite of recession, a recession that can only be overcome by greater trade liberalisation and domestic reform. Australia needs to improve its competitive position, which requires not only significant internal structural adjustment, but a commitment to greater integration into the global and regional economies. </PARA>
<PARA>Much has been happening to influence global economic relations over the last few months, and these events have had, and will continue to have, an impact on Australia's trading position and economic wellbeing. In the post-Gulf War situation, the economic realm will come in for greater focus as economic security becomes fundamental to the security of a state. </PARA>
<PARA>For Australia, this means several things. It means firstly that a commitment to a multilateral trading regime, such as the GATT, is essential as structural change continues in the world economy. This process of globalism requires management of international economic relations through an international rule based regime with the objective of furthering world trade liberalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>In a period of great change, such as the one we are experiencing at the moment, there is a temptation to adopt discriminatory and protectionist economic policies in order to attempt to reassert control over the direction of national economies. This must be discouraged as it has detrimental effects for those not part of such agreements, and eventually the parties to such arrangements suffer, at the very least in terms of the economic efficiency of their production and practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The apparent breakdown of the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks in December 1990 and the restarting of them in February this year, is illustrative of this trend in the global economy. Member countries have been attempting to negotiate a new multilateral trading regime including areas not previously covered by the GATT, such as agriculture, services and intellectual property rights. Australia has been a player in these talks, through the Cairns Group of Agricultural Fair Trading Nations. However, it is over this very issue-agriculture-that the talks have stalled. </PARA>
<PARA>The intransigence of the European Community (EC), Japan and South Korea over the protection of their agricultural markets has meant that very little progress in all areas has been made. Agriculture has been the key to the negotiations, with progress on this directly related to the preparedness of developing countries to make concessions with regard to the concerns of the more developed countries in areas such as intellectual property rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet whilst the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round must remain one of Australia's highest economic priorities, attention must also be given to our Asia-Pacific region and the opportunity for greater economic integration within it. Our future lies in this region and we must attempt to play an active and appropriate role. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has always been an enthusiastic initiator and supporter of regional economic arrangements, often in tandem with Japan. Australia was instrumental in the formation of the Pacific Basin Economic Committee (PBEC), a private organisation of business interests which originated from Australia-Japan business cooperation. In 1980, a seminar prompted by discussions between Prime Minister Fraser and Japan's Prime Minister Ohira then resulted in the establishment of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) in 1982. PECC brings together in an informal manner a combination of representatives from government, business and the academic world which has been significant in encouraging greater economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>More recently, there has been the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 1989 as a result of an Australian initiative. Prime Minister Hawke and Senator Evans have claimed it as possibly their finest foreign policy achievement. Not surprisingly, as the Coalition was intimately involved in the development of economic cooperation in the region over the past few decades, we also welcomed APEC. We recognised its potential-potential clearly still present. Yet it is not too early to assess whether that potential is being realised. It is on the progress of APEC that I now wish to dwell. </PARA>
<PARA>APEC[1] is designed as a ministerial-level forum to pursue three general objectives for regional economic cooperation[2] which include:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) greater regional coordination of economic activities and policies, including various practical projects;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) communication and exchange of information on trade and investment flows, including the establishment of regional information bases; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) attempts to jointly advance multilateral trade liberalisation, and to respond to the limits of multilateral regimes for the region. </PARA>
<PARA>As the third annual ministerial meeting approaches[3], there are regrettably very few positive achievements that can yet be identified. Perhaps in part it relates to the style in which these objectives are pursued. APEC has from the start been very much an informal consensus building forum, designed to be sensitive to the heterogeneity in culture, ethnic composition, ideology, security interests and levels of economic development of the AsiaPacific region. Whilst this is in essence the most productive way for a region with such diversity as this to cooperate, it must not become an excuse for inaction. </PARA>
<PARA>The first APEC meeting, held in Canberra in 1989, was claimed to be significant singly because it was held at all. A government-level forum to deal with the economic concerns of the region was unprecedented, with the main area of agreement arising from this meeting being cooperation with respect to the furtherance of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>The second APEC meeting, held in Singapore in 1990, reviewed progress in work projects, focused on APEC's commitment to the Uruguay Round and confirmed the desirability of the participation of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. However little else originated from this meeting apart from reiterating previously determined objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Without real progress on the crucial economic issues facing the region, APEC risks being dismissed simply as yet another talk-shop. It is important for APEC to start to show evidence of progress on difficult regional economic concerns and it is now an appropriate time to concentrate on this. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the evidence of greater regional coordination of economic activities and policies, the first general objective which has been identified? Work projects have indeed been established including the review of trade and investment data, trade promotion, expansion of investment and technology transfer, human resources development, energy cooperation and marine resource cooperation. But yet these projects have produced little in the way of concrete results and little that could not have been done by existing regional organisations such as the PECC. </PARA>
<PARA>The second general objective, that of communication and exchange of information has fared little better. There has been a great deal of dialogue, at the ministerial and officials level, which no doubt is useful, but in practical terms it has taken until now to reach agreement on a proposal by Singapore to establish a trial regional electronic trade and economics data bank[4]. The establishment of regional information bases of standardised data should be a priority goal. </PARA>
<PARA>The third general objective, that of cooperation with respect to furthering the Uruguay Round, has been hailed as evidence of APEC's success. Yet the Uruguay Round stalled in December 1990 largely as a result of the intransigence of three parties, two of which are participants in APEC-Japan and South Korea. Although there are indications that if the EC made concessions with respect to agriculture, the other two may be persuaded to as well, at present all three are unwilling to come out from behind their protectionist trade barriers. </PARA>
<PARA>APEC has been of limited use in helping to resolve this. APEC aimed at adopting a common position with respect to these GATT negotiations, but despite the successful rhetoric of cooperation and the image of a united front, little in reality has been achieved in this respect. Yet APEC retains the commitment, reiterated at the most recent APEC Senior Officials Meeting in South Korea in early March, to the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round as its top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, a commitment to further the Uruguay Round sits uneasily with the lack of regional commitment to trade liberalisation and trade openness. Almost all APEC participants have significant levels of protection in some sectors. For example, contrasted with the efficient agricultural production of Australia and New Zealand is the protection evidenced in the agricultural sectors of not only Japan and South Korea, but some ASEAN countries and Taiwan. In addition, protection is high in the manufacturing industries of Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. This contrasts with Singapore and Hong Kong, which have the most liberal import systems in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, APEC has only recently agreed that general regional trade liberalisation is an appropriate area for further detailed study and consideration[5]. This is in response to an Australian discussion paper on non-discriminatory trade liberalisation in the region. It is unfortunate that it has taken Australia, or any other regional country for that matter, so long to circulate a paper on such a crucial topic. Although the preferred approach of the region has always been a process of consensus-building, and indeed APEC is considering liberalisation in specific areas, it really does seem that regional trade liberalisation as a whole should have been on the agenda in a much more defined way from the very beginning of APEC. The question of regional structural adjustment is perhaps the most important one for APEC but the one to which the least amount of attention has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade liberalisation is assuming increased importance in response to very definite signs from within the region of an exploration of greater discrimination in trading policies. The apparent breakdown of the Uruguay Round triggered all sorts of propositions, including one from the Australian Prime Minister to consider using APEC as the basis of an Asian trading bloc should the GATT Round fail completely. This suggestion must be dismissed as totally counter-productive for the region, indeed many of APEC's participants are committed to APEC precisely because it was not intended as a regional bloc. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that certain global trade signals indicate the move towards more defined regional trading blocs. It is still too early to say however, whether European market integration in 1992 will result in the feared ``Fortress Europe'' outcome. In turn, the agreement by the US, Canada and Mexico to negotiate a North American Free Trade Agreement, as an expansion of the existing United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, has led to justifiable fears about the maintenance of market access. The announcement by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay of the creation of the Southern Common Market Treaty (Mercosur) to aim at free trade between the four countries is also indicative of this trend. </PARA>
<PARA>However, proposals for Asia-Pacific regional trading blocs are not a useful response to these indications. Malaysia's proposal for an East Asian Economic Group (EAEG) in December 1990 appeared to aim at the formation of an inward looking trading bloc: to include the ASEAN nations, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Burma and Indochina; but excluding the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA>This call seemed not only designed as a response to the global devolution towards trading blocs, but as a response to developing countries' concerns that they were being excluded by developed nations. If this indeed is the case, then APEC is failing in its attempt to bring the countries of the region together in a manner which enables equal exchange of views. Perhaps there is a perception that the developed nations are dominating APEC which could help explain why Malaysia found it necessary to make such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>It is encouraging to note that Malaysia has since moved away from the trade bloc idea, although it is still not entirely clear as to just what is being proposed. It is also encouraging to note that two potential members, Japan and Indonesia, have rejected the idea, with China giving a fairly cautious response. It is more surprising however for Singapore, a model of openness, to be expressing support. </PARA>
<PARA>What also needs to be cautioned against in APEC is a domination of APEC's agenda by the United States-Japan trade friction. This is likely to assume a greater importance as the two experience disputes over areas such as semiconductors, construction, Japan's role in the Uruguay Round, the Structural Impediments talks and Japan's financial contribution to the Gulf War. </PARA>
<PARA>These disputes will inevitably affect the countries of the Asia-Pacific region as the US and Japan dominate so much of regional trade. Both are the major trading partners of most in the region and therefore market access becomes an issue, with fears of greater protection in the US or managed bilateral trade if disputes are not resolved. Depending on how these disputes are managed, it is possible that APEC will spend increasing amounts of time trying to deal with issues arising from the differences between the two. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, apart from not meeting its claimed objectives, there is still the question of APEC's inadequate membership. A body to reform economic relations in the region will exist in a world of unreality if it does not include China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Yet so far APEC has been unable to find criteria for eligibility and a way of allowing the political sensitivities of China to be accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA>China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all distinct economies which should be included in APEC as a matter of priority due to their economic importance to the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, the inclusion of Hong Kong should never have been a real problem as it has not yet reverted to Chinese control, is a member of the GATT and an exemplary free trader. </PARA>
<PARA>With adequate resolve it should be possible to find a formula, perhaps the Asian Development Bank or PECC model where the issues of names was resolved and both regarded as ``economies'' and not countries. One therefore questions whether the resolve is present. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also the question of APEC's relationship with other countries of the region. Participating states have not worked out a formula for linkage with the Soviet Union and the Pacific states of Latin America despite being pressed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed the region needs to decide how the Soviet Union is relevant and engage it in some form of greater interaction. This might avoid proposals such as one rumoured that President Gorbachev is expected to propose a Japan Sea economic bloc, incorporating China, North and South Korea, Japan and the Soviet Union. The combination of technology from Japan and South Korea, Soviet resources and Chinese labour may well be tempting, but the region generally would suffer with such an inward looking arrangement[6]. </PARA>
<PARA>However, even resolving questions of participation, one must question the effective usefulness of APEC whilst there is no satisfactory interface with business. From the outset business was not included which struck the Coalition as a fundamental flaw. Business interests need to have an input into APEC's working groups and representation, perhaps through observer status, at APEC meetings. Economic development cannot be examined in isolation from commercial realities. Regional economic cooperation is not just about changing government policy, at the commercial level it will be business interests that determine the success or failure of such policies. </PARA>
<PARA>APEC must produce concrete results. Dialogue and exchange of views at a government level is always useful but more must be achieved. The more practical outcomes: the changes in government policy, the alteration of business practices, the communication of information to improve economic performance, have to be the priority. By achieving positive outcomes dialogue and cooperation will be reinforced. Without practical results APEC will become a disinterested forum incapable of real progress on regional issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional issues must become APEC's primary focus. It will be too easy to focus on multilateral causes, such as the GATT, and although attention should indeed be paid to this, there are already appropriate multilateral forums in which to do this. By contrast, there are a limited number of regional forums designed specifically to cope with regional economic cooperation and structural adjustment. APEC must not become distracted from regional issues. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time for governments to take a hard look at APEC and its objectives. It is time to evaluate whether useful outcomes are being achieved and whether there is room for greater productive interaction. Consensus building is a slow process but it must not be used as an excuse for lack of progress. With a firm commitment to regional economic cooperation, APEC has the potential to not only liberalise trade, but to play a useful role in the resolution of regional differences and help carry the region through a difficult time into the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1991, to incorporate into that Act a proposal to increase the duty on exported uranium concentrate, which was tabled in this Chamber by myself on 10 May 1990, and is effective from 21 February 1990, being the date of effect of that Proposal in accordance with section 273ea of the Customs Act 1901 (Clause 2). </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal, which increases the export duty on uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory Region from $1.15 to $1.30 as from 21 February 1990, is incorporated in Clause 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4 of the Bill provides an exemption from the increased levy where uranium concentrate was loaded on to a vessel, or was part of a consignment, the loading of which was commenced prior to the 21 February 1990 commencement of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The levy, which applies only to exports of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, is imposed to partially offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities undertaken by the Commonwealth to protect the Alligator Rivers Region. The increase in the level of the levy reflects the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne as far as is practicable by the industry carrying out those operations, and not the ordinary taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>Successive Governments throughout the 1980's have recognised that the Alligator Rivers Region, which includes Kakadu National Park, requires special measures to ensure that its sensitive environment receives adequate protection from the possible adverse effects of uranium mining. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of the Alligator Rivers Region should not be underestimated-large parts of the Area have received international recognition by being placed on the world heritage list. Australia has specific obligations under the World Heritage Convention to ensure such areas are not degraded. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth's contribution to the protection of the Alligator Rivers Region is through the operation and research undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist and other Commonwealth Agencies, in addition to the provision of funds for services by agencies of the Northern Territory Government on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The services provided by the Northern Territory on behalf of the Commonwealth include:</PARA>
<PARA>* the application of National codes of practice relevant to nuclear materials,</PARA>
<PARA>* safety, health and mining regulations and</PARA>
<PARA>* environmental monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA>The costs of these services are offset by contributions from the Commonwealth in the annual revenue grant to the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The programs and role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (``OSS'') have been reviewed and endorsed on a number of occasions. The most recent review, the Taylor review, concluded in November 1989 that the OSS is as necessary today as it was in 1978, (when it was established), as the community continues to require assurances from an independent and competent source that the environment of the region is being protected from the adverse effects of mining. </PARA>
<PARA>The uranium export duty, which only applies to the export of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers Region, was introduced by the Coalition Government in 1980. The increases in the duty that have occurred since 1980 reflect the Government's position that those involved in uranium mining activities in the Alligator Rivers Region, and not the ordinary taxpayer, should incur as far as possible, the costs associated with protecting that environment from possible adverse effects arising from their activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed increase in duty from $1.15 to $1.30/kg from 21 February 1990 has been implemented in an effort to move towards full cost recovery of the Government's environment protection measures associated with mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government makes no apology for its policy of supporting full cost recovery of all Government expenditure used in protecting the environment from uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region. However, it recognises that limitations exist in the present export duty system which, for example, requires an amendment to legislation whenever a change to the amount of revenue required is needed. Further, it notes that the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts report on The Potential of the Kakadu National Park Region and the Taylor Review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist suggested that the levy could be applied more equitably as organisations other than uranium mining companies either utilise or benefit from the results of OSS research. The Government will be addressing these issues and examining alternative means for collecting these costs in a more effective and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed increased duty raised an additional $0.222 million during 1989/90 and is expected to raise an additional $0.932 million over the full 1990/91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1989/90 financial year the levy raised $4.007 million. Between July and February of the 1990/91 financial year $6.146 million has been raised by the levy, and based on current projected exports it is expected that a further $1.066 million will be raised during the March-June period, giving an estimated total amount to be raised during the 1990/91 financial year of $7.212 million. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present its Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debate on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1991 and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 was interrupted when matters of public interest were called on last Thursday. At that stage, I had made the point that I welcomed the Government's change of attitude on the so-called luxury tax on higher priced vehicles. The Government has reverted to the old system under which the rate was 20 per cent and then 30 per cent on the retail price of vehicles of $45,000. This is certainly a backdown by the Government on the decision that it made on the run to impose a sales tax of 50 per cent on so-called luxury vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to point out that when this amending legislation becomes law there will still be a differential of 10 per cent in respect of vehicles priced over $45,000 retail. Anything under that will be 20 per cent and anything over will be 30 per cent. So this differential of 10 per cent will still be aimed at the higher priced vehicle which could be considered a luxury vehicle. Unfortunately, once again, this legislation takes in vehicles which, for certain reasons, may be in the heavier class. Heavier vehicles are needed in certain areas-for instance, remote areas-for safety reasons. In other words, I believe that there will be an extra 10 per cent sales tax on safety. </PARA>
<PARA> When one is driving a lighter vehicle around a city, one is limited in most cases to a speed limit of 60 kilometres an hour. If one has an accident with another car or if one hits a tree, one has a much greater chance of surviving than one would have if one had an accident in areas where the speed limit was 110 kilometres an hour, which is the average open road speed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen the results of such accidents. Unfortunately, in only the last 12 months I know of two accidents in which a lighter vehicle has hit a tree, with tragic results. A person driving a heavier land cruiser type of vehicle would have some chance of coming out with his life intact. I believe that where these sorts of vehicles are registered in remote areas, the Government should look at removing this 10 per cent differential, which is to be imposed across the board. I believe that the Government has a long way to go in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a schedule put out by the Australian Taxation Office which relates to vehicles which are totally sales tax exempt. The schedule contains a lot of surprises in terms of the exemptions that are made. The main exempt vehicles are four-wheel drive vehicles with a one tonne carrying capacity used in the agricultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The agricultural industry is the main industry in which such vehicles, if they are used primarily and principally in that industry, are sales tax free. Other categories are the mining industry, ambulances, schools, organisations promoting the interests of schools, organisations promoting competitive sport among students of schools and universities, consular posts, Commonwealth or State government departments, the Reserve Bank of Australia, public transport authorities, local government and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few exceptions that I find peculiar, although that does not mean they should not be included. I wonder whether in these cases there are joint arrangements with other countries. It refers to members of the armed forces of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. I am wondering-and I shall probably ask questions about this in the Committee stage of the Bill-whether we have reciprocal arrangements with those other countries and, if not, why not, and why these arrangements do not apply to the armed forces of, say, other countries that are friendly with Australia? This seems somewhat peculiar. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome a new ruling by the Australian Taxation Office last week. A four-wheel drive vehicle of one-tonne carrying capacity with seating for only two passengers was the norm for exemption of sales tax. Last week's ruling brought into line the dual cab type of four-wheel drive-in other words, vehicles that can carry five passengers as well as a load. That welcome ruling was sales tax ruling 2343. It is a ruling which those in the primary and in mining industries have been trying to get for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one industry missing from this schedule. I wonder why the fishing industry does not have the same exemptions. Fishing is classed as a primary industry and provides great foreign income for Australia, yet it does not seem to be given the same consideration as other primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the removal of the items of sales tax contained in this Bill. The Government has seen the folly of its ways in that it did not raise the $100m to be spent on those black spots on our roads. I understand that the $100m was made up from general budget items somewhere else, such as fuel taxes. The Government committed a great folly, and I suppose we must give the Government credit for seeing the error of its ways and backing down. Hopefully the Government will not make such promises on the run in future, but will think these things out before putting them into effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating two related Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bills which result from the prime ministerial statement of 12 March and from a House of Representatives committee report brought down in 1990. The first of these reduces sales tax on luxury cars from 50 per cent to 30 per cent, and the second allows for quarterly rather than monthly payments of sales tax but with a liability below $50,000. Both measures have the support of the coalition. One rectifies an expensive mistake that was made last year, and the other is a small step in the right direction. At the same time this legislation illustrates the failure of the Hawke Labor Government to reform an illogical and unfair system of indirect taxation and a system that it wishes to misuse and manipulate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The abandonment of the 1990 attempt to levy a new 50 per cent sales tax on cars retailing over $45,000 is nothing less than an admission of abject failure, even though we should not hold our breath for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to say that he got it wrong. The Treasurer gets it wrong more often than not but, of course, we never hear an admission from him. This attempt to raise an additional $105m through a deliberate appeal to the politics of envy and jealousy was the result of not a rational consideration but the desperation of an election campaign in which we saw a government do and say anything to get re-elected. That was not just apropos the last election but certainly all elections that this Hawke Labor Government has fought. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation was also an example of taxation by press release, which we have seen throughout the eight long years of this Government. We do not get announcements made in the right and proper manner. We get them in a press release hidden somewhere for us to find, or we get announcements made in an answer to a dorothy dix question at Question Time. But are announcements made at the right place at the right time when they can quite rightfully get proper debate? No, they are not, and this is yet another example of that. It was an example of the worst possible kind, which could not be justified through the excuse by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that `such a method would be employed only to correct an abuse or deficiency of revenue laws'. Those words, I might add, were his, not mine. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all bad taxation legislation, the market has been distorted and otherwise efficient businesses have been damaged. With bankruptcies at the moment at unprecedented levels right throughout Australia, and particularly in my State of Western Australia, this Government does not seem to care one iota about the damage that its decisions are having not only on the businesses but also on the employees of those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Specialist retailers in luxury cars or more expensive cars were being sent to the wall and larger firms with other operations in Australia were suffering severe losses. But, once again, did the Government care? No, the Government did not; it simply saw that the initiative was not bringing in the tax that it thought it would; so it changed its mind. The mind change did not come about because of the damage that was being done to the industry or to the employment factor or to the number of businesses going broke; it was based purely on income. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that this Bill will cost the Commonwealth $45m in revenue. Had the 50 per cent sales tax remained in place, the total cost to the taxpayer in lost revenue and the consequences of lost jobs would have been far greater. The oldest rule in the book, ignored of course by the Hawke Labor Government for political short term advantage, is that if a tax is increased disproportionately people will alter their purchasing and revenue will fall. That is exactly what happened after the introduction of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is less than 12 months since this Parliament debated the original legislation imposing the 50 per cent rate, and the predictions of the Liberal-National Party coalition have been absolutely and utterly vindicated. We pointed out that this Government was ignoring the warnings of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry and the Motor Traders Association; that, at best, the effect would be revenue neutral as the importation of luxury cars was already declining due to the effects of the recession-or the depression that `we had to have' according to Treasurer Keating-and that a further decline would cause a loss of tariff and sales tax revenue. We also made it clear that the effect of the tax rise applying in practice to imports was a de facto tariff increase that reduced competition in Australian car manufacturing and undermined the purported aim of the Government to fight for tariff reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also significant to note that few members of the Government had the interest or the conviction to speak in support of legislation to honour a cheap election stunt and that the Australian Democrats, while voting for this disastrous Bill, were equally reluctant to argue the principle. But, of course, the Democrats' support for this Bill should surprise none of us because they will support anything that is a tax on envy, a tax on jealousy or a tax on anything that they believe they cannot have. The fact is that, in a lot of cases where people work hard, they should be allowed to do what they wish to do with their rewards without a tax on jealousy and envy. </PARA>
<PARA> One could not be all that critical if the Government acted unilaterally across the board in a fair and equitable way, but it does not do that. For example, we have a situation where, under the current system of taxation, clocks-bedroom clocks that are used by people who are lucky enough these days to have a job-are taxed at 30 per cent, but the tax on antique clocks is nothing. On the list goes-and I will come back to it later-of the many taxes being imposed in a very irrational and illogical way by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the attempt of the Hawke Labor Government to levy a punitive but workable rate of tax on luxury vehicles highlights two massive flaws in the system of wholesale sales tax. The first of these is the potential for manipulation for political theatre, and we have seen plenty of that over the last eight years. Tax rates can be increased to focus envy and at times resentment against the supposed purchasing habits of sections of our society without thought as to the practical consequences. It is the wealthier people in the society who pay more tax, yet this Government will seek irrationally to tax things to the point where, at the end of the day, people are disadvantaged even on the lower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, this sorry episode shows the inherent absurdity of politicians or civil servants trying to define a `luxury' for taxation at a higher rate. In this particular case the luxury tag had nothing at all to do with features on the motor vehicle. It had everything to do with the simple cost of that motor vehicle. It also had nothing to do with what the vehicle was going to be used for; it just had everything to do with envy. This legislation will still attempt to distinguish between luxury cars, now attracting a 30 per cent sales tax, and other vehicles that are taxed at 20 per cent. But the valid question remains that a Range Rover, for example, may be for some an affectation in St Georges Terrace but could represent a very logical investment for a farmer seeking long term value and safety for money. My colleague Senator Panizza has just touched on the very area of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> If the 30 per cent sales tax rate applies to luxuries, what are we to make of its continued application to television sets, radios, cameras and photographic equipment generally and, of course, the old faithful household clock? They are all taxed as luxuries, but we come to a situation where antique clocks are not. We also come to a situation where gold-plated bathroom fittings are not taxed at all but ordinary bathroom fittings, which each and every one of us use, are taxed. The whole thing is absolutely and utterly absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has increased sales tax during its term of office by over 206 per cent. What most people do not understand is how much sales tax they are paying on goods that they go and buy in the supermarket, or anywhere else for that matter. What most people think is that they have simply gone to a store and the shopkeeper has had the audacity to put a price up. In a lot of cases that is not the situation: the shopkeepers have reduced prices and reduced margins and therefore profitability, but what has gone up is the sales tax component. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give some examples. Flavoured milk and fruit juices used to be exempt, but they now attract a 10 per cent tax. Wines and ciders, also once exempt, now attract a 20 per cent tax. All the following items used to be exempt, but now attract a 20 per cent sales tax: low alcohol beer; household disinfectants; oils and lubricants for business; skin lotions and creams; and sun screens. Most people thought it was the manufacturers or shopkeepers who kept putting up the prices, but that was not so. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the taxpayer, in some circumstances, gets hit again because this Government-and I suppose quite rightly-has set about advertising campaigns to encourage people to use sun screens and buy lower alcohol drinks. But, of course, the taxpayer pays for those advertising campaigns. To make the taxpayer pay for them, the Government says, `We will increase the tax on low alcohol beer and we will increase the tax on sun screens from zero to 20 per cent'. We now have a situation in which all those increases have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Since videotapes have become more and more popular, the Government has said, `There is another niche and another opportunity where we can increase tax'. The tax on videotapes has gone from 7 1/2 per cent to 30 per cent under this Government. The tax on compact discs, another popular friend of the young and not so young, has jumped 10 per cent from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> How many people really realise what they are paying on the day-to-day goods? They are paying a 20 per cent sales tax for detergents, toilet paper, toilet soap, toothpaste, shampoo and children's toys. The tax on all those products has just gone up and up. It is not difficult to know and understand why tax under this Government has increased by 206 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we are amongst the highest personally taxed people in the world; we just go on getting taxed more and more. This Government does not give a continental about taxing a kiddie's flavoured milk while keeping caviar and oysters exempt. It thinks that the current system is fair and equitable. I do not know of too many people who would think that that was fair and equitable. More average people in Australia would have an orange juice or a flavoured milk more often than they would a jar of caviar or a dozen oysters. But does the Government exempt the orange juice or flavoured milk? No; it just increases the taxes on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also mentioned a number of items in that little list that may not be strictly necessary to sustain life, but they are certainly goods that are purchased as a matter of course by most ordinary Australians. I am not trying to pick out products that everybody does not buy; I am trying to suggest that what we have in the discrepancy area of taxation at the moment are ordinary items that are purchased day in and day out. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia continues to endure an archaic system of indirect taxation that assumes that a range of household items is to be purchased only by the relatively affluent. That is the best way that I can describe how out of touch this Government is and, quite frankly, how out of touch, sadly, the Democrats are, because they always support additional taxation. </PARA>

<PARA> Once again, we have the politics of envy: people who have the temerity to go out and earn money should be taxed to death and have all incentive removed so that there is nothing remaining for them to spend at their discretion. No, give it all to Big Brother. That is what the Democrats and the Government are all about. The Democrats will reject any little piece of taxation legislation that has attached to it some benefit to some industry because they do not like it. They do not like anyone to be successful; they will put the brakes on any initiative that might see someone get a lucky break. </PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be no logical refuting of the coalition proposal for a goods and services tax. The Government admitted that back in 1984-85. Of course, the difference today is that it has its political master, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), saying, `You must not, and you will not, bring in a goods and services tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> The differences that we are looking at with a goods and services tax are that personal income tax will be reduced and there will not be the tax on exports that we currently endure at the rate of $1.2 billion in direct taxes. The $1.2 billion that is currently spent on taxes for all our exports, which goes to make us uncompetitive and creates additional problems with our balance of payments, will be abolished under our proposals. We will have one level of taxation for goods and services, not this archaic mishmash that we have at the moment. Under our proposal where, until recently, until the introduction of the Bill that we are debating today, there were five levels of taxation- 0, 10, 20, 30 and 50-there will be no such thing; there will be one level. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, Australians will also know when taxation for those goods and services is increased, unlike what Senator McMullan and his colleagues have done in the last eight years by increasing tax by 206 per cent underhandedly. Everyone will know when a goods and services tax is increased. Very few people have known when any tax has been increased under this Government, let alone to the tune of 206 per cent. If the Government can deny that, good luck to it. No-one out there understands what the Government has done; they think it is the shopkeepers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, a goods and services tax will apply even-handedly. It will stop both politicians and the tax system from playing favourites and making archaic value judgments as to our free choice in purchasing what we want and can afford. As I have stated, it is a welcome step to allow businesses with a liability below $50,000 to pay sales tax quarterly. That is a good move. It is a start. It is about time. This, however, is merely a useful administrative reform. It is absolutely amazing-the Government has not made any tough decisions, and this one is just a child's first step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not alter the structure of sales tax which needs 11 separate Acts to govern its rates, and 14 Acts to govern its assessment, collection and administration. This is the Government which said, back in 1983, that it was going to make the tax system more simple and easier to understand. That is the biggest joke of all because, as I have said, we have 11 separate Acts to govern rates and 14 to govern assessment, collection and administration. If that is simple, I will go he. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not alter the fact that, despite some more foreshadowed window-dressing, the Government will continue to collect over $5 billion worth of sales tax from business inputs. If that does not make us uncompetitive, what does? Did the Government make any tough decisions on that in the non-existent industry statement of 12 March? No. There was hope that it might exempt business inputs-as the coalition plans to do-to make this country more competitive, but did the Government do that? No, it ran away from yet another tough decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia has pointed out that 49 per cent of sales tax is paid on the business purchase of intermediate inputs, with a further 14 per cent on the business purchase of investment goods. It does not alter the fact that sales tax costs exporters more than $1 billion-an effective average export tax of 2 per cent, rising to 4 per cent for forestry and wood products. It does not change the situation where compliance costs will continue to weigh heavily on smaller businesses that must bear the burden of collecting a tax, hidden from the consumer but paid, nonetheless. </PARA>
<PARA> Why must the Government continue to hide its grubby little taxes from the consumer? Why not have the courage to put it up front? Why not have the courage to reform in a proper manner? Why not have the courage to reform, full stop? No. It says, `We can't do that because the ACTU won't let us'. The situation will continue with 29 per cent of total sales tax payable on transport and transport equipment, and 24 per cent levied from household and office equipment and furniture. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not much of a level playing field, is it? The Government is great on talking about a level playing field. This is the bumpiest playing field that I have ever seen in my life! Having been in business but a few years ago, having experienced it in a practical sense and having sat in this Parliament for a number of years now, I can say that it is anything but a level playing field. This Government picks winners; it tries to decide who will benefit and who will not and, at the end of the day, we end up in a depression. That is good judgment, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government, while it refuses to acknowledge the self-evident truth that the wholesale sales tax system is irredeemably unfair and distorting, can only tinker with yet another national problem that cries out for the rational solution that the coalition is determined to provide. It is about time that taxation became what the Government said it would become and has never delivered and that is, lower and more simple. We are advocating that. It is a shame, knowing that we are advocating it, that the Government has not taken up Dr Hewson's offer of bipartisan support for a number of tough tax decisions, but has kept on its belligerent downhill slide-which has been engineered by the ACTU-purely and simply because it wants to tax, and tax heavily. </PARA>
<PARA> I encourage the Government to think again, to think hard and to try to come up with a system where we can get back to it being worth people's time to work-for them to get rewarded for effort-and to stop us hearing all of the time people saying, `It is not worth my time to work overtime. I get taxed too heavily and, therefore, I will not work overtime'. We now have a situation where people cannot even get a job to work overtime. The tough decisions need to be made and I cannot see why they cannot be made now. </PARA>

<PARA> There was some indication that perhaps the level at which the quarterly payment entitlement will cut in is too low. My advice is that this change allowing quarterly payments will be available to 82 per cent of sales tax payers as a result of this amendment. The overwhelming majority of people who have to make payments will be entitled to do so quarterly. These payments represent a very small amount of the revenue-only about 5 per cent. I think that is a fair indication that the level which has been struck is pretty well right. It may be that on some future occasion we will look at this issue and say that a bit of fine tuning is needed here, there and elsewhere, but I think that is a pretty fair indication that this matter has been targeted fairly well. </PARA>

They are based on a long term assessment of taxpayers' obligations and the percentage of taxpayers affected. This debate is therefore not helped by snide remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people have indicated that they think that this is a good exemption, that it will assist the small business sector, and they have then supported a goods and services tax. They deliberately mislead, or do not understand-I suspect that they do not understand, because I would not accuse them of bad faith-the bureaucratic implications for small business of the introduction of a goods and services tax. Everywhere that one has been introduced and every way it has been introduced-although it is difficult at this stage to get the details of what is proposed-it has involved substantially increased compliance costs overall, in particular for many small businesses. I will deal with an example in a moment. This point needs to be made and we need to look at the capacity that a goods and services tax might have to make a distinction in favour of small business. I would be interested to see it. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the question of the estimated revenue from sales tax on motor vehicles. Some people have posed that question reasonably; others have indulged in absurd hyperbole about it and have tried to imply that somehow the drop in sales of luxury motor vehicles is in some way a product of the increase in tax. If that were true, as soon as the tax was changed back to its previous level, sales would leap up again to their former level. Nobody who is seriously addressing this question believes that that is likely to take place or that it is even remotely possible. How one determines the likely revenue outcome of any tax change is always a complex question, because we are required to make certain assumptions about people's behaviour in response to those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Some calculations have been based on 1988-89 peak volume sales. I think that that is a highly unlikely basis upon which to make any current estimate or to have assumed that those sales would have continued had there been no tax. Of course, we all know that, in comparable countries, sales of similar vehicles have fallen significantly notwithstanding that there has been no tax change in those countries. So for perfectly understandable reasons to do with the capacity of people who used to buy such cars to continue to do so, sales have fallen. There has been continuing speculation about whether the higher tax regime will continue and that has understandably encouraged people to defer expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The best estimate we can make about the effect of the change in the rate structure-not some sort of figure the Government has plucked out of the air-is based on a continued trend towards a decline in sales for the remainder of this year and some rebound in 1991-92 in response to lower taxation. That is most likely, but nobody can be sure. That is the basis of the estimate and such estimates, as everybody knows, are always difficult to make. As I say, they are based on assumptions about how individuals, groups and companies will respond to the changes in any particular tax, whether it be income tax, sales tax or an excise. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up the time of the Senate by diverting too far into the wholesale sales tax versus goods and services tax debate that was dragged across the trail a few times, but I will make a few comments. Firstly, some people were dragging red herrings and erroneous assertions across the trail. I am not an expert in sales tax-perhaps more than some in this chamber, but not more than most-but, after making inquiries, my understanding and my advice is that, contrary to Senator Knowles's view, all taps are exempt from sales tax and those comments she made are in fact wrong. </PARA>

To deliberately exclude that from the calculation is to deliberately create a false impression.</PARA></TALK.START>

On those goods on which the tax is levied-those which are liable for tax-there is no zero rate. That is a cause of great concern to me. It is why the Australian Family Association has said correctly that a consumption tax is not in the best interests of families and it is why the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission has said that a consumption tax would have no regard to a family's ability to pay. It does cause a lot of Australians who are genuinely concerned about equity issues in Australia to come down, on balance, and say that a goods and services tax is unfair.

I disagree with him on the general question because he makes a value judgment, but he says that, although he supports the goods and services tax, the compliance costs under it would be higher. He is correct: thousands upon thousands of small businesses which do not now have to pay any compliance costs on wholesale sales tax--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. The equity argument is the powerful argument, but Senator Newman asked what the virtues were. The third point is quite simple. Even the Business Council of Australia paper, which advocates a goods and services tax, acknowledges that the staff of the Australian Taxation Office would be increased substantially in order to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is absolutely true. We look forward to the day when the Opposition tells us how it will be done, because that will allow me to deal with one of the points which Senator Watson raised in the debate on this matter. When he was trying to make the point about the problems with the wholesale sales tax as it compares to the goods and services tax, he gave an example of the shoe-shine business. It is impossible, without knowing all of the facts, to go into comparisons of all the details. I will assume, for the moment, that for the transaction in question the taxpayer would have been better off under a goods and services tax. There are some assumptions in that which I cannot test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was not the point of the question. The point of the question was the problem of the multitude of taxes that people in Australia pay at both Federal and State levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Senator Watson was making several points about how hard some States make it for people to set up businesses. Nobody is proposing that we do away with customs duties; they will continue to apply-and I think it is appropriate that they should. The only two Commonwealth taxes we are talking about are the wholesale sales tax and customs duty. It may be that they will decline as we reduce tariffs, but that is another question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even though it is a bit difficult to assess the relative position of that individual until the Opposition tells us what it is going to do about the goods and services tax, the one thing that is obvious is that for that individual to conduct his or her business-I think it was a male-he would have massively increased problems because of the need to impose a consumption tax on the service that he was providing. There will be an increased cost to that business of no small amount, and certainly it is not clear what the implications on the business will be, as the individual has to provide receipts to his customers and has to keep the complex records that are required for the exemptions requirements, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson has managed, as he picks his way through the wholesale sales tax system, to find all of the little anomalies that he can and gloss over the enormous problems that a goods and services tax will create. I am concerned about its impact on the consumers and on inflation. We have had that debate before and I will not conduct it again here. It would be a diversion from the matter before us to have it again, although it would be welcome any time. I am trying to say today that the honourable senator has misunderstood profoundly the adverse impact of it on many small businesses, for whom it will be a burden and a significant problem, and that the compliance costs, as measured in any reasonable way, will be higher for those people, not less. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, I was happy to respond to the divergence of views-which I enjoyed pursuing-raised by Senator Panizza and Senator Knowles, in particular. I did not have time to pursue them comprehensively, but a few comments seemed to be well-placed. We have two worthwhile reforms being introduced, particularly the one about the quarterly payment of wholesale sales tax. Many small businesses will be advantaged by this and 82 per cent of them will be eligible to take advantage of it. I think that is desirable. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, in explaining to those listening to the broadcast that we are actually talking about a repeal of the luxury sales tax, failed to mention that it was a costly blunder that was best forgotten and that at the time the Liberal-National Party coalition stated in this place that it did not believe the increase would raise anywhere near the amount of revenue claimed. We also mentioned that it would have a negative impact on employment and business viability. I thought it was essential to put that on the record to put it in an appropriate balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary diverted to another matter-that is, the virtues of a goods and services tax versus a wholesale sales tax. It was not a question of whether there was all virtue in a goods and services tax and no virtue in a wholesale sales tax, which was implied. The point that the Liberal-National Party coalition makes is that on balance a goods and services tax is certainly superior. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the real reason for my speaking to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1), I would like to acknowledge the work that has been directed to the preparation of the new information-enhanced explanatory memorandum which has accompanied the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). I also thank those who have been concerned with this preparation. The Liberal-National Party coalition now eagerly awaits the next income tax Bill, which we understand will have that new format. I remind the Senate that that format was pioneered by the sales tax section of the Australian Taxation Office. On previous occasions, I praised the administrative performance of the sales tax section of the Australian Taxation Office, and I must use this opportunity to applaud again that section for the explanatory memorandum which is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a question for the Parliamentary Secretary. I remind the Senate that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, stated the following in the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in the rate of sales tax on `luxury' motor vehicles will cost $15 million in 1990-91 and $45 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>This is also in the explanatory notes. I now believe that all honourable senators and certainly others within the industry are uncertain as to which total revenue base this latest reduction in sales tax will be deducted from. We now have a number of revenue bases. I think only the Treasury would know from which revenue base the latest reduction in sales tax will be deducted. In relation to clarifying this position, the question now arises: what are the revised levels of sales for 1991 and 1992? I think we are entitled to this information as well as to information about the financial impact of the decline. </PARA>
<PARA> I pose another question at the same time for the purpose of expediting this debate. Industry representatives have indicated that the tax has already cost the Government $163m and that it could cost up to $400m in a full year. I therefore ask: what was the basis for the calculation of $15m? Everybody apart from the Government believes that the costs will be far greater than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not quite understand Senator Watson's last point in saying that he expects the cost of the reduction to be greater than that. Some people have actually been saying the opposite. They have been saying that the sales fell so much because of the increase that the cut will cost us less because sales will go up again. It is proper to disagree on that point because its conjecture indicates the difficulty in giving a very precise figure. As always, the Treasury has made its best attempt to assess what it expects to be the impact on sales and, with that calculation, to feed into the system what it expects the revenue outcome to be, comparing it with what the revenue outcome would have been had such a change taken place. I do not have before me a bit of paper which explicitly says, `We thought that it was going to be $Xm. It would have been $Xm without the change. It will be $Xm minus $15m with the change and $Xm minus $45m next year because of the change'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have tried in sum to give a quick indication of the basis of the calculation. I do not want to elevate it to too great a level of accuracy because the various factors that are playing on sales relate to the state of the economy, expectations about future changes and the extent to which there has been deferred demand because of conjecture that the rate might fall and this might lead to a surge in sales. We are all speculating, but on the basis of the Treasury assessment of likely sales at the previous rate, likely impact on sales of this rate and the combined effect of the probable change in sales counteracted by the undoubted reduction in the revenue per sale, the equation has pumped out this particular outcome. As I indicated, my advice is that this estimate was based on a continued trend decline in sales for the remainder of 1990-91 and some rebound in sales in 1991-92 in response to the lower taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I acknowledge that there is obviously some degree of conjecture in relation to the $15m cost in 1990-91, but my first question still remains unanswered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the main point is that the change does cost the Government a lot of revenue, whether it is $15m, $20m or $25m. In a sense, I am glad to hear that Senator Watson thinks the cost might indeed be higher because that might move him to reconsider his position. In a full year $45m is a fairly substantial amount of revenue to lose, and if he thinks it could be even higher I think we should think again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are also concerned, as I have said before, that we are likely to put up our adverse trade balance by between $290m and $420m and that we are actually withdrawing sales from our local car industry, which is obviously going to cost us jobs. Seeing that the Government has stated on various occasions that there is a benefit or a cross-subsidy to be gained from the distributors of luxury cars if they are assisted in importing more luxury cars and in increasing their operations, has the Government actually quantified these benefits, bearing in mind, firstly, and in particular, that JRA Limited has announced that it is going to sell its luxury car distribution division and, secondly, that Daimler Benz has gone on record as saying that it expects to develop its business on the basis of the export facilitation program and therefore, by implication, not on any benefits that it might derive from a larger turnover in luxury cars?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Should such a calculation have been made-and I think it is highly unlikely-I will try to get it for Senator Spindler. I do not imagine that there is much point in artificially trying to quantify that. But let me make a couple of responses to his points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Spindler" NAMEID="0X4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator Spindler</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But what was your reason?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me to be implicit in what Senator Spindler says, in his assertion about the jobs and import costs of this change, that there is an assumption of what people would do with their money if they could not buy the car that they were otherwise going to or decided not to buy it because of the tax advantages. It does not seem to me to follow necessarily at all-and this is the indication from anecdotal information-that they will otherwise buy Australian cars or that they will not spend the cash that they were otherwise going to use for a car on other luxury imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other side of the balance of payments equation, that to which Senator Spindler just alluded inferentially, is that the operations of many vehicle importers, which are likely to continue and to be enhanced as a result of the increased capacity they gain from the increased sales of vehicles likely to flow from this measure will, amongst other things, increase their exports of automotive components, the sort of export facilitation to which he just made reference. </PARA>
<PARA> So the net balance of payments effect is going to be quite different from that which the honourable senator outlined. It is not immediately possible to give an answer. We could speculate upon what the net balance of payments effect is going to be. The honourable member could guess; I could guess. I am simply saying to him that it is not a simple equation that implies, first, that if people do not buy luxury cars this year they will automatically spend that money buying Australian cars. That is not what the evidence indicates. Nor is it a straight equation which says that if we allow more imports of these vehicles, the net cost to the balance of payments is going to be anything like the figure to which the honourable senator refers. </PARA>
<PARA> We can have an interesting debate about the likely arithmetic. Such a debate really does not go to the committee stage debate on the clauses of the Bill. However, I want to take the opportunity to pursue a point that Senator Watson quite rightly raised. I was going to deal with it in regard to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) but I am equally happy to do so now. I refer to the explanatory memorandum process in respect of sales tax. We discussed this the last time that sales tax measures were introduced. I think it substantially enhances the quality of parliamentary debate to have the quality of the explanatory material so improved. This is an example which I hope will be followed not just by the income tax section of the Tax Office but by all departments. The fairly radical notion was put to me that an explanatory memorandum is being used actually to explain something. I think that is an idea that ought to be continued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his attempted rebuttal, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) has quite clearly separated the issue of tax on luxury cars and the volume of luxury cars that are to be imported and any possible benefits that could arise from that.

In response to the challenge that he put to the Liberal-National Party coalition, we will certainly not be changing our mind. We were against the tax in the first place. Having spent about 12 months trying to tell the Government about the fallacy of this tax in terms of the impact that it would have upon revenue, the industry and employment, we are pleased that the message has finally hit home and that the Government has decided to review the higher rate of luxury sales tax. Naturally, the Opposition will continue to support the decision that we have taken today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put a couple of questions to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan).

But I am not too worried about what term he uses-I am more interested in what the Government has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like the Minister at the table to explain the definition of a luxury car. I prefer to call such cars safer cars. While the Minister has his advisers with him, I would also like to ask him a question in respect of the schedule of vehicles exempt from sales tax, to which I referred a little earlier. In particular, I refer to exempt vehicles purchased by members of the armed forces of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. First, I would like to know whether a reciprocal arrangement is in force with those countries. Secondly, can the Minister give me any reasons why other friendly countries are not given the same consideration?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that the criterion for determining the countries on that list is those with which we have reciprocal arrangements. Apparently, not all countries with which one would expect us to have that sort of friendly relationship have the sort of sales tax base that is appropriate for that sort of reciprocal agreement to operate. As I said, the countries on the list are those with which we have reciprocal arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Panizza wanted a definition. I do not intend to start a whole new debate about that. But the legislation is fairly clear. I do not apologise for using the term. I think the common English meaning of `luxury' will suffice.

<PARA> In spite of anything in an Act amended by this Act, a person cannot be a quarterly remitter in relation to a sales tax quarter earlier than the sales tax quarter commencing on 1 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>It is necessary to draw the distinction between monthly remitters and quarterly remitters in those two subclauses. Is there an inconsistency between clauses 2 and 4 in the operative date?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had to check to make sure that in my simple reading I was not missing something. As far as I can tell-and this does not seem to me to be a problem-so long as the Bill receives royal assent before 31 July, the situation is absolutely clear. I suspect that even if it receives royal assent after 31 July, clause 4 would still apply. But it would be a less desirable situation. I think in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is not a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just remind the Minister that the legislation says that the Act commences on the date it receives royal assent. But if it receives royal assent next week the Bill will not really operate by virtue of clause 4 and I think, to that extent, there is an inconsistency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to ask another question. What is the reason for the different quarterly dates in respect of sales tax remitters and pay as you earn group remitters, particularly those who have a remittance of less than $10,000? Is there a special reason for a difference in the quarterly ending date?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told that these dates have been chosen as those likely to be the most convenient for small business in terms of sales tax obligations and the flow of sales. Therefore, they were considered-I am not sure after how much consultation with the small business section-to be the most convenient dates. Nobody from small business has raised with me at this stage the fact that they would have preferred coordination. If we were to seek that, whether it would be most appropriate to change this Bill or the income tax provisions is a question for subsequent consideration if it arises. There may be some advantage in not having to make all the calculations at the same time. At the moment it is six of one and half a dozen of the other.

If I may seek to enhance the earlier debate, perhaps the Minister might be aware that the sale value under sales tax refers both to the wholesale value and to the retail value under certain types of sales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on these two Bills, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill, gives the Senate a further opportunity to consider the Government's policies for Australian education. Those policies, I lament to the Senate, have caused disruption, confusion and uncertainty and have earned much criticism, not only from the Opposition but also from the public at large, especially from those in an informed position in education institutions and our universities, in our colleges and among students. I referred to these matters at some length on 12 March when the Senate debated the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill. I take up similar themes again in this debate because they are still relevant and are still not getting an adequate response from this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills themselves do not in their specific provisions arouse great contention. They provide for the supplementation of Federal funding to higher education and to technical and further education (TAFE) in accordance with supplementation formulae. They are Bills that we regularly deal with at this time each year. The problem with them is not this particular supplementation, not the formulas, not the dollar amounts, but rather the whole financial and educational policy of this Labor Government which has generated the Bills and which is responsible for the failures in higher education and TAFE that we see. </PARA>
<PARA> A few other specific changes are made to higher education funding, such as the adjustments being made in Queensland by the removal of certain art and design courses from TAFE to higher education. One aspect that is not fully explained in the Minister's speech or in the explanatory memorandum is the reference to funding for the special overseas postgraduate fund. This is now to be spread over several years so that there can be a properly structured program. I ask the Minister at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), to provide some information about this and an explanation of what this means-whether there was not previously a properly structured program and when the program will be fully decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA> The wrong directions of this Government's higher education policies have been repeatedly made evident in the experience of our higher education institutions and in the public statements of people representative of those institutions and various faculties in direct criticism of the Government's record. In the light of this continuing evidence of the Government's failure, I move the Opposition's second reading amendment to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add `, but the Senate deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education, and, in particular, it deplores the Government's failure to provide the sector with the flexibility and incentives it needs to address the academic staff shortage, and to provide for adequate opportunities to meet the diverse educational needs of students'. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is restrained, it is brief, and pinpoints those matters that the Opposition has been directly concerned about in higher education. I expect that the Senate will be persuaded by the contributions to be made by a number of speakers on this side in this debate to adopt this amendment and so to bring home a message to the Australian Government on the need not to remain with its present record of failure. This is a cognate debate and we are also considering the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. Later in my speech I will move on behalf of the Opposition a second reading amendment to that Bill. Similarly, I expect that to be persuasive in the Senate and to gain a clear majority of support. We will come to that in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to all senators that the hallmark of the Dawkins approach has been to maximise governmental and bureaucratic influence in educational decision-making. We see this in the backroom pressures involved in the requirements for educational profiles, the burdens that these place on institutional administrations, and the intrusiveness into decisions that should be left to the institutions themselves to determine without this centralist Government's interference. All those accusations are real and we have been pointing them out before the White Paper that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) brought down. We regard it as centralist, as making for Government pressure in the backroom on institutions to comply with the Government's goals and determinations, and we object to it.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that in the past three or four years in particular-and into the future-there should have been in Australia more autonomy in our higher education institutions without this centralist intrusion, interference, from Canberra. We see the Dawkins approach in the destruction of the previous system of independent advice to government. Here I am referring to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission (CTEC), which this Government abolished. It had an outstanding record of giving advice on behalf of higher education throughout Australia not only to this present Labor Government but also to the preceding Liberal Government. In its place, Mr Dawkins has arranged things so that there is a National Board of Employment, Education and Training, which has nothing like the independence that CTEC had. </PARA>
<PARA> So whilst we have this record of failure, these continuing complaints being made about the conduct of higher education in the country, we do not have a sufficiently strong, independent body of advice coming from those statutory boards and councils that this Government has set up very much to work along with the government of the day. There is not enough independence in reporting to government about its conduct in higher education. In fact, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training is too close to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the councils. There are four of them, which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would know well. There is the Higher Education Council, the Schools Council, the Employment and Skills Formation Council which, amongst other things, deals with TAFE and the Australian Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Those five bodies-the Board and the four councils-are all too close to the Department; they are dependent upon the Department's resources and they have become tame cats. It would appear that the Minister intended them to be tame cats. When have any of those bodies taken any public stand on any issue where they feel this Government is failing? We get a few suggestions at the margin. I am not saying something here which I have not said already to either the National Board or to the councils. I actually see enormous qualifications and experience being brought by individual members, in most cases to the Board and to the councils. That is not the quarrel. </PARA>
<PARA> The quarrel that the Opposition has is with the structure that makes them too easily the tame cats of the Government and, similarly, the failure to give them adequate resources to carry out the task of being advisory bodies. So they depend upon the Minister and the Department. They have to get resources and information as determined by the Department-and it is very convenient for this centralist Minister, Mr Dawkins, and his assistant Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be a complete review of these matters. Independent advice on higher education and the other areas of education, employment and training is needed not only for its own sake but also so that the public sees it as such. The public, especially those involved in these education areas, should have full confidence that the advisory mechanisms are cognisant of the arguments that they would want to put, of the pleas that they would want to put. It should be ensured that the arguments are put as publicly as possible so that the public can trace what the Government does in response to them. At the moment all of that is too hidden. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the public is very likely to fall into the trap of feeling obliged to follow the agenda that the Government desires. We see the Dawkins approach in the way that institutions have been forced into all sorts of amalgamations, which have not been pursued by those involved for reasons of any education or merit. These institutions have been forced to respond to the financial imperatives of the Federal Government. `If you don't amalgamate, you won't get the same amount of money' is the sort of backroom pressure that this Government has made its distinguishing characteristic. I reject this kind of centralist approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and effort have been wasted even by those institutions not ultimately amalgamating. Institutions have had to spend a lot of time facing up to the shotgun at their head of this centralist Minister. They have to think it through, consult and explore whether the amalgamation is on. Even though many of the amalgamation proposals being forced by the Government have been eventually evaded, it has taken a lot of time and this country should have avoided this kind of distraction from education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's amalgamations agenda has been a disgrace. We just want to see the end of it, and we have been saying something like this for at least two years. Yet even when in this Senate chamber we saw an end to the legislation that was supposed to amalgamate the Australian National University (ANU) and the Canberra College of Advanced Education here in the national capital, we have found over recent months, particularly while the Senate was not sitting in the summer, another proposal being put by one of these tame cats, the Higher Education Council, to this Government to amalgamate the undergraduate part of the ANU with the Canberra College of Advanced Education.</PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition do not support that; the Australian Democrats do not support it. That was publicly known and yet the Government still persists. Professor Chubb, the particular appointee of Mr Dawkins to carry out an inquiry towards this end, came up with a report. It was as if he had not existed or had not known about the parliamentary debate for the past couple of years. He still proposed recommendations to amalgamate the two universities in this city despite all that had been said in the Parliament and despite all the expressed views of the ANU and even of the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> Many in those institutions in recent months have rightly said, `This Dawkins pressure that Chubb has given in to in recommending further amalgamation will destroy the ANU'. They say that it will-they use the word `destroy'-rip apart the school of general studies from the research institute at that university. The ANU is one of the most valuable higher education institutions that we have. Last Wednesday, in the `Higher Education' supplement published by the Australian, academics and students at the ANU-indeed, even the university council-were reported as totally opposing this agenda of destruction upon which the Labor Government still seems to be set. The headline is, `ANU scathing on Baldwin's latest proposal'. Professor Kurt Lambeck, who is the Rector of the university's Research School of Earth Scientists, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The past few years have been a time of turmoil and uncertainty. The university, or parts thereof, has been the subject of seemingly endless reviews. </PARA>
<PARA> The university has been requested to respond to government or government-initiated inquiries into all aspects of teaching and research. Initiated all too often by bureaucrats and politicians who appear to have little understanding of how a university functions, the reviews and reports are requested with great urgency and detail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is not complaining about accountability. As a Minister of the Government, Senator Cook is only too aware that the number of reviews that have disturbed this university has been excessive. Even when this Senate, of which Senator Cook is a part, has ruled out the merger of the ANU with the Canberra University one sees his colleagues Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin persisting with yet another attempt to find some amalgamation. That has hit the dust and is history again-for the second, third or fourth time. Yet there does appear to be justice in these criticisms of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The criticisms are not being made of the Opposition; the criticisms are being made about the Government. That is what the article is referring to when it condemns bureaucrats and politicians. A change of government is way overdue. We need the Opposition's approach to higher education to dismiss this record of failure, this record of intrusion and this record of ignorant interference by politicians and bureaucrats-to quote what these academics have been saying, even as recently as a few days ago in the higher education supplement. Reference is made to this being an attempt by bureaucrats to be tidy; that is, to overcome some sort of innate call within a bureaucracy to get things ordered as they see fit for administrative reasons. I quote again from Professor Lambeck's remarks:</PARA>
<PARA> Better to stamp out this creativeness before it spreads to other areas. After all, if we're not careful, this approach could spread to the government departments themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Also this past week at a graduation ceremony, the ANU's Professor of Economics, Professor Ross Garnaut, warned about `meagre and mediocre minds'. He is talking about those elements of Senator Cook's Government and his Government's bureaucracy that are interfering in the administration of the Australian National University. Professor Garnaut is a former adviser to the Prime Minister on economic matters and a person whom both Senator Cook and I respect. I am not quoting some isolated person we have just heard of; this is a person who carried out the Garnaut inquiry into Australia's economic relations with East Asia, our major trading centre. I endorse the Garnaut report. I value the insight, the experience and the views that are expressed by Professor Garnaut, and he is the one that is referring to meagre and mediocre minds. He wonders whether they are even capable of understanding a great university like the ANU. He is reported in the same supplement as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> A few days ago a Commonwealth minister said that `it is important that we develop a positive vision of the ANU'. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Meagre and mediocre minds are as incapable of seeing the reality of a great centre of scholarship, as of sharing the vision of whence it grew. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The minister will come, I trust, to recognise the value in the established vision-lest his monument to Australian education and research be the destruction of a great institution, great and with capacity for further improvement yet, unique, and irreplaceable. </PARA>
<PARA>These are not light words. They are cries from the hearts and the minds of experienced people about what this Government is doing. I reject what this Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition calls for a refreshing change completely away from the Dawkins agenda and completely away from the record of this Labor Government over recent years. I myself am convinced that this will come about only through a change of government. I remind the Senate of Mr Dawkins's words back on 15 June 1989 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . this Government has explicitly stated that it will support only mergers which have the support of the institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>Can we still believe that that Minister has any credibility? What hollowness. It is a hollow claim that has turned out to ruin the credibility of the Minister now when we consider the financial pressure that is being placed on institutions to conform to this Government's centralist thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider a current disgraceful example endangering the future of the Australian National University. I refer not only to the Chubb recommendations but also to the fact that there has not been sufficient consultation on a more respectable review, that which was carried out into the Research Institute at the ANU, in which a number of constructive findings were found. But let me put a very clear complaint, along with those I have put to the Senate in recent weeks, about this Government's conduct with regard to reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the Senate there was only one paper tabled. It is entitled Response to the Review of the Institute of Advanced Studies: Report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. This report has been printed just recently but it is actually a letter of 14 January-three months ago. It is four pages of report from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training dated 14 January over the hand of the Chair, Dr Ramsey, to the Minister, Mr Peter Baldwin. We see it three months later, despite the fact that there is a conclusion at the end of Dr Ramsey's report, of which I remind the Minister, that this report needs:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now three months later. I will not trespass upon a private conversation I had with the Minister, Mr Baldwin, just last Thursday night, but he said, `You are perhaps not aware, Baden, that the Government is not going to fully implement all that has been found in the Chubb report or in the Stephen report'-that the ANU in its Council's instructions and its appeal to stop the destruction is not aware that the Government is not going to go all the way down that agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we know unless we are given reports? I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) very sincerely: why was this report not tabled at the beginning of February? It is only four pages long. What is the great problem in running that off on anyone's photocopying machine? It is symptomatic of the lack of information to this Parliament that when there is a hot debate running about what is to happen at the ANU, whether it is over the Chubb report or the Stephen report, we get such a piece of information from this tame cat, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, three months after it has been given to the Minister. This is why we had an amendment before this chamber, which was passed by the Senate, to reduce the reporting period of 15 days to five days. We did not persist with our amendment when the House of Representatives tossed it back to us because we knew that the Government was going to get around it administratively anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record of informing the Parliament about higher education matters is deplorable. When I have a private conversation with the Minister, I welcome what he has to say to me in good faith, but I do not know the basis of his assumptions in that conversation because the Government, through its Ministers, has not brought information to the Parliament. This week we have these directly critical articles in the higher education supplement, in the publications of the Australian National University and so on. It is in the best interests of this Government to inform the Parliament what it is doing and what reports it has. </PARA>
<PARA> I was going to quote a very critical statement made by Professor McKinnon, the Vice-Chancellor of Wollongong, speaking as Chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC), when he decried the fact that the standards of and access that students have to higher education in Australia at the moment have gone down, have not improved and are worse under the Labor Government. It is right that he, as the Chairman of the AVCC, brings that clearly to people's attention. However, my time has gone so I cannot directly quote from the statements that he made, for instance, as reported in the Advertiser on 20 March, similarly in the Age and in various other newspapers in relation to the AVCC meeting in my city of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go quickly to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. As I said earlier, we are debating cognately two Bills. On behalf of the Opposition, with regard to the TAFE Bill, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the motion, add ``, but the Senate deplores the Government's:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) failure to consider adequately the role of TAFE in its reform of the higher education sector;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) failure to take adequate steps to encourage the development of an open and flexible training market; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) neglect of the warning of the Training Costs Review Committee that training must not become excessively burdened with the rigidities of the industrial relations system''.</PARA>
<PARA>In turning to the Opposition amendment and indeed to the inadequacies of this Government in the TAFE sector, we again find a situation where, under this Government, rigid and burdensome factors are being allowed to hinder the potential of this sector to contribute to the nation's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Deveson report which was published last October. The thrust of the report was to urge open and flexible training markets. I am sure that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, is very interested and wants to respond positively to the Deveson report because there is very much in it that is positive. In fact, it shows the inadequacies of the way in which TAFE has been administered from Canberra in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> There do need to be changes and I want to urge them on the Government. It is in the direction of the Opposition amendment to make for more flexibility and for openness. I just have time to quote this sentence from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Existing training arrangements comprise an unclear mixture of market and non-market driven activities. With market related activities growing rapidly and intruding into erstwhile non-market activities, the committee believes that clarification of the appropriate role of market processes in the overall training industry is urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude and cut short my speech by saying that the Government's record on TAFE and higher education is inadequate. It is a track record of failure. Whilst the only ultimate solution will be a change of government, I urge the Government to pay full attention to what the Parliament is saying and to bring about the changes that will improve both higher education and TAFE. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sorts of concerns that have been expressed by Senator Teague during his speech are concerns which he is not alone in expressing. As he mentioned in his speech, recently there have been some quite public debates in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), especially with regard to higher education. Whilst on the surface these debates relate to the future of the Australian National University, the University of Canberra and the John Curtin School of Medical Research, they are providing a catalyst for many academics, institutional staff and tertiary students to question and publicly express their concerns about the direction of this Government's education policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It could be argued that some of the debate that has taken place so far in the ACT has been based, to some degree, on speculation. I agree with Senator Teague that some of that speculation may well have been reduced if the Government had presented its response to the document he referred to in his speech in a much more timely fashion. The Government's record in relation to information about higher education matters is deplorable. I suggest that could well be because it is embarrassed about the information which is now coming forth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 that we are considering at the moment provide cost supplementation for the 1991 grants to the technical and further education (TAFE) and higher education sectors. In most respects these Bills concern fairly straightforward matters of financial administration. As well as allowing for inflation, they include the transfer of art and design courses in Queensland from the TAFE sector to higher education institutions. This apparently suits the trend in terms of course development and conformity; that is not to be debated by me here. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the Bills there are also provisions to spread out the payments over the years instead of providing a one-off amount under the special overseas postgraduate fund. This money that is the subject of this movement is a windfall from the equity and merit scholarship program due to chronic underexpenditure in that program. Perhaps it could at a later date be appropriate to ask questions about that underexpenditure. But, importantly, we should observe that, the essential factors in funding-the methods and levels of support for our tertiary institutions-are grossly inefficient, inadequate and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General, in Audit Report No. 4 1990-91 on the Department of Employment, Education and Training, notes that cost supplementation indices have not been reviewed since 1984. That audit isolated a number of procedural and systems defects and abuses. It was noted that recurrent funding was neither in accordance with the established conditions nor in accordance with legislative requirements. Some payments were found to be not documented and not authorised. Other documents had been lost and prescribed actions had not been taken, especially, for instance, with regard to the acquittal of grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning in particular to higher education, those sorts of criticisms that I have just enumerated from the Auditor-General's report are not the only criticisms which should be directed to the system as it is now. The higher education sector is plagued by multiple crises in funding, overcrowding, shortages of academic staff and huge levels of unmet demand from qualified students. This phrase, `unmet demand', is one which has gained some currency in the media recently. It was suggested to me only at the weekend that the demand was caused by other factors. All sorts of suggestions were made about students not wanting to participate in the other sorts of activities that might be undertaken in the community. The fact is that these are qualified students who could and should be able to take advantage of the excellent schooling that they have had and the efforts that they have put in to reach the standard of being eligible for university entrance. But in demanding that entrance to higher education, their demand has been unable to be met because of the lack of foresight in this Government's education plans. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other major problems have been well documented, almost daily, in our national newspapers. We see evidence of over enrolment in higher education that has reached historically high records, with some institutions over enrolled of the order of 15 per cent. To be particular, the unmet demand was over 20,000 last year and, according to the early estimates that we have now, it could be as much as 30,000 for 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> An acute national shortage of academics of somewhere between 20,000, according to the report of Dr Blandy and the National institute for Labour Studies, and 25,000, according to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, will come to pass by the end of the decade. That can be measured at the moment, and we see no evidence that the Government's plans will bring about a change in that trend which has been identified by those two different sources.</PARA>
<PARA> Criticisms can be made, and we have examined the Opposition's plans to meet these criticisms. The Democrats cannot honestly support the Opposition's plans in their entirety either-which is not surprising, but is part of the way things are. The idea to charge fees for students after places have been filled, we think, is no solution to the many problems in this sector-the problems that have been caused by government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move on to TAFE funding and what the Government has in mind there. I suggest that it is not a strong cooperative network of various educational and training opportunities, but an extension of compulsory tertiary fees to ensure that TAFE courses are no longer affordable as the only post-secondary education available to generations of bright, interested Australian students. We have seen what happened with the introduction of TAFE fees in New South Wales in 1988 which, it has now been estimated, has been responsible for a decline of 100,000 students over two years. Instead of creating a climate of cooperation where we can build a more intelligent and equitable Australia, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who oversees this master plan, wants to see a situation where TAFE is competing with private companies for funding. What we really see is that this Minister's topsy-turvy education policies are, in fact, mean, discriminatory and illogical. </PARA>
<PARA> The record in this whole area of education is smeared with disgrace. We have the Dawkins rhetoric about institutional autonomy under a uniform national system, and we know that that is a fraud. It is now broadly realised that Mr Dawkins has increasingly interfered with institutions and extended the scope for much greater government control. Institutional autonomy may be the rhetoric, but what is delivered is, as Senator Teague described, a centralist approach which is called one thing and, in fact, turns out to be something else. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the many severe critics of the Minister's plans comes from a growing lobby of educators, community groups and citizens who have been cast by the Minister's Green Paper as the guardian angels of national policy on languages. I think the Minister should be advised that more than one of these people find it hard to endorse the policies that are described in the Green Paper. One senior lecturer at La Trobe University, Helen Moore, in a paper which was issued in January 1991 entitled, `Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages: An Australian Perspective', considers policy changes in relevant sectors. In paragraph 2.4 on page 30 Ms Moore describes policy developments in higher education and states:</PARA>
<PARA>In many of the Minister's policy documents and pronouncements, not just the Green Paper, he has shown himself to be a master of malign displacements. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to higher education, he has claimed that current reforms are motivated by a belief in institutional autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, this rhetoric is being used to establish closer control of both intellectual and organisational life in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the development of education under the overseas student policy as an export industry, Ms Moore is even more scathing. She states:</PARA>
<PARA>If for nothing else, he-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins-</PARA>
<PARA>should be sacked as the Minister responsible for this wicked fiasco, marked by the inefficiency and stupidity of his own Department, scandalous fraud within the private sector which his Department supposedly monitors, the coercion and debasement of teachers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and young people forced to maintain themselves at best by working for wages that bear no relation to award standards and at worst involved in prostitution and presumably drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Of particular relevance to the Dawkins approach to education as an economic resource, is this paper's review of the argument that our understanding of the university is changing. On page 44 Ms Moore summarises as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The essence of postmodernist thought is a critique of the notions of truth, moral values and the unity of knowledge. We are now more comfortable with the assumption of multiple truths, each as good as the other. </PARA>
<PARA>She continues on page 45 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The reality now is that, with the loss of acceptance of knowledge and truth as uncontested meanings, the basis for the state's toleration of the university's autonomy has also disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the consequence of this loss of autonomy is that university programs and research are competing against other claims for resources, and even competing for their very existence. </PARA>
<PARA> The pursuit of truth is no longer the privilege of universities. Helen Moore concludes that under the Dawkins model, `in fact, purse strings and power are the only truth'. That is evident in the sorts of plans that Senator Teague referred to with regard to the Australian National University. That is the very reason why we should question those plans. There has been little evidence given to us by people who have participated in the debate that the guiding factor in making those plans has been the desire to see academic improvement. In fact, we would be forgiven for thinking that the only factor has been something to do with the rationalisation of expenditure. As such, we would find it very hard to endorse those plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that education should be supported as a lifelong opportunity for all, and that further education should benefit not only the individual but also our society as a whole. The danger of accepting the Government's view and, indeed, the Opposition's view, that education is a cost is one of which we should be very wary. We see evidence that on the scale of priorities education, health and welfare do not fare well under the policies of the major parties. </PARA>
<PARA> This patch-up Bill may provide a short term answer to some of the problems in education, and for that reason we will not be opposing it, but, in the long term, the malaise in education will not be ameliorated in any way by this Bill. So although we will allow the passage of the Bill, we take the opportunity to be most critical of the policies of which it is a part. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time that we have had to consider the several amendments that will be moved by the Opposition, we have been tempted to support them. We would be particularly tempted if the amendment to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 had included a certain word. For Senator Teague's benefit, we would have appreciated it if the amendment had read, `deplores the Government's failure to provide the sector with the finances, the flexibility and the incentives it needs to address the academic staff shortage.' If the amendment had included the words, `the finances', we would have been even more tempted to support it. Rather than guarantee support of that amendment and the other amendments at this moment, we will listen to the debate with interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 cognately. Those Bills will provide increased funding for higher education institutions totalling $171m over the period 1991-1993. These supplementation costs will amount to an additional $54m in 1991, $58m in 1992 and $59m in 1993. The Opposition will not be opposing either of these amendment Bills, but we do oppose very strenuously the efforts of the Hawke Government to destroy what was once considered a very fine higher education system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government interference with and intervention into higher education has had catastrophic results. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. We have lost essential flexibility and incentives to maintain our internationally competitive higher education system with world-class standards. Competition in the education marketplace has given way to competition for bureaucratic favours. Our institutions have been bullied, bludgeoned and blackmailed into forced amalgamations or new institutional arrangements by the threat of withholding capital grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I have come to this place from the higher education sector and I have observed from the inside the chaos that is created by the heavy-handed interference of this Hawke Labor Government. Students who enrolled at the Newcastle College of Advanced Education in 1987 went on to spend the second and third years of study at the Hunter Institute of Higher Education in 1988 and 1989 and then finally graduated from the University of Newcastle after 1990. In other words, students had to pass through three major organisational changes during one course of study. I leave to the imagination of honourable senators the disruption and chaos that this caused as staff were constantly distracted from their proper work of teaching and research to cope with the massive problems created by administrative change. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was on sabbatical leave in the United States (US) four years ago, a professor told me that the changes in higher education that Australia had been subject to over a period of 20 years had occurred in the US over 90 years. He said this before the so-called Dawkins revolution. We have had extraordinary change on top of rapid change and the staff in the universities have been brought almost to breaking point. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the most recent change, we have another bureaucratic impost-the education profile. I will remind honourable senators what education profiles are. These are mechanisms which are designed to balance the freedom of institutions to manage their own affairs with the need of public accountability. They represent agreements which are negotiated annually between the Commonwealth and higher education institutions. They define the institution's broad mission together with its teaching and research responsibilities. They also establish the institution's particular area of activity and specific goals as the basis on which to receive Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of the education profile process have been deplorable. The Government now has considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs. The education profile process opens the way for extensive government intrusion into matters where governments should keep out. There are already complaints from institutions that the Commonwealth Government imposes excessive and unnecessary demands on institutions for information and that the Government is unnecessarily intrusive in their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week Professor Lambeck told graduands at the Australian National University (ANU) that the University had been requested to respond to government inquiries into all aspects of teaching and research. The Government appears to have little understanding of how a university functions when these reviews and reports are requested with great urgency and detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) reflects his socialist passion for control. The name `unified national system' says it all. It sounds like a program out of the old eastern Europe with its command economy. While eastern Europe was moving towards greater deregulation and freedom, flexibility and competition, Minister Dawkins was forcing Australia in higher education into the Dark Ages of regulation and inflexibility, a command system for our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> The former president of Romania would have been very proud of our Mr Dawkins's command system. The results of this national unified system are only too apparent in the universities of the nation. Five years ago, we had the so-called Dawkins revolution. Let us have a look at the effects it has had over the last five years. It has affected student numbers. This year about 20,000 qualified students were turned away from higher education institutions, thus blocking their opportunity to achieve their potential and stunting our growth as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Staff morale is at an all time low and workloads continue to rise. I should know because I have been subject to them over the last 10 years. We have been told of one staff member conducting a tutorial designed for 20 students but having more than double that number packed into a room to hold a maximum of 15 people. In the humanities and social science departments, the real crunch will come when reports and essays flood in for marking and staff attempt to cope with additional assignment work. I know what that involves. In one course I was conducting four years ago, I had about 30 assignments to mark; that went up to 45 and last year I had 70 assignments to mark on a regular basis, coming in about once a month. Those assignments were in only one of the courses that I was teaching. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, we have staff shortages in universities and these are approaching crisis proportions. By the year 2000, it is projected that there will be an academic staff shortage of 25,000. Stories of student overcrowding in lecture halls appear in the newspapers almost every day. In last Tuesday's Sydney Morning Herald, Professor Richard Blandy of Flinders University stated:</PARA>
<PARA> You've got 300 in the class in front of you, you lose eye contact at row six, there's a video camera pointing at you, there are . . . students in the first three of four rows with recorders . . . Here you are, having to meet their needs in economics one. You're wired for sound, there are 150 out in the overflow room watching on the big screen. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I know I'm a terrific teacher and I just bleed inside. I look in the eyes of those bright-eyed bushy-tailed kids and I know I'm trying, they're trying and together we'll fail . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet there is little chance of attracting academic staff from overseas, given the low level of salary inducement. The centralised wages system is a major impediment to alleviating the situation. The system currently involves long and tortuous negotiations. Academics have become so frustrated that last year they took the unprecedented step of refusing to process examination results. This created, at the end of last year, administrative chaos but it was an act of desperation which arose out of a slip in their standard of living. Since 1974, the standard of living and the value of salaries of academics has dropped 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest wage offer which is supposed to help redress this is little more than a joke. A professor telephoned me last week to tell me that under the latest offer his new take-home pay will be $5 more a week; for tutors it will be even less. We desperately need the kind of deregulation in the academic staff market that will permit flexibility and competition in order to attract and retain outstanding staff in Australia. If market forces are not allowed to have any influence on setting the salaries of academics, people in high demand by industry-for example, people in computing and accountancy-will leave the universities and this will further reduce the standard of teaching and research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Blandy report has indicated that there will be substantial requirements for additional staff over the next decade. But how does the Government plan to attract high-quality staff when salaries are so low and working conditions are deteriorating so rapidly? Our staff shortages will have the long term effect of reducing recruitment standards, together with declining teaching and research standards as staff-student ratios are allowed to increase beyond their already unsatisfactory levels. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been my experience in higher education that these levels have been rising for 10 years. This is not surprising when Ministers display their complete lack of understanding of the nature of university work. Recently, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, claimed that academics need not hold a higher degree. What a peculiar claim. If all academics are expected to carry out research and to teach others to take part in this process they need to have a higher degree; this is their professional qualification. It is the only means by which they acquire competence in their subject which, in turn, gives them the authority and the knowledge to teach others in a university. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the worst aspect of this Government's heavy-handed interventionist command approach to higher education is in the area of forced amalgamations. I remind the Senate that only two years ago the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has explicitly stated that it will support only mergers which have the support of the institutions concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>But what has actually happened? There have been continued threats to the Australian National University, to take one example of a proposed forced merger. The Chubb report recommended that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the faculties of the ANU and that the faculties, in turn, be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. The ANU, its staff and its councils have totally rejected these recommendations. They claim that it would not be in the interests of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), nor would it be in the interests of Australia. They further claim that the ACT would lose a major educational asset if the ANU were split, and it would be a long time, if ever, before university education in the ACT again achieved the status that it has currently through the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA> However, for these recommendations to be put in place appropriate legislation will have to be put before the Federal Parliament. If such legislation were to be introduced while the ANU and the ACT opposed the split, the amalgamation would be a clear and unambiguous violation of the commitment of the Minister to support only those mergers which had the support of the institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of my own institution, the University of Newcastle was forced to amalgamate with the Hunter Institute of Higher Education. Both institutions resisted this merger for eight years. Neither side wanted it, but in the end they were forced into it by a relentless government-the same government that claimed to support only those mergers which had the support of the institutions. The obstacles to the amalgamation were gargantuan. The institutions had different administrative systems; everything had to be redesigned. This is an example of economic efficiency: a totally new telephone system had to be installed because the two telephone systems were different and totally incompatible. </PARA>
<PARA> The missions of the university and the institute were quite different. The institute was originally vocationally oriented and the university focused not only on some vocation but also on liberal education. Following on from the differences in mission, the institute staff were paid to be involved in lecturing only whereas the university staff were expected to be lecturers and researchers. As a result, the staffing of the two institutions was quite different. In order to fit into the university mission, staff of the institute had to change dramatically: from being employed only as lecturers they had to change their work functions and many had to upgrade their qualifications in order to perform essential research functions in a university. They also had to undertake a different style of lecturing. We are now moving to a system which involves larger lecture groups and less individual guidance for students who are trying to learn complex subject matter. This is hardly the way to create the clever country-particularly if students have difficulty understanding the subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with higher education is that much of the effort which has gone into the amalgamation of institutions has to do with administrative, not educational, objectives. But even there the Government's policy has failed. Higher education institutions have lost the capacity to respond flexibly because of new inappropriate internal structures and excessive government regulation. Only two weeks ago Leonie Kramer said that we cannot produce a flexible work force in this country by creating a higher education system where the Federal Government is dominant. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you want flexibility, you have to encourage diversity and independence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government's national unified system is not the answer. Therefore, it will be up to us, the Opposition, to maintain a vigorous debate on higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> I will indicate, very briefly, to the Senate that the Opposition policy on higher education is quite different from the direction in which we have been travelling for the last five years. Our approach is to move towards a more competitive system with less government regulation, better access to private funding and a more open system of public accountability. Earlier, the Minister said that all of these heavy-handed controls were for the purpose of accountability. There are other ways to achieve this without totally stultifying the institution. </PARA>
<PARA> We will restore autonomy to higher education institutions. We will allow them greater freedom to chart their own futures without the conformist constraints that are presently upon them. We will provide incentives for institutions to improve their performance without government intervention. We will stimulate healthy competition amongst institutions which will promote excellence of achievement among students and staff. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that higher education is of utmost importance in this country. Australia is a modern industrial nation with the potential of developing into a leading technologically-advanced society. Our future prosperity will depend upon our willingness to push back the frontiers of knowledge and to exploit new alternatives. Our prosperity and the quality of our lives will depend greatly on our capacity to provide our youth with an excellent education which is not just training in specific skills. Higher education in Australia is at the crossroads. It should contribute to our economic development, but it should also contribute to our cultural enrichment. Each institution must have sufficient freedom to determine its own directions and goals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. The first Bill will provide a cost supplementation for funding for States, Territories and higher education institutions, and the second Bill will change some existing grants to the States for technical and further education as a result of the transfer of certain courses from the TAFE sector to other parts of the higher education sector in Queensland. Neither of the Bills, as is indicated by what I have said, is very contentious. They provide for an additional $171m to be allocated to the tertiary sector to be spread over three years which, given the total amount needed in the area, is not particularly large at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose these Bills but, regrettably, it is necessary to speak on the Bills-even at some length-lest it be thought that in not doing so we were in fact supporting the Government's policy in the area of higher education. I think this is the time for us to review it. </PARA>
<PARA> The failures of this Government are: increasing interference and interventionist policies; the policy of forced amalgamations; to make inroads into the level of unmet demand; reduced funding per student; staff salaries declining by up to one-third, relative to weekly earnings, since 1974; to provide tertiary institutions with freedom and flexibility to address this impending shortage of academic staff; neglect of the fundamental issue of equality in education; and disruption and continuing insecurity in these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this has an impact on the students who are attempting to benefit from tertiary education in this country. I wish to go through this in a little more detail. First, I refer to the increasing interference and interventionist policies of the Government in higher education. The whole higher education system is being brought under increasing and direct political control by the Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), and this has led inevitably to an undermining of institutional autonomy. This is illustrated by the whole concept of a unified system and the intrusive educational profiles process which continues to be an administrative nightmare and is totally related to undue central control. Mr Frank Hambly, the Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said on 28 September 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the reality is that there is scope for much more government control over higher education than there was in the past. For example, through the educational profile process the Government has considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>There is little doubt that the Federal Minister is attempting to achieve a uniform system of tertiary education and not just a unified system. The whole policy is more about central control of education than national standards, more about bureaucratic control under the Minister's direction than the benefit to students who are studying in our institutions. In August 1989 Professor Peter Karmel argued that the Dawkins reforms meant that the Federal Government was intervening more in tertiary institutions and warned that the bureaucratic tendency to coordinate, which is a euphemism for control, must be watched closely. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I mention is the policy of the forced amalgamations since 1988. Amalgamations have produced some sort of cult that big is better. Some of the amalgamations made sense; others did not. Senator Tierney has just referred to the one that he was involved in with the University of Newcastle. Regardless of whether the proposed amalgamations were appropriate or wanted, higher education institutions have been bullied by the threat of withholding capital grants into forced amalgamations and new institutional arrangements, in spite of the Minister's comment that no institution would be forced to amalgamate if it did not wish to do so. At no time during the debate on amalgamations in 1988 or since have I heard the Australian Labor Party express amalgamations in terms of benefits to students. How often have we in this place asked the Government to explain the benefits to students? All of us might have taken a quite different approach to amalgamation had it been expressed in terms of benefits to students. They seem to be the least of the Minister's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry restructuring under increasing central control has failed to introduce flexibility and incentives to allow higher education in Australia to maintain and extend an internationally competitive higher education system. Failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand is perhaps one of the most significant points. The Government has demonstrated a total inability to provide tertiary places for those Australians who desperately want to further their studies. There have been quite dramatic increases in the retention rates of students continuing to year 12 in our secondary schools, and that is particularly the case in the Australian Capital Territory. This Government is very inclined to boast about the increasing numbers completing year 12. It is frequently heard that the Government is very proud of the fact; but what is the point in this if it then cannot offer students the opportunity to pursue their education to university or into the technical and further education area? The TAFE populations are expanding and there is an unprecedented demand for university places. However, having been encouraged to go that far, having been encouraged to recognise that education beyond secondary level is of benefit, many students are now disillusioned at finding that they are unable not just to get into the courses they wanted but to get into a university or a TAFE college. This, of course, causes real problems. I believe that it causes social problems as well in that those who have been built up to believe that they would be able to achieve something, to pursue a course, suddenly find that, having gone to year 12, they are virtually thrown onto the scrap heap and invited to take up unemployment benefits. It is a failure adequately to fund opportunities for an increasing number of people who want to take them. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear about the clever country. It is clear that the numbers able to obtain employment in manufacturing are dropping. It is only in this area that this country has a future. At the same time that the Government has reduced the opportunity for those who are qualified to take up places in tertiary institutions, we find that there is reduced funding per student. In 1990, 75,000 more students than in 1983 passed through the system-a positive achievement. However, they received 12 per cent less funding per full time student. This fact was dramatically illustrated by Jon Coroneos, the President of the Australian National University (ANU) Students Association, when on 22 March 1990 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The federal Government has in many ways been the principal cause of the malaise currently sweeping through universities. The education policy of the Government is to increase tertiary student numbers without any increase in funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The funding levels are worth noting. In 1985 funding per student was $11,500, in 1990 funding per student was $8,700, and in 1992 funding per student is planned to be $8,200. I do not need to point out that the value of money has not been going in the same direction. In fact, the amount per student being lost is quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of that brings me to my fifth point-staff salaries. While available funds are being cut back, it is inevitable that the value of salaries of staff will decline. It is a fact that in many of the institutions we still have very dedicated members of staff who, notwithstanding the loss of earnings as a result of the Government's policies, have stayed in the institutions and are very committed to education. But that will not be the case for ever. If this continues, the time will come when it is impossible to attract into our tertiary institutions people with the necessary qualifications to be good teachers. They just will not want to be there; they will want to go where they can earn a reasonable living. </PARA>
<PARA> Staff salaries have declined by up to one-third relative to the average weekly earnings since 1974. At the same time, staff workloads have increased, promotional opportunities have been reduced and research funding is more difficult to obtain. Unless there are significant and positive changes in staff conditions, it is estimated, reliably and reasonably, that there will be massive staff shortages. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, staff morale remains at an all-time low: salaries falling relative to average weekly earnings, staff shortages increasing, more and more students wanting to get into institutions, and little likelihood that academic staff will be attracted to this country from overseas. Where will the tertiary institutions get their staff from in five or 10 years time? I hope that when it happens the Senate will remember that we have pointed it out now. The present Commonwealth-controlled rationing system does not allow the flexibility to attract and retain outstanding staff. </PARA>
<PARA> To use one example, I refer to the salaries in the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University. In 1974 a professor of law received a salary which was the same as that for a district court judge. Currently, a professor at the ANU in the Faculty of Law receives a salary which is one-half of the value of a district court judge. That is how far the salary levels have gotten out of kilter since 1974, and that is what we are doing to our students: failing to pay lecturers and professors at a rate which will attract good people into the institutions. As I said, luckily we still have many good staff members who are prepared to stay in the institutions because they are committed to what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> A legal secretary these days with no tertiary qualifications will be paid as much as a lecturer in law at a university. The Government might think it is saving money by doing that, but it is certainly destroying the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to raise is the failure to provide institutions with the freedom and flexibility that they need to address the impending shortage of academic staff to which I have referred. It has been suggested that there will be a shortage of up to 25,000 staff by the year 2000. Higher education in Australia under this Government is financially bound to the Commonwealth Government. It operates within a rigid framework of regulation-the profile funding mechanism with threats of withdrawal of funds if people do not do what the Minister wants-which has restricted and frustrated the capacity of tertiary institutions to compete for staff, students and resources. The Government has failed to give institutions the flexibility to offer Australian students additional places on terms acceptable to both. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the quality of education? Senator Aulich, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, has acknowledged that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, is so absorbed in financial and structural change that he has neglected the really fundamental issue of quality in tertiary education. What a condemnation of any education Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Uniformity does not automatically produce quality in tertiary education; in fact, without competition between institutions for top staff, students, courses, et cetera, there is a risk of complacency and mediocrity rather than a striving for excellence. The Blandy report from the National Institute of Labour Studies argues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the inevitable long-term effects (of current staff shortages) include reduction in recruitment standards together with declining teaching and research standards as staff-student ratios are allowed to increase beyond optimal levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in the report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training entitled Higher Education: The Challenges Ahead, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is relationship between the level of funding of higher education and its quality. The closer the funding base is to the margin, the more difficult it is for the system to be able to deliver the quality. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government may well boast a 50 per cent increase in tertiary enrolments since Labor came into government, but funding has not kept pace with this. Funding has declined by 11 per cent, and that means that students are not getting the same education. As a proportion of our gross domestic product, Commonwealth expenditure on higher education was 1.05 per cent in 1980-81 and by 1989-90 it was 0.85 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this leads to disruption and continuing insecurity in institutions. The Government's policies have caused a chronic and crippling uncertainty. As the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), said in the other place on 13 March 1991, an enormous disaffection exists within the higher education sector towards the Government and its disruptive and damaging policies. That of course affects teaching in institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these factors can be illustrated by what has happened to the Australian National University. I go back over the story. In July 1988 the proposal was to amalgamate the Australian National University with the then Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE). It was put forward as part of the Dawkins's plan for higher education. It was evident that the Minister was more concerned with administrative neatness and control than with increasing educational standards. On 12 August 1989, Mr Dawkins said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question in my mind that the amalgamation would result in a university more appropriate to the emerging shape of the unified national system of higher education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>But what about the educational advantages? There was not a word of that. It was all to do with being more appropriate to the emerging shape of the unified national system of higher education in Australia, no matter what happened to the ANU and the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And no matter what happened to the students, as Senator Teague just said. Even in August 1989, at that relatively early stage in this ongoing and disruptive saga, the Minister is quoted in a press article as being sympathetic to the concerns raised by the university and the CCAE about the damage that would be done to its academic programs if there were to be continuing, drawn out uncertainty about their future status and mission. It is now April 1991 and the uncertainty continues to this time, even though the Minister said that no institutions would be forced to amalgamate if they did not wish to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In September 1989 the proposed amalgamation of the ANU, CCAE and the Canberra Institute of the Arts was called off after the ANU Council voted against the merger. The following was reported in the Canberra Times on 13 September 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>There will definitely be no amalgamation between the ANU and the CCAE, according to the Minister for Education, John Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA>No sooner did CCAE change its name to the University of Canberra than the proposed amalgamation was back on again. I believe-and Senator McMullan can correct me if I am wrong-that at that time he too called for an end to the speculation on the future of Canberra's tertiary institutions, recognising that it was time that they be allowed to get on with the jobs they were supposed to be doing. That was in September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, that was not to be the end of the saga. On 3 January 1990, the Minister announced the appointment and terms of reference of a committee which was to review the Institute of Advanced Studies of the ANU. Its report is known as the Stephen report. Page 1 of that report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that the Institute continues to have an important role to play as a major Australian centre of research and of research training at the highest level and that it can best perform these roles as a constituent part of the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened after that, one can only speculate about, but the next thing we knew Professor Ian Chubb, Chairman of the Higher Education Council, was asked to prepare a report on the implementation of the Stephen report. I really cannot explain what happened, but there is no relationship whatsoever between the recommendations of the Chubb report and what was recommended in the Stephen report. It seems to me to be much more likely that what is recorded in the Chubb report is what the Minister was aiming to do in the first place-that is, amalgamate the institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not talked to Mr Dawkins or Professor Chubb, though the outcomes seem to be putting into effect precisely what Minister Dawkins had in mind in 1988. The implementation of the recommendations of the Chubb report would have meant the disintegration of the Australian National University and the loss to Australia of its international and national reputation. That would be a tragedy for education in this country. It certainly would be a tragedy for Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that this community has to offer is that it is a place of excellence in education. There is a whole range of institutions and courses in Canberra, such as the national baccalaureate course at Narrabundah College. A number of places offer courses that people come to Canberra to undertake. At the top of the tree is the Australian National University. To destroy that would undermine the total benefits for this Territory of the educational institutions that have been built up over a period. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Chubb report, the debates about amalgamation, merger, takeover or whatever one might see it as, started all over again, continuing the uncertainty that exists in both institutions as to what their future really holds and where they are going. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1991, following an overwhelming rejection of the split of the institutions and the proposals of the Chubb report, the Minister announced that the recommendations would not be implemented. However, that was not the end of it. The Minister stated his intention to continue to push for a merger between the ANU and the University of Canberra and decided to separate the John Curtin School of Medical Research from the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU. There just seems to be no end to the Minister's desire to destroy that institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody is suggesting that there is not room for change, that there is not room for working more closely together. I believe that that is happening. But the Minister seems to have at heart this hell-bent desire to destroy what has been achieved. It is interesting that on 15 June 1989 the Minister stated that only mergers would go ahead that were supported by the institutions. But in Canberra we have suffered for three years from this instability. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Des Nicholls, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Commerce at the ANU, summed up what has happened to the ANU. In an article reported in the Canberra Times on 13 March 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the instability into which Australian tertiary education has been cast; the continued threats to the ANU as an institution; a real reduction in academic salaries and the lack of flexibility of appointments and salaries within the ANU itself. </PARA>
<PARA>This illustrates the insensitivity and the destructive power of the Dawkins's approach and, ultimately, the irresponsibility of the Government's handling of higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, we are discussing two Bills which relate to funding and administration of higher education and institutes of technical and further education. But I could not let the opportunity pass without referring to these important matters which have arisen from Government policy over recent years. I could also mention the attack of the Minister on the Bond University, which he described as an abject failure. He seems to be totally negative about anything. I also refer to the uncertainty which exists, particularly in the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the Government adopts different policies, until it adopts the policies which we have espoused, there will be no opportunity for more places and better quality education in our tertiary institutions. As Professor McNicol, the Vice-Chancellor of Sydney University, said in the University of Sydney News:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the present system is so manifestly unable to provide the funds needed to satisfy people's expectations of higher education that other alternatives must be urgently canvassed . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make some brief general remarks to bring us back to the purposes of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. As is appropriate on a very important issue such as tertiary education, this has been a somewhat wide-ranging debate. The Bills before us deal with increased funding and supplementation-increased funding for tertiary education under the Higher Education Funding Act and supplementation under the TAFE funding Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills, while not controversial-and this is what speakers have been saying-do give honourable senators the opportunity to range widely over the important issue of the nature of the future funding and size of our tertiary education institutions and the importance that that has for a country that must increasingly give attention to the education and training of its work force. In this instance, I am talking not just of conventional education and training to do with higher education but on-the-job training, important issues to do with TAFE and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> If this is to be the clever country, if we are to maximise the economic return from the human resources available to Australia, we have to continue to maximise the attention and the consideration given to education issues broadly and, for the purposes of this debate, higher education issues. I welcome the fact that there has been such an interested and wide-ranging debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give a specific response to matters that were mentioned by Senator Reid, given their domestic concern to me. I also want to give a more detailed response to some questions which I understand Senator Teague raised. I am sorry that I was not in the chamber to hear his speech but I have a detailed response which I will read into the record. I hope that that will be of assistance to him. I will make only a brief response to the amendment which is, in fact, just a continuation of the ongoing debate about tertiary education. Although the points raised are not new, I want to refer to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid raised questions about the Australian National University (ANU), the University of Canberra and higher education in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to talk about it. I was about to say that I was quite happy to say publicly that I did not agree with the Chubb report. I do not think we ought to reflect-and Senator Reid did not-on the integrity of Professor Chubb. I think he went about his work responsibly. But he came to a conclusion with which I disagreed. I am pleased that his recommendation has not been adopted and I expressed that view publicly. This is very unusual. I do not usually make public comments on matters that are under consideration within the Government. I think the most appropriate thing for someone in a position like me to do is to make comments inside the Government. But I thought this matter was of such local significance and my views were sufficiently strong that I should make that comment publicly. I had previously made it to Professor Chubb, so he would not have been surprised in the slightest. I am disappointed that he came to that conclusion. I think his views about the Institute of Advanced Studies were wrong and I am pleased that the Minister did not proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the release of the Chubb report I have had the opportunity to have discussions with the Minister, with representatives of the ANU and particularly with people from the Institute of Advanced Studies. I hope that the discussions which took place before the ANU Council-and those which will be precipitated by the decisions of the ANU Council-will lead to a more efficient and a more effective higher education sector in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> While I think it is important that the Institute of Advanced Studies continues as a separate research institution within and attached to the ANU, it is also important that we get the coordination of higher education here, particularly between the ANU and the University of Canberra and, to the extent that it is possible, the Australian Defence Force Academy. I think that is a desirable reform and we ought to continue to press for that enhanced coordination. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the higher education institutions in the ACT need the opportunity to get on with educating students. They should not have to spend so much time talking about how we are going to organise the institutions to do that.

The initial proposal with regard to Professor Chubb was to try and look at the integration of the Stephen report with other matters. I do not want to speak too much about the Chubb report and other matters because we do not have the time to do so. But if the institutions would stop coming to the Government complaining about each other, the administration of higher education in this Territory would be much better done. I have told the parties concerned. Any Minister for education would say that he spends more of his time than objectively can be justified having to deal with squabbles between the ANU and the University of Canberra, given their place in the overall scheme of higher education. Both of those institutions and their administrations are subject to some criticism in that regard. I would not normally say that, but I have said it to them privately and I do not need to be embarrassed about saying it publicly. Let us get on with the education function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to respond to Senator Teague's request for more information on the amendments regarding the special overseas postgraduate fund. In 1989, the Government determined new arrangements for the funding of overseas students. Under these arrangements, the subsidised overseas students program is phased out. Newly commencing overseas students are required to pay full tuition fees from 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government allocated additional funding to the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau to fund scholarships to assist overseas students to study in Australia. This additional funding was designed to maintain the Commonwealth financial commitment through the aid budget for overseas students to study in Australia. I think that has led to a more accurate definition of the nature of the assistance that is being provided. It is being more appropriately recorded. This is a reform that is generally supported. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1990-91 Budget, the Government reviewed the implementation of the new arrangements and took a decision to establish a special overseas postgraduate fund to finance scholarships to assist overseas students to undertake postgraduate study in Australia. The amount was legislated in the 1990 Budget session as a total amount for expenditure in 1991 pending detailed discussions on the establishment of the program. The Department has now had an opportunity to undertake discussions with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee to develop a detailed program which will be spread over a number of years for the management of the fund. The proposed amendment gives effect to the cash flow required for the program. I hope that information assists Senator Teague. If there is anything I can get subsequently, if he will let me know I will try to arrange it for him. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up a great deal of the time of the Senate with amendments. Second reading amendments-I do not intend to minimise them-tend to be re-statements of public positions. Senator Teague and I have been debating higher education in previous motions in this place, and more particularly and importantly Ministers representing the Minister for Education over the years have debated this issue with Opposition representatives, including Senator Teague and the front bench people responsible. It is important that we do not ignore the fact that some of the problems in higher education at the moment are problems of growth. We might wish that they were being dealt with differently or whatever, but many are problems emerging from a significant increase in the number of tertiary education places-if my memory serves me correctly, a program for some 70,000 extra places over the period to 1993. That is a very important increase. If people then want to say that we should have handled the increase differently or that we should have managed such and such in a different way, those questions are worthy of debate and have been debated here on many occasions in the past. We get all sorts of arguments about the way in which these things are handled. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to respond to only one of them, that to which Senator Bell referred, not particularly in relation to the amendment but in the second reading debate as a whole. He referred to perceived shortcomings in the financial administration of the higher education program on which the Auditor-General reported to Parliament. It is important not to minimise that criticism, but to point out that they were based on the 1988 program year. Those criticisms have been addressed by the Department, and my advice is that the more recent audits of the program undertaken by the Audit Office have established that there are no longer those serious problems relating to the financial administration of the program. I think I can say that the Auditor-General was right to raise the matter, and probably has done his duty in enhancing financial administration in the public sector, but it is not a reflection on the existing situation. For those reasons I indicate that the Government will be opposing the second reading amendments. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the last day of sitting I mentioned that 23 March 1991 was an important day for democracy in Queensland. It was also a very important day for democracy throughout Australia in that it could well be the last major election where citizens have the right of free speech in this country; that is, the right to lobby and the right to put their point of view in the media in the way they believe most effective-not just effective in getting their message across but cost-effective. That could well have been the last time that form of election at the local government level will take place in Queensland, because if the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has its way it will ban free speech in this country and prevent the people of this nation from being able to advertise and to get their message across in the most effective way that they know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government should not be allowed to tell people how and how not they can get their message across. The Government should not be able to tell people that they can exercise their right of free speech only in certain ways. The banning of political advertising, even if it is only a minor infringement on a person's free speech, is a terrible shame, a terrible step for this nation to take with regard to democracy. Senator Bolkus would have us understand-so he says in support of his proposals to ban free speech, to ban political advertising-that television advertising is only for the rich, that it is very costly and that people cannot exercise their free speech now because the costs simply prohibit all but the very wealthy from doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus uses misleading figures-as does the ALP generally with its advertising-in an attempt to confuse the public of Australia, to put fear into the public of Australia and to mislead the public of Australia. For example, Senator Bolkus would have us believe that all television advertising would cost $13,000 per minute, and that is what he said in this chamber recently. He uses this cost to justify the ban he proposes to make on free speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you probably do not need me to tell you this because you come from Queensland and you know about the Brisbane City Council campaign, but the ALP in that campaign advertised for about 90 minutes on the television. If we multiply 90 minutes by $13,000 per minute, which Senator Bolkus says it costs, we find that the ALP spent over $1m to win the Brisbane City Council campaign. That is incredible in anyone's language. I am sure that the ALP in Queensland did not spend over $1m to win the Brisbane City Council election because, quite frankly, it never expected to win it anyhow and it would not throw that sort of money around. Even as wealthy as the Queensland ALP is, it would not spend that much money on a campaign to win the Brisbane City Council election. </PARA>
<PARA> What is even more incredible, if one uses Senator Bolkus's figures, is that in Townsville certain ALP candidates for the City Council also had a total of 80 to 90 minutes on television. No-one can suggest to me that the ALP spent $1m on winning the Townsville City Council campaign. It is absolutely ridiculous. But those are the sorts of figures that the ALP, Senator Bolkus and his other minions would have us believe in an attempt to get support around Australia for the ban on free speech which he is trying to impose. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the real situation with television advertising is that in my city of Townsville one can get 30 seconds on Tonight Live with Steve Vizard-not a show I watch but one which many people do. Mr Vizard was this year's Gold Logie winner and one can get 30 seconds of advertising on his show for $25-not $25,000 as Senator Bolkus would have us believe. So if a person wants to run an advertisement on Townsville television in prime time for a minute it will cost $50, not $13,000 as Senator Bolkus would say. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that prices are different with different television stations, and certainly at prime time in Sydney one may well pay a lot more. But to run around as Senator Bolkus does and have us believe that all political advertising is that expensive is ridiculous, and it puts the lie to the argument that the ALP has been proposing. Mr Deputy President, can you imagine that any little group should be prevented from putting their message across at election time?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a little conservation group on Magnetic Island called Island Voice. It advertised in the last Townsville City Council election. The sort of legislation that the ALP and this Government want to bring in would prevent that conservation group and hundreds or thousands of other groups throughout the nation from having their say in the way electoral campaigns are run. </PARA>
<PARA> History is full of governments that have attempted to restrict freedom of speech, and history is also full of the dictatorships that have followed the restriction of those liberties. This restriction, one would say, is only a small one but that is what used to be said in the other totalitarian regimes. It is only a little restriction now, but it is the first step. It should never be allowed to happen in our nation. There should never be any permission for any restriction of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Bolkus and the ALP wanted to do something to clean up political advertising, wanted to do something sensible and genuine, he would have got his Party to instil a little honesty into its election advertising-never mind about the electronic media, but in any media at all. What gives the ALP the right to use the sort of dishonest advertising that it has used very effectively in the campaigns in the local government elections in Queensland? I just show the Senate an advertisement that appeared in the Townsville Bulletin just before the election. Headed, `What services would the Liberals cut?', it suggested a number of things that the Liberal Party, if successful in the Townsville City Council campaign, would cut. It asked whether Liberal Party members would cut the 85 per cent pensioner rate rebate, whether they would cut the extension to bikeways, and whether they would cut the program to shoulder seal all Townsville streets. That is what the advertisement suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement is completely dishonest because the Liberal Party policy in that campaign, as the ALP well knew, promised to retain all those services. But that did not stop the ALP, with its dishonest and misleading advertising, from running that sort of campaign. If the ALP wants to clean up political advertising, that is where it should start, not by banning free speech and political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do we not have a code of conduct in election advertising that prevents that sort of misleading statement? If that sort of statement were made about a product or service-something in the commercial world-the Trade Practices Commission would be down on the responsible company like a ton of bricks; it would be sued, fined and made to pay damages for that sort of misadvertising and misstatement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did not vote against it. I am glad that Senator Lees is here. I am not quite sure what the Australian Democrats' policy is; it changes every five minutes. I understand that she has been told by the lefties and greenies who control her Party that she has to vote for us, which is pleasing. That is what we need. I hope that, when the crunch comes, the Australian Democrats will realise that it is that sort of advertising that should be banned and not electronic advertising. I take it from her nodding that she will support that and allow electronic advertising on the radio and television to proceed completely and freely. I am very pleased to see that and I congratulate her for taking that line. Let us just hope when the votes come that she continues that consent. I look forward to the day when the Democrats will have that fire and that strength of backbone to support us on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ALP proposal to ban free speech on television and radio but to allow it in other areas is equally ridiculous. I suggest that that will not ensure honesty in advertising and it will not ensure that the ALP will not get up to its dishonest tricks. I will show how the ALP cheats and lies in its direct mail advertising, which would still be legal under the ALP proposal. Have a look at this letter, Mr Deputy President. You can see that it is printed in Liberal blue colours. Anyone in the Townsville electorate receiving that letter would see the Liberal blue colours and think that it was from the Liberal Party. Of course the ALP is not mentioned anywhere. I admit that Alderman Mooney, the mayor, is mentioned, but many people would not know that he was the mayor and that he was from the ALP. Nowhere in that letter is there any indication that it comes from an ALP candidate. It is printed in Liberal blue with not one word mentioning the ALP. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last two Federal elections were pretty much the same, as Senator Knowles said. The ALP is on the nose so it even pinches our colours in an attempt to give some credibility to its campaign. Mr Deputy President, if you think that is bad, I will take you back to the Brisbane mayoral campaign. In that respect I will quickly read a passage from each of three letters. The first letter from the ALP candidate for the Gabba says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Only Labor is committed to stopping the proposed bridges into West End and Highgate Hill/Dutton Park, which would have a devastating impact on our community.</PARA>
<PARA>In one ward along the Brisbane River, the ALP is going to stop this bridge. Lo and behold, we get one from the Alderman for Doboy. He says in his direct mail letter:</PARA>
<PARA>So do not expect any better treatment from the Liberals when they consider the ill-conceived cross-river Bridge proposal for Hawthorne/Bulimba.</PARA>
<PARA>That is 10 miles downstream. So we have two bridges across the Brisbane River being proposed by the Liberals. Then the ALP candidate for Fairfield says:</PARA>
<PARA>And now they are planning to put A BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER to St Lucia. That will bring even more traffic into the suburb.</PARA>
<PARA>So we now have the ALP telling us that the Liberals are proposing to build three bridges. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones can follow me. Not once did the Liberals ever say anything about bridges across the river, but this sort of dishonest, direct mail advertising would lead one to believe that that was the proposal. That is dishonesty in its greatest degree. And the Labor Party wants to talk about banning free speech. If we had free speech, those sort of claims would be corrected. If they are sneaked through as direct mail in the last days of the campaign, the other parties have no chance of refuting them. If those claims were made on television, a response could be made within a couple of hours. Within a couple of hours people would know that there was no way in the world that the Liberals would have proposed three bridges. I have only three letters, but I will bet that there were others that would have had the Liberals proposing 10 bridges all the way down the river. That is dishonesty in its greatest degree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other examples, but time will not allow me to go into those. The ALP says that it is too expensive to advertise on television so it will ban it, but it will not ban advertising in the media or by way of direct mail. As a result there is a proliferation of that sort of claptrap and blatant dishonesty in this field. There is no way of correcting that just before an election if that is done a day or two before the poll. That is why it is essential that we retain the right of free speech, the right to say at all times what the real policies are and to refute the sorts of lies that our political opponents are very good at putting across. I just hope that the Democrats listen to that, understand it and, when it comes to the vote, they do not again crawl over with the Government, come to some compromise and sell their souls in some way that allows the ALP to ban free speech. I hope that that salutary lesson will be accepted by the Democrats and that they will join us to defeat the Government's proposals to ban electronic advertising so that 23 March 1991 will not become the last election day on which there was free speech in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are all very indebted to Senator Macdonald this evening for bringing to our attention some of the outrageous direct mail letters which the Australian Labor Party (ALP) used in the recent Brisbane mayoral campaign. It is not surprising for those of us who went through the last Federal election campaign to learn from Senator Macdonald that the ALP has played fairly loose and fast with the truth in relation to its direct mail letters. Probably millions of letters were posted out into marginal electorates in the last election campaign claiming, quite untruthfully, that the Liberal Party of Australia was about to abolish Medicare. Of course that was not the case, but it was designed to be part of the campaign of the big lie-the scare campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comments by Senator Macdonald have underlined just how important ethics are in politics. The subject of ethics is a big matter of public debate at the moment. The greatest protection that we have is that people act in an ethical and proper manner. I suspect that it will be very hard for any law in the land to stop the filing of these direct mail letters which contain gross untruths. Therefore, Senator Macdonald has underlined in a very important way that one of the best counters to these types of letters, that unfortunately the ALP has made a practice of sending off, is for the party that feels aggrieved to respond on television. For example, the leader of the Liberal Party in the last Federal election had to go on television and make the point time and time and again that the Liberal Party was not about to abolish Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I think that effectively underlines the fact that it is important for political parties to have that right-that access to television and radio-to be able, among other things, to correct the misleading statements which have so often marked direct mail campaigns in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak briefly tonight about ethics and public policy. I want to draw the Senate's attention to what can only be described as an extraordinary statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the other place last Tuesday. When speaking to the condolence motion on the death of Sir John Kerr, he made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party makes the political heroes in this country. When people cross the Labor Party they wear the crosses it puts on them, whether it be Billy Hughes or Joe Lyons-that is the truth of it. Sir John Kerr has worn the admonition of the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That statement was made by Mr Keating in the other place last week. I do not think that the first part of that statement, that the Labor Party makes the political heroes in this country, is correct. I do not think it was the Labor Party that made Deakin a hero; I do not think it was the Labor Party that made Sir Robert Menzies a hero; I do not think it was the Labor Party that made Reid, Parkes, Wentworth and so forth heroes. I think there are, indeed, many examples-tens of examples-where our political leaders who have earned the great respect of the public of the day, and that, after all, is the important test, have become political heroes, not because of the activities of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Macdonald for drawing our attention to another extraordinary Labor Party figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to draw the Senate's attention to the latter part of Mr Keating's statement that `when people cross the Labor Party they wear the crosses it puts on them, whether it be Billy Hughes or Joe Lyons-that is the truth of it'. It has to be pointed out that Lyons and Hughes were two of our longest serving Prime Ministers. Our ALP colleagues may not be aware that Lyons and Hughes won more election victories out of the Labor Party than within it. </PARA>
<PARA> It also has to be mentioned that there are three Governors-General in Australian history who are sometimes noted for their close associations with the Labor Party: Sir William McKell, Sir John Kerr and Bill Hayden. For those ALP members who forget the McKell era, and think that the treatment of Sir John Kerr was unique in Australian history, let me remind the Senate that Sir William McKell was sent to Coventry by ALP members because he agreed to a double dissolution proposed by Menzies. Both of those Governors-General were punished in a vindictive way because they took decisions in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> My second observation is to suggest that the type of threat we heard from Paul Keating, I regret to say, is more typical of a mafia-type organisation than a major political party. Honourable senators should remember that `when people cross the Labor Party they wear the crosses it puts on them, whether it be Billy Hughes or Joe Lyons-that is the truth of it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to canvass very briefly the significance of Mr Keating's statement and what it may mean to the independence of our institutions and the functioning of our democracy. The Treasurer is not a man to make ill considered statements. We may disagree with the content of what he says, and the arguments he puts forward, but Paul Keating does not make statements without knowing their full import. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Keating does not make statements without considering their full import. Mr Keating is aware that the Labor Party is in a period of acute stress. The pressures on the Labor Party are coming from all directions-we have royal commissions in three States; we have a period of major public policy failure in relation to the Hawke Government, and the current recession which its policies have plunged us into; we have unbelievable levels of incompetence from Labor governments in the States of South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia; and, finally, we have pressures on the Labor Party resulting from the fact that the current Labor leadership has dropped many of the key principles which have guided and energised the Labor Party faithful for most of its history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result, we are seeing the collapse of voter support for the Labor Party; a haemorrhaging of Labor Party membership; bitter policy disputes between factions; and an increasingly divided and disloyal Cabinet. This is the context in which Mr Keating made his statement that when people cross the Labor Party they wear the crosses it puts on them. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my next point. It is no secret that this Government has made a practice, unmatched by any other government in Australian history, of providing jobs for Labor Party members, its sympathisers and supporters. Many of these people now occupy senior positions in our major institutions. I do not make an accusation in this chamber that they are not honourable men but, like all of us, they will be judged on how they perform their duties. Party affiliation offers no protection nor does it in any way diminish their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these people that the Labor Party has appointed-its sympathisers, members and former members-are in responsible positions, and may be faced with issues which require them to decide whether their loyalty is to the institution to which the Hawke Government has appointed them or to the Labor Party. Is their duty to the nation or to the ALP? Mr Keating has told us that, in his view, their duty is to the ALP. Will former trusted Labor Party stalwarts turn their backs on the party? We do not know the answer to that question, that is in the future, but we do know that Australia is in a serious economic and political crisis-a crisis unmatched in the memory of certainly most people in this chamber. Strange and difficult pressures, are placed on people in these times. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the chamber that Mr Keating has fired the warning shots of a desperate man. His philosophy urges known Labor Party members and sympathisers appointed to major posts and boards to adopt partisan policies. Mr Keating does not understand how his incredible statement has left those people open to suspicion and odium. I suggest to the Senate that Mr Keating's philosophy is not appropriate to any governing party, let alone one which so relentlessly appoints its own sympathisers to positions of responsibility in the major institutions of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> No coalition leader, I am proud to say, has ever claimed that the primary loyalties of individuals that it appoints to great positions are to the coalition. Every reference in the coalition platform shows that, as a political force, it is dedicated to Parliament and the rule of law. Mr Keating is saying, `You step out of line, you will be punished. You will have the judgment of the Labor Party on you. You will wear the cross that will mark you for life as an object of hatred and vindictive revenge. So be careful. In these difficult hours, remember, you owe your loyalties to the Labor Party not to the institutions which have been entrusted to your responsibility'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that most Labor Party appointees will recognise their duties above partisan loyalty. At the end of the day maybe even Brian Burke will recognise his duty. I say this because we have greater traditions in this country than loyalty to the Labor Party, which influenced most Australians-Liberal and Labor alike. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these is that Australians give a great priority to institutional and national loyalties rather than party political loyalties. The second set of traditions relates to the desire of most Australians to do what is right, proper and decent and if this may quarrel with a party political loyalty, so be it. The third tradition goes to the very core of our democracy, the desire of our people to avoid extremist positions either of the Right or the Left and to treat with disdain political zealots and power hungry politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating's threats will not quell the storm. The Labor Party is in disarray and he is shouting into the gale. If Australia is to make it through this crisis, it will not be because people in high places put the Labor Party above the national interest. We should be grateful to Mr Keating for one thing-for bringing to the attention of this Parliament a number of great Labor leaders who could no longer tolerate Labor ideology and Labor policies in times of national crisis. Paul Keating has drawn our attention to these leaders who, when faced with a crisis, chose the nation rather than the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one would argue that these men, Hughes and Lyons, did not do what was right by their own conscience and guidelines. To draw on Mr Keating's terminology, to wear the cross has never been a mark of dishonour in our society. Time and time again, Hughes and Lyons, flying colours other than those of the Labor Party, received what matters most in a democracy-the people's support. In contrast to Mr Keating's view, Hughes and Lyons are honoured in Australian history; so is Sir William McKell, as indeed will be Sir John Kerr. Mr Keating's threat should be treated with contempt by all who treasure democracy. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 proposes the imposition of a supervisory levy on superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts which are subject to supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The levy would be due and payable upon lodgment of annual returns with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in accordance with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. The proposed levy would replace the present system of charging funds and trusts with a fixed fee (which is presently set at $40). </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that the Government announced in its August 1990 Budget Statement, that the fee would be replaced with a new levy commencing with the annual returns for the 1990/91 year of income. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's intention in introducing this measure is to effect full cost recovery for the supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of the superannuation industry. When the Insurance and Superannuation Commission was established in 1987, the Government decided to recover the costs of superannuation supervision and a lodgment fee of a flat $30 was set. Costs recovered under that fee have only recovered approximately half of the costs of relevant superannuation functions because the number of funds lodging returns has been less than half what was expected, from Taxation Office records. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, together with the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991, would give effect to the Government's Budget announcement. There are two Bills because the supervisory levy is a tax and, as such, must be imposed under a separate Bill. This Bill should be read as one with the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill and is to come into operation on the day the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill receives Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the superannuation supervisory levy to have two components, a basic levy amount and a late lodgment amount. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the basic levy amount to be prescribed by regulation. It is intended that the amount of basic levy payable would generally be determined on the basis of fund or trust asset size although, where appropriate, other bases for determining the levy may be used. Small funds (those with assets of $0.5m or less) would pay a levy which approximates only the cost of actually processing the forms as this closely approximates the call of those funds on Insurance and Superannuation Commission resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Large funds would pay a larger levy, generally depending on fund size, with a maximum levy applying at a level which would recoup all of the relevant costs. It is important to note that it would be possible to impose different scales of levy on different categories of funds or trusts. Thus, it would be possible, where appropriate, that superannuation funds might pay a different scale of levy compared to pooled superannuation trusts or approved deposit funds. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, being the Bill which imposes the levy, is required to set a statutory upper limit to the amount which it would be possible to impose on an individual fund or trust in any one year of income. The maximum levy limit set by the Bill is $30,000. This would amount to a very large increase over the current flat fee, although proportionately it is comparable to the payment of $40 in the case of a fund with $0.5m in assets. In practice, the amount of the maximum levy that will generally apply to funds and trusts in the first few years of operation will be well below this amount. I expect that the maximum levy imposed by regulation for the first year or so of operation would be of the order of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for a late lodgment amount to be added to the basic levy amount when a return is lodged after a grace period of 14 days following a lodgment date specified by the Commissioner. The proposed period of grace is intended to allow a reasonable time for correction of returns which were attempted to be lodged on or before the relevant date but which were not complete (for instance in circumstances where a trustee has omitted to sign a return). </PARA>
<PARA>The late lodgment amount would be calculated on a monthly basis, at a rate of 20 per cent per annum of the basic levy prescribed for the particular fund, subject to a minimum monthly amount. The late lodgment amount is not a penalty and is intended to encourage timely lodgment of returns and to recover the additional costs associated with processing returns which are lodged late. </PARA>
<PARA>The large majority of the funds that will lodge a return would pay the minimum basic levy. If in the first year of operation, the minimum basic levy amount were $40 then the minimum monthly late lodgment amount would be $5. </PARA>
<PARA>Preliminary discussions are currently underway between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and industry representatives concerning an appropriate progressive scale for the basic levy which would apply to returns in respect of the 1990/91 year of income. </PARA>
<PARA>There would be annual discussions with the industry when the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is determining the scale of levies. In addition there would be annual consultation between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Department of Finance in determining the amount of revenue required to fully recover all costs. </PARA>
<PARA>For the first few years, until accurate asset profiles of funds and trusts are available, it will be difficult to accurately estimate the revenue which would be generated each year by a prescribed levy which is graduated according to asset size. Also, the precise amount of revenue that would be required to be raised in the first year of the levy, to fully recover relevant costs of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and based on the relevant current functions of the Commission, has yet to be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated, however, that the amount required to be raised by the basic levy in the first year or two would be of the order of $6m to $8m: these amounts are therefore estimated revenue targets. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue estimates do not include any estimate of revenue which might be generated by the late lodgment amount. </PARA>
<PARA>If the current flat $40 fee were continued, it is estimated that revenue would be of the order of $3.6m. </PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements I have just outlined, together with a provision for rounding up to the next whole dollar would also simplify the calculations necessary to determine the total levy to be paid. It is envisaged that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will produce a simple ready reckoner for this purpose to which trustees would be able to refer. In addition, the arrangements outlined would facilitate the streamlining of annual return processing within the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill to the Senate, and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 and the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 are designed to give effect to a single purpose and that is a decision announced in the last Budget to achieve full cost recovery for the supervision of the superannuation industry by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. This is to be done by the introduction of a levy to be paid on the lodgment of annual returns, and that levy will depend upon the size of the fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fee of $40 which is currently applicable to all annual returns is likely to remain the fee for small funds-those with assets of less than half a million dollars. Those above that figure are likely to be looking at a levy of $5,000 a year in the first instance up to a maximum of $30,000 under the present legislation. Whilst the Government has given assurances to the industry that it will consult extensively before it seeks to increase those fee levels, we will be moving an amendment to ensure that full and proper consultation take place with the relevant peak councils, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We take the view that it is desirable that a user pays principle should apply in this area and as a result that the industry will have not only the financial responsibility for funding the activities of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner but also an ability to exercise leverage in ensuring that the Commissioner fully undertakes his responsibility. So, at the end of the day, if something goes wrong, it will not be the fault of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beetham, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, has made it very clear that he welcomes that challenge. In his recent address to the Conference of Major Superannuation Funds in Wollongong, he spelt out very clearly the obligations which he believes ought to attach to the industry and the role that his office is prepared to play in ensuring that adequate prudential requirements are in place. Mr Beetham is simply acknowledging, in many respects, a situation which is widely recognised in the community, that is, that the growth rates of superannuation funds have been verging on the exponential in recent years, to the stage where we are now looking at assets to the value of $124 billion on last count and which are estimated to reach some $600 billion by the turn of the century if Treasury is right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr Keating, in his usual hyperbolic fashion, has suggested we might be looking at $1,000 billion, but I think most sober industry observers prefer the view of the Allen Consulting Group Pty Ltd which recently released its report Superannuation 2000 and its significant figure is something of the order of $350 to $400 billion. Even that is a trebling of the current level of assets over a 10 year period. It means that this industry will undoubtedly be one of the fastest growing industries and one that will need extraordinarily close supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> Make no mistake: there are many forces at work that will try to interfere with the proper commercial activities of superannuation funds. Not only the Treasurer, but also the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), are at this very moment seeking to do their best to direct the way in which superannuation funds make their investments-not in the crude manner that one might have expected if they were simply to be giving adherence to the Australia Reconstructed proposal of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or to some of the more gung ho resolutions emanating from the Caucus which has directed that a proportion of funds be invested in everything from low cost housing to large scale social infrastructure to venture capital through to a whole range of other so-called socially desirable projects. </PARA>
<PARA> We are likely to see some heavying on the part of leading Ministers to the point where a number of the major players, the life offices, are put in a position where they will be publicly criticised, probably vilified and condemned, for not exercising their national responsibilities and for going along with these sorts of proposals. I view with a great deal of concern the attempts that are being made at the moment to desperately get the Labor Government off the hook. It is trying to restart the economy by gaining access to the hard earned savings of very many small players-those people who have had the prudence and the foresight to save for their own retirement. They are overwhelmingly in the majority of those who are long term beneficiaries of superannuation. Those people are the ones who are going to be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably part of the mythology fostered by the Australian Labor Party that industry funds are where it is all at; that, as a result of award superannuation, the vast majority of people are getting superannuation benefits that they have not had before. There are something like 100,000 company funds and fewer than 100 industry funds. The great majority of people are beneficiaries of traditional employer sponsored company funds and those are the ones that will make or break the future of superannuation in this country and they are the ones that will control, through their trustees, the manner in which those funds are invested. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only irresponsible but also socially undesirable for the Government to be trying to usurp the role of the trustees of those funds, yet that is precisely what is being attempted at the present moment. I think it ill behoves the Labor Party to be in any way critical of others unless it is prepared to stand aside and give the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner full power, authority and funding and let him get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> We favour fuller disclosure than exists at the present time. We favour tighter prudential controls. We are anxious to ensure that this industry remains as safe as it can possibly be-certainly safe from the predations of those in the Labor Party who want to get their hands in the honey pot. I am reminded of a recent newspaper article from the State of Western Australia which demonstrates graphically the gap between rhetoric and reality in this area. That article, which appeared in the West Australian of 6 April, disclosed that there is a massive $3.9 billion shortfall in unfunded liabilities for the Government's Employee Superannuation Board. Indeed, the article says that another State-run shipping line, Stateships:</PARA>
<PARA>revealed in its latest accounts that its true superannuation liability had been assessed at $29.3 million, matched by a provision of only $5.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA>So Labor governments are in a position to lead the way. They are in fact able, if they choose, to ensure that there is proper and adequate demarcation in terms of the roles of trustees so that investment policies are undertaken by people with commercial experience who know what they are doing, who are best placed to make proper commercial judgments-they are not to be lent on or heavied in the public arena into putting all of their money into one area or another-and who do not put their money into things that are somehow the current flavour of the month, which some Ministers, for the benefit of their own political agenda, believe it is desirable for superannuation funds to take risks on. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that as a result of the passage of these two Bills we see a much greater recognition of the imperative that these funds ought to be left to operate on commercial considerations. The spotlight of the regulator ought to be constantly upon them so that they are accountable for their actions but, ultimately, they should make the decisions and not the politicians. I think that is quite a considerable distance from the position we have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we favour proposals which will lead to greater prudential standards. Indeed, the Treasurer announced not so long ago that he had asked the Commissioner, the Treasury, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Securities Commission, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the superannuation industry to conduct a review of the superannuation industry. We welcome that and we think that simplification of the rules is a very important priority in this area. But we again express considerable concern at the way in which Mr Keating is endeavouring to demonstrate that somehow the funds are being irresponsible in the nature of their investments. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that less than 20 per cent of the assets of superannuation funds are invested in all types of real estate, despite the fact that the usual justification trotted out is that it is about time we stopped superannuation funds from putting all of their resources and reserves into central business district real estate. That is a myth. The funds themselves are very much aware that they need to have balanced portfolios and that it is highly desirable to have a spread of investments if they want to balance the rewards and risks. I have no doubt that we will continue to see responsible decisions being made by the vast majority of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case, the last thing they want is Mr Keating standing on the sidelines trying to twist their arms and somehow suggesting that their current investment strategies are not sufficiently gung ho, innovative or imaginative-as he has described it in the past. Indeed, we ought to welcome the fact that the trustees have been conservative in their investment policies; that they have taken heed of the October 1987 crash; and that they have not been out there leading from the front with funds which are not their own-nor, of course, the Government's funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will support each of these Bills, but we will be anxious to ensure that the Government keeps it word: that it does not even contemplate going beyond the indicative level of about $5,000 for large funds without full and thorough consultation with the relevant industry bodies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate tonight is debating cognately the Occupation Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991. One of the purposes of these two Bills is to impose a new supervisory levy structure on superannuation funds pursuant to an announcement made in the last Budget. Constitutional requirements mean that two Bills are necessary. I will return to that point in a moment. The other matters dealt with in the legislation concern a late payment penalty to apply to unpaid levies, the taxation treatment of late lodgment penalties, electronic provision of data, the imposition of a fee for a copy of a previous reasonable benefit limit determination, and the discretion to not issue a compliance notice where a levy remains unpaid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Insurance and Superannuation Commission was established under a similarly named Act in 1987. This Commission supervises the insurance and superannuation industries. The Government has always intended to operate the Commission on the full cost recovery basis. A $30 fee was instituted on the annual returns lodged by superannuation funds from 1987, and similar levies operate on life and general insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The superannuation levy was increased to $40 for the 1990-91 financial year. The revenue from the existing fees does not, however, cover fully the operation of the Commission, and the Government now proposes to adopt a fee based on the assets of the superannuation funds to replace the current flat fee. The current Budget estimates total outlays of $11.3m for the Commission and receipts of $8.6m, yielding a deficiency of more than $2.5m. The Bill's proposals are estimated to raise between $2.4m and $4.4m in extra revenue, thereby effecting the Government's goal of self-sufficiency and full cost recovery for the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy, however, that the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) describes the levy increase as necessary to recover the costs of superannuation functions. This statement actually directly contradicts the data contained on page 86 of the explanatory notes for the Treasury portfolio which shows outlays of $3.8m and revenue of $3.6m for the superannuation subprogram. This means that the superannuation funds are actually in balance and it would suggest to me that the shortfall must lie in other charges-possibly management services-and that that is now to be met by these Bills in order to achieve self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this sloppiness in the second reading speech is indicative of the approach that the Government has taken to this Bill. We find that the delegation which the Government is proposing-in this case, for this levy to be established by regulation-is entirely unacceptable. The detail of the exact method of calculation has simply not been finalised. The Bill merely replaces the existing $40 fee with a maximum levy of $30,000. In the Minister's second reading speech we are told that it is expected that the maximum amount to be imposed will actually be about $5,000; so we have here a range of between $5,000 and $30,000 to be put into effect by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats find that this is an unacceptable level of delegation. All the details are to be contained in regulations, we are told; yet it is obvious that the policy and the formula on which the calculations are to be based have not been finalised. The Minister's speech only states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is intended that the amount of basic levy payable would generally be determined on the basis of fund or trust assets although, where appropriate, other bases for determining the levy may be used. </PARA>
<PARA>One may well ask: what are these other bases for determining the levy? When would these bases be more appropriate than the asset-based approach? Fortunately, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is also disturbed by these proposals. We can be grateful for the valuable work of that Committee. The Committee has written to the Minister to clarify the matter but the Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in this case, has not bothered to reply. I am told that this is not uncommon for the Treasurer. We believe that the current proposal should not be supported in its present form. The Australian Democrats are somewhat astonished that the Opposition, which always defends the primacy of the Parliament over the Executive in taxation matters, is prepared to accept these Bills in the current form. </PARA>
<PARA> The Scrutiny of Bills Committee Alert Digest No. 4 of 1991 at page 18 accurately describes the problems which the Australian Democrats have with this legislation. Under the heading, `Inappropriate delegation of legislative power Paragraph 6 (1) (a)', it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the amount of levy to be paid by superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts in conjunction with the annual return which they lodge with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. Paragraph 6 (1) (a) provides that the `basic levy amount' is to be ascertained `in accordance with the regulations'. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision raises two possible concerns. First, the Committee questions whether this is an appropriate matter to be left for the regulations. The only guidance on what the regulations might contain comes from subclause 6 (5) which provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The regulations may provide the different basic levy amounts for different classes of funds or unit trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, there is the question of whether this `levy' is more appropriately categorised as a tax. If it is more properly categorised as a tax then, clearly, this is a matter which should be dealt with by primary legislation and not by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this comment, the Committee accepts that subclause 6 (4) sets the maximum amount for the basic levy amount at $30,000. The specification in the legislation of a maximum levy or a formula for determining the maximum levy is a factor which generally tends to allay this Committee's concerns in this regard. However, the Committee notes that in the present case, in his Second Reading speech, the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA> I expect that the maximum levy imposed by regulation for the first year or so of operation would be of the order of $5,000. If this is so, the maximum levy allowed under subclause 6 (4) is significantly higher than the amount which (at least initially) is expected to be set, leaving considerable scope for discretion in regulations subsequently made to alter the levy. In all the circumstances, the Committee would appreciate some guidance from the Minister on the reason that the clause has been drafted in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee draws Senators' attention to the clause as it may be considered to constitute an inappropriate delegation of legislative power . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats concur entirely with that view expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It must be a matter of considerable concern that the Treasurer has obviously treated this advice and these queries from the Committee with utter contempt in not replying to this date, I am informed, to its concerns. I believe that it is up to the Senate to take a stand on such a matter, and the Democrats will oppose this Bill. We believe that we should not tolerate such a level of delegation and such a contempt by the Treasurer for the queries raised by a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> All the other proposals are reasonable, with the exception of the proposed fee for a copy of a reasonable benefit limit determination. The relevant clause provides that the Commissioner must issue a determination, otherwise an individual will be charged income tax on the whole of his or her superannuation benefit. The proposal to levy a fee to provide a copy-and it is a copy-of such a vital document is, I believe, contrary to the freedom of information legislation and, indeed, to all principles of information legislation which should compel the Government to provide information on the personal details which pertain to each individual's concerns. We will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to delete this clause from the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my remarks I shall advert briefly to some comments that were made by Senator Alston in which he spoke against any suggestion that superannuation funds should direct their funds to business in Australia to assist in the creation of jobs and generally to assist in internal capital formation. I refer to an article in the Australian newspaper on 6 February 1991 headed, `Super funds should be made to fund business'. The author of that statement is none other than Mr Adler, the Managing Director of the FAI Insurance Group. Mr Rodney Adler can be described as one of Australia's foremost businessmen and certainly an advocate of the free enterprise ethic, yet he says that the booming superannuation industry should be regulated to the extent that it is compelled, if it is not doing so of its own accord, to provide funds for the economic development of Australia and for the provision of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, while marginal to the overall regulation and supervision of the superannuation industry, is indeed a forerunner of other provisions and other legislation which will need to be introduced to ensure that this growing source of funds benefits all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill, I shall touch on a couple of points relating to the Bills and raise a couple of concerns that I have regarding occupational superannuation. The purpose of these Bills is to introduce supervisory levies which will raise about $7m, with a system of appeals with a review by the Minister. If necessary, an appeal can be heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The detail of the Bills has been covered by Senator Alston, so I will not go over it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall, however, raise a couple of concerns I have regarding occupational superannuation. Occupational superannuation is, in fact, compulsory saving. However, there are a number of concerns. My initial concern relates to taxation. There is taxation on the profits of the funds and there is capital gains tax. There is taxing of recipients, which falls into a number of areas. If that tax is in the form of a pension, there is one form of calculation. If it is taken as a lump sum, there is another form of calculation. All in all, it is extremely confusing. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have this levy, and while it is not a tax it is another imposition on funds. The taxation regime significantly reduces the level of savings and hence reduces the national significance of the level of savings and, at the end of the day, the personal return to the individual. The tax implications of superannuation are both complex and mammoth and, in my view, certainly need looking at very carefully because to a point they are defeating part of the purpose of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to raise in this debate is that of freedom of choice with regard to the placement of funds. Many recipients in award superannuation have no choice as to where they may place their funds. In fact, according to the last available figures that I have seen, dated 30 April 1989, for 90 per cent of award decisions the Australian Industrial Relations Commission directed where the funds had to be invested. Of 284 superannuation awards implemented, a single fund was nominated for 162. That hardly represents freedom of choice. Another 90 awards allowed a choice of two, which is a very limited choice of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is deplorable. It is a fundamental weakness in the current situation. It prevents individuals from maximising their returns and from deciding the type of investment they wish to have their funds in, whether it be capital guarantee, investment linked or some other form of investment. The individuals have no control over the costs of a particular fund, and if they transfer jobs they have no choice but to have the occupational superannuation paid into the fund under their award. In many instances, they are in fact worse off when they transfer their funds in terms of costs and return. All of these provisions reduce the real value of the investment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to quote a few examples in this arena because I think they highlight very significantly the point I make. I shall seek leave to have these examples incorporated after I have spoken on some of them. If we look down the list that I will incorporate, we see that returns on investment, as of the six months ending December 1988, range from 6 per cent up to 21.4 per cent. We see funds at 7 per cent, 13.3 per cent, 14 per cent and 16.45 per cent. On the charges side, some funds cost $1 per week; some cost 50c per week; one costs 3.75 per cent per annum; and another costs 45c per week. </PARA>
<PARA> As we go down the list, we find enormous differences in the returns on the investment, which ultimately determine what the individual will get out of that investment in superannuation, and an enormous difference in the charges. I notice now that there is one fund with a charge of $4 per annum. The fund above it has a $1 maximum per week. I believe that this is one area that needs looking at. I now seek leave to have this paper incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having quoted those figures and given them as examples of the enormous differences in the performance and costs of some funds, I believe that it is absolutely imperative that this area of occupational superannuation be addressed. The individuals who hold the funds should have as a fundamental right the ability to have that money placed in a fund of their choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One must also raise another question in this area. Some of these industry funds are commercial operations, funds that have been approved by the Commissioner for Occupational Superannuation. Other funds are owned by unions and controlled by joint employer-employees trustees. Others are just direct arrangements between employer organisations and unions. I do not believe that the union movement or any other individual operation should have an unfettered right by a decision of the Arbitration Commission to have the payment under a particular award directed to them. They should have to compete in the marketplace to win the right to have that occupational superannuation payment. In other words, they should have to win it by the performance of their fund, by the cost and by the return on that investment-not as a result of government legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991. As my learned colleagues have already stated, these Bills will amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987, commonly referred to as OSSA. The Bills give effect to a 1990 Budget decision to achieve full cost recovery for the supervision of the superannuation industry by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, known as the ISC. This will be done by the introduction of a levy to be paid on the lodgment of annual returns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for two Bills has arisen as a supervisory levy imposed by one of the Bills is a tax, and therefore it must be imposed as a separate Bill. I am pleased to see that the proper procedure for this has been followed. Honourable senators might recall that in the debate in this House on the Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1991 changes were made to a number of income tax rates, amongst other things. The procedure did not follow this course of separate Bills. I expressed my doubt, which was supported by a number of constitutional lawyers, about this process giving the Senate some possible unintended powers as a result of amendments to the financing of legislation. But that matter is still being looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, there is a fixed fee of $40 for lodgment of annual returns by the superannuation and pooled superannuation trusts. This will be replaced by a supervisory levy, consisting of a basic levy amount and a late lodgment amount on superannuation funds, pooled superannuation trusts and approved deposit funds. The basic levy is intended to apply from 1 July and will generally be determined according to the fund or the trust asset size. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept raises no particular problem for the Opposition, but the design of the levy has already been fully explained by my learned colleagues. Naturally, I will not repeat what they said. However, as part of this levy, a late lodgment fee will apply after a grace period of only 14 days. This is to be set at the rate of 20 per cent per annum of the basic levy prescribed for the particular fund, subject to a minimum monthly amount. </PARA>
<PARA> But what concerns me is that the Government intends to deny an income tax deductibility for the late lodgment fee. Therefore, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for the Government's reason for this course of action because I remind him that often a late lodgment is really beyond the control of the trustees. I believe that such a denial of tax deductibility is not an acceptable process. A further amendment will provide that a request by a person under section 15q of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act to the ISC for a copy of a previous reason- able benefits limit determination must be accompanied by a fee. I understand that the amount of the fee is to be prescribed by the regulations, and I look forward to seeing what that fee will be. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no reason to believe that the fee will not be a reasonable one, taking into account the large number of calculations that will be required. Therefore, it seems reasonable that a fee be charged for such applications. I also hope that this will not deter any superannuant from pursuing any inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party coalition will not be supporting the Democrat amendment to oppose clause 23. We believe that a reasonable charge should be made for a service provided, bearing in mind that some quite extensive calculations will be required in some circumstances. However, what does worry me is that we do not have the regulations before us at the moment. When we consider that this calculation will be necessary for income tax substantiation, this will certainly add further to the compliance costs of taxpayers in preparing their income tax returns. So I further ask the Minister-and this is my second question to which I hope he will respond-whether he will give us some indication when the regulations will be published and whether that fee will be in the initial publication of those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> This important question has arisen as a result of my past experience of taxation Bills, the latest perhaps being the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill, which was passed late last year. The regulations were not issued until late February this year. Almost 12 months had gone by from the time the draft Bill was first issued, again, without regulations. Consequently, the industry had no knowledge of what was to be expected. We find ourselves in the same dilemma tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Good legislative processes would certainly require the regulations to accompany, or follow shortly thereafter, the introduction of the legislation to the Senate. But there is no indication of the likely elements of the regulations. I would have thought that an open and honest government would provide some indication of what is likely to be in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The result for the industry is certainly a great deal of uncertainty. Hopefully, with the numerous changes that have occurred within the superannuation industry, the late issuance of the regulations will not add to the already many problems in terms of comprehension which are current. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate contains a number of other changes concerning the use of data processing devices to provide information to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Under sections 15f and 15g, requirements set out under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act can be supplied, for example, on a data processing disk which provides administrative flexibility in the application and collection of the levy. So it is good to see that our Government is keeping up with the times and encouraging the use of modern technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of some of these bureaucracies is becoming quite frightening. This can be seen when we look at the cost of income tax and sales tax collections and the cost of maintaining an efficient ISC. But what is worrying a lot of observers at present is whether the new ISC is performing quickly enough in terms of covering its wide obligations in a satisfactory manner. Most commentators believe that it has a long way to go but that it needs a lot more encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that, from my discussions with the industry, I think it is generally happy about the principle of an internal supervisory levy. But there has to be a better rate of performance-a performance matched by an appropriate evaluation of the role of the ISC which failed to perform adequately, for example, in the first major test involving Occidental and Regal. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some reluctance since the imposition of a 15 per cent tax on the earnings of superannuation funds. The industry has expressed deep and sincere concern that, along with increasingly high administrative costs, superannuation could become less attractive as an investment since the Government introduced this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I have certain concerns about the lack of a uniform administrative practice in relation to the dividend imputation credits that apply as an offset against employer and employee contributions. Rather than take the time of the Senate, perhaps it might be appropriate to signal my intention of taking this matter further during Senate Estimates committee hearings. But there is a genuine concern that there is lack of a uniform practice in relation to the manner in which those dividend imputation credits are offset. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the superannuation industry needs to be reassured by this Government that there will not be any further increases in the 15 per cent tax on the earnings of superannuation funds or on the cost of collections at source in respect of contributions derived from both the employer and employee. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to give an assurance in this respect because there are some rumours and concerns within the industry at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no problems with the technical aspects of the Bill and I have been informed that the industry welcomes the Government's assurance of full consultation each year prior to the setting of the annual fees by regulation. The industry believes that the levy approach is a reasonable price to pay to ensure the integrity of the industry so long as the Government honours its promise of ongoing industry consultation and so long as the ISC performs. So there are a couple of big question marks there. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to point out to the Government a number of areas of concerns and problems with superannuation in general that need attention. If the Government has decided that superannuation is to be the preferred medium for our old age, is it necessary that the Government should strive toward ensuring that the combined contribution is adequate to provide the necessary return? For example, at present the industry believes that the combined contribution needs to be something like 9 per cent to provide this adequate return. This raises several economic questions as to how the present economy under the Keating management will ever be able to achieve this need and at the same time bring this country out of an ever deepening recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that if superannuation is a preferred savings option for retirement, there should be a greater campaign on the part of the Government to encourage all employers to assume their responsibilities in this regard. It should not be up to the union movement or others. There are far too many employers who are not aware of their responsibilities. As a result, there is a building up of large amounts of arrears and penalties that will need to be paid eventually. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer the Government to a report of the Strategic Issues Forum which was recently issued by the Committee of Economic Development of Australia. The report emphasises the need now to provide for the future. The report notes that the percentage of the population aged 65 years and over will more than double between now and the middle of the next century, while the ratio of workers to pensioners will almost halve. A definite possibility exists that revenue collected will not be sufficient for the payment of age pensions. That is, indeed, a sobering forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends that policy initiatives be put in place to cover the predicted population trends. These include the abolition of compulsory retirement and the introduction of the universal superannuation scheme for workers; an increased emphasis on reskilling and training; and the diversion of assistance for the aged in the form of accommodation, leisure and education. The overall aim of the report states that the universal superannuation scheme should cover all workers, including those in private and public sectors, and the self-employed. A present limitation on the expansion of superannuation is that only employed persons are currently eligible to participate in private superannuation funds. Non-employed women and part time workers are disadvantaged by this ruling. This is an area which I believe needs certain investigation if universal superannuation is to apply. Hopefully, when the sex discrimination amendments finally reach this chamber, these sorts of problems will be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with most superannuation schemes is that the excess benefits tend to benefit those on the top salary scale. Those at the lower end of the scale tend to receive nil or low coverage. Therefore, I believe that, as part of this recognition of these problems, superannuation needs to be removed from the industrial to another area. In addition, although our present tax system encourages participation in superannuation, the converse is true when it comes to encouraging the average person to invest in long term savings other than superannuation. The interest on savings being taxed after it has already been taxed in the workplace is a major disincentive to the average taxpayer to invest in long term savings type investments. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to a recent scheme commenced in the United Kingdom whereby interest on long term savings, that is, savings tied up for five years or more, is granted exemption from taxation. The scheme is known as TESSA, that is, tax exempt special savings account. The amount per year that can be invested in this type of account naturally is limited on a yearly basis as well as there being a maximum amount that can be invested. The interest shown in the accounts introduced since 1 January I think has surprised United Kingdom banks and building societies. Part of the cure for the recession-part only-and our alarming balance of payments is to increase savings whether this be by means of superannuation or other mechanisms. So the individual should always have the choice in how he saves his hard-earned cash. Superannuation should not be the only method of saving. </PARA>
<PARA> A further area that has caused me great alarm is the suggestion that a small proportion of superannuation fund money should be skimmed off by the Federal Government into risky ventures known euphemistically as venture capital projects. In simple terms, as suggested by one writer on this topic, `If Australian businesses will not put up the money, let us get it from the superannuation funds'. This is dangerous talk. To suggest that superannuation fund members should bear the full risk of businesses which have an excellent chance of going broke is simply outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical questions that arise if this is followed are quite numerous, for example, such questions as what is the legal structure of the body holding the money; who assesses the projects; how does one assess them; to whom is the body accountable especially if it loses a lot of money and the like; if it does not lose money why does it exist; who would be on the board of this body-indeed, who would be silly enough to accept an appointment to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept that everyday workers' retirement savings should be used for risky ventures. The choice of investment in venture capital should be left to the individual who can exercise his choice as to whether his savings can be put at risk. Consequently, he has the benefits of the gains and reaps the losses himself. The manager and trustees of pooled superannuation savings for everyday workers should not be forced to risk these hard-earned savings. </PARA>
<PARA> On the topic of the need to safeguard the retirement savings of the everyday Australian, I believe that the prudential rules covering the way in which superannuation funds can invest their members' money and engage in financial transactions need to be strengthened. At the moment superannuation regulations have clauses aimed at preventing funds from risking members' money. For example, superannuation funds are limited in what they can borrow from a company-run employers' superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations also impose auditing standards and reporting requirements that stipulate actuarial reports every three years, but really do not go to the hard core of requirements in protecting and adequately providing a proper prudential standard that would provide a lot more assurance for those people who are putting money into superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The only force behind the regulations is the Commonwealth taxation powers, and superannuation funds are offered tax concessions provided that they abide by the superannuation regulations. Since the collapse of Occidental Life and Regal Life, it has been shown that this supervision may not be enough and has not been enough. Therefore, I repeat that there is an urgent need to update these regulations on prudential standards to ensure the safety of Australian savings in these sorts of investments. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to popular beliefs about superannuation funds investing in management investment companies-MICs-an alternative arrangements would be to encourage our funds to invest in safe overseas investments. This would soften our balance of payments problems because the more Australian superannuation funds invest overseas the greater the softening of the balance of payments. This would also apply to companies investing overseas. I know that there is some reluctance in some political quarters to encourage that because critics believe that funds should essentially be directed to Australian type investments. I know, for example, that one Australian company in the paper industry, Amco, has just made a further $20m investment in a corrugated paper supplier in the United Kingdom, taking that company's overseas investments and acquisitions past $500m. I remind the Senate that now over one-third of that holding company's sales come from offshore operations and substantially benefit our balance of payments. I remind the Senate that our foreign debt was small when the present Government came to power. It has since exploded by 468 per cent. When the coalition government was in power in 1972, there was a current account surplus of $754m. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I commend these Bills to the Senate. I look forward to receiving the answers to the four questions I posed earlier in my speech, but I hope that the Government will heed some of the wider concerns in relation to the superannuation industry. In particular, I look forward to the raising of prudential standards for superannuation funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill and the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill obviously need to be read as one, and should be. They are being debated as one by the Senate. One Bill imposes the levy and the other enables the collection of that levy. It is important to remember that because what we are proposing to do here is replace an existing $40 flat fee which is imposed by regulation. If the Government simply wanted to maintain the originally declared intention of cost recovery without being worried about equity, we could simply by regulation have reasonably raised the fee to $80. I understand that the Opposition has not raised this point, but the Australian Democrats have done so. Therefore, it is reasonable to respond to that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We could have raised that fee to $80. That would have been consistent with the legislation and with the continuing principle of cost recovery, but it would have been terribly unfair because 90 per cent of the funds would have been raised from the small funds. No-one is advocating that is what we should have done. I make that point only to say that the intention to proceed to set this more complex formula by regulation is not some horrible breach of proper process. It is simply doing more equitably what has properly been done until now. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is Senator Spindler's point of view. I am trying to explain that it is not creating some new and extraordinary mechanism of cost recovery. It is continuing the existing mechanism of cost recovery in a more equitable manner. I do not find it a persuasive argument that it is appropriate to have an inequitable charge by regulation but not appropriate to have an equitable one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reference was made-I am sorry I was not here for that part of the debate-to a report on these and other matters by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Often such matters would come to me. I know nothing about it. I checked with the office of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and with the responsible people who would normally deal with such a matter in that office, and no-one is conscious of the correspondence. I am not saying that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has made it up; I am saying that something has slipped through. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been trying to upgrade the level of response to both regulations and ordinances and scrutiny of Bills, I think with some success. It is not an intention to ignore this particular matter. I am not aware of the letter having come at all. I have not seen it and we cannot find anybody who has dealt with it. So at this stage I do not think we have slipped up at our end, although that may ultimately turn out to be the case. I am simply saying we have not ignored the proposal in any wilful manner, and I will make what inquiries I can about that to ensure that, if it is a problem of the system, if somehow or another there is a flawed mechanism for dealing with this-although it seems to be working all right for the other proposals that come up-that is overcome. I reassure the Senate that we intend to continue our current practice of enhancing our response to both scrutiny of Bills and regulations and ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant issue, in one sense, is the Opposition's amendment on this matter. Of course, we will have a subsequent chance to deal with that, so it may be more appropriate if I do it in the committee stage. It is not a conflict of underlying intention between Government and Opposition about whether there should be such consultation. It is a conflict of approach about the best way of carrying it out and the terms and conditions under which it should be carried out. I should perhaps leave the matter there, otherwise it will be a needless duplication. I shall deal with it at greater length during the committee stage. I do not want to say that this is a terrible amendment. It is an amendment, the purpose of which we understand and are sympathetic with and want to achieve but not through legislative mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by the Australian Democrats is a bit of a surprise. I am not saying that they do not understand their own amendment, but it is strange that we should be concerned about a charge which is only intended to cover the additional cost of providing copies of documents which have already been properly provided. I can see that if one had to pay for the initial copy there would be a problem; a citizen might in some way be disadvantaged. But there comes a time when the balance between proper administration and equity tips. We are not saying one is not entitled to know. We are saying that if one needs to be provided with a replacement it is not unreasonable that one should pay for the replacement, although one is provided with the original. I do not understand that is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the general principle raised from time to time by the Democrats, the Opposition and Government members about charges for documents that one might need for the proper discharge of one's business. However, this is a slightly different circumstance, which we can deal with in greater length later if that is proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one more point raised by Senator Watson. If I have not covered all of his points, I am sure that either in the committee stage or before one of the Estimates committees he will pursue it. There was some dialogue, and I might have missed some of the points he raised, but there will be other forums in which he can pursue that. However, I did note his question about the timing of the regulations. I cannot be absolutely specific about the date on which they will come out, but the drafting instructions have been given and it is the firm intention that they come out well before 1 July, sufficient to allow people to carry out properly the necessary administrative requirements. I cannot be any more specific than that but that is my current understanding. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7, page 3, at end of clause, add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Regulations shall not be made for the purposes of section 6 unless the Minister has consulted with the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia and has had regard to the views (if any) expressed by those organisations.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to ensure that we were all ad idem on this matter. The Government has indicated that it intends to consult with the industry on an annual basis. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to repeat that indication to ensure that we are not talking about the sort of consultation, which the Government has said it will undertake with the industry on earlier changes to superannuation laws, which has led to a great deal of anguish and concern on the part of the industry that it was either nominally consulted or not consulted at all. I refer in particular to the infamous episode which occurred a couple of days before the end of the last financial year when the Treasurer (Mr Keating), having said that he would consult on the detail of what was then to be a tax deduction in respect of member contributions, without any warning whatsoever issued a press release after the close of business on the Friday before Easter, I think it was, announcing a new rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the high watermark, I hope, of the total lack of consultation that has been undertaken on some occasions. That is why I make it clear to Senator McMullan that the Opposition wants to ensure that the Government does indeed honour its promises. I ask the Minister to respond on those matters. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson has been at pains to register a complaint that indeed we ought to have had the regulations before the chamber tonight so that we were able to judge them on their merits. It is reasonable to say, as Senator Spindler has said-perhaps somewhat overstating the case nonetheless-that it would have been much more helpful if we had been able to see the precise formula that will operate. We do not share the Australian Democrats' concern that ultimately the Government will completely depart from its undertakings and so find that we are looking at $30,000 per large fund from year one. We accept that the Government does not have any intention of moving to that $30,000 in any form of haste. We understand the constitutional requirement that a specific maximum figure be inserted in the legislation, and hopefully that means there will not be a need to amend the legislation for a period of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the meantime, it is important that we have the Government on record as agreeing to consult as soon as the regulations are available, and thereafter consulting in such a manner that we can be confident that it will not be just a question of inviting the industry to take it or leave it but will involve a two-way process. This will mean that the industry itself is able to make some sensible comments on the effectiveness of the regime, which will no doubt be put in place by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission as a result of the funds which become available and which will enable the ISC to honour the very fine promises that have been made over recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The major concern that we would have is not simply that the four mechanisms are in place but that at the end of the day they lead to meaningful change and regulation-not smothering but simply a close and regular monitoring of what is increasingly a very sensitive if not rapidly expanding industry. It is critically important that the Government should acknowledge that we can maintain and enhance confidence in the area of superannuation and indeed maintain, as the Government would have it, the forcible commitment of workers' funds to superannuation only if we ensure that there are no collapses-no repeats of the Occidental-Regal episode or the Estate Mortgage and Pyramid collapses. In other words, somehow the superannuation industry should be quarantined from the rest of the market, in effect, so that it is at least able to maintain the confidence of investors, large and small. </PARA>
<PARA> That can ultimately be achieved only if the Government is prepared to sit down with the industry at a very early stage and not only discuss what it has in mind in financial terms but also allow the industry to make sensible judgments and suggestions about the extent to which the ISC might be further or less involved. If we have that type of consultation, I think we are entitled to be confident that the industry will prosper and that the Government, as one of those players with a major vested interest through the various taxation levies that apply to funds, will have its revenue source guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments to date of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about not being prepared to close his eyes to the failure on the part of funds to invest in ways which strike him as suitable or desirable I think will have the effect of causing a great deal of anguish and concern on the part of those who rely on superannuation for their retirement incomes. One way in which the Government can overcome that crisis of confidence, apart from telling Mr Keating and Senator Button to back off, is to ensure that the ISC is properly equipped, properly financed and properly maintained and that the Government is prepared to be open and frank in its discussions about where it thinks the problems lie and in properly ascertaining the amount of funds that the ISC is likely to need. </PARA>
<PARA> If that can be achieved, then I think we will have the best of all possible worlds, but to date it has not happened. The industry itself is showing a very high degree of trust in this Government because, to take Senator Watson's point, it has not seen the whites of the Government's eyes. It does not have any legislative provision which guarantees that it will not be looking at $30,000 from day one but, nonetheless, in a spirit of trust, it has been prepared to support the legislation. It behoves the Government in that situation to make it abundantly clear to all concerned that consultation does not mean just going through the motions; consultation means being prepared on a regular basis to discuss the problems, the opportunities and the level of funds needed to do the job efficiently. If we can get this right, I think we will all be beneficiaries as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Deciding whether or not to support this amendment of the Opposition leads me back to the original criticism that I made of the Government's inadequate legislation. I would seek to confirm with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) that we are not opposing the principle of cost recovery. We have stated that that is perfectly in order. We understand and support that principle. However, it is totally unacceptable to have a range of between $5,000 and $30,000 and then to ask for a cart blanche trust, if you like, for the Government to fix the ultimate fees or levies based on even a shifting range of criteria, because we do not have even one set of criteria. This legislation permits the Government to shift to another set if it so chooses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principle of responsible delegation has been breached here inasmuch as it is this chamber that is responsible for legislation. Parliament should decide on the basis of a reasonable proposal advanced by Government. I think we in this chamber are not doing our duty, and I am surprised at the Opposition's level of disregarding its responsibility in this regard, to actually make the decision and make the determination. Instead, we have wide open delegation. It is, I believe, at an unsatisfactory level and I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary, even at this stage, seeing that we do not have a formal response from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to the concerns expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, is prepared to address them in this chamber. The concerns have been put on record, and I believe that they deserve a reply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are getting the answer to that question, I will respond to two previous queries. Someone will then be able to give me the answer to that question, because I do not know it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go firstly to the central point in the amendment, which is what Senator Alston pursued the second time. I have sought and received assurances that the consultation will be more than merely cursory or formal. The only thing I cannot guarantee is that we will agree. People may make representations with which the Government profoundly agrees. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats will find out about that very quickly, of course, because this is a democracy and when industry groups do not get satisfaction from governments, they turn up on other doorsteps very quickly. Sometimes it is before they come to see governments, but certainly it is never very long after-and that is quite proper. So were we not to discharge that obligation, Senator Watson and the Australian people would find out about it very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only will there be regular and substantial consultation, but there will also be consultation in this interim period on the question of the form of these regulations that are being drafted at the moment. There has been and there will be more. I have once again sought and received that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to really go over the ground that I dealt with in the second reading speech with regard to the relationship between the regulations and the legislation. I think that I have said all there really is to say. My understanding is that it is the advice of Parliamentary Counsel, which is concerned about the proprieties of these things, that what is being put forward is appropriate. When we are dealing with matters of this detail and complexity which may need to change relatively frequently-not day by day, but more frequently than we would wish to see legislation being amended-it does not seem an inappropriate mechanism, particularly when the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will operate within the restriction, that it is not to use the levy as a revenue raising mechanism but as a cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the requirement for consultation with industry about the scale of the levy and the nature of the mechanisms by which it will be raised and consultation with the Department of Finance about the amount to be recovered by the levy. It seems to me that we have built a reasonable set of checks and balances into and around the framework of something which has been dealt with by regulation. I put that on the record as the response to those two points and I will just consult on the question that Senator Watson has raised with me. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, firstly, the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 is a tax Bill. I missed some of the earlier debate so I hope that Senator Watson will excuse me if I am not giving him the full information. In part 3 of the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 we are dealing with an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. That is what is meant by the `principal Act' and we are amending that through this Bill. It is called the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Act, but it is amending, amongst other Acts, the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to clause 4 of the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill which introduces a new and, I must say, very unsatisfactory precedent into income tax law whereby a deduction is not allowable under subsection (1) in respect of so much of the levy imposed by the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991, as represents the late lodgment amount within the meaning of section 6 of the Act. For the first time, under our income tax laws, taxpayers are being denied a tax deduction in respect of a late lodgment fee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pointed out earlier that quite often the late lodgment may be outside the powers of a trustee; it may be due to extraneous factors beyond which they have absolutely no control. Therefore, it seems unreasonable that the fee-it could be a quite substantial one, we are not told because we do not have the legislation before us-be imposed. I object in principle to this precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether this will be the first in a whole long line or litany of situations where there is a penalty for late lodgment-that the taxpayers will get caught by the loss of tax deductibility-or whether this is a one-off situation? I believe that it represents a very unfortunate development in income tax law and can lead to all sorts of ramifications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of substance, it is not part of some plan to make this a major new initiative of the Income Tax Assessment Act with regard to late payment penalties. As Senator Watson would undoubtedly know, the basic levy component is taxable-it is tax deductible-and a late payment penalty, as against a late lodgment amount, is not tax deductible. We propose that the late lodgment be treated equally, that is all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not proposing to create a precedent here that will be a new and uniform procedure in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a proposal that is being brought forward for the specific purposes of this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware of that. The initial question, I thought, related only to the first point. In an attempt to save time, I did not go on at great length. Let me reiterate what I said: the current advice is that-if we look at the three things: the levy, the late payment penalty and the late lodgment amount; I will go through them-the basic levy component is tax deductible; that is not controversial. The late payment penalty is not tax deductible. Under this program, the late lodgment amount would also not be tax deductible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The non-deductibility of late payment penalties is, I am advised, consistent with the Income Tax Assessment Act. In order to achieve a quality of outcomes for those funds which lodge late and those which pay late, they are being treated equally. We are proposing that neither will be tax deductible. It is a fairly small matter in most instances. It will, quite clearly, be an incentive for people to lodge and pay the correct amount of levy on or by the appropriate date. I do not think, for that reason, it is an unreasonable or inappropriate provision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not support the amendment because we believe that there ought to be a fee attaching. I found Senator McMullan's explanation persuasive, but I suppose the matter of concern is that there is no fee as prescribed. Again, we have to take it on trust that the Government will set a reasonable fee, so I would invite the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate whether the formula that is likely to be adopted in determining that fee will be one that will essentially seek to achieve cost recovery or whether it will have some punitive element in it in order to encourage persons to lodge on time. I think if we receive an answer to that question, we might be in a position to judge the merits.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will go to Senator Alston's reasonable point. The intention of the Government is that the extra charge would be simply a cost recovery exercise. That is the briefest possible, but I hope sufficiently comprehensive, response to Senator Alston's reasonable concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To go to the point of the Australian Democrats as briefly as possible-the costs associated with meeting the requests for things like additional copies are not what would be called costs incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in the normal course of carrying out supervisory tasks required by the legislation. Therefore they are not included in the costs which have been and which will be considered in establishing the amount to be recovered by the levy. The levy will cover one set of costs and then there are more minor costs that need to be met. It is not unreasonable in that it is to recover the cost of providing replacement copies rather than original copies. For that reason, I think it is appropriate that the Government persist with the clause and I hope that the Senate will support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991 provides for the payment for a term of just over four years of a bounty on the manufacture of citric acid derived from the specific fermentation process. The bounty proposed by this Bill was announced by the Government in its 12 March industry statement. The declared intention of the bounty is to ensure the retention in Australia of what is deemed to be strategic technology. The bounty will affect and benefit one firm only-Sirius Biotechnology located in Altona, Victoria, a company which closed its doors in late 1990 and retrenched its 34 researchers and technicians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason given for the cessation of production was that the pricing scheme designed to protect Australian sugar growers had required the company to pay double the international price for the sucrose or the glucose necessary for its fermentation process. The net effect of this Bill will give effect to the owner of Sirius Biotechnology which will shortly be a multinational food and industrial conglomerate, Bunge Industrial Ltd, receiving $7.72m from the operation of the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has determined that this particular biotechnology process must be preserved in Australia in order to provide a manufacturing base for the further exploitation of the production process. One might pose the question how it expects to achieve that. It contends that the retention of the plant and equipment is essential for the commercialisation of leading edge biotechnology research and development activities under way in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and various universities. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the presence of Sirius in the market has provided the momentum for this research and development program. Therefore, the Government sees the application of the bounty-be it uncomfortably selective and short-sighted-as a means to an end. Putting research and development aside for a moment, the question we must ask ourselves is whether this Bill will be of benefit to Australian companies and, in turn, to Australia, and whether this knee-jerk reaction is an appropriate measure to help keep and foster high tech industries in Australia. The answer on all counts is no. The Bill is set to affect one company only, and a foreign-owned company at that. It is a short term reactive measure to plug the holes in Australia's ailing high tech retention sieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties are clear in their opposition to this Bill. At first glance, the Bill may appear reasonable, even sensible, and at any rate one could argue that the amount of $7.72m is trifling. But the coalition firmly believes that, small though it may be, the proposal is diametrically opposed to a gradual reduction in protection levels and a reduction in distortions in assistance between industries-objectives we thought had broad bipartisan support. Therefore, the coalition parties are opposing this Bill not because we do not consider that the fermentation technology developed is unique or worthwhile, but because it is a retrograde step in terms of industry policy. The position is based on the necessity for the Government to carry out reforms which will allow all industries to derive benefits, which will allow them to be competitively placed as import replacement or export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the Bill, as put forward by the Government, is to provide an economic incentive for Bunge Ltd to retain the operation of its soon to be acquired citric acid fermentation plant in Australia. The point of the exercise is not, however, to see the development of the local citric acid production capability as such. It is rather to seek to ensure the presence in Australia of its production facilities which will enable Australia to further capitalise on its research and development strengths in fermentation-based biotechnology. The link is not between the bounty and the continuation of the research. It is rather, as I pointed out earlier, between the retention of the Altona factory and the possibility of commercial development of that research taking place in that plant. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, the Government is hoping, by way of the bounty, that the technology process embodied in the Sirius plant and production processes is not, in the short term, sold off overseas under licence, which will, the Government hopes, enable the industry to move closer towards the commercialisation of existing biotechnology research and development programs. However, it is also more than possible, given the company's prior financial investments, that Bunge would have retained its commitment to the research and development program regardless of the availability of the Sirius operation. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleagues in the other place have made clear, the coalition parties in opposing the Bill do not do so on the issue of the biotechnology research effort which is under way in Australia. The value of the research work in this area is well recognised. However, we question the integrity of the process by which the Government is seeking to achieve the goal of preserving the production facilities in Australia, the implications of this in respect of the signals it sends to other private sector companies, and the capacity of the bounty to deliver its intended result-that is, its simple practicality. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, it should be recognised that Bunge Ltd may refuse to enter the bounty arrangement given our refusal to support the legislation. However, if it does enter the agreement, there is still no indication that it would retain its operations in Australia beyond the terms of the expiry date of the bounty. As I understand it, should Bunge Ltd decide to break the agreement with the Government at any point, it would not be liable for the repayment of the bounty that it has attracted. That means there is no guarantee that a suitable return will be forthcoming to the Australian community for its outlays. The exercise simply lacks sufficient transparency to justify the appropriation of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite a departmental briefing provided to the coalition, the coalition parties have not had access to sufficient information on the cost performance circumstances affecting Sirius to justify support for what is, in effect, a cash transfer payment. The explanatory notes make reference to the requirement that that company continue research and development, contribute to product development, explore new markets, and take all reasonable steps to provide for the participation of local companies. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce agrees that, whilst it is possible to determine whether these objectives are being carried out, the level of the commitment will be a matter for subjective assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting it plainly, it is difficult to see what the Australian community will be getting in return for its outlay of in excess of $7m. This is exacerbated by the reported comments of the Chairman of Bunge Ltd, in which he is quoted as saying that Sirius `is a baby in the whole area' of fermentation technology and it would be a `big struggle' to develop a market for citric acid in Australia. Given this, the capacity of the future owner of Sirius, even with the injection of the bounty payment over the next four years, to build a competitive market position is in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce agrees that if Bunge Ltd is unable to compete in the citric acid market here and overseas, it will not maintain Sirius as a manufacturing base. That is, if Bunge determines at some point that it is still not in its interests to manufacture in Australia, it can up and go, and it can do this without repayment of the bounty that it has received. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting momentarily on the history of the company, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in his second reading speech attributed most of the cost disadvantage to this company to the price of sugar. He made an attempt to lay the blame for that set of circumstances on the coalition parties. He neglected to mention that his Government was happy to continue the sugar import embargo for six years before advocating its abolition. At any rate, the sugar tariff is being reduced and I understand that the company has switched to wheat gluten as its substrate. This weakens considerably the Minister's argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond these concerns there is a larger question as to the merit of doing deals with corporate entities in order to retain their manufacturing or research bases in Australia. The Government has selectively chosen a single area of strategic development for assistance. As the benefits of the bounty are captured by only one company, it therefore technically represents an added and discriminatory cost to other users of the same raw materials. Whatever the merits of the circumstances of Sirius, one cannot escape the fact that the proposed bounty is a case of the Government picking, or attempting to pick, a winner. Given the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd fiasco, one would have thought that the setting of further precedents in this regard would have been avoided at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of the bounty accrue to a single company utilising a particular technology. It is extremely difficult to justify the decision to single out a particular technology for support over another. If this technology, why not the high-tech production facilities of Black and Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd; why not offset costs impinging on the advanced ceramics program of ICI Australia Ltd? Why not take up public interest ownership in gene shears technology? Why not meet the cost impediments to the further development of an array of other technologies with, presumably, equal claim to strategic technological significance? Alternatively, why was support not given to retain the manufacturing presence of the medical manufacturing arm of Pacific Dunlop Ltd, Telectronics Pty Ltd? Telectronics shifted its manufacturing of the implantable pacemakers to Miami last year with a loss of over 200 jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As we are all too well aware, the administrative process of selecting particular industries or technologies for special assistance is always reduced ultimately to politics and leaves itself wide open to special pleading, lobbying and even corporate blackmail. Once concessions of this sort are made, the Government has revealed its susceptibility to special pleading and, therefore, politicises the process by which it seeks to allocate resources. In the case of Kodak, which bears an obvious parallel to the initiative under consideration, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce implied that this was the case which proved the rule. It would now seem that it was the case which broke the rule. Of course, we have that circumstance of those funds going into Kodak. As I understand it, the Minister was asked on one occasion: how did Kodak receive such an allocation of government funds?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise to speak briefly on a very sad matter, namely, the death last Thursday of Dr Peter Rawlinson of La Trobe University, a former colleague, a very active conservationist and one who has performed extremely well in his academic area. I first came across Peter in the 1970s when we appeared together on a platform in relation to the adverse effects of agricultural chemicals. I also appeared with Peter on a number of occasions through the 1970s on public platforms and on a Four Corners program, I think as long ago as 1978. He was very concerned about the effects of such chemicals on the environment and on humans. He was very active in raising concerns, I recall, specifically over the substance 245-T.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Peter became a member of the Australian Conservation Foundation and in the last several years has been Treasurer of the Foundation. In that organisation he took an active interest in wildlife preservation and particularly the question of kangaroo populations and kangaroo culling. He was very active in a number of areas and operated against a very considerable background as a lecturer in biological sciences at La Trobe University. As I mentioned, he died last Thursday while on an expedition to a small island off the island of Krakatoa in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not generally recognised that science does not really establish absolute truths. Science is a way of looking at the world, a way of understanding the world in which we live. Science as such enriches our experience of the world around us. It should in that way make us much wiser people because it gives us a depth to our understanding of the world in which we live. It is unfortunate, however, that many scientists do not demonstrate this wisdom but rather make their services as scientists, or people trained in science, available to industry and particularly to the military industry. It is often said that over half the scientists in the world work in military science and a number of others become the unquestioning handmaidens of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are some scientists-Peter Rawlinson was one of these-who, with a deeper understanding of the world in which we live, undertake to attempt to build a much better world. That is why Peter actively engaged himself as a scientist in public debate on a number of issues of concern, and particularly those issues that have the potential either to build a better world for tomorrow or, on the contrary side, to damage the world in which our children will live. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect Peter Rawlinson was, fortunately, one of a growing band of scientists who do not live in ivory towers-who come out of their ivory towers and make their knowledge, their wisdom and their understanding applicable to ordinary, everyday life, to participate in the processes of social decision-making and to work very actively in every spare moment towards a much better world. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter Rawlinson was only 48 when he died and his death is a very great loss to Australia. I understand that there will be a memorial service at La Trobe University on Saturday the twenty-seventh of this month. I would certainly enjoin all people who have a concern for building a better world, who know of the work of Peter Rawlinson, if they are in Melbourne at that time to make every effort to attend the memorial service. I understand that he is survived by a wife and two children-people whom I have never met. I believe that everybody will extend very deep sympathy to Peter's family. His death is a great loss and something that I know the conservation movement throughout Australia is feeling very deeply at this time. </PARA>

<PARA> For the moment, I simply draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that on 15 March I appeared before a bank inquiry which, frankly, I believe I had partially caused to be put in place by the processes I had been pursuing in this place for 2 1/2 years. I appeared before that inquiry as a principle witness, accompanied by a barrister of the High Court of Australia and a barrister of the Supreme Court of Victoria. We presented 3,000 pages of evidence to the banking inquiry, 1,500 pages of which I have tabled progressively over 2 1/2 years before your very eyes, Mr President, in support of 70 cases that I have brought to the attention of the Senate. In addition, I tabled 1,500 pages of new evidence that had never been sighted by the Senate or by the banking inquiry and tabled, in confidence, the names of two former senior officers of the Westpac Banking Corporation who were prepared to interpret those documents for the banking inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I did that on a Friday. Two days later, on a Monday, at the first available public opportunity in an address to the society of economists in Sydney, Mr Martin chose to denigrate my evidence. I was appearing merely as a witness, in the same way as hundreds of others were appearing before the inquiry, providing evidence which in many cases very learned lawyers in support of the cases of many seriously damaged constituents had helped prepare. Mr Martin chose to make a glib statement that I had failed to provide evidence. He has admitted to me that he had not read the evidence that I had put before the inquiry in the ensuing two days. In so denigrating my presence before his Committee and the evidence I had provided, I think he irrevocably damaged the process of parliamentary committee inquiries-a matter of deep and profound seriousness to our Parliament and something which should be addressed in serious debate by both houses of our Parliament. I will be attempting to ensure that that debate occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> I make these comments purely as introductory remarks. At the end of his statement, Mr Martin said, `McLean had better put up or shut up'. I thought that I had been putting up for 2 1/2 years, and I shall continue to put up tonight. Honourable senators will be relieved that I am returning to the process of tabling before this chamber and before the Parliament solid, substantive evidence of allegations which I have been raising, and will continue to raise, of banking malpractice and corrupt practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The first three cases I brought before this chamber were those of Batiste, Rigg and Taylor. I attempted to elaborate on those before the bank inquiry as examples of what I had referred to as targeting and asset stripping. Indeed, we tabled a lot of evidence, which presumably Mr Martin has decided will not in fact be regarded, addressed or considered by his inquiry. I will continue to put it forward tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I return therefore to the matter of Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd and to imprudent bank lending practices in relation to that company because I think that that is a classic case, substantiated and documented by me progressively, of bank malpractice and corrupt practices. I have demonstrated in this place how officers of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia painted their bank into a corner. During December 1985, senior management of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia assumed responsibility for the administration of the company's overdraft account. In a memorandum dated 16 December 1985, which I have referred to previously, the Assistant General Manager, Mr R.A. Hill wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Senior Executive of this Administration became aware of the full situation in a memorandum of 5th December from Mr Simington . . . upon receipt of this memorandum the writer, in conjunction with D/C/M Mr Vanner, took the following action: Branch was informed that no further cheques were to be paid without reference to writer or D/C/M and all branches involved to be informed immediately of the stand being taken . . . Mr Burton, Deputy State Manager CDB--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Commonwealth Development Bank--</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney, has been fully acquainted with the situation and the stand being taken by the CBA . . . The matter is under the personal control of DCM, Mr Vanner . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I previously tabled that memorandum. It was among the documents, 1,500 pages of which I put before Mr Martin's Committee. The direction by Mr Hill was adhered to. In a memorandum, dated 23 December 1985, a senior manager of the New South Wales Southern Division, Mr K.M. Simington stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Cheques have been paid on a day to day basis but only if cash has been deposited to meet them . . . A number of cheques have been dishonoured with the answer ``Present Again'' but to date all cheques have been paid on representation. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table all of the documents from which I am quoting during the process of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that the Commonwealth Development Bank held a registered equitable mortgage over the assets and undertakings of Huon Valley Springs. One interest payment was due from the company to the Commonwealth Development Bank on 1 January 1986. If that payment was not met, the Commonwealth Development Bank could appoint receivers to the assets and undertakings of the company. If the payment for the interest was drawn against the overdraft account of the company, Mr Vanner could prevent the appointment of receivers by allowing payment to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Equally, Mr Vanner could refuse payment and the company would be in default to the Commonwealth Development Bank. The CDB was well aware of the implications if the interest was not paid. In a memorandum dated 31 December 1985, Mr K.I. Watson of the Commonwealth Development Bank head office wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The CBA are not paying cheques unless covered by funds lodged. So far Miss Batiste has been able to produce funds to cover, on representation, all cheques which have been dishonoured. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed Action</PARA>
<PARA>Check on payment of interest of $5,930.00 which falls due on 1st January, 1986. If not met, Sydney office is to pursue payment as a matter of top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>New Year's Day was a public holiday. The Commonwealth Development Bank could expect payment on the following day, and that is what happened. Given the priority attached to the payment, one would expect the Commonwealth Development Bank to make any necessary presentation to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for clearance of payment at the earliest practicable time. That apparently happened on 2 or 3 January. If for any reason the Commonwealth Bank of Australia did not meet the payments, one would expect alarm bells to be ringing at the Commonwealth Development Bank. Apparently, that did not happen. In addition, if there was nothing untoward going on, one would expect that the records of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Development Bank would coincide. They did not. The overdraft account of Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd at CBA's Park and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney branch, was number 2018-29-1976. I seek leave to table the account card. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bank statement on page 47 relating to that account has this entry: 2 JAN 86 CDB 5930.40. The entry represents payment of the interest to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Those who examined these documents will note that no cheque number is shown in the entry. This means that the company did not draw a cheque against the overdraft account payable to the Commonwealth Development Bank. That also means that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would have drawn-that is, issued a bank warrant or other means of inter-bank transfer from its own account against a corresponding debit to the company's account. If that is what happened, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia could not dishonour or reverse the payment to the Commonwealth Development Bank. The bank statement on page 48 purports to show this entry: 3 JAN 86 REV 5930.40 I repeat the words `purports to show'. The reverse side of the account card shows entries entitled `Dishonours for lack of funds'. The purported dishonour of $5,930.40 does not appear on 3 January 1986 or at any later time. Further, the purported dishonour does not appear on Miss Batiste's account card, which I have previously tabled. I say that the reason that the purported reversal did not appear on the account card was that on 3 January 1986 there was no reversal and there was no dishonour. In support of that contention, I refer to a memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank, dated 8 January 1986, in which the State Development Bank Manager of New South Wales, Mr J.W. Thompson said to the Commonwealth Development Bank head office:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We have been informed by CBA Park and Castlereagh Streets that our drawing for $5,930.40 representing interest charged in December has been returned unpaid. This does not yet reflect in the balance of our account. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those words: `This does not yet reflect in the balance of our account'. Why not? I suggest that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had honoured the payment. Mr Thompson took the matter further on the following day. In a memorandum dated 9 January 1986, Mr Thompson stated:</PARA>
<PARA>At the request of the CBA, I attended a meeting at NSW Branches Administration on 8th January, 1986. Others present were:-</PARA>
<PARA>Messrs. Robinson, Vanner and Simington-CBA; and Ian Cambourne-Legal Department</PARA>
<PARA> . . . CDB details need amendment as drawing for December, 1985 interest (payable January, 1986) has been returned unpaid. Balance is thus now approximately $506,000.00 and the loan is now in default to the extent of the unpaid interest . . . The Company was still trading but on the previous day CBA had declined a request to provide further accommodation. It had in fact taken the decision that the company was in an irretrievable financial position and that CBA should serve demand as it was convinced it could not salvage the greater part of its $3Million involvement . . .</PARA>
<PARA>CDB was asked what it intended to do . . . I replied that should borrower decide to close down its plant and operations . . . CDB would serve demand on the company . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This means that the question of the dis-honour and reversal was raised by officers of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the context of the decision to pull the plug on Huon Valley Springs. What makes the meeting on 8 January so extraordinary is that at the time CBA held $350,000 of company funds on interest bearing deposits. This fact was well known by the Commonwealth Development Bank. In a memorandum dated 9 January 1986, Mr Thompson stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Total CBA involvement with the company is $1,236,361.00 for which the only tangible security is a T/D (that is, Term Deposit) of $350,000.00. </PARA>
<PARA>What this means is that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had been placed in an untenable position because of its own imprudent lending practices and, in spite of the $350,000, was now going to `pull the plug' on Huon Valley Springs. What this also means is that the Commonwealth Development Bank was prepared to alter its records to show a default, in spite of the fact that its brother bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, had $350,000 on behalf of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia did not dishonour the payment and that the purported reversal is a fraud. I contend that when management of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia decided to `pull the plug' on the company, the overdraft account was manipulated and the records falsified to facilitate the appointment of a receiver. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegation that officers of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia manipulated an account and falsified records to facilitate proceedings against a customer is not new. That is what officers of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia did to Tony Rigg and his company. I pursued that case in this place and tabled that evidence before the bank inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia had a problem. If the bank statement page 48 was to be falsified to show a reversal of $5,930.40, subsequent statements would have to be falsified to take account of the revised debit balance. That means that the original statements would have to be destroyed and replaced with false statements. Mr President, I draw your attention to the handwritten note on the company's account card: `Destroy original of statements'. Those words speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia also had another problem. The officers of the CBA could hardly inform officers of the Commonwealth Development Bank how they were going to falsify the statements. They would have to take `pot luck' and hope that the officers of the Commonwealth Development Bank would not mess things up. But also, the officers of the Commonwealth Development Bank did mess things up-in a stupid and hopeless manner. I seek leave to table bank statements, pages 1 and 2, issued by the Commonwealth Development Bank to the receivers of the company on 30 June 1986. </PARA>

<PARA> I just want to record in the Hansard the passing early last week of Graham Greene, a great prolific writer in the English language, a great entertainer and a great storyteller. The fact of the matter is that he brought joy to many millions of people with his work, including over the years a number of senators whom I have seen reading Graham Greene novels in the chamber. For that reason, I wanted to make mention of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have a prepared speech. But the well-known Graham Greene novels include Brighton Rock, The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana and The Heart of the Matter. Perhaps one of the greatest books of all time about spies and secret agents was The Human Factor. I believe that these books will remain classics in the English language for some time to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Graham Greene also wrote some great short stories. There is a volume called Travels with My Aunt and another in Penguin called Journey Without Maps. These are great short stories and I would have no hesitation commending them to bored senators who want to fill in time between two speeches or something of that kind with a little bit of light, elegant and beautiful entertainment. He also wrote a great autobiographical book called A Sort of Life which described the earlier part of his own somewhat rich and fascinating life. </PARA>
<PARA> Graham Greene was many things. He was a diplomat. I might be doing him an injustice, but I think he was a member of MI5 during the war. He was certainly involved in the intelligence business during the war. He was a great traveller. He spent months and years in other countries. In fact, I have a book at home called Graham Greene Country in which extracts from his diaries are illustrated with beautiful drawings of places such as Saigon, Singapore and the south coast of France to which he went and lived. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to detain the Senate. I think the passing of Graham Greene should be recorded. I felt on the day it happened that the great prince had died and that that ought to be acknowledged. </PARA>

This should assist in expediting settlement of a significant number of cases as delays have occurred in the past where inadequate information has been provided by some taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>In the longer term, the move towards a self assessment form of tax administration will benefit taxpayers as additional resources are freed from processing work. These resources will be available to provide a comprehensive and targeted range of services to ATO clients.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The cost to revenue in the 1988/89 income year of personal income tax deductions for work related expenses such as tools of trade, uniforms, car and travel expenses, reference books and so on is estimated to be $1350 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The formal substantiation requirements do not apply where an employee's aggregate claims for work related expenses do not exceed $300 in the income year. Where the amount spent is less than $300, only the amount actually spent is claimable. A diary or other record should be kept to show how the claim was derived.</PARA>
<PARA> When introducing the substantiation provisions the Government weighed concerns regarding compliance costs against concerns regarding exploitation of areas of latitude in the tax system. In so doing, it formed the judgement that excluding from the formal substantiation requirements claims of up to $300 for work related expenses was a reasonable balance between concerns of compliance costs and preserving the integrity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The $300 exclusion is provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Act at Section 82kzb.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A deduction is only allowed for the amount of expenses actually incurred in earning income. For this reason, any increase in the specified limit will not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in claims for work related expenses. It may, however, prompt some taxpayers to make inflated claims which would result in a cost to revenue. The cost to revenue to raising the limit would therefore depend on the number of taxpayers who inflate their claims to the new limit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Most food items are exempt from the current wholesale sales tax. However, the following food items are taxable at the rate of 10 per cent:</PARA>
<PARA> * confectionery;</PARA>
<PARA> * biscuits;</PARA>
<PARA> * ice-cream;</PARA>

<PARA> The following food items are taxable at the rate of 20 per cent:</PARA>
<PARA> * beer, wine, whisky, brandy and other potable spirits;</PARA>
<PARA> * carbonated beverages.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Most clothing items are exempt from sales tax. However, articles made of fur skins such as fur coats, capes, caps, jackets and stoles are taxable at the rate of 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The total annual revenue collections from the wholesale sales tax were $9,402 million in 1988-89, and $10,132 million in 1989-90. The budget estimate for revenue collections from the wholesale sales tax in 1990-91 is $10,668 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As the Government has rejected implementation of a broad-based consumption tax, there has been no need to address possible inclusions or exclusions from such a tax base. However, as I have indicated on several occasions, it is not possible today to introduce a fully compensated consumption tax generating sufficient revenue to provide further reductions in marginal tax rates even where food and clothing are included in the tax base.</PARA>

<PARA> The value of the exemption from interest withholding tax provided by section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act is estimated at $225 million for 1989-1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for the exemption has been that interest withholding tax would largely or fully reflect in interest rates in the markets to which the exemption applies, and, if imposed, would therefore represent an additional cost for Australian business.
