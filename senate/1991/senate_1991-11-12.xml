<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I draw the Minister's attention to the call for intervention and assistance from the world powers by the Croatians caught in the battle against Yugoslav forces in Zagreb and Dubrovnik. Could the Minister inform the Senate what action the United Nations has taken towards obtaining a peaceful settlement of this war? Is the International Red Cross assisting with care of the sick and wounded in Zagreb and Dubrovnik? What access to information do Australian-Croatian families have about  relatives living in Zagreb and Dubrovnik?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2897" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I answered a question on this issue from Senator Hill yesterday, but Senator Jones's question takes the matter somewhat further and into a more specific area. As I said to Senator Hill yesterday, the international community is working towards a peaceful solution in Yugoslavia, and the European Community has now decided to impose economic measures against Yugoslavia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point of Senator Jones's question goes more to the suffering of particular communities and individuals in Yugoslavia. The International Red Cross has been heavily involved in helping the victims of the conflict. The International Red Cross has some 40 delegates in all of the major conflict areas in Yugoslavia. For example, the International Red Cross has been assisting the people of Dubrovnik as best it can, with parcels being sent to its local branch; it is intended to allow a relief vessel loaded with supplies into Dubrovnik in the next couple of days; and stocks of emergency medical supplies have been maintained at various centres throughout the country for distribution to hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Australians with families in Croatia and other parts of Yugoslavia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made a major effort to register with the Australian Embassy in Belgrade as many Australian citizens as possible residing in Yugoslavia. The number of registrations increased from about 50 before the crisis to about 6,000 now. Most of these people are dual nationals. About 167 registered Australians live in Zagreb and 19 in Dubrovnik. In most cases where the Department received inquiries about a relative who is an Australian citizen, contact was made and the information passed on to the family in Australia. Where the Embassy has not been able to make phone contact, it has had some success in making contact by telegram. Contact with Zagreb, even if somewhat roundabout, would still seem to be possible. In the one case where the Embassy has been trying to make contact with Dubrovnik, it has so far not succeeded. Where the relatives are not Australians, the Red Cross has been able to offer its assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department, through its posts and through the International Red Cross, is continuing its efforts to improve the information flow about particular dual nationals in Dubrovnik, Zagreb and elsewhere and to help in one way or another, and that will continue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Do Australian Government guidelines exist for Australian business investment in Burma and, if so, what are they? If not, in view of the appalling human rights record of the illegal military regime in Burma, including the continued incarceration of leaders of the elected Government, such as Nobel Peace Laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will the Minister consider drawing up guidelines for Australian business investment in Burma as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2898" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has taken action to ensure that no Australian exports of defence related goods are sent to Burma. It is also currently advocating an international arms embargo against Burma. However, apart from military related investments or exports, the Government has not issued any official guidelines relating to trade or investment in Burma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several reasons for that. Whether Australian companies wish to engage in commercial relationships with Burma is essentially a matter for the judgment of the companies. The fact is that Australian companies are not very active in Burma at all because of the abysmal record of the regime there. Its economic performance is not much better than its political record. Australia's trade and investment with Burma is very small and narrowly based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the third part of the question, in view of the small value of Australian investment and exports to Burma and the very restrictive foreign investment climate in that country, the formulation of investment guidelines has not been pursued by the Australian Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. What action is the Government planning to take on calls for a royal commission into organised crime now that the coroner has returned an open finding on the murder of Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2899" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that the coroner, Mr Ron Cahill, found that Assistant Commissioner Winchester was murdered but that the finding remains open as to who was responsible for the murder. I am sure that all honourable senators have followed with interest the inquest into that tragic assassination. It is the case that back in May 1990, I think in reply to questions from Senator Durack and Senator Hill, I indicated that if, at the end of Mr Cahill's inquiry, there were issues remaining or new issues came to light, they would be investigated and that if in our view that required a royal commission, that is what we should have. Certainly that has been the Government's attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have not yet had a chance to look at the vast amount of evidence evaluated by Mr Cahill in a very exhaustive process and a very comprehensive report, he does say&mdash;and I attach great weight to his saying&mdash;in his executive summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For my part, given the passing of time and the quality of the witnesses who make allegations of corruption, I cannot foresee a great deal of progress being made by any royal commission or inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>He did say that the question remained for the judgment of others, and that is true. I attach great weight to that observation by the coroner. I believe that it indicates that his findings, which have been so comprehensive and have been reached after such an exhaustive process, need to be given very considerable significance in any Government decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that over the time the inquest has been undertaken the National Crime Authority has taken a particular interest in the question of organised criminal activity among those few members of the Italian community who have a criminal propensity. In that regard, the National Crime Authority organised a conference in Canberra in November last year attended by various agencies, including from overseas the United States and in particular a delegation of Italian criminal justice agencies. Judge Falcone, who was then inquiring into the mafia in Sicily and who is now based in Rome&mdash;I had the pleasure of meeting him both here in Canberra and in Rome&mdash;was a very important figure in those consultations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very courageous man, as my colleague says. At its conclusion, that conference resolved to consolidate all relevant information from all agencies in Australia in one database; to ensure the provision to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence of all relevant current information; and to establish with respect to the national database appropriate intelligence analysis. I believe that has formed the basis for a very comprehensive examination of this type of criminal activity that is a phenomenon here in Australia. The report of that conference will be discussed at the National Crime Authority's operational intelligence dissemination conference to be held in Canberra later this month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that under Mr Justice Phillips, who has now been appointed as Chief Justice of the Victorian Supreme Court and, unfortunately, will have to leave his chairmanship of the National Crime Authority, there has been a very cooperative, collaborative attitude taken by all law enforcement agencies in Australia in relation to the question of organised crime in this country. I believe that they are well positioned to carry through with investigations. That will also be a matter which the Government will take into account and give great weight to in deciding whether it will respond to the calls for a royal commission which are associated with this tragic assassination of Assistant Commissioner Winchester.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no obligation to resign as Leader of the Government in the Senate. I am sometimes tempted because one gets bored if one has no intellectual challenges in this place. One gets bored if one is not inclined to suffer fools gladly&mdash;as I am not;  I suppose that is a bit of a weakness&mdash;and that question seriously arises if I am going to get these idiotic questions from people like Senator Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand Senator Baume's political sensitivities on all these issues. The political problem in Australia at the moment is this:  I confess that the majority of the community is not greatly enchanted with this Government at the present time. But I have to say that people are appalled by the prospect of the lot opposite. Everywhere we go in this country we get the same message: `We are a bit angry with you because of high levels of unemployment  but, God, do we have to face up to the possibility of even thinking about that other lot?'. That is what we get right across this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume talks about loyalty to leadership. He has had a pretty chequered record in all of this over the years, and it will continue. One of the problems which people address to me again and again is, `How could we cop that boring Dr Hewson?'. That is a problem which I understand the Opposition is peculiarly sensitive about. Indeed, on the Opposition's own front bench, people are asking that question day after day.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to a recent article in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS> regarding the high numbers of women without superannuation. The article claims that less than one-quarter of women aged 25 to 64 years have superannuation, compared with 58 per cent of males in the same age group. Could the Minister please explain whether this is correct and whether the measures introduced by the Government in the Budget go any way to remedying the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last part of this question asks, `Will the measures introduced in the Budget go part way to remedying this situation?'. In one fell swoop, the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy from 1 July next year will, in fact, remove the inequity that some workers in this society have access to superannuation and many others do not. It will be a quite significant social justice measure by this Government. It will enable these people&mdash;most of whom are women&mdash;to look forward to retirement with some dignity which, in the absence of superannuation cover, they are now denied. It will be a major social change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot directly corroborate the figures referred to in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS>; but I can go to the figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is a fair comment, looking at those figures, to say that there is massive discrimination against women in Australian society. According to the 1990 ABS figures, only 43.8 per cent of working women get superannuation cover in this country compared with 57.5 per cent of working men; 55.7 per cent of women who are full time workers get superannuation cover, but only 25.2 per cent of part time employees who are women get superannuation cover. In the retail section the figures are more alarming, despite the fact that award entitlements to superannuation are a standard in that industry sector. It is also true that thus far only 52 per cent of workers in that industry sector are in receipt of superannuation, despite their legal entitlement to coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee levy will remove this gap, remove these inequities and remove the sorry story of the past when only well paid elite and white collar workers got superannuation and if one happened to be a blue collar worker, by and large, one did not. It will ensure 100 per cent coverage of those workers. This will be evidence, of course, of a continuing concern by the Government to improve the status of women in Australian society, to reduce the earning gap between men and women as it now stands and to remove the structural and systematic discrimination women face in the work force.</PARA>

If Senator Crane is agitated and concerned about this matter, he ought to face up to the challenge I made to him when he last questioned me about this matter. If he conscientiously and seriously believes that I have misled the Senate, he may censure me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that on previous occasions in the Senate I have expressed my concern about what has become a very serious international problem, with the loss or serious damage to 39 bulk carriers since January last year, six of which were carrying Australian cargoes, along with the loss of the bow of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off Western Australia. I indicated to the Senate that it was Australia's intention to pursue, in whatever avenues we could, our concern about this at the international fora that are available for this purpose and to attempt, in the first instance by international agreement, to get an extension of the port inspection program that operates in this country. I am pleased to advise the Senate that we have now had the opportunity to do this. Australia, along with a number of other countries that are similarly concerned, has achieved a positive result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMO seventeenth regular session of its biennial assembly concluded in London last week. The IMO has a membership of 135 nation states. Its principal safety and pollution prevention conventions apply to about 97 per cent of the world's shipping. The meeting passed a resolution permitting an extension of the current port state control inspection program. This program enables Australia and other signatories to the conventions to conduct inspections of foreign ships visiting their ports. The extension provides a basis for more effective protection of our ports and marine environment by encouraging examination of the ships' crews performance of basic on-board safety related functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said to the Senate before, one of the serious problems with foreign shipping in Australia is not only the physical condition of the ships but also the very poor state of training of their crews. This examination would include communication and proficient operation of equipment involved with lifesaving, firefighting and pollution prevention. Deficiencies in these aspects of ship operation have been identified as factors in recent shipping accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the most recent session of the IMO's maritime safety committee, a working group was established to monitor the extent of compliance of its members with major conventions. This is in the light of clear breaches of these requirements by certain flag states, demonstrated by the results of port state control inspections. Australia, through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's representations, will be seeking participation in that working group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMO is also reviewing the cause of vessel loss through its specialist subcommittee structure and AMSA will be making an input to this as well. In particular, AMSA will be submitting the findings from its recently commenced pilot study to investigate the way in which existing ship and terminal data on bulk carrier loadings may be used to identify and quantify possible factors in recent ship losses. I would add that these ship losses have occasioned very significant loss of human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study complements research programs also being conducted by international classification societies and other bodies to examine factors possibly relevant in recent vessel losses, including the design of the vessels, ageing, loading and discharge methods, heavy weather and cargo types. Australia supports this activity within the international community to reduce the current alarmingly high loss of life associated with recent ship losses.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of claims in the media that, rather than becoming a clever country, Australia is now a stupid society; that while other countries have computers and other technology as their highest growth industries, Australia has real estate? We are in fact selling the farm. In view of this, while the Minister rightly supports fast tracking major projects costing over $100m, which often have only very small employment prospects, he refuses to support a number of smaller projects such as the world patented collapsible container which has the potential to create 2,000 jobs and save up to $100m by reducing empty sea container movements, all for a cost of $25m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a very clever question. I am not aware of claims in the media that Australia is a stupid society rather than a clever country. I guess Senator Walters has distilled that from page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> where there were a number of figures relating to growth areas in the Australian economy during the 1980s. If Senator Walters compares those figures with the figures for the 1970s and the 1960s, she will find there is not much difference between them in terms of growth areas and activity. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To be quite frank, I do not know about these collapsible containers that Senator Walters is talking about.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I understand that. I now have to deal with Senator Crichton-Browne's interjection. When we are diversifying an economy from one which was 80 per cent dependent on raw materials to one which is significantly less dependent on raw materials as exports, we start from a low base. I think I am not going overboard when I say that the growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, has been phenomenal in the last few years. There was a 26 per cent growth in manufactured exports last year, and most of it to the Asia-Pacific region. There was a more significant proportion than ever before of elaborately transformed manufactures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there has been a considerable international enhancement of Australia's profile as producers of high quality scientific instruments and high quality software; and good providers of systems integration and a variety of engineering capacities. The reputation of this country has grown significantly. I will certainly follow up this answer by giving Senator Walters figures on the growth in elaborately transformed manufactured exports over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I should make is that there has also been a significant growth in R and D and a significant growth in relationships between R and D institutions and industry, which has been proceeding fairly satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters ended her question by asking me whether we should concentrate on employment rather than exports. My answer is that, important as employment is, it is not susceptible to a simple answer. Those companies in Australia which have had fewer reductions in employment have been export companies. Export companies, in times of a recession, have a cushion against a downturn in the domestic market because of their export activities. Exports engender a whole range of indirect employment opportunities, apart from those directly employed in a particular exporting business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If subsidised products are entering the market in Australia to compete with properly produced Australian products there are, if that involves any question of dumping, anti-dumping mechanisms to which I have referred. The Government, in its most recent industry statement, announced that the regulations and procedures to deal with anti-dumping complaints have been modified. That is to facilitate exactly the sort of complaint that is now more frequently being voiced&mdash;that the procedures required some refurbishing in order to speed up dealing with genuine anti-dumping complaints. It is not a matter for the Government to initiate those actions; it is for those who believe that dumping is occurring and are offended by it to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the other issues in this question, I am advised that there have been recent price negotiations between potato growers and processors in Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria, and that the agreed prices for this season are lower than last year but that this is as a result of the prevailing market conditions in Australia. I think the implication of Senator Boswell's question was that prices have changed because of external factors. The advice that I am given is that in the negotiations between growers and processors, prices have changed because of a number of other conditions relative to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised that the risk to Australian producers from imports of potatoes from overseas is very low. For example, potato imports accounted for less than one per cent of the total consumption of potatoes produced last year. In the case of corn&mdash;another issue which Senator Boswell mentioned in his question&mdash;there is a similar situation. With respect to tomatoes, there are imported processed products. This matter is being considered as an anti-dumping case and it will be reported on by 5 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should note that Australia is, on the whole, a net exporter of horticultural products. The Government has always acknowledged the concerns of growers, but the concerns expressed are required to be grounded in facts, and the facts from which concerns are expressed are not always justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Boswell would know because we have often debated this matter here, Australia is on the record as not hiding behind artificial trade barriers and subsidies. That is our position, and it is confirmed by the position we have adopted in the GATT Round in order to try to loosen artificial restrictions on agricultural trade in the world and open up a free trade in agricultural products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves us to conduct our affairs properly and with principle in order to see that we, as the advocate for freer trade, are not fingered by some of the people we are targeting for applying different conditions to ourselves from the ones we are asking them to apply to themselves.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would have to say that Senator Walters was the person who first raised this in Estimates committees. I undertook to follow the matter up with Mr Howe, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, who has primary responsibility for the institutions which are affected. As a result of that consultation, it has been decided that clients of the larger accommodation services who are required to pay a contribution based on a percentage of the pension plus rent assistance should have their contribution calculated as a percentage of the applicable pension plus rent assistance rather than at the full adult rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of that is to reduce the contributions which would have been payable by young people who are granted this new disability support pension after today. It will ensure that they will have sufficient disposable income to meet their needs. There is obviously a flow-on effect in that some service providers must inevitably suffer a reduction in the amount that they receive. I think the Government has to take some steps to rectify that. So, consistent with the intentions of the disability reform package to protect the interests of both accommodation service providers and clients, those service providers will be reimbursed under the Disability Services Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act for any reduction in income they might suffer as a result of the new system, which begins from today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the National Health Act or the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, a different approach will apply. It will include a change in that legislation scheduled for the autumn session. Residents of services funded under those Acts will continue to pay the full adult contribution. However, they will be reimbursed so their contribution is only a percentage of the 16- to 20-year-old rates. We estimate that all of that should affect only 280 people in a full year. It is not going to affect a great many people, but obviously for those 280 it is a pretty vital decision.</PARA>

This system will also enable monitoring of the effect of the AMA's call for GPs to stop bulkbilling.</PARA>

A comprehensive strategy for monitoring and evaluating the proposed longer term reforms of general practice announced in the Budget will be developed as the details of these reforms are worked through with the medical profession, as I answered in hopeful tones to a question asked by Senator Herron yesterday. This is only the beginning of the various systems that need to be put in place in order to monitor the impact of the changes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the Minister aware that, despite the present record levels of unemployment, particularly in rural areas, fruit growers are having difficulty recruiting workers to pick fruit? Would the Minister accept that at least part of the reason is that the new training allowance arrangements provide a positive disincentive to workers to work more than two days a fortnight because, if they earn any more, they would lose their benefit and then take weeks to become eligible again? Unless they work more than five days a fortnight, they are actually financially better off to work only two days per fortnight. Is the Government aware of this anomaly, which must also affect other industries, and is it intending to make any changes to the present scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill raises the point and draws conclusions in respect of a scheme on the basis of an allegation he makes about fruit growers and their difficulty in finding staff. That portion of the fruit industry is probably not a good one to use as a benchmark on which to assess a broad government program. I do not have any information as to the difficulty growers have in obtaining staff. I do know from my personal experience, through university days, that there are all sorts of reasons why people went fruit picking and all sorts of reasons that discouraged them from so doing. I take on board the more substantive part of the honourable senator's question but, in doing so, reject that any broader inference can be drawn from or any broader judgment made on a government program, based on the presumption Senator Brownhill alleges.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I would like to bring to the notice of the Senate just a few points in the annual report of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Chairman of the Corporation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impediments to export, principally the exchange rate, high internal and transport costs are well recognised and put Australian producers and exporters at a disadvantage to their significant Southern Hemisphere competitors. However, if the industries are to survive, then we must find ways to overcome these impediments. Solutions will only be achieved by a co-operative effort with each participant in the discussions respecting the views and contributions of the others.</PARA>
<PARA>I also bring to the notice of the Senate a question I asked in Question Time. People in some horticultural industries are having a lot of trouble getting casual workers because of a disincentive for them to work when they are in receipt of the training allowance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the example of seasonal fruit and vegetable pickers. During the harvesting season, growers are desperate for pickers but potential pickers have no incentive to take on work because if they do they can lose the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not quite get the answer from the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) that I wanted. At the moment, casual agricultural workers can earn approximately $360 a week. But there is no incentive for pickers on the training allowance to undertake extra casual work if they receive between $140 and $368 a fortnight. Their optimum level of income is something like $140 a fortnight. At this level they can maximise their income by working the minimum number of hours. This optimum level is achieved by working approximately two days a fortnight. Until agricultural workers receive an income exceeding $368, which occurs after working five days a fortnight, they do not improve their financial position by one cent, despite working an extra three days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should be looking at setting a two-week pay period over which the training allowance is broken down into 10 working days. Benefit recipients who work over that period would then have deducted from their training allowance a set amount of the total benefit for every full day they work, irrespective of the wages paid. I believe that that would be a help to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further on, the report states that the developing challenge by Chile and Argentina to our traditional Asian apple and pear markets is a growing concern. The report says that to retain or regain these markets better shipping arrangements are essential. Obviously, we all know a bit about some of our shipping arrangements and some of the problems on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point relates to food safety. Perhaps Senator Crowley might like to add to this, because I know she was on the agricultural and veterinary chemicals inquiry. The Australian Horticultural Corporation played a major role in the establishment in 1990 of a `fresh produce watch', the objective of which is to provide information on chemical residues to the community and to the fresh fruit and vegetable industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have good respect for our environment from the people who grow fruit and vegetables and all the other horticultural products. If we are to compete against the rest of the world, it is essential that we use the value of being an isolated continent, away from all the contaminants which exist in other parts of the world, so that we can sell our produce. This is the area in which the fresh produce watch will achieve much for our export industries, especially in the horticultural field. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This Auditor-General's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Migration Program&mdash;Concessional Family and Independent Entrant Migration </EMPHASIS>is of some significance because it deals with the clear need for improvement in procedures in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs relating to the migration program for concessional family and independent entry migration. The report focuses on two categories of migration: independent entry and concessional family. Together, these account for 49,000 of the 111,000 places in the 1991-92 migration program. Applicants for both programs are selected on the basis of points testing, including skill and employability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key findings of this Auditor-General's report was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in recent years considerable attention has been paid to the need for Australia to become `the clever country' and policies and programs in several portfolios have taken account of the national requirement for upgrading the skills of Australian workers, investment in new technologies, and encouragement of a range of activities in which the nation could develop a basis for competition with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The report says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This audit dealt with selection of migrants in categories involving the assessment and testing of employability and skill and rating applicants on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the significant conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the national interest in `the clever country' it might have been expected that the process would reflect rising standards and a high priority to selecting persons with skills needed in the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Auditor-General found something quite to the contrary, and it is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of the audit's conclusions suggest, however, that other policy priorities have received greater attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In Family migration, the program structure places the skill tested Concessional Family category on a `residual' basis thus according it a lower priority than the Preferential Family category which is not skill tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A higher than estimated number of approvals in the `demand-driven' Preferential Family category leads to reducing numbers selected in the skill tested category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Changes in the points test suggest a partial withdrawal from a formerly close nexus between occupational skills, qualifications and experience. It is now less difficult for some applicants to be classified as skilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Comparing the skill tested categories, Concessional Family applicants receive the advantage in the points test of a lower Pass mark than Independent Entry applicants, and may also receive substantial points towards the mark from family connections with a sponsor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The test process accords only marginal additional recognition to skills and occupations in short supply in Australia. There are no adjustments to reflect occupations in oversupply.</PARA>
<PARA>The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These factors influence the process in directions away from the selection of the most skilled applicants, whose employment could make a substantial contribution towards the objective of a better skilled Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA>This is fairly damning criticism of the Department's approach to immigration and, of necessity, the approach of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and the Government. The debate on immigration has heated up in recent times. One would have thought that the Government would be a little more sensitive not only to the economic requirements but also to the general requirements in the area of migration, particularly at a time when the level of immigration is falling substantially. Having increased to something like 140,000 in 1989-90, it is now declining to 111,000 in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Auditor-General's comments are particularly serious. Simply on a spot audit basis, the Auditor-General points out not only that more weight appears to be given to non-skill factors but also that some bad decisions appear to have been made. The Auditor-General considers, as a result of the spot audit, that the Department should closely monitor the effect of the change by direct analysis of applicant point scores. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DILGEA's method of classifying skilled arrivals and evaluating the skill outcome would not disclose the numbers of migrants with the lower levels of experience permitted by the 1990-91 test. The ANAO considers there is scope for adjustment to points test arrangements to provide a higher level of recognition of skills in short supply, and to discourage applications from persons in occupations in which there are no shortages.</PARA>
<PARA>As to whether the wrong sorts of people may have been getting in, the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the results indicated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the audit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that more weight had been given to factors such as an applicant's relationship with a permanent resident than to misconduct, including alleged breaches of the law. Some cases had been approved despite questionable actions by applicants.</PARA>
<PARA>This is quite serious stuff. It extends beyond the level of whether it is the right theoretical structure to apply to one's migration program. There are also, obviously, concerns about the actual checking of the people who have come in. In addition, the Auditor-General deals with the general question of quality assurance. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO found that some supervisory checking of decision makers took place, and some rejected applications were reviewed through appeal procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the methods observed were inadequate to provide an organised program of quality assurance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, decisions are being made which do not have an organised program of quality assurance. In all, this is a very important document. I commend the Auditor-General for the report. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and India and Australia and Poland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will insert the texts of the agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Polish and Indian agreements, which were signed on 7 May 1991 and 25 July 1991 respectively, deal with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and those countries. Details of each agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at time of signature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both agreements generally accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years but the agreement with India differs from them in certain respects. Those differences reflect a balancing of Australia's interests with India's position as a major developing country and importer of technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A notable feature of the agreement with India in that regard is the royalty provisions, which prescribe different source country tax rate limits for various categories of royalty payments and provide for fees for services to be treated as royalties in specified limited circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another feature of the agreement with India is that it provides for "tax sparing" credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by India under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, the agreement calls for a tax credit to be allowed by Australia for the Indian tax forgone. By this means, the development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian firms and allow them to compete for business in India on favourable terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement with India will enter into force when the Australian and Indian Governments have exchanged diplomatic notes advising each other that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in their respective countries have been completed. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion of the agreement with Poland is indicative of Australia's support for that country's moves towards democratic structures and economic reforms. That agreement will enter into force on the date of exchange of instruments of ratification. This ratification process would also follow the enactment of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and India and Australia and Poland, but it is not possible to predict the eventual effect on the revenue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new withholding tax will not represent a new source of revenue to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, the measure will, in conjunction with the amendments proposed by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, support the existing tax file number legislation and ensure that an effective sanction is applied where a tax file number is not quoted for the deferred interest investments covered by the new arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the income thresholds below which married couples and sole parents will not be called on to pay any levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 1991-92, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,745 will not be required to pay the levy. This threshold is unchanged from the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $19,674 will not be required to pay the levy for the income year 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will continue to be increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a married couple with three dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $25,974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the increased low income threshold is nil in 1991-92 and $10 million in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in low income thresholds will not be reflected in provisional tax raised for 1991-92 as the amounts involved would be very small for individual taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not proposed to amend the tax instalment schedules to take account of the change until 1 July 1992. The number of people from whom the levy is deducted in PAYE instalments and who would be affected by the change would be relatively small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand changing the PAYE instalment schedules would involve an administrative cost to the Government and there would also be a substantial administrative cost to the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying this Bill contains more detailed explanation of the provisions of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2)  1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must have effective immigration controls  to ensure that only those persons who are entitled to enter and remain in Australia do so. This Bill contains amendments to the  Immigration Act 1958 which will strengthen the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls. These amendments will place in the Migration Act a power to obtain information to identify and locate illegal entrants and create offences relating to the arrangement and use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships to obtain residence in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes a power to limit the number of applications which may be considered within a specified class of visa or entry permit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will not tolerate the continued presence of illegal entrants in Australia. In August 1990, we introduced an enhanced compliance strategy which included measures to reduce the number of people illegally in Australia and to discourage further illegal entrants. These measures were further bolstered by the provision of additional resources in this year's budget. They are producing results. However, additional powers are necessary to detect illegal entrants, including overstayers. The Government must be able to obtain information about their identity and location. The information gathering provisions included in the Bill will authorise the Minister to obtain information, including documents, about the identity or whereabouts of suspected illegal entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government recognises that a person's privacy should not be intruded upon without clear justification. The provisions of proposed Division 1A allow information or documents to be sought only where the Minister has reason to believe that the person in relation to whom the information is sought is an illegal entrant. Furthermore, the provisions can only be used where the person from whom the information is sought is capable of providing it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators, there are people who will go to extreme lengths to enter or remain in Australia. These lengths include entering into contrived marriages or de facto relationships with Australian citizens or permanent residents. While there are cases where the Australian party willingly lends himself or herself to the contrived relationship, it should also be pointed out that there are cases where the Australian party is misled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships for obtaining residence in Australia is unacceptable. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations and the Migration Committee of the National Population Council have examined the use of contrived marriages and de facto relationships to gain residence in Australia. The result has been strong recommendations to Government to adopt firm measures to discourage this practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will not tolerate the activities of persons conducting business as arrangers of false marriages or de facto relationships for migration purposes. Severe penalties are necessary to punish those involved and to discourage any other persons from considering involvement in this disgraceful business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangement of a non-genuine marriage or de facto relationship for migration purposes will be punishable by a penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000 or both.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also essential that the Government discourage persons from entering into fraudulent relationships. For this reason a term of 2 years imprisonment may be imposed on the Australian citizen or permanent resident who is convicted of nominating another person as his or her spouse where that person has no intention of living in a genuine and continuing marital or de facto relationship. The person who applies for residence on the basis of the contrived relationship may not only be subject to two years imprisonment upon conviction, but may also be removed from Australia as an illegal entrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This complements the Government's earlier introduction of longer qualification periods to demonstrate the genuine and continuing nature of relationships and to discourage fraudulent relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has been advised that there are a number of people providing supporting statements which claim that others are in a genuine and continuing relationship when in fact they are not. It is necessary for the law to provide a check to ensure that persons making supporting statements are certain of their facts. Offences have been created for knowingly making a false or misleading statement, or making a false or misleading statement without having made sure that the statement was correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These offences will only be operative when the departmental form on which the supporting declaration is made contains a warning of the penalties for making such false or reckless statements. Persons wishing to provide supporting statements will be clearly warned by the notice on the form of the possible consequences if their statement is false or misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives it made no provision for penalising fraudulent interdependency relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the rules which apply to such relationships have only recently been regulated there is no evidence of fraud in this category. However the sentiments expressed by the Opposition on this issue in the House were taken into account and the Government amended the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This extends the scope of the fraudulent relationships provisions. The offences which relate to non genuine marital and defacto relationships are now mirrored in relation to the interdependency category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will recall that on 30 April of this year the Minister announced the Government's decision to introduce a `special assistance' category in the 1991-92 migration program. This new category has been established to target people in need who do not meet the refugee and other special humanitarian criteria but who nevertheless are considered by the Government to have special humanitarian claims on Australia. In the past these groups did not qualify under existing program criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `special assistance' category will be introduced by regulation. As announced in April, decisions will be made each year by the Government on groups which are identified as being eligible and the numbers which can be accommodated. The Government recognises that program capacities will be limited. For this reason the Bill will amend the Act to allow the Minister by gazettal to set a limit on the number of places available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes proposed by clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill mean that once the announced program limit is reached there would be no further consideration of applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These application `capping' powers will only apply to those classes where use of the power is specifically permitted under the regulations. The powers are, in effect, an extension of the capping powers already found in sections 28 and 40 of the Act. As I have mentioned, their introduction is principally intended to give effect to the new `special assistance' category. The Government does not rule out the possibility of using the powers in relation to other humanitarian responses which may need to be put in place in the future. We need to have available the legislative tools to respond flexibly to the growing mass movement of peoples throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators can be assured that this power will not be used in relation to preferential family cases. This would be consistent with the approach already reflected in sections 28 and 40 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any person who lodges a fee with an application which is subject to the capping power will have the fee returned if the application falls outside the capped number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment to be made to the Migration Act by this Bill will allow criteria in the regulations to include, by reference, matters published by notice in the gazette from time to time. This will overcome the limitation imposed by section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act requiring these notices to be in existence at the time the regulation is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Mr President, these amendments demonstrate the Government's continued vigilance to ensure that the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls is maintained and, where necessary, enhanced so that only those persons with a right to enter and remain in Australia may do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amending provisions will not impact on the costs of administering the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 will simplify the statutory procedures for approval of new coin issues under the Currency Act 1965 and remove potential ambiguities in the wording of sections 13 and 14 of that Act. The Bill also effects two minor amendments to the Financial Corporations Act 1974, and repeals the Special Employment-related Programs Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory procedures under the Currency Act 1965 for the approval of new coins, or variations to design or other characteristics of existing denominations, were drawn up at a time when the number of new numismatic or collector coins was very small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in recent years there has been a considerable increase in the number of such coins being issued under the programmes of both the Royal Australian Mint and the Gold Corporation, a statutory authority of the WA Government that produces precious metal coins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present arrangements, considerable administrative effort is required before the necessary Executive Council approval is obtained for any variation to the currency regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the drafting and preparation of additional documentation, the procedures can involve time delays, particularly as executive council only meets periodically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such delays can create difficulties for the marketing programmes associated with the launch of new collector coins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to sections 13 and 14 of the Currency Act contained in this Bill are designed primarily to provide the Treasurer with the authority to approve new coins, or determine variations to designs or other characteristics of existing denominations by means of a disallowable instrument, thereby dispensing with the need to refer such matters to the Executive Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that this simplified procedure will offer administrative savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all other respects, the effect of the arrangement will be the same as the making of a regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, there will be the same opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny as that which currently exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments to sections 13 and 14 of the Currency Act are designed to remove possible ambiguities arising from the amendments to the Act made in 1987 to facilitate the production of the same coin denomination in different metallic compositions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Financial Corporations Act 1974 will permit the Treasurer to delegate to the Governor or Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia the responsibility for varying and publishing the list of non-bank financial institutions which fall under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also permit the Treasurer to publish the varied list in a manner or form he or she thinks appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are intended to simplify administrative processes but do not affect the substance of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Special Employment-Related Programs Act 1982 was enacted by the former Fraser Government to appropriate moneys saved under wage pause arrangements for Commonwealth employees up to a total of $300 million for the purposes of employment generating programs. The Act provided that subsidies were not to be payable in respect of employment after 30 June 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By agreement with the States, who administered the program, $200 million was allocated for employment programs and the remaining $100 million was provided for welfare housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All activities under the Act are obviously complete and all moneys paid out have been satisfactorily accounted for. As the Act is now spent, the Government is taking the opportunity afforded by the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill to remove it from the statute books.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES GRANTS (TAFE ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 provides for initial grants to the States for TAFE for 1992 and for supplementation to 1991 grants to reflect increases in price levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill implements the Budget decision to provide for a real increase of 5% in Commonwealth recurrent grants to TAFE. This is in line with the recommendations of the 1990 Deveson Report into training costs. Overall levels of funding for TAFE will be reviewed further in the context of the consideration by State, Federal and Territory Ministers of the findings of the recently released Finn Committee Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the changes is that the Bill provides for $157,385,000 for Recurrent funding and $215,528,000 for Capital funding in 1992 and an additional $1,660,000 for Recurrent funding for 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO.2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, which provides for Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for higher education purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides funds for higher education amounting to some $3.6 billion in 1994, i.e. the third year of the new funding triennium, 1992-94. This amount takes into account the Government's decisions to provide, in 1994, some $44 million for 2845 additional student intakes, some $277 million for capital works and additional funds amounting to just under $75 million for a new funding program to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education. These decisions were announced subsequent to those on higher education which formed part of the Government's 1991-92 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's new funding program to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education is one of a number of initiatives to promote quality and diversity in the development of higher education through the 1990s. The focus of the Government's new policies is a comprehensive set of measures to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education teaching and provision. The extra funds will be used to reward institutions for making the best use of all their available resources. The Higher Education Council has been asked to explore the characteristics of quality in higher education. After the Council reports on this reference, and following wider consultation with the higher education sector, a national structure, independent of government, will be established to report on the application and effectiveness of quality enhancement measures developed by institutions. A National Centre for Teaching Excellence in higher education is to be set up next year to examine and disseminate information about good teaching practices. Funding will also be made available for a pilot credit transfer project, under the aegis of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, which the Government hopes will lead to the establishment of a national credit transfer agency. In addition, a comprehensive review of modes of delivery in higher education will be conducted to look at how technology can best be harnessed to improve access to, and the quality and efficiency of, higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these measures, the Government is taking the lead internationally in providing a funding incentive to institutions, over and above funding for student load, to promote the highest possible level of quality in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be stressed that institutional participation in the new quality assurance arrangements will be voluntary and the allocation of normal operating grants will be unaffected. It is certainly not the Government's intention to use the new arrangements to redistribute operating grants to institutions on the basis of comparative quantitative performance indicators. These quality assurance initiatives will be developed hand in hand with all of the main interest groups within the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth emphasising also that the Government's approach to quality assurance balances institutional autonomy with public accountability. It is based primarily on self assessment by institutions rather than relying on external assessments of quality. It relates the monitoring of quality to the goals of individual institutions. It involves assessments which include both qualitative and quantitative indicators. It allows for comparisons to be made against the different circumstances of institutions, including the composition of their student population, and their performance over time. It should thereby encourage diversity and innovation while confirming public confidence in the higher education system and reinforcing its international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for a number of decisions on higher education announced in the Budget. It includes provisions to widen the definition of higher education capital projects to encompass other than simply building projects. This will enable the Government to support major investments in course material and equipment which are genuine capital substitutes. The wider definition recognises the potential for new technologies and alternative delivery modes to improve delivery of, and access to, higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the Government's decisions aimed at addressing enrolment and overcrowding pressures being felt in higher education institutions. To this end, just under $10 million has been allocated for additional student intakes next year with additional funds to take account of the pipeline effect of these intakes. As well, an additional $54 million is being provided for capital projects next year to alleviate pressures of overcrowding, of which some $24 million is funding originally earmarked for 1994. About half of these funds will be used to assist institutions to refurbish and renovate existing space. These funds will be provided on a matching basis with institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pilot scheme will begin next year which will see the Government and employers sharing the costs of providing a number of additional student intakes, with the Commonwealth's share at 60 percent. The Government has allocated just under $3.5 million for up to 600 new student intakes in 1992 and some $4 million for 700 intakes in both 1993 and 1994 with additional funds for the pipeline effects of these intakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides funds for a Commonwealth program to establish three advanced engineering centres in partnership with host institutions and industry. The focus of the centres will be on advanced undergraduate and postgraduate education and training.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on this Bill was adjourned last evening I was describing the purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991, which is a traditional machinery Bill which implements the decisions agreed at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council on 31 May this year.  The Bill provides for general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1991-92 for an amount totalling $13.7 billion.  That is approximately half the total Commonwealth payments to the States this financial year, the other half being paid in the form of special purpose grants basically under section 96 of the Constitution, which special purpose grants, of course, have particular terms, conditions and strings attaching to them in terms of their usage.  The Bill implements the decision to pay to the States the $13.7 billion in general purpose payments, without any strings attached, for use by the States in whatever way they wish to use those funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, of course, does not oppose this Bill.  It is a traditional machinery Bill and we will be supporting it, although I will be moving an amendment to the second reading motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also said last night before the debate was adjourned that the fact that yesterday the Premiers very understandably decided to abandon their participation in the Special Premiers Conference which was scheduled for Perth on 21 and 22 November&mdash;that is, next week&mdash;is a very sad decision indeed.  It was a very understandable decision on the part of the States, given the conditions that the Commonwealth was imposing on that conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that conference was to be the third Special Premiers Conference which followed the initiative by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in July of 1990 to establish a series of Special Premiers Conferences to examine fundamental reform of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States in various ways: firstly, to delineate better and more clearly than exists now the responsibilities and the functions as between the Commonwealth and the States. We have seen over many decades an increasingly centralist trend in government in Australia, whereby the Federal Government&mdash;the Commonwealth Government, the central government of the day&mdash;has taken unto itself an increasing number of powers and functions that are traditionally and constitutionally the preserve of the States. One thinks particularly of the areas of education and health and, in the broad sense of the term, many areas of social welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an encroachment by the Federal Government over the State governments for many decades now, and one of the important things that have to be done in this nation of ours, as we move towards the twenty-first century and want to have a more efficient and more competitive federal system, is to have a clearer separation of the functions and a clearer understanding and agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of who is to do what, which are the functions that should be done by the Commonwealth Government and which are the functions that should be done by State and, of course, local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was an essential part of the process that was envisaged in the Special Premiers Conference machinery. But the other part, and the part without which none of the rest can follow in any lasting and meaningful term, was to have a fundamental review of the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, to look at and to do something about the very dramatic imbalance that now exists between the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and the States, on the other, in terms of their relative responsibilities for spending from the public purse and putting money into the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, 50 per cent or thereabouts of every dollar of taxpayers' money in this nation that is spent is spent by State governments. But State governments raise only about 20 per cent of the total public sector revenue that is raised. They therefore have a very dramatic, very sharp, imbalance between what they spend, on the one hand, and what they raise, on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Commonwealth Government also spends about 50 per cent of each taxpayer's dollar. But it raises close to 80 per cent of all the revenue raised by governments in Australia. That relative imbalance between the Commonwealth and the States in terms of their revenue raising and spending responsibilities is known in this terrible jargon as vertical fiscal imbalance. It is the mismatching between the revenue raising responsibilities, on the one hand, and the spending responsibilities, on the other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why do we not just say that? Senator Kernot is quite right. If we can think of a simpler and less arcane term than `vertical fiscal imbalance' then the debate on this very important subject might be better understood than it is. Indeed, it might be better understood how important the whole debate is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point to be made is this: unless we do something to correct that imbalance in the financial area between the Commonwealth and the States then we are never going to get a proper functioning of the federal system in the way in which it has always been envisaged to function. The reform of Federal-State relations and in particular Federal-State financial relations&mdash;because, as I said, that is what sets the pattern for everything else that happens&mdash;was to be a fundamental part of the Special Premiers Conference process. It was the whole reason for establishing the Special Premiers Conferences. It is arguably the most important micro-economic reform that could be undertaken in this Federation of ours over the next 10 years as we move into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the Commonwealth and in particular the Prime Minister, having given the States and the Territories every expectation that the Commonwealth was prepared to look at this subject, have in recent days&mdash;and it has culminated in the last 24 hours&mdash;completely stepped aside from any prospect now of achieving those worthwhile reforms. Because the Commonwealth Government has said that it is no longer prepared to consider this as an option for debate&mdash;it will not allow it to be on the agenda of the conference that had been planned for next week&mdash;there is no chance of solving this financial mismatch between the Commonwealth and the States through any hand back to the States of income taxing powers or any arrangement to have an income tax sharing arrangement with the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have done so&mdash;and the Prime Minister has announced this&mdash;on the flimsiest of explanations and indeed on explanations which are absolutely contrary to what he put to, and agreed with, the Premiers at the first Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane last year and again at the second Special Premiers Conference in Sydney just three or four months ago. Indeed, let me quote one small part of the communique of the first Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in October 1990, just over a year ago. It said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaders and representatives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the leaders of Commonwealth, State and local governments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have agreed on the need for a fundamental review of Commonwealth/State financial arrangements. . . In this review the Commonwealth and the States recognise the need to address the question of vertical imbalance. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then again at the second Special Premiers Conference only three or four months ago, in July&mdash;which, by the way, the Prime Minister described in his normal modest way as the most important post-war Premiers Conference&mdash;the Prime Minister and especially his offsider, the then new Treasurer, Mr Kerin, repeated that positive flavour of the first conference. The conference communique reflected that optimistic approach by including the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the examination of issues is not yet complete some preliminary conclusions are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. A very large reduction in the existing degree of vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the States could be made before the existing arrangements for horizontal fiscal equalisation would be called into question. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . . the medium term focus of macro-economic policy suggests that changes      to taxation arrangements. . . could be manageable. . .</PARA>
<PARA>After the conference, after that communique had been issued, Treasurer Kerin went so far as to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was work we looked at today that will take us to the November&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Perth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conference, particularly. . . vertical fiscal imbalance. . . The whole question of vertical and fiscal equity, the whole question of tied grants and the fact that we believe that macro-economic management won't in any way be impugned by that. . . we are engaged in a process that will give great benefits to everyone. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then at an Australian Labor Party business breakfast in Brisbane just a few weeks later, on 27 August, Mr Kerin said that the Federal Government was fully committed to handing substantial taxing powers back to the States as agreed at last month's, that is the July, Special Premiers Conference. This involves removing some of the so-called vertical fiscal imbalance which Mr Kerin described as meaning `he who taxes should be the one who spends it'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is really prepared to go as far as we can in that area. We believe it will not impede our ability to manage the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened since those heady days of just a few weeks ago? The thing that has happened is what has been happening to this country for months now, which has produced a policy paralysis in this country; a situation which is adding to the economic misery day by day of hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of Australians&mdash;a policy paralysis which now sees almost one million people in this nation unemployed. If one looks at those that are underemployed the figure is closer to 1 1/2 million people, and that is a conservative estimate. </PARA>

If the Special Premiers Conference went ahead and meaningful financial relationships were worked out between the Commonwealth and the States, as virtually everyone in Australia would like, with the possible exception of Mr Keating and, increasingly, Mr Hawke, because of the political blowtorch now being applied to him;  if meaningful debate took place at that Perth conference, if it takes place at all, and at the moment that conference will not take place because the Premiers have quite understandably, quite properly, pulled the pin on the charade that was being forced upon them;  and if there were meaningful changes to Commonwealth-State financial relations, which virtually all Australians want, then the whole balance and purpose of the Bill we are debating today would be changed.

The Government has had a dream run in the support it has had from the coalition, and it will continue to get that support if it acts responsibly and exercises the proper leadership role that it should.  Regrettably, I would have to say that the performance of the Prime Minister over recent days on this matter has, in my view, shown beyond any remaining lingering doubt that he is unfit to continue to be the Prime Minister of this nation. The only concern that raises is: heaven help this nation if he is replaced as Prime Minister by the pretender to the throne, Mr Keating&mdash;the greatest wrecker this country has seen in generations, the deliberate architect and engineer of the most serious, deepest, most protracted recession this nation has had in 60 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would support and take a very positive approach to the proposals put forward by the Premiers and Chief Ministers in the document that was tabled in this Parliament last week. It was the proposal the Premiers were going to take to the Premiers Conference&mdash;the one the Prime Minister has now said he will not have a bar of. That proposal essentially was designed to make an important first step, in a very responsible way, to correcting the existing vertical fiscal imbalance. It said that for an initial period of three years the States would receive, within the existing personal income tax structure, a fixed share in percentage terms of that personal income tax. The figure worked out at about $10 billion, or about 20 per cent of the now personal income tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without arguing particular percentages or figures, the approach was a very responsible, measured one. The States said through this document that after three years there would be provision for States, either individually or collectively, to vary that initial rate. Again, something like that is essential if one is to get some greater competition, some greater flexibility, some greater responsibility, some greater accountability into the financial relationship in which the States are involved and ought to be involved. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial grants are based on a per capita relativity which is then multiplied by the actual population of a State or Territory. Thus, the per capita relativities are the key determinant of a State's entitlement. Not surprisingly, the more populous States dispute some of the methodology used in calculating relativities, but the merits of fiscal equalisation&mdash;another one of those phrases&mdash;have been apparent for decades and are supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current estimate of the funding which will be provided is $13.7 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not oppose this legislation, although I take this opportunity to express our opposition to the policy line which the Government has been pursuing for years with respect to cutting the funds available to the States. We believe that this has meant the deferral or abandonment of many public works projects which should have been undertaken. Child care facilities and the disgraceful neglect shown by the Commonwealth in the area of mainline railways are two examples that come to mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of grants to the States inevitably leads, and has led in this debate, to the broader question of Commonwealth-State financial relations. This has again become an issue in Australian politics. I say `again' because ever since the Second World War when the Commonwealth became the only Government to levy income tax, there has been a series of calls by the States for more access to growing tax bases. All these calls by the States have despaired that the Commonwealth has retained the goldmine of income tax receipts, yet when pressed&mdash;or indeed when they were offered the chance by Prime Minister Fraser&mdash;to actually levy a State income tax they have always declined. The events of last week have shown that this is still the position. Their collective position seems to be `Give us more money, yet don't give us any of the political odium which naturally arises when governments tax their constituents'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been interesting to note the way in which the Labor Premier of Queensland readily adopted the catchcry of former National Party Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, of `No new taxes' when he came to power. It seems that few Australians want new taxes, but many want increased services. That leads to an almost insoluble political dilemma and one which is very relevant to the current introduction of the GST debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some serious reservations about the new federalism agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Australian Democrats believe that a system of strong regional governments is infinitely superior to the current system of State governments, but we recognise that although there is a growing body of public opinion in favour of the abolition of States, this is not realistically achievable in the immediate future. Accordingly, as a matter of urgency and within the significant constraints imposed by the Australian Constitution, we must seek to eliminate the ridiculous inefficiencies which accrue to this country when States pursue competing and uncoordinated strategies and policies on matters of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The classic example in this regard is the environment. It would lead us to ask how anyone could support a State based system of protecting endangered species of fauna and flora.

I acknowledge that for the first time a genuine effort is being made to get some consistency into the laws which are administered at the State level. For example, the Queensland Attorney-General, Mr Dean Wells, is leading the charge to establish a uniform crimes Act in this country. It is a massive task, but it is under way. Similarly, there are attempts to unify the various State credit Acts and the eastern States have agreed to a uniform system of defamation law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Special Premiers Conference process has produced some incredible results if measured simply in terms of the communiques issued at the end of each well publicised gathering. There is to be a national rail corporation, at this stage only concentrating on interstate freight but with the possibility of passenger services as well. We have also seen a rational approach to pricing road transport for heavy vehicles, the establishment of a properly interconnecting electricity grid in south-eastern Australia, and the mutual recognition of occupational qualifications and goods and services between the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the States are all committed to introducing their financial statements in a comparable manner and to progressively adopting the superior methodology of the Commonwealth and the Australian Bureau of Statistics in regard to budgetary functional classifications. However, apart from the National Rail Corporation, we still simply have the stated intention of the Premiers to deliver these important reforms. It must be remembered that, apart from Queensland, no State Premier controls both houses of parliament. Therefore, there can be no guarantees concerning the passage of the necessary legislation through all State parliaments. Indeed, the sensational announcement last night that the Premiers were pulling out of the scheduled Special Conference in Perth has put a cloud over the complete process&mdash;at least in the near future. </PARA>

If it is conceded that there needs to be a lessening of the degree of imbalance between the revenue resources and the functional responsibilities&mdash;and I admit that there is an argument to lessen the imbalance&mdash;then why are, or should I say why were, the politicians and the bureaucrats only examining the various options of redistributing the excess revenue of the Commonwealth, instead of also examining the far more promising options of redistributing the excess functions of the State governments and the role of local governments within that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former Labor State Premier of New South Wales and a former Governor-General have recently added their voices to those calling for the abolition of the State level of government. The shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Howard, has recently stated his preference for a more rational system of government, which he identified as one of regional representation. I know that that view is certainly in the minority within the Opposition. But it seems ironic to me that the economic rationalists who have dominated the agenda in this country in recent times have not been more consistently vocal about the structural inefficiency of our current federal model, as they would see it. It is the coalition which constantly carps about efficiency in government and which constantly advocates cutting public expenditure. But at the same time the coalition staunchly defends and advocates the existence of State governments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot sensibly referred to the fact that there seems to be some emphasis on transferring financial responsibility, not transferring management responsibilities and not rearranging structural activities. She is right. Of course, they are intrinsically linked. To have a proper system, rights have to be accompanied by responsibilities. As Senator Short said, one of the problems we have at the present time is that the States expend something in the range of 50 per cent of all taxes raised and they collect but 20 per cent. Inevitably, that will lead to delinquency in terms of accountability and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) understands that. Maybe it was for partisan political reasons, or maybe it was his great leap forward in an effort to distance himself from the former Treasurer and be seen as actually being able to initiate something, that led him to announce that we would have Premiers conferences to set down guidelines for where responsibilities ought to exist. The great tragedy of the imbroglio, the internecine conflict which is going on between the Prime Minister and Mr Keating, is that it has destroyed, for the life of this Government, any prospect of rational debate and any chance of rationalising responsibilities, duties and financial collections and disbursements. To me, that is the horror of recent events. No longer is the Prime Minister able to make altruistic decisions and determinations in the best interests of all Australians; he is now driven by the ambition to retain his own position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that not in recent history have we seen the consensus between the various Premiers that we are seeing now. I suggest that nobody would argue the proposition that the Premiers Conference has been cancelled as part of the staging of some political stunt. It has been cancelled because the Premiers were led to believe&mdash;they were a little slower than Paul Keating&mdash;that they would be meeting to confirm arrangements which would allow them a share of income tax; nothing new or different, but a share of current income tax. That would have given them certainty, security and, certainly, responsibility. Following that, we would have seen the rearranging of their duties and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great sins in Australia&mdash;and I say this as a federalist&mdash;is that we have never seen proper demarcation of responsibilities between local, State and Federal governments. The State governments&mdash;whether they be Liberal or Labor&mdash;want all the rights and none of the responsibilities. I had to say to an ex-State Liberal Minister for education, when he was berating me for my attitude on something, that it is difficult to persuade Australia that the federal system works when, after 90 years, we cannot get six State Ministers for education to agree to children starting school on the same day and in the same year. With the mobile population we have at present, it is absurd that children, when they are transferred with their parents from one State to another, find themselves either a year ahead or a year behind their classmates. If the States cannot get that much right, one wonders whether they are serious about other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think there has been a new understanding on the part of the States that we can no longer play these political games. Meaningful reforms have to take place. I do not think anybody would argue that the present system is working. Nobody would argue that the present system of tied grants is accompanied by proper responsibilities on the part of the States. Nobody would argue that the vertical fiscal imbalance is in any way guaranteed to ensure a fair distribution of accountability and responsibility. Tied grants cause a lack of accountability. They deny local circumstances, and this is why I have always been opposed to the dead hand of centralism. They deny the opportunity for vibrant local decision-making and, inevitably, they load up the cost of monitoring administration and add to the costs of compliance. They create duplication and they guarantee economic inefficiency and a waste of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always fascinated to see the Federal Department of Transport and Communications with its responsibility for roads, the State departments with their Ministers for roads and heads of main roads departments, and the shire councils with their preoccupation with roads and footpaths. They all want their share, their responsibility. So we have this enormous triplication. In more recent times, this has become trendy. We have seen the same thing applying in the delivery of health-care and child welfare and child minding centres. This is all the result of a lack of accountability by the various tiers of government for the funds they spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying, as I have from the outset, that it is a pity we see this legislation in this form, with a guarantee that it will be in this form in the future. Premier Carmen Lawrence from Western Australia was quite right when she talked about the pilgrimage of the mendicants coming to Canberra&mdash;not to be active and meaningful participants in a Premiers conference and not to contribute to the decision-making, but simply to be told what their share will be. I am sure we had all hoped&mdash;as Senator Short said, the Liberal Party had given its imprimatur and its support to reforms&mdash;that we would see a new form of Premiers conference where everyone would meet for the purpose of a meaningful outcome which, in my view, would have set in place the reformation of responsibilities in this country. </PARA>

It is simply the most difficult form of government one can have. I can understand that, with their legislative shortcomings, the Democrats find it attractive&mdash;as the Labor Party does&mdash;to have a central form of government, where everything is in one spot; if they had a unicameral legislature, the whole thing could be run by a caucus or some other committee and they would not have to listen to anyone or listen to any conflicting advice.

They get muddles and delays and incompetence in the air and on the ground with the congestion in the terminals.

All the long-haul internal traffic within the country goes through Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delays we have suffered in Sydney are now very long standing. They do not go back a few months or a year or two; they go back over a decade. Those delays affect all the air traffic through the country, financially as well as in a large variety of other ways. If there is a half-hour delay in the morning, a ripple effect runs through all the airline schedules for the whole day. People in Perth, Adelaide and Cairns might be half an hour or an hour late in their travels as a consequence of not having enough runway capacity at Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the economic penalty is enormous. It has cost the country many hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel burn, crew time, airframe and engine time, plus the penalties business suffers by being held up.

When I was living in the United States I found that people had to work in industry for about two years before they were entitled to any holidays, after which time they got seven or 10 days. At most they got about 14 days if they were working for the average company. When people are coming in with those tight vacation requirements, they have to be able to plan their travel expeditiously. They certainly cannot do that if they are held up getting into and out of Sydney. </PARA>

Badgerys Creek is not a substitute for the principal airport of Sydney.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendment is simple: it is to point out the need for meaningful reform. Of course, there are many ways in which that debating process can proceed, should proceed and, in effect, would have been addressed next week by the Premiers Conference if we did not have this political approach to that sort of a problem by such an impotent Prime Minister.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without meaningful reform, the aspirations of the Opposition or the Australian Democrats or, for that matter, the Government will never be capable of being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I commend to the Australian Democrats the amendment moved by Senator Short and seek their endorsement of it, particularly for clauses (a) and (b).

I trust that Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats will be able to join us with regard to clauses (a) and (b) of the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I come to talk about the amendment, I want to say a couple of things about the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991 because it seems to have slipped out of the debate a little. For the record, the Bill reflects the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 31 May 1991 putting arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a significant Bill in terms of the amount of money which is being disbursed. It represents about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1991-92&mdash;about $13 billion-plus. It reflects one of the significant changes which has recently taken place in Commonwealth-State relations. It is not a change of the fundamental order of magnitude that some were seeking, but it reflects an agreement by the Commonwealth at the 1990 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was at that stage a commitment that, should Australia suffer a major deterioration in its economic circumstances, that agreement would be reviewed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, at the 1991 conference the Commonwealth agreed to honour that undertaking and, in return, the States undertook to focus their adjustment efforts on restraint in outlays, and to use increases in taxes and charges only as a last resort. The balancing item for the Commonwealth's agreement to honour its undertaking has been an honouring by the States in their 1991-92 Budgets of their undertaking&mdash;not that there have been no tax increases, but substantially they have not used that as their first mechanism. That is important and it is a sign of a healthy relationship and the healthy discussions which took place at that Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting which led to these Bills. That is essentially the background to this legislation. The rest is incorporated in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to talk about the amendment. Essentially, it falls into two parts: that which relates to the financial arrangements between the States; and, dragged in from the back streets&mdash;not exactly relating to this Bill, but nevertheless dragged in&mdash;the question of the third runway, which I will come to in a moment. First of all, I will talk about calling off the Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it absolutely clear that the Commonwealth has not in any way called off or sought to have adjourned, deferred or called off the Special Premiers Conference. We want it to continue because there are important reforms that can be discussed and should be discussed, but we are not prepared to do so at the price of the introduction of a State income tax. There is an important reform process under way which we believe should be continued. There have been a very proud number of steps forward in Commonwealth-State relations as a result of the Special Premiers Conference process, and I think it is important that it should continue. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made it clear that it is his view that the Perth conference should proceed as planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has already gained a lot from the Special Premiers Conference process. We have the National Rail Corporation, which Senator Kernot correctly referred to, which in my view is the most substantial of the changes. That is a very subjective view and people may have other views, but of itself it is certainly important, and it has the potential to become even more important. There are the road transport reforms and the electricity grid reforms on the east coast which, perhaps, others would consider to be more important than the first two. But the ranking is not relevant; those are three important changes. The mutual recognition of standards is long overdue and means at least that some of those arrangements which the sovereign countries of the European Community have reached amongst themselves are starting to be applied to the States within our federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been significant progress in reviewing functional areas of government activity and there are important processes still to be undertaken. There are other important matters on the agenda for this conference, to which I wish to refer in a moment, which should have been considered. If the States were discharging their responsibilities to their constituents&mdash;to their voters, to their citizens&mdash;they would be meeting properly to consider these matters instead of doing a bit of grandstanding, trying to get their hands on the money. I will come back to those matters because I think they are important in the consideration of whether one should support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the States would want the proposal that they have put forward because it means more revenue and no increased responsibility for the States. It is hardly surprising that they would want it. It is somewhat more surprising that the Opposition seems to be supporting it. I would have thought that anybody seriously trying to address the national economic interest could not propose the opportunity for the States to have that share of income tax and the capacity to influence the level at which income tax is levied. To restrict the capacity of the Commonwealth  effectively to manage the economy would not be supporting the proposal. Perhaps Opposition members have not read it or perhaps they do not understand it. I am very surprised and very interested that they should be proposing this idea that the States should also be able to levy an income tax but not have to have the sordid responsibility of passing the laws to do so&mdash;of pursuing the debtors. All the odium falls on the Commonwealth. Every time people fail to pay, the Commonwealth has to pursue them, but the money goes to the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were a State Premier I might think, `Maybe the Commonwealth is looking away. It might not see the national interest impact of these proposals. We might slip it past them', and I guess I would have supported the proposal too. But, as a member of the Federal Parliament with national responsibilities, it seems to me extraordinary that anybody should seriously contemplate that proposal. The Prime Minister has made it clear that the proposal for a national income tax sharing arrangement, so-called, agreed between the Premiers and the Chief Ministers is for all practical purposes a State income tax. Therefore, the Government does not support the imposition of such a tax. The Prime Minister has made it clear&mdash;and I support him&mdash;that the Australian people do not want that burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a party that is supposedly riven with division about this matter, I think my colleagues would endorse the view that when the Prime Minister made it clear to the Caucus today that the Cabinet had made a decision&mdash;I understand unanimously&mdash;to reject the proposal because it is tantamount to a State income tax, it had the unanimous support of the Caucus. It would have that support again if the matter were to come back. It is a question on which the national interest is clear and it is a question on which the Prime Minister has made the right decision. It was not an easy decision because he knew that it posed the risk of the States pulling out. Nevertheless, he made exactly the right decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not represent this so-called policy paralysis that people keep looking for to reject a bad proposal. To say, `Someone has put forward a proposal, but we don't agree with it because it's not in the national interest' is a proper decision not to do something inappropriate, and it is not something to be criticised. Far from saying that these questions of Commonwealth-State relations and Commonwealth-State financial relations cannot be discussed, the Commonwealth view remains that this issue properly should be discussed in Perth. But we make it absolutely clear&mdash;and it would be misleading not to do so&mdash;that any concept containing the elements of a State income tax is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is some manner in which we can get agreement with the States to meet their understandable concern to achieve a greater degree of certainty in the financial resources available to them and give them more certainty in Commonwealth disbursements, then let us have a look at that, but not at the price of a State income tax. That remains the Prime Minister's view; it remains the unanimous view of the Government side of the Senate and the Government side of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has expressed the view that there is a strong case for the meeting in Perth proceeding even if, at the end of the day, there is no discussion on vertical fiscal imbalance. It is not our view that there should be no discussion. We are happy to have the discussion but, we are telling people in advance, not  predicated on the assumption that there might be a State income tax, and I support that. It would be misleading to go on giving people the impression that we might support such a thing. We do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the prospect that there may be some fruitful discussion on the issue of financial arrangements. There will not be if the Premiers do not turn up to the meeting, but that is up to them. There is a collective responsibility for all people in government&mdash;in fact, all members of parliament in Australia&mdash;to face up to some of the other very important issues on that agenda. The Premiers themselves have said, `We want employment put on the agenda'. The Commonwealth agreed to that and now they say, `It was important a week ago, we wanted it on the agenda, but it is not important enough now. We are not going to come'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the environment in Commonwealth-State relations is very important. There are some very important proposals for consideration in the area of education. Health and aged care also are on the agenda. An issue that has often been discussed, about which the public is clearly very concerned, is community violence and gun control. Why is it that this meeting, which is important to deal with those sorts of issues, should be held to ransom because people would like a State income tax? They would like to get their hands on some of the revenue without having to face up to any of the responsibilities. For those reasons, I think part (a) and part (b) of the amendment deserve to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing on which I agree with Senator MacGibbon is that the development and the management of relationships between the different levels of government in a federation are very complex and difficult tasks. He is absolutely correct about that. There is no perfect solution at any stage. Even when we get the best solution in any one period, it will be different again in five years, 10 years or 15 years as the nature of government evolves. I take it that that is what Senator MacGibbon was implying. I share that view. There is no perfect solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made more progress in the development of cooperative relationships between the States, the Territories and the Commonwealth recently than at any other time. There is a very substantial potential for debate to take place, and progress to be made, about reform of financial arrangements. We will not agree to part of those changed arrangements being a State income tax. If that is where the dividing line between the Commonwealth and the States, or between the Government and the Opposition, needs to be drawn, so be it. That is simply a point with which the Government will not agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly turn to the question of Sydney Airport. This really has nothing to do with the Bill. It was dragged in because people were a bit desperate to get in and find something to say. It was dragged in off the street. The fact of the matter is that many senior members of the Government are anxious to see this project go ahead quickly. It may well be that their hope will be fulfilled in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, and under this Government, we continue to operate under the rule of law. The law requires certain processes to be gone through before the project can be approved. The processes should be undertaken notwithstanding that some very senior officials, very senior members, of the Opposition and the New South Wales Government would like to see things happen quickly. We do not have a dictatorship where individuals can, by decree, change laws designed to protect the interests of citizens. Those processes are being gone through; they are almost at their conclusion. When they are concluded the Government will make a decision in accordance with the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (c) of the amendment is really saying that the Government should be condemned because it has obeyed the law; it has adhered to the processes set down by the relevant legislation. I do not believe that any rational House of Parliament will condemn the Executive arm of any government for adhering to the laws which the Parliament has passed. The amendment is a joke. I recommend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put on the record the extraordinary scene that we have just witnessed in this chamber, where the Government of the day has voted against an amendment of the Opposition calling on the Government to do precisely what is the Government's policy, and that is to expeditiously build the third runway at Sydney Airport. What we have seen is the re-emergence of the left wing in New South Wales. I thought that the right wing was the dominant force there. I thought they were the people who called all the shots. We have a new power broker in the Senate. Senator John Faulkner has risen to lead the Government into voting in absolute opposition to its policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

I find that quite extraordinary. I congratulate Senator Collins and his other colleagues of the Left in the New South Wales Labor Party. I think it is a tremendous achievement on their part, but I would have to say that it is another example of the absolute shambles into which this Government has fallen. The divisions and policy paralysis afflicting this Government at every turn were shown today in the dreadful inability of the Government to support its own policy in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by Senator Baume. I would like to take a slightly different viewpoint to his, while fully supporting the points that he has laid out to the Senate. It is not usual to speak on third readings but provision is made for this under Standing Orders, and Senator Short quite properly exercised this privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the explanation given by Senator McMullan&mdash;that he looked to me as the other person who had participated in the debate and, when I did not rise, he then rose to his feet. I accept that the Minister made a mistake. I can understand his making that mistake and I do not blame him for this. What I do blame him for, though, is not recognising the collegiate atmosphere of the Senate. Having virtually admitted that he made a mistake, he should have yielded to Senator Baume, who was the only other person who wished to speak, and allowed him the right to speak. It was quite within Senator McMullan's power, having said he had made a mistake, to ask for leave of the Senate to allow Senator Baume to speak before the vote was put for the third reading. That would have been the simple and correct thing to do in the atmosphere in which the Senate works. </PARA>

To make it even worse, the Minister then left the chamber. Again, it is one of the traditions of this place that when one is involved in a controversial issue or when one makes a controversial speech or controversial decision, one has the character and backbone to stay in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have other engagements and that chamber duty is a very onerous task. But this was an unusual situation. A senator had made a mistake and the correct thing for him to do, with respect to the traditions and practices of this chamber, was to allow Senator Baume to speak. If he had done so, we would have finished the matter maybe a quarter of an hour ago. The Minister should have stayed in the chamber. I support the motion moved by Senator Baume. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills we are debating today are the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance Amendment) Bill (No.2) 1991. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 introduces a co-payment, or at least what the Government is calling a co-payment, for general practitioner consultations. Certain changes are also made to the safety net arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government announced these measures in the 1991-92 Budget. Indeed, Budget Paper No.9, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health Care in Australia&mdash;Directions for Reform</EMPHASIS>, outlined the changes. The Medicare benefit was to be reduced from 1 November 1991 by $3.50 for out of hospital general practitioner attendance items provided to non-cardholders. From November 1992 the co-payment was to increase to a sum of $5. Where the patient was direct billed by the general practitioner, the practitioner would be permitted to charge the patient a co-payment of up to $3.50. Cardholders are exempt from the co-payment and the reduction in the Medicare benefit. Also announced were changes to the safety net arrangements. From January 1992 the safety net arrangements will change so that families count their out of pocket costs towards the safety net threshold of $246, indexed, rather than as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latter part of the Budget proposal stayed intact, but I need not remind the Senate of what happened to the first part. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) got himself into awful trouble because of a Caucus revolt over the co-payment proposal. It was obvious to Minister Howe that Caucus was not going to accept the proposal as it stood, so he bid a hasty retreat and set up a Caucus working party to examine the Medicare changes. In his news release of 3 September 1991, the Minister outlined the conditions that would prevail on this Caucus working party committee. I wish to highlight one of them. The Minister said that one of the conditions for him to accept the proposal was that the committee would `achieve the same fiscal result for the health area as in the Budget'. The Minister kept saying that over and over again. Each time he was interviewed he stressed the fact that any proposal from the Caucus committee must meet the criterion that it would achieve the same fiscal result for the health area as in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one was fooled by the Minister's setting up the working party. What hope did it have of coming up with a proposal with the objectives as outlined in the Minister's news release? Of course it had no hope at all, and did not succeed in its attempt to have the co-payment proposal thrown out. What we ended up with was a compromise that was presented to the Caucus. In fact, the compromise that the Minister came up with did not even meet the requirements that were set down for the Caucus committee. A sum of $91m was shaved from the initial Budget proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister only just won over his colleagues. The Minister's own Left faction voted narrowly at a heated meeting&mdash;we are led to believe a very heated meeting&mdash;to accept the compromise. Given that a Caucus defeat would have been a serious blow to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), one wonders what sorts of threats and promises were thrown at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>left wing of the Labor Party to support the Minister's compromise. In fact, it was very interesting to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 2 November the antics that the Minister's office apparently got up to. I will read from that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff of the Minister for Health, Mr Howe, used "heavy-handed thuggery and obstructionist tactics"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that phrase is in quotation marks so obviously I presume the journalist is quoting from somebody&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . .to thwart Caucus attempts to change his planned Medicare charge, according to an internal ALP report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, by Senator Rosemary Crowley, one of the back-bench members of the Caucus committee reviewing the contentious patient charges, also said the final Caucus decision to allow co-payments was heavily influenced by leadership tensions rather than the merits of the case.</PARA>
<PARA>We have said repeatedly in this chamber that the Government of this country is being affected in a detrimental way as a result of the continual leadership challenges and leadership tensions that are going on between the Prime Minister and the would-be Prime Minister, Mr Keating. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Crowley also revealed that when her committee tried to get advice from one of Medicare's architects, Dr John Deeble, the group was "accused of treachery". . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Caucus committee `sought information, defined the problem and set out to solve it, but it was thwarted at every turn, in particular by the refusal of the minister's office and the department to provide reliable figures to assist the committee", Senator Crowley said.</PARA>
<PARA>It was obvious that Senator Crowley and that committee were impeded in getting information. Senator Crowley turned up at the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs hearing on this Bill last Friday and had to ask for details that I would have thought she would have been given as chairman of the Caucus committee. She sat there asking the Department for details that, in order for her to have made a decision at the Caucus committee and to put forward a proposal, she should have had. Here is a backbencher in the Government unable to get information and having to go to a Senate Committee to ask for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That justifies what has been said in this article about all the trouble she had and how the Caucus committee was denied information it needed to make a submission. I will be interested to see whether Senator Crowley will speak in this debate. If she is not going to speak, she will be very sad that she has to sit here and watch what is going on in the chamber, given that I do not believe that the witnesses got a fair go or a fair hearing. All the Government has come up with is a compromise that is satisfactory to no-one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the compromise, all Australians have been left with two tiers of GP schedule fees and six different levels of benefit. There are two tiers of schedule fees, depending on whether the general practitioner is vocationally registered, and three levels of benefits, depending on which billing procedure is used and whether the patient is a cardholder. Imagine the confusion that will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What astounds me is that out of all this we now have a system that will encourage bulkbilling&mdash;a root cause of the evil that is plaguing our health system. The smallest payment made will be by those patients who are bulkbilled. It will be interesting to note what sort of reaction entrepreneurial clinics will have to the charging of the patient co-payment. It is quite possible that some of these clinics will not charge the co-payment and will attempt to recover the drop in the rebate by seeing more patients for a shorter time. Surely that is not what we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fail to see how this proposal will help to achieve a sustainable, equitable, efficient, universal health insurance system. It is important to note the effect that bulkbilling has on overuse and overservicing in GP consultations. In the hearing into this Bill on Friday last, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said that there will be some evidence that relates bulkbilling to increased doctor supply. Areas that have high doctor supply have higher bulkbilling rates. I look forward with great interest to this information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the point made by the RACGP was relevant to the supply side of GP services. It is also imperative to note the overuse that can occur on the demand side because of bulkbilling and the absence of a price signal. This is why the coalition is supportive of price signalling for general practitioner consultations. We believe that where a service is provided for free, it may&mdash;and I say `may'&mdash;be overused by some. The presence of a price signal helps to curb that overuse because patients think about the need for the service and maybe will even question the general practitioner as to the need for that service. It was interesting to note the report of the Auditor-General earlier this year, Audit   report No. 32 1990-91 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Department of Community Services and Health&mdash;Administration of the Medicare Benefits Schedule</EMPHASIS>, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the areas with the highest growth in outlays are frequently those with a high proportion of direct billing.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department's response to this report has been that it has been unable to duplicate the results of the survey of the Australian National Audit Office, so it has dismissed the report. I have to say that this is a fairly typical attitude to comments from the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hearing last Friday Minister Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The co-payment matter is only one part of a reorganisation of the provision of general practitioner medical services to the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no problem with this, if only we knew what the other parts of the overall scheme included. It is patently obvious that the co-payment proposal was thrust on the Minister by the Department of Finance. The Minister for Community Services and Health then had to invent other reforms to general practice in Australia to meet the bottom line of budget savings. The problem is that no-one knows any details about the other reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If what I have heard is anything to go on, the Minister will have a battle on his hands. I will be interested to see the community's response to some ideas the Minister seems to have floated;  for example, drastic reductions in the numbers of young students from high school going into medical schools. Another suggestion that seems to have come from the Minister's head somewhere is that one way of reducing the number of general practitioners is to develop ways to prevent GPs practising beyond the retiring age;  for example, taking away their provider number. If that is the sort of suggestion the Minister is making, I think he may need to think again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this entire process of developing the changes that are outlined in the Bill, the Minister and his Department have neglected to undertake meaningful consultation with those members of the medical profession who have valuable first-hand experience in health care delivery. There was no consultation prior to the announcement of a co-payment in the Budget. Since then, there has been precious little. Every single group across the board&mdash;the RACGP, the AMA, the Doctors Reform Society&mdash;came into the committee hearing last week and said, `Before this decision was made, before it was announced in the Budget, there was no consultation'. I think people are reasonable and, as I said at that committee meeting, had I been Minister, I think it would have been appropriate to say, `We have problems. There is overservicing. We have what appears to be an oversupply of doctors. How are we, as a community, going to solve that?'; rather than in some dictatorial fashion telling the medical profession how it will happen. I would have thought that consultation and cooperation would have meant that not all members of the medical profession may have been happy but they may have been more likely to be on side to contribute to a solution; that is, to ensure that Australians get the best medical service as possible from their general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that would be the goal of the Government and the medical profession. But they were not given a chance to contribute, to look at the ways in which these problems could be solved. Minister Tate gave the impression that there has been fruitful and meaningful discussion between the AMA and the RACGP, but the truth is that these bodies are on the verge of war with the Government. These are the words of the National Vice-President of the AMA, not mine. In fact, there is so little agreement and consultation at the moment that the relevant bodies cannot even agree on a document that was prepared as a summary of a meeting between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can these reforms of general practice in Australia lead to a better health system if the Government refuses to conduct meaningful consultation? Apparently a working party of the Australian Health Ministers Council is considering the effects of the co-payment on State hospitals. There was not even enough foresight or consultation to consider the effects of the Government's proposals on our State hospital systems. We have seen some of the State hospital systems responding to this already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the way to conduct an overhaul of general practice in Australia or of our health system. It would appear that the most fundamental problems in our health system are not going to be addressed. One of those is the fact that our system is grossly underfunded and that the private health sector has been strangled by this Government. The initial claim was that a Medicare system would be self-financing through the Medicare levy. This has never been the case. The message that must be put again and again is that the Medicare levy contributes only one-third of the funding that is outlaid on Medicare programs. The Australian community must be reminded over and over that it is a farce; it is misinformation for the Government to allow people to believe that Medicare covers the cost of health in Australia: it does not. Our health system desperately needs the private sector to be encouraged to participate and to provide additional funding that is obviously so necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill we are debating today is the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. This Bill ensures that Medicare benefits are paid only where a medical practitioner provides a medical service within that practitioner's State or Territory of registration. The effect of this Bill will also be to require the repayment of Medicare benefits where a practitioner has rendered excessive services. I will restrict my comments to one area in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medical Services Committee of Inquiry was established under the Health Insurance Act. It inquires into matters referred to it by the Minister, including accusations of overservicing. Changes in this Bill will mean that the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry will be able to levy a new financial penalty against medical practitioners who have rendered excessive services or have initiated excessive pathology services. This will be equal to the value of the excessive services. The Committee will also have the power to refer a medical practitioner to the medical participation review committee if it finds that he or she has rendered excessive services on two or more occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with this change relates to the increase in powers to be given to the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry. These changes, in effect, make the MSCI a quasi-judicial body. To this stage, the MSCI has provided counselling or caution. Given that the make-up of the MSCI consists of medical practitioners, there may be some reluctance to serve on the Committee if members are forced to impose financial penalties on their peers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the concern that there is not enough of a deterrent to overservicing, but I have some doubt as to whether this change is the most appropriate way to go. Perhaps it may have been better to reconsider the penalties the courts can impose and to ensure that all cases of suspected over-servicing are followed up which, I believe, is currently not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I wish to raise relates to the ability of physiotherapists and podiatrists to perform certain X-rays. The Community Services and Health Act (No. 2) 1990 restricted the payment of Medicare rebates to X-ray referrals from general practitioners, dentists and chiropractors. Prior to the passing of the legislation, physiotherapists were responsible for ordering X-rays for their patients. The majority of physiotherapists in private practice use X-rays as an integral part of diagnosis and patient care. However, since 1 May physiotherapists have been restricted in their ability to order X-rays. A doctor's referral is now needed for R-type X-rays for which a Medicare benefit is payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I would be misleading the Senate to say that I have taught almost 1,000&mdash;if not over the thousand mark&mdash;physiotherapists, and honourable senators can imagine how they beat a hasty path to my door to discuss this issue with me. When I went through it and discovered that it was really an oversight that physiotherapists had been omitted from this clause in the Bill and that general practitioners, dentists and chiropractors had been included, I wrote to the Minister asking him to address the issue. I am pleased to hear that the Minister has acceded to the request and will be making an amendment to legislation this session to allow physiotherapists to refer for R-type X-rays of the spine and pelvic area. I do not know whether, without that pushing, it would have been done as quickly as, hopefully, it will be done. </PARA>

In view of the procedures they perform, it would benefit them to have access to the information which is available from the X-rays. Referral may not be crucial if the patient wishes to claim the higher R-type rebate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that many Government senators share the Democrats' concerns and no doubt many of them have fought very hard in Caucus to have the Government abandon this move to enforce a co-payment. I call upon those honourable senators to demonstrate their commitment to the principles of Medicare and to the 70 per cent of Australians who support the Medicare system by voting against this Bill tonight. To those honourable senators I say that I do appreciate that they are bound by Cabinet rulings and then, of course, tied by Caucus solidarity, as they call it. But I ask them, on this issue, what value is there in permitting themselves to be hamstrung by this process when it means a failure on their part to demonstrate the same solidarity with the vast majority of Australians who do not want to see further undermining of Medicare, and who believe that this is very much a misguided effort on behalf of the Government to address problems within our medical system that we do acknowledge exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands upon thousands of their constituents out there are wondering just how far the Labor Party can sell out its principles before some Government members crack and actually dare to vote against the tyranny of Cabinet and, I guess, put on record the fact that they really are listening to their constituencies. I would argue that many members of the Labor Party are now so patently out of touch with the needs and aspirations of ordinary Australians that it is only a matter of time before we see what is happening in some State parliaments, where independent members are becoming quite common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Medicare has never been very popular with some&mdash;indeed, not popular at all with many members of the Opposition. It has also not been very popular with some doctors&mdash;particularly members of the AMA. However, its popularity with the public continues to grow. Last year's ANOP survey found that about seven in 10 Australians&mdash;71 per cent&mdash;were in favour of Medicare and just over two in 10 Australians, or 22 per cent, were opposed to it. Not surprisingly, support for Medicare is higher amongst those who rely on Medicare&mdash;indeed, it is very high at 85 per cent. But, at 60 per cent, support is still high among those who carry private health cover. As ANOP observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clear finding. . . is that despite these differences, the clear majority in all groups is in favour of Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>ANOP went on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the 1990 study has confirmed that the principles of Medicare are now widely accepted and the main features of the Medicare program have solid community support.</PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to think of any other government or, indeed, private program that has such widespread support. One really has to ask why the Government is dismantling one of the most popular projects for which it is responsible. Medicare has, by and large, achieved what it was set up to do. Despite the problems, it has provided Australians with equitable access to relatively cheap health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to move on to look at some of the costs. In 1988-89, $29.5 billion was spent on health care in Australia. Of that, some $6 billion&mdash;about one-fifth&mdash;came from direct out of pocket payments by individuals. The remainder of the expenditure comes from the Commonwealth Government&mdash;via the Medicare levy and taxation&mdash;State and local governments, and workers and motor vehicle accident compensation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of expenditure by individuals, the analysis of the health expenditure survey and Medicare undertaken by the national health strategy indicates that the provision of free services substantially protects low income households from the cost of basic health care&mdash;that is, GP services, hospital care and prescriptions. This protection primarily occurs through the bulkbilling mechanism. The national health strategy paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spending on Health</EMPHASIS>, came up with the very important conclusion that free, or certainly low cost, basic health care protects two kinds of vulnerable people: firstly, those on low incomes, for whom even small out of pocket costs are too much and would deter them from seeing doctors when they need to; and, secondly, the high users. Into that group fall people with disabilities and the chronically ill who would otherwise have substantial out-of-pocket costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians understand that they do not receive their health care for nothing. They are quite well aware that they pay for it via the Medicare levy and through taxation. I believe the widespread support for Medicare by the Australian community demonstrates that Australians are generally willing&mdash;if not pleased&mdash;to pay for a health care system which protects the two kinds of people I have just talked about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are well aware of the shambles that masquerades as a health care system in the United States, and no-one wants to go down that track. They do not want to have a system where access to basic essential services is denied to so many. Indeed, it is most ironic that, at a time when many in the United States are calling for some commitment to universal public health care to overcome the problems of a private system, we have the Parliament in this country appearing to be moving in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government agrees that Medicare has largely been successful in keeping health costs down. In its own Budget Paper&mdash;Budget Related Paper No. 9&mdash;it states that it believes that Medicare has been a successful program. Health care costs in this country have been fairly constant&mdash;around 8 per cent of GDP&mdash;for quite some time, about 14 years. Although others will disagree, this is not an astronomically high proportion of GDP if we accept the desirability of meeting social objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats see the provision of basic health care as a desirable social and economic objective. Although we see considerable room for improvement in the delivery of health care services, we do not consider 8 per cent of GDP too high an amount for total expenditure. This is not to deny that there is a need to rein in some areas of health expenditure. But we need to be clear that Medicare has enabled better control of the growth of health care expenditure. Overseas evidence&mdash;again we can refer to the United States&mdash;indicates that those countries where public health insurance plays a key role have been the most successful in controlling total health expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to look at why we need a co-payment. After sitting through Friday's hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I find it very difficult to work out exactly why it is that we need this co-payment. There is not a great deal of Australian research, data or information about the distribution or impact of health costs. But what evidence there is goes against the Government's assertions. Indeed, I believe that the Government is doing its best to ignore the evidence that exists. The evidence that I believe it is ignoring includes quite unique data being collected by the national health strategy, an expensive exercise which the Government appears hell-bent on pre-empting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Peter Walsh brought home this fact in this chamber last month when he asked for some pretty basic data about the per capita growth in GP attendance over the past 11 years, with particular reference to the utilisation by cardholders versus non-cardholders. One would presume that this would have been the type of information on which the Government was basing its decisions. However, we find that was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate, in his response to Senator Walsh, admitted that data is not available on the utilisation of services by cardholders as distinct from non-cardholders, although estimates were made as part of the decision-making. I argue that is not very reassuring when we are talking about such a major change. This is indeed a very major change in the Medicare scheme which could have significant effects on the health of the community. Senator Tate also had to point out that there had been a decline in the number of visits to GPs on a per capita basis over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also evidence from the national health strategy that co-payment may have a small effect on demand but will establish a framework for an uncontrolled increase in costs. As Professor Geoff Richardson, the Director of the National Centre for Health Program Evaluation at Monash University, has noted, the introduction of the co-payment potentially moves us towards a situation of cost shifting rather than cost control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Richardson's paper for the national health strategy entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Effects of Consumer Co-Payments in Medical Care</EMPHASIS> is really the first comprehensive survey of this issue carried out in this country. He found that the introduction of a co-payment is likely to cause a one-off reduction in the base level of demand but that the supply side response from the medical profession would probably result in an offset of this demand by around 50 per cent. In other words, if we do not tackle the supply side of the health services equation, the effect of the co-payment on the overall level of demand is likely to be modest. So one wonders what the Government figures about the savings from this measure are really based on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real problem is that co-payment sets up a structure under which a number of problems may arise. I will just go through three of them. The available evidence suggests that increased co-payments result in higher medical incomes in exchange for less output. Co-payments open up the prospect of unrestrained inflation. Although this may not occur in Australia, it certainly has elsewhere. Co-payments have a greater impact on low income people, especially their children, and people with poorer health. These are the ones most likely to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at co-payment as a price signal, which Senator Patterson has already dealt with. The Government and the Opposition argue that co-payment operates as a price signal. It is one of the rationalists' favourite maxims that offering a free service ensures the service will be overused and abused. Certainly there are many areas where this is the case, but I would argue very strongly that this does not apply to the health system and the delivery of health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, while there is undoubtedly overservicing in the health area, it is not correct to blithely put it down to overusage by patients. Indeed, as Professor Richardson notes in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For most categories of the medical workforce there appears to be a consensus that there is a problem of excess supply of doctors and not an excess demand.</PARA>
<PARA>I would argue that sending out a price signal does absolutely nothing to tackle this problem. A price signal also represents a determination to impose free market principles and mechanisms on a system that will not respond to them for a variety of reasons. It is basically a misunderstanding about the functioning of the health system and of health economics. The kindest interpretation is that it possibly is a genuine misunderstanding coming from a genuinely held ideological viewpoint and a commitment to competition. But there are many who push this view who are quite clearly doing so for their own vested financial interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence here and overseas is clear: market signals are undermined by the distinctive nature of the health system. A number of features of the health system make free market logic unconvincing in this context. Firstly, the existence of insurance acts to minimise price signals. Even if we were to abandon Medicare altogether and move to a totally private insurance system, we would still have this operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is an imbalance in the amount and nature of information available to patients and service providers. In other words, it is virtually impossible for consumers of health services to exercise a free choice in the health market because genuine independent evaluation about the benefit obtained by the product is virtually impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the structure of the health market undermines market mechanisms. There is restrictive entry for service providers and no alternative source of supply for many. The basis of competition can become higher levels of service rather than a more effective or efficient service. Again, price signals do not address this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the concept of health care is overlaid with social justice objectives that do not necessarily equate with marketplace objectives. In other words, economic efficiency is not necessarily the goal that a community is aiming for in health care. Indeed, most communities, especially those in the developed world, aim for the provision of basic health care for all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also economic merits in these sorts of objectives. For example, presumably a healthy work force will be more productive than an unhealthy one, and so on. But these kinds of merits are too often overlooked in the pursuit of what I could perhaps call the more obvious economic goals. We are talking there about more savings and expenditure reductions. So the concept of a co-payment as a price signal is not only an invalid one, given other factors that work in any health care system, but it can also serve to undermine what a community may well consider to be desirable outcomes in the delivery of health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to look at bulkbilling. I want to say a few words about this because, again, I believe that the evidence about its role in our health system shows up pretty clearly that a lot of nonsense is often talked about it. Despite assertions to the contrary from some quarters in the Opposition and the medical profession, bulkbilling does not increase health expenditure in the medical profession. The national health strategy data suggests that the major impact of bulkbilling is an increase in the number of patients seen by a GP, not an increase in the fees per GP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bulkbilling also represents a powerful competitive tool. Although there is contradictory evidence around about whether patients choose GPs according to whether they bulkbill, it seems that GPs who bulkbill generally attract more patients and, therefore, even higher incomes&mdash;possibly because bulkbilling GPs charge their patients less. For example, in 1990-91, doctors who bulkbilled charged, on average, 8 per cent less than doctors who did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to be validity in the claim that some of these doctors do give less time per patient, but patients apparently do not always mind, because they continue to use bulkbilled services. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that many patients, in fact, prefer less time with their doctor as long as they feel that their particular problem&mdash;their particular reason for going to the GP&mdash;has been satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are potential problems with the reduced time per consultation, but what is clear is that bulkbilling operates as an effective price competition which actually exerts downward pressure on GPs' fees. It would stop the inflation that would occur if these measures that the Government is taking do, indeed, undermine the bulkbilling system. All the available evidence suggests that, if we do away with bulkbilling, health care costs will escalate and the poor and less well off will pay more for their health care. The Australian Democrats have long been supporters of bulkbilling and we believe that this co-payment heralds its demise, to the detriment of our system of health care generally and low-income earners in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we could have a dozen different views on the effects of the co-payment, depending on whom one speaks to. However, despite what the Government would like us to think, it really does not have much of a clue about the potential effects of the co-payment. It became very clear to me, from listening to all the witnesses in the Senate Committee hearing on Friday, that they are fairly united in this. I would argue that the Government really is very much in the dark about what exactly will happen and what the effects of the co-payment will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the data collected by the national health strategy which, as I have already noted, the Government is now largely ignoring, the Government really has no idea at all where this move will take it. Basically, the Government is conducting a massive experiment with no idea of what the eventual outcome will be. It is not certain that demand will drop or, if it does, whether this will result in detrimental effects on low income earners and their children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has no idea of how many doctors will relinquish bulkbilling, how many will absorb it and how many will take the additional charge and cover it internally by collecting it from their patients. Indeed, there are a variety of different opinions as to how doctors are going to work around it. Therefore, the Government has absolutely no idea how the co-payment will impact upon bulkbilling and whether a significant reduction in the numbers of doctors who are bulkbilling will result in a hike in GPs' fees or increased health care costs overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also has no idea about the potential impact on other areas of the health system. For example, on Friday at the Senate committee hearing, I referred to the community health centres and public hospitals. Mr Ian Lennie, executive officer of the Australian Community Health Association, urged the Committee to recommend that salaried bulkbilling practices be exempt from the co-payment as the revenue lost to centres through the co-payment would seriously affect their ability to deliver services. Mr Lennie explained that centres would come under pressure to pass on the charge to their clients, many of whom are already on low incomes and this may, indeed, deter many clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the submission from the Australian Hospitals Association raised questions about the impact of the co-payment on hospital outpatient and casualty services. In his evidence to the Senate Committee, Mr Ian McNeil, First Assistant Secretary to the health care access division of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, admitted that the effect of the co-payment on outpatient services was `debatable'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage there is no way of knowing whether it will have a significant impact or not.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very reassuring! So why is all this being done?  What are the problems with our health care system? I suggest that they are some or all of the following: increasing costs of medical technology; the escalating use of pathology and radiology services; waiting lists in public hospitals; an ageing population which is putting demand on a variety of services and is increasing the share of the health budget; and an oversupply of doctors but, at the same time, the inadequate distribution of doctors so that some areas&mdash;particularly the outer metropolitan areas of our larger cities and rural areas&mdash;do not have even the basic number of medical practitioners required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems certainly need fixing; I do not deny that. However, the Democrats strongly oppose the introduction of the co-payment as the means of fixing any of these problems. It will not solve them. As one example, let us look at the supply of doctors. There is agreement that there is an oversupply of doctors. As the Department pointed out to the Senate Committee, doctor numbers have been growing. However, it is difficult to pin down the impact of this growth in relation to health costs. Certainly, medical service use per person is increasing but, as I noted earlier, there is some uncertainty about how this relates to per capita visits to GPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there continues to be an increase in such visits, it is quite possible that this will be due to a reduction in the amount of time people spend in hospital and the fact that we are now making greater efforts to minimise the number of elderly and disabled people in our community who need access to hospital and nursing home services. Thus, it is entirely possible that an increase in visits to GPs will be offset by savings in other areas, such as in our nursing homes and hospitals. We must not forget the other facets of improved community access and well-being for those people who do not want to spend time in nursing homes and hospitals. The issue of oversupply of doctors is also complicated by the fact that there is a shortage of practitioners in rural and remote areas, as I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I argue that the simple fact is that the Government has basically opted out of looking seriously at the problems in the health care system. Its own national health strategy has already made many significant suggestions about structural reform which could address many of these problems, as well as improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the co-payment, make no mistake about it, it is basically a cost saving exercise. The Government, in particular the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), has talked about it being part of some sort of remarkable and miraculous reorganisation of the provision of general practitioner services, but as the co-payment is the only bit of this so-called reorganisation we have seen, we cannot comment on what the total package is going to be. We have seen no direct evidence of the Government tackling the supply side of the health service equation and this begs the question: if the Government is really serious about re-organisation that addresses both demand and supply, why not wait until it has the full package in place and then introduce all the measures together? At least we would then possibly be in a better position to judge the likely effects of this move on the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know why this has not occurred&mdash;because, basically, Brian Howe wanted extra dollars to fund his better cities program and, of course, the Department of Finance is always there ready and willing to carve up Medicare. It has apparently been looking at that as a possibility for quite some time. It provided Minister Howe with all the evidence he needed, and I would argue that it is very contrary evidence to all the existing evidence that we have been through with regard to the health system. The Department of Finance gave the Minister the opportunity to claim the extra funds by attacking the public health insurance system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says nothing for Caucus, despite the determined efforts of some members&mdash;which I recognise&mdash;that it ultimately let him get away with it. I again call on those honourable senators who are opposed to the co-payment to think about the 70 per cent of Australians who approve of the Medicare system. I ask them to join with the Democrats in opposing this Bill. If they do not, the situation will be, as Diedre Wicks and Roy Green observed in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 13 October:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator WALTERS </EMPHASIS>(Tasmania) (8.00 p.m.)&mdash;The Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 relate primarily to Budget decisions on the co-payment of the supposed $3.50 to be paid by patients for consultations with their general practitioner. At least, that is what the Budget decision was. Medicare was never going to work. This decision of the Government has at least acknowledged that Medicare has now come to an end. One of the primary components of Medicare was bulkbilling. This legislation has effectively done away with bulkbilling. I am not the only person to have said that. The AMA, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Doctors Reform Society and community groups have all said that this legislation has effectively done away with Medicare. What a shemozzle it has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government brought down the Budget. We all know that every government says that its Budget is sacrosanct. No Opposition&mdash;even the Labor Government when it was in Opposition&mdash;likes to interfere with a government's Budget Bills. Indeed, that has often been described as denying Supply or interfering with the outcome of the Budget. While the Opposition goes along with the Government's decision on the Budget, what does its own back bench decide to do?  I have been here long enough to know that when a Budget is given to the party room it is supposed to be a fait accompli&mdash;not so with this Government. For the first time that I can remember the back bench rolled the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Cabinet. The back bench decided that it did not want to have that co-payment; that it wanted Medicare, despite all its faults, to remain unscathed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and, indeed, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) virtually put their jobs on the line and said, `Okay, you can make some changes but we need the same outcome financially'. We are all well aware that that, of course, did not happen. The Government is now well down the drain on its Budget figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided to set up a back bench committee to come up with an alternative suggestion. A lot relied on the present fight going on between Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. That, of course, was drawn into the Caucus fight that ensued after the Budget decision was made public. The end result is a halfway house&mdash;a hotchpotch of the worst of all evils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the patient co-payment of $2.50. If the general practitioner decides to bulkbill, the patient will pay $2.50; if the general practitioner does not bulkbill, the patient will pay $3.50. Because the back bench decided against the Government's Budget statement&mdash;it knew better and wanted to keep encouraging doctors to bulkbill&mdash;it decided, in its wisdom, to give the doctors a dollar to continue bulkbilling. I have never heard of anything so stupid. The Cabinet decided to discourage bulkbilling and, indeed, to get rid of it, insisting upon a patient co-payment. Then Cabinet succumbed to the back bench and said, `But we want to encourage doctors to bulkbill so we will give them a dollar if they continue to bulkbill'. Is it any surprise that the public wonders what on earth has happened to this Government?  The Government's lack of credibility has never been as great as it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have the situation where if a doctor bulkbills he gets a whole dollar from the Government to do so. Can honourable senators imagine the administrative costs of that?  The doctor gets a whole dollar from the Government; the patient pays him $2.50, so bulkbilling is out. If the doctor does not bulkbill, the patient pays an additional $3.50 because the rebate that the patient gets back for a consultation fee is reduced by $3.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not all that this wonderful back bench committee looked at and came up with. It said, `Let's bring forward $12m to be spent in the next financial year'&mdash;that is, the financial year 1992-93&mdash;`to this financial year, 1991-92. There will be no alterations in the appropriations; nothing will be needed; we'll get it out of the Minister for Finance's slush fund. We don't want to have to admit that there were alterations; we'll just grab a bit out of the Minister for Finance's slush fund'. Of course, we all know that is not the usual procedure. Indeed, when the Budget comes down we have appropriations. Appropriations are accurately passed in this place, according to the decision of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone was so confused by this stage&mdash;mainly the Government&mdash;that the Government welcomed the setting up of the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs to sort out the mess. The AMA, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Doctors Reform Society and a community forum appeared before the Committee to explain their concerns in regard to this legislation. All of those groups said that the Government had broken its promise on consultation. Sometime ago the Government had said to the medical practitioners and the medical industry, `We promise that we will consult with you if we are going to alter anything substantially'. It could hardly be said that this is not a substantial alteration. Indeed, all groups complained bitterly to the Committee last Friday&mdash;my colleagues have referred to it&mdash;that there was no consultation by the Government and that the Government had once again broken its promise. The Government's excuse of course is, `We could not tell you all about it because it was a Budget decision'. </PARA>

The Government does not fool around with the pathologists any more. The Government consults with the pathologists. It is time that the AMA and the Royal College of General Practitioners decided to pull the same stunt and make the Government respectful of its promises. As I said, the basic tenet of Medicare, bulkbilling, has been abolished. My notes for my speech say, `Medicare&mdash;bulkbilling&mdash;gone'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees, on behalf of the Democrats, stated that bulkbilling does not make any difference to the number of medical services.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me once again&mdash;because I have done so on several occasions&mdash;give a simple explanation of how bulkbilling does make a difference. I would like Senator Lees, who is in the chamber, to listen to this example. I know that I have done this before but each year I bring the figures up to date because it is interesting to see how they climb. In New South Wales, with entrepreneurial clinics all over the place&mdash;and I might add that, by allowing bulkbilling, the Government encouraged their establishment&mdash;76.1 per cent of GP attendances are bulkbilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, where general practitioners and the medical profession do not allow entrepreneurial clinics&mdash;they ran them out of town when they tried last time&mdash;58.7 per cent of general practitioners visits are bulkbilled. So in New South Wales the figure is 76.1 per cent and in Tasmania 58.7 per cent. The cost per head for Medicare bulkbilling&mdash;man, woman and child&mdash;of that 76.1 per cent in New South Wales is $105.20; in Tasmania, with 58.7 per cent bulkbilling, it is only $90.40 per head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do not believe that Senator Lees can claim that this does not indicate that all of these entrepreneurial clinics have excess servicing. Senator Tate will be aware of how we fought this in Tasmania. Patients attending entrepreneurial clinics were sent to other GPs for a second opinion, for X-rays, for pathology and for other examinations. All of these services were bulkbilled. Nobody can possibly say&mdash;and I have just given the figures&mdash;that such a practice does not encourage bulkbilling and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get back to the figures. As I said, the cost per head in New South Wales is $105.20 and in Tasmania $90.40. If, with our small population in Tasmania, there were as many bulkbilling attendances as there were in New South Wales&mdash;in other words, if it were 76.1 per cent in Tasmania&mdash;there would be an additional cost of $6.8m to Medicare. That is in a State with a small population of 400,000. If one looks at the figures Australia-wide, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that the Government is right&mdash;that there is a blow-out in Medicare costs. If one allows bulkbilling for everyone and if entrepreneurial clinics continue to operate as they have, the taxes that this Government has to raise will continue to escalate as they have ever since it has been in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has now abolished bulkbilling. There is now to be a co-payment by the patient; that is, the patient must now pay part of that fee. But the Government has denied the patient the option of private insurance. It will not permit private insurance for doctors' consultations and for surgery. It has forced patients to pay these costs out of their own pocket. This is the only area in Australia in which the Government has decided that people cannot insure. One can insure ones house or car. One can insure against death and sickness. But one cannot insure against having to see a doctor. The lack of civil liberties in this area is quite appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to the extra $12m that the Government back bench has decided in its wisdom should be brought forward. I asked Senator Tate at a Friday meeting whether he could explain some of these so-called future reforms to the funding of general practice. When I asked him what was meant by the statement `Information technology could substantially enhance diagnostic and patient education roles of GPs', he said, `It's all English'. I said, `Okay, but what does it actually mean?'. He ended up by saying, `I don't know; it all depends. What they are going to have to do is talk about it. But I don't know how it is going to help patient education roles. Don't ask me; I am only the Minister'. That is what he was indicating. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp will agree with me that that means nationalisation. There is no way that anyone who is on the government payroll is not nationalised. Once on the government payroll, do not come screaming about being hurt. Doctors might have been sucked in but that is their problem&mdash;the Government has nationalised them. If the doctors accept that one they should not come crying later and tell us that the Constitution does not allow it, or whatever, because they have been sucked in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacists were sucked in years ago. Look at what has happened to them. The Government now says to them, `You will not open a pharmacy on the corner of X and Y street. We think there are too many. You will not open the pharmacy unless we give you special permission, because if you do we will not let you deal on the PBS'. So the pharmacists were sucked in years ago by putting themselves on the government payroll and being nationalised. They have woken up a little too late. They now realise that the Government will pay them to sell up but if they want to open, no way;  they will not get a guernsey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next proposed reform is the trialing of the use of practice budgets. When I got to that I asked the Minister what on earth that meant, and he said, `Well, I don't know'. I said, `Well, now, wait a minute, I know what a budget is.  What happens if you are the next patient and the doctor has used up all his budget on diagnostic services and pathology and radiology?  What happens then?'. The Minister said, `I don't know. It has all got to be negotiated between the members of the medical profession and the Government'. If the Minister does not know what a budget is, I do. A budget means one works to one's budget and one does not go over the budget. Again, I would be very surprised if the medical profession swallows that one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next proposal is for the accreditation of general practices. The Minister did not have much of an idea of what was meant by that, but I think I have a bit of an inkling. Let us consider a general practice of, say, three or four general practitioners. If one is a solo practitioner, one will probably not be accredited&mdash;no way. It is uneconomical. If one goes to an independent doctor, one who has set up on his or her own, how economical is that?  A practitioner should have attached to him all the paramedical facilities. He should have a physiotherapist, a dietitian and all the ancillary paramedical organisations. A practice comprising three or four general practitioners with all the extra paramedical paraphernalia attached is nice and economical and will be accredited by the profession, but if one is not&mdash;no way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the Government push for non-accredited general practices to have less of a reimbursement, less of a rebate, than the accredited general practices? I can only see that as the next step. I can only foresee the Government treating accreditation as it has vocational registration.  We will have to wait and see just what the Government does in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the supply and distribution of medical practices.  As I said a little while ago, just think of the pharmacists, because that is the direction in which we are going. According to the Government, pharmacists were in oversupply. The Government did not like the distribution of pharmacists. It said that all that oversupply and maldistribution created terrible problems of overservicing&mdash;even though of course the pharmacists do not write the prescriptions. I say to the doctors, `Beware! Oversupply and maldistribution, according to the Government's guidelines, means the same for the doctors as it has for the pharmacists'. The medical profession should think of that before it enters into negotiations with the Government, because that is what the Government has in store for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said, `For the sake of social justice, we must continue to take in overseas doctors. While we may cut those a bit, we are also going to cut our own medical students here in Australia and not allow as many to become medical practitioners'. We must accord social justice to foreign doctors coming into Australia but, as far as I can see, there will be no social justice to our medical students, to Australians wanting to become medical students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last topic for discussion is information technology.  The document circulated by the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information technology could substantially enhance diagnostic and patient education roles of GPs. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I stop there. The Minister told me this could assist general practitioners considerably. All the practitioner will need to do is get out the word processor or computer and type up the symptoms and out will come the diagnosis. The doctor will just say, `Give me your symptoms', he or she will type them up, hand the patient the sheet of paper and the patient will know just what the illness is. The Minister is shaking his head. I do admit I am going a bit over the top. But the Minister does say that is the way it will be done, that general practitioners will be assisted by using their computers to type in the symptoms and the computer will spit out the diagnosis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the Minister&mdash;I know he does not have much medical knowledge; I am not blaming him for that, he is first rate at law&mdash;every patient's body reacts differently to situations. I can remember when I was having my children. I would complain bitterly about something to my husband and he would just wipe me by saying, `It's all right, they are perfectly natural, some do and some don't'.  That, quite frankly, is true. I could be pregnant; my next door neighbour could be pregnant. We would have totally different symptoms, because some do and some do not. Symptoms vary so much that the doctor cannot just type them into a computer and have it spit out a diagnosis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to patient education.  Could the Minister please tell me how this information technology will assist patient education in the GP's surgery. I am most interested. The circular continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as well as improving the business management of practices.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the only aspect I understand fully.  If a general practitioner has his computer, it will improve his business practice&mdash;not that many general practitioners are good businessmen; indeed, far from it. But if someone in their office can work the computer, it will help to send out the bills and it will help their business management practice.  Finally:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as with other equipment, the current structure of general practice means that few practices have sufficient capital base to provide these facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that the Government will give the doctors computers?  If the Government is to subsidise them and give them computers, what does it want back?  What the Government wants back, of course, is data on patients. That is what it gets back from the pharmacists and that is what it will want from the general practitioners. The general practitioners will have those little black boxes that the pharmacists have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to the basics. The pharmacists have been nationalised; they can no longer set up where they want to; and they can no longer operate as they wish. The Government pays them for their prescriptions and, as a consequence, they have to jump to the Government's bidding. So the pharmacists have learnt the hard way. I warn general practitioners that if they do not learn by the experience of the pharmacists, for heaven's sake, do not come running to us later and say, `It's all too late, we have been nationalised; you undo it'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the record&mdash;I do not have here to wave about the lengthy quotes from the AMA and a number of places&mdash;that there is an oversupply of doctors in this country practising in general practice. The profession admits it and the College of General Practitioners admits it. The Government knows it and is trying to address it. It is also perfectly prepared to address the question of continuing quality care in general practice and changing the parameters so that that continuing quality of care can be promoted and developed further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A year or so ago I chaired the Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance inquiring into vocational registration of general practitioners. The Committee produced a report that affirmed vocational registration and accepted it as the first of many steps that this Government has introduced and will introduce to maintain quality general practice&mdash;to support the claims of the College of General Practitioners, and even the AMA, for the importance of postgraduate and special to general practice training for general practitioners. The Government recognises the need for quality and continuing education; the medical profession recognises it; and the Government recognises that it should be acknowledged by increased remuneration. That is all undeniable. The record stands: that has been the practice of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Walters cannot understand what is to be the final definitions of practice grants or the parameters of quality care into the future, when the Minister says to her that the final details of that are to be negotiated between the profession and the Government, as I say, that is a measure of Senator Walters's limitations and no discrediting of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was tempted to take points of orders against Senator Walters for her fairly outrageous dealing in a very, I think, unkind way with the best that the Minister offered in the hearing of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs the other day. I was present for much of the hearing. After listening to Senator Walters today, one could not have concluded that the Minister had goodwill and was trying to answer her questions. But the Minister was; he did, and it was mischievous of Senator Walters to suggest otherwise.

The Minister says there will be negotiation, the Department says there will be negotiation, yet Senator Walters calls us liars. I think Senator Walters is absolutely disgraceful, but there is little we can do about such a disgraceful performance. Senator Walters is uncivil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Walters should know, it takes time to negotiate with the medical profession. The profession has its own character and it cannot be rushed. As Senator Walters properly points out, if the negotiations go too fast, sometimes the medical profession gets very cross and goes away:  witness the AMA, which has not been negotiating with the Government on medical benefit schedule fees for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion from Senator Walters was that if the medical profession were to get as tough as the pharmacists did with this Government and took it to court this Government may behave differently. I refer Senator Walters to Dr Bruce Shepherd's hairy-chested claims shortly after this Budget was introduced that he would go to the High Court. That hit the front page of many newspapers. I notice that he is now beating a retreat from that position. I am not sure whether he had advice, but nothing the Government does will give him his day in court. Perhaps he thought the cost was not worth it. The Government knows where it stands vis-a-vis the medical profession, and I think Dr Shepherd has learnt, too, that it is not a good idea to rush to headlines, boasting that one will do things which one subsequently discovers one does not want to or cannot do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is at pains to negotiate with the medical profession. It is committed to quality general practice; it is committed to continuing care; and it is committed, on behalf of all of the people in this country, to restraining the total outlays of health. For the past eight years, the cost of health in this country has been just below eight per cent of GDP, and this year it is projected to be just above it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in great contrast to the cost of health care in the United States of America where it is resting at 12 per cent. I am advised that it will go above that. If one looks at the number of Americans who do not have access to any kind of medical insurance and whose quality of health care is very poor, one would acknowledge how good the system is in Australia. When I visited Washington and saw senior health officials in the health department, their comment to me was, `What is Australia doing visiting America? America should go to Australia to find a preferred way of providing good quality affordable health care for its people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now considerable responses to those pressures emerging in America&mdash;Senator Walters would be shocked&mdash;where in some of the states fixed fees are being negotiated for the general practitioners. That is because that country recognises, as this country has known for a long time, that one cannot have an unlimited cost to the provision of health care. It does not do the profession any good; it does not do the economics of the country any good; and it does not necessarily assist the patients. It is the balance this country and this Government has achieved that ought to be earning Senator Walters's plaudits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Patterson asked me earlier what I thought about the proposed changes to the legislation. Senator Patterson knows very well what I think about those changes. I fought very strenuously not to see them introduced. They are now part of the proposed legislation, and here I stand supporting them. That is a matter of fact. That is as a result of being a member of the Labor Caucus and the Labor Government. I have no trouble at all with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question today to the Minister, Senator Tate, shows that I am very interested in the processes that will be set up by the Government to monitor the impacts of these changes. I am concerned to see how the changes come into effect and how they may fall&mdash;whether there will be a significant shift away from bulkbilling; whether there will be a maintenance of bulkbilling; whether in fact patients will start advising that they cannot afford to see the doctor because of the costs; or whether the changes in the safety net will provide the sort of assurance and fallback for those patients who may have thought they were troubled. The modification of the safety net under this legislation is something about which we should be reminding our constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be reminding the people of Australia that the safety net in Medicare has changed. It has gone to a sum of $246 for a family. Once the people who constitute a family register with the Health Insurance Commission and once the payments by the patient of any scheduled fees reaches $246 for the total family, we know that those people will be eligible for 100 per cent rebate of the medical benefits scheduled fee for whatever medical services they need. That is a very good backstop for those people who may now have to find the $3.50 extra if they are patient billed, and $2.50 extra if they are bulkbilled and non-cardholders. Those people will have that fallback position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles of Medicare remain. I refer to the principles of making sure that nobody is denied access to the doctor because of cost. It has been argued by Dr Bob Woods in the House of Representatives that $3.50 is not much money. I disagree with him. An outlay of $3.50 depends very much on what percentage it comprises of one's total income. For people on a low income that is a lot of money. It may be argued that it is not much for one person, but it certainly is for families with children who may find they have three or four lots of payments of $3.50 to find when they visit the doctor. That is precisely the sort of thing that I will be looking for when monitoring and it is what the Government will be looking for to ensure that those people who previously did not have to find that money and who will now have to do so are not disadvantaged. We will be looking to see that such people will not be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I will be interested to see exactly what happens to the general practitioner clinics, be they entrepreneurial or not. I am not at all sure that we know at this stage what an entrepreneurial clinic is. Again, I think that is probably something that is taxing the minds not only of the Government but also of members of the medical profession. There is considerable concern that no clinic should get into the habit of practising less than quality care. The clinics have shown what it is like to have 24-hour care. A lot of folk left their general practitioners over a number of years because there was no after hours care or service. Perhaps sometimes there was a locum service, but many people got used to going to the outpatient or casualty section of public hospitals where they knew they would find treatment if they were sick in the middle of the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 24-hour clinics have provided that service in the suburbs, certainly out of the hospitals, and it is quite clear that consumers like it. That is precisely what those clinics have been teaching the medical profession. I know that the quality of care provided in those clinics is challenging the profession. It is very interested and very busy in looking at further definitions of what constitutes quality care. This will not be defined for the profession by the Government. It is something that the Government will be pleased to have defined for it by the profession. In particular, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is understood to have that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreed position of the Senate Select Committee's report on vocational registration was that the College of General Practitioners appropriately set standards of care for general practice. The Government in its response accepted that. I do not believe there is any doubt about the profession having the principal responsibility of defining standards of care. The Government will be negotiating with the profession exactly what practice grants will mean. I would say that such grants probably would differ from one practice to another. It would depend on whether one were a solo general practitioner or part of a large group practice. It would also depend on whether one were providing general practice as part of a community health centre or as part of a freestanding general practice clinic. In rural Australia it would certainly depend on whether one had an agreement between a number of doctors practising solo. Again, that would put a different character on what a practice grant might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of things to which I understood the Minister was referring when he answered questions the other day. I am sorry that Senator Walters seems to be unable to understand those differences. I have no trouble at all in understanding what the Minister was referring to. The profession is certain that it will have the say in how quality medical practice is defined, and the Government does not disagree with that. The Government will negotiate with the profession as to how general practice is best paid for, taking account of the Government's proper concern that no person in this country is denied access to that good quality care by the way in which it is paid for. Accreditation of general practice is clearly within the realm of the profession in terms of definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the legislation acknowledges that it is time to look at significant redefinitions and restructuring of general practice. It is recognised by both the profession and the Government that there is an oversupply of doctors. It is recognised by the Government, and to a large extent by the profession, that the principal problem of increasing costs under Medicare in the general practice area lies in the oversupply of doctors, associated with overservicing. In grave doubt is whether the demand effect has led to the increase in costs but, to put the matter most kindly, I suppose it can be said that the jury is out on the effect or size of the demand effect. There is agreement that the question of oversupply of doctors must be addressed. Indeed, the Government has signalled its intent to address it, and the profession has agreed that it will be talking to government on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that we maintain standards of care. To this point general practice care and health care across the country, apart from pockets of the population, are very good. Australia has a standard of health care to be proud of, but there are areas which to me are a matter of grave concern. For example, the standard of health among Aboriginal communities is very much less than the average for all Australians. That aside, we have a good standard quality of care. We need to appreciate the importance of maintaining that standard and should address ways in which it can be improved. I refer in particular to the opportunity for government and the profession to negotiate the restructuring of general practice and build into it the continuation, maintenance and improvement of quality care. This will be to the benefit of all Australians and must be at an affordable price to both individuals and the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past half an hour, minus the last three minutes, I have witnessed some of the most lunatic contributions I have ever heard with regard to the issue of health. I just find that Senator Crowley's contribution has been incredible. For Senator Crowley, in her position as chair of the working party, or whatever it is called&mdash;the committee that revolted against the Cabinet decision and the Budget decision on Medicare&mdash;to have to come along to the Senate Standing Committee last Friday to ask the questions that she did, I find quite extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was quite clear from that exercise that Senator Crowley had not been given the information which, I believe, she should have been. She was in the position of not only being a member of the Caucus but also of being chair of that committee. Given that the Government treated her and the whole of her committee in such a way, is it any wonder that we are now dealing with this legislation that has caused so much dissent and anguish within the Hawke Labor Government?  It is simply a bandaid approach to health by this Government that has a record that is nothing short of appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposing this legislation that is attempting to contain costs and that provides implicit, grudging recognition that the free consultations promised by Medicare lead to overuse and higher costs. We need to go back to when Medicare was first brought in. Medicare was promised to be a universal, self-financing health system. Quite clearly, it is anything but. It is not universal&mdash;I will come back with more examples or that later&mdash;and it is certainly far from self-financing, the result of which we are seeing today in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not alter the fact that I deplore the lack of consultation that, yet again, has been characteristic of this Government's dealings with the medical profession and with health care professionals generally. As my colleague Senator Walters quite eloquently said earlier, the Government did learn a very valuable lesson from the pathologists in that it found that it cannot ride roughshod over the medical profession and the professionals within that profession. They know their law best; they know their services best; they are the people at the coalface; they are the ones dealing with the patients; not this out of touch Government that believes that it can just legislate for a profession and have no concern whatsoever about the consequences for the patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is typical of this Labor Government to have promised in 1989 to enhance the status of general practice and now to spring this measure on the practice in a manner that suggests a complete lack of concern, without tackling the deeper problems of Medicare. Whenever, by direct statement or implication, this Government tries to blame general practitioners for the cost of medical services, it should be noted that in Western Australia 71 per cent of medical services were charged at the schedule fee that, over the last eight years, has risen at half the rate of average weekly earnings. Does this Government know or care?  No, it does not. It keeps on saying that it is the greedy doctors who need to have their earning ability clipped. The Government does not care whether it is accurate to say that the doctors, according to the Government's vague figures, are earning too much money and the Government is bearing the brunt of that. Quite untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preferred style of consultation with the medical profession by the Government was so aptly demonstrated on 4 September when the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) threatened to allow unrestricted entry of foreign doctors if the AMA proved obdurate over changes to general practice. In other words, the Government said, `If you, the AMA, block what we want to do, we will let more and more foreign doctors in'. It does not, for one moment, look at the real problems of how we get more doctors into country areas. The Government just says, `We will bring in more foreign doctors; we will send them out to the country areas'. The very real problem of oversupply and maldistribution of general practitioners suddenly becomes a very convenient bludgeon against the AMA, although the problem was squarely diagnosed in 1988 by the Doherty Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce pointing to the wastage and lowering of skills that result when too many doctors enter general practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Government done? It has simply ignored the recommendations. Again, it has done nothing to attempt to get more doctors into the country areas. It has just used this crude threat of bringing in more foreign doctors. For years the coalition has stated that if people who are not pensioners or welfare beneficiaries are able to obtain free medical treatment through bulkbilling, inevitably there will be some overuse of the system. That is exactly what we have seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent submission before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs noted that 23 years ago the Granville area of western Sydney was serviced by eight doctors. Now there are 20, yet the population is the same. I really cannot think of a more succinct illustration as to the effect of unrestricted bulkbilling in raising overall costs and encouraging the maldistribution of general practitioners. This is a truth that this Government has tried desperately to evade. Even now, the idol of bulkbilling must be placated by the fact that the co-payment is to be $2.50 rather than $3.50, wiping off between $70m and $90m in anticipated savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening to that figure?  No-one has been told. The Government will not tell anybody. We just do not know where that money is going. But there had to be this compromise to keep the leadership of the Labor Party firmly&mdash;or not so firmly&mdash;in the grasp of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Therefore, the leadership issue has become far more important than this huge re-jigging of the Budget. No-one knows where it will end and, more importantly, the Government will not tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe we will hear about something in some vague statement the Prime Minister will make later this week; but I doubt it. He has already made a statement in March this year, we had a Budget in August, and now he is being forced to make another statement. The best thing he could do would be to make a statement to the people of Australia that he is going to quit. Here we have the wiping off of between $70m and $90m with no explanation. By such means is a measure of peace brought to the confederation of warring tribes that constitute the Labor Party Caucus. As always, logic and good government have taken very much a back seat to leadership battles between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains to be seen whether the fears of the ideological supporters of bulkbilling will be realised and whether the administrative cost of a $2.50 co-payment will lead to numbers of doctors abandoning bulkbilling. I do not apologise for one moment for welcoming a reduction in this practice for patients who are presently being implicitly fed the damaging lie that health services come free. They do not and they cannot. There is simply no logical argument for imposing a price signal on pharmaceuticals, as was done last year, and neglecting to subject medical services to the same discipline. It might be a bit much to expect the Hawke Labor Government to forgo the campaigns of fear and misrepresentation with regard to the coalition approach to health, now that it is forced to take some tentative steps toward reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must emphasise that yet again this Labor Government lacks the courage and the unity to tackle the real health issues. Australia continues with the irritant and farce of the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy, which will raise $2.6 billion in 1991-92&mdash;less than 20 per cent of its health expenditure of $13.7 billion. That figure really does demonstrate the farce of the statements and the impression this Government tries to convey to the people of Australia that Medicare is free and that Medicare is self-financing. What rubbish. The levy is bringing in less than 20 per cent of the total cost of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who are privately insured also have the misfortune of paying four times for their health cover. Even the people who are not privately insured are invariably paying three times: that is, via the levy; via increased general taxation; and, in many cases, through gap payments. Yet those who are privately insured have the fourth additional cost of private health insurance. But does this Government care?  No, it keeps on going out there and trying to pretend that Medicare is free and self-financing. The Prime Minister has been very coy in refusing to rule out a rise in the Medicare levy. If this occurs&mdash;and a figure of 2.2 per cent has already been floated by Caucus and agreed to by such organisations as the Doctors Reform Society&mdash;we can remain confident that it will still not be an honest levy that actually pays for health care, but will be nothing more than a disguised tax hike. That is all it is at the moment; it is just added to tax. It is just that constant bracket creep that goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no incentives for private insurance. Yet in 1990, when the Medicare levy raised $2.4 billion, $2.7 billion of health care expenditure was made by the private health funds. More was paid by the private health funds than by Medicare. Once again, we see the hypocrisy of this Government, which treats private health insurance as a luxury, yet depends upon 44 per cent of Australians retaining it to prevent the collapse of the public hospital system. What would happen if those 44 per cent of Australians opted out of the private health insurance system tomorrow?  The whole Medicare system would fall over and die in a day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a most profound interjection from Senator Crowley, saying no, it would not. With the private health funds carrying 44 per cent and $2.7 billion in health expenditure a year, if that cost were suddenly transferred to Medicare&mdash;which cannot cope now; that is why we have the legislation before us tonight&mdash;how on earth could anyone say that it would not fall over dead?  That is a most extraordinary statement. The $600m contributed by private health funds to public hospitals in 1990 amounts to another tax upon private health insurance. This Labor Government, through its ideological preoccupations and its sheer laziness, continues to tolerate a situation where 40 per cent of Australians with private insurance have incomes below average weekly earnings and 20 per cent have incomes below $160 per week. Yet they clearly feel that they cannot afford to rely upon Medicare for hospital treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters is quite right. Yet the Doctors Reform Society had the audacity to say to me the other day at the Senate Standing Committee hearing, `Yes, but when someone like Mr Holmes a Court needed help he went to a public hospital'. Sadly, we all know what happened to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the public hospitals cannot cope, and that is not a criticism of the public hospital system. This Government continues to do nothing about the fact that 25 per cent of Australians with incomes above $1,000 per week do not have private health insurance. Those people will lengthen the Medicare queues for those who have no alternative. Surely this is a strange idea of social justice. It is not social justice, and there is no point in trying to pretend that it is. This Labor Government will not face up to the fact that unless the slow decline in the percentage of Australians with private insurance is reversed, the entire health care system is on borrowed time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley's saying that she would not fall over and drop dead tomorrow if the private health system were taken out, puts her squarely at odds with the Western Australian Minister for Health who knows full well that Western Australia is suffering. While, judging from Senator Crowley's demeanour, he is obviously not from the same faction, nonetheless, he has quite a good point. It is a likely development that co-payments for medical services will result in greater use of public hospital outpatient services, thereby compounding what is our most pressing health problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is in a very sad state with regard to health&mdash;and with regard to everything else, for that matter. Western Australians become increasingly concerned when they learn that the Royal Perth Hospital, purely and simply to contain costs, must drastically reduce its services and suspend elective surgery every fourth Friday. The Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, to achieve cuts of $2.2m, is to abolish some services and restrict non-emergency surgery between 8.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. The Bentley Hospital may be forced to abolish 10 beds for elderly psychiatric patients to save $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A real cut of $6m in Western Australian public hospitals means that people do not get the medical treatment that they urgently need. It was reported on 1 September that an 80-year-old lady in Perth lost two toes through gangrene while awaiting admission to Royal Perth Hospital. In June, her general practitioner sought an emergency appointment with the vascular clinic, but one could not be made until 11 August. So an 80-year-old lady lost toes as a consequence of the lack of funding by this Government of the public hospital system. I note strongly the comments of the lady's GP, who did not blame Royal Perth Hospital, but stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system's just got to change. We can't have the Federal Government saying everyone can be seen free.</PARA>
<PARA>That put the blame squarely where it belongs, and it is quite correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A measure of the pressure that Medicare has placed upon public hospitals is that, on 3 October, a memo from a medical services director of the Gairdner Hospital stated that the hospital had simply stopped taking new orthopaedic patients because of demand pressure; the situation would be reviewed in January. What happens between now and January? One may well ask what happens after January because the funding situation will not change. In effect, Medicare patients are even losing the right to be placed in a queue. They may have to resort to the law to obtain treatment for what is so often acute pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I do not raise this matter to blame the hospitals so much as the Medicare system. The Labor Minister for Health in Western Australia has drawn exactly the same conclusion, stating that Medicare was in crisis. Yet Senator Crowley, in her speech earlier on, said, `The principles of Medicare remain'. If they do remain, they are pretty sick principles. Even Senator Crowley's own party colleagues in Western Australia disagree with her. The same Labor Minister for Health in Western Australia stated publicly on 6 September that the Medicare levy is misleading and that bureaucratic Federal health administration forces the States to carry the can for Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 September, Mr Wilson supported the proposals of the Australian Private Hospitals Association that would, in effect, confine Medicare to those in need and oblige other Australians to take out private health cover with some taxation incentives. It is an interesting difference of opinion within the Labor Party itself. On the release of the national health strategy report, Mr Wilson was critical of the fact that the Government had not investigated the possibility of scrapping Medicare, requiring those on high incomes to take private insurance and offering them tax rebates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the Government not really get dinkum about the problems of health in Australia?  Why does it not really start looking at the situation as it is and not necessarily just do what its ideological whims wish it to be? It must start looking&mdash;hopefully sooner, rather than later&mdash;to make the changes that are necessary. In effect, a State Labor Minister is rejecting the ideological premises of Medicare that have been so smugly and very blindly upheld by this Labor Government for far too long. It cannot go on pursuing these premises, leaving people unable even to join the end of the queue and just rotting. That is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people in Western Australia who have no money are told by the public hospitals system, `You have to go to a private hospital and you have to pay for it yourself', what is their choice? They have no money, they cannot do it and, more importantly, this Government does not care. Of course, we may only speculate as to when it may embrace reality on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that it is not much use asking this Government to do anything about the situation because certain elements within the Labor Party obviously will not allow change to happen. I only wish that some of them would get out into the real world&mdash;get out into the public hospitals&mdash;and talk to some of their constituents in Australia. They should talk to those who are in pain, those who need surgery&mdash;relatively minor, as well as major&mdash;who simply cannot get it. They should talk to those who are being told, `You pay, or else'. Quite frankly, the reality of the `or else' for them is a very serious choice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The health system in this country is in a chaotic mess. This attempt by the Government to tinker at the edges is too late, too little and, in my view, should be rejected. I am going to vote against this legislation, because I believe that it ought to be redrawn and redrafted so that we have before us a set of principles and measures which will be able to remedy the chaos that is now rampant in the health care system in Australia. At present there are queues in many public hospitals for treatments that I would regard&mdash;as, indeed, would the patients who are waiting for those treatments&mdash;as being essential. This Government's policy has resulted in far too much suffering in the extended suffering of people who are chronically ill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 is to increase the difference between the Medicare rebate and the schedule fee, and to establish new safety net provisions in relation to the maximum amount paid by families in a year for the difference between the scheduled fee and benefits. The Bill does not tell us how it will reduce the queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Knowles said&mdash;and it is my view&mdash;the net result of the co-payment idea will be to increase the outpatient queues in public hospitals. I may be proven wrong, but I believe that that will be the end result of this measure. I am very concerned about the effect it will have on the struggling families who are paying their way. I am also concerned about the effect that it will have on aged people, superannuants&mdash;not only those who are chronically ill but also those who may require medical treatment up to and including the safety net limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all I will deal with those families who are in that bracket just above the FAS limit. Of course, FAS recipients are covered by this legislation but those above the FAS limit are not. It is these people who are getting it in the neck in every way from this Government. For example, the Hearing Services Bill, which we debated last night, covered FAS recipients. But families who are just above the FAS limit can absolutely whistle. This appears to me to be the attitude of the Government so far as these people are concerned. We are not talking about the wealthy people in this world. We are talking about electricians and tradesmen with a couple of kids&mdash;one-income families whose income is just above the FAS cut-off point. These are the people who are hurting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was driven to Parliament House this morning by one of our car drivers. These people are not in receipt of an enormous amount of money. My driver happened to be wearing a hearing aid which cost $1,000. He could not get any recompense for that; he had to pay for it up-front. It is essential for him to have the hearing aid. Sure, such an argument was advanced in yesterday's debate but this is just another example of the hard-heartedness of the Government in respect of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is relying on advice from its bureaucrats in this area. We all know that, increasingly, the economic rationalist philosophy is becoming dominant amongst those in the top bureaucratic positions in Canberra, many of whom belong to highly paid two-income families. We now have another example of that philosophy. In an attempt to somehow get a user-pays system into operation, the Government dreamt up this co-payment idea. In my view, it has done so without regard to the effect it will have on the type of family that I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would not know what it was like to attempt to make ends meet on one income. It would not know of the effect that the current recession is having on families where the mother has been forced, through economic circumstances, to go out and get part time work. Now, because of the recession, they are forced out of that part time work without receiving any compensation at all. Nevertheless, the Government is now imposing a co-payment on those people. I believe that is unfair and unjust.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar situation exists with superannuants who have worked and struggled all their lives. Each week&mdash;either voluntarily or compulsorily&mdash;they have put money into a superannuation scheme. Those superannuants are now faced with having to make these payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said by the Government that there is a safety net&mdash;an amount of $246. But people will have to pay out that $246 a year before becoming eligible. That is another impost on these families and on these superannuants. There is much more I could say about this Bill but I said at the outset that I would be speaking for only five minutes.

I am not oblivious to the fact that there is overservicing by a number of medical practitioners and people in the profession; that they are bleeding the system, bleeding the taxpayer. My view is that the people in the Health Insurance Commission know that the taxpayer is being bled by overservicing. The statistics are available. The Government should act on those statistics by giving the Health Insurance Commission more staff and the power to seek out instances of overservicing and then impose greater penalties. I appreciate that the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) goes to that question. But I do not think even that legislation goes far enough. A greater number of people should be involved in this investigatory process so that the taxpayers' money is safeguarded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. It has been a very exhaustive debate. I think the Senate, in its consideration of the substantial matters in the Estimates Committee, in the special committee held last Friday to deal with submissions from various organisations, and again tonight, has said just about everything that can be said about the merits of this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the debate got somewhat out of hand at times tonight. I was disappointed with Senator Knowles and what I took to be a gross invasion of privacy of those who have received hospital attention, particularly surgery, in a particular class of hospital. I do not think that should be made a matter of public comment. I think patients are entitled to their privacy, whatever their status in public life. In particular, I found incredible her linking of Robert Holmes a Court's admission to a public hospital and his tragic and untimely death. I think that was a most unfortunate passage in tonight's discussion. Apart from instances such as that, the debate has canvassed many of the issues which have previously been exhaustively dealt with by the Senate in its Estimates committee process and in the committee on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the Government intends that the measures this legislation incorporates and enables are only part of a whole package that has been announced in the Budget. The Budget foreshadowed further regimes and schemes to encourage a reform of the way in which general practice is both delivered by medical practitioners in our society and approached by those who require this primary health care given by GPs in our social structure and according to the expectation of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has taken very firm steps to remedy what he has perceived&mdash;I think quite correctly&mdash;as the growth in use of medical services per person in Australia. The measures being undertaken represent a very radical step in the evolution of Medicare in this country but have nevertheless been required by the increased use of medical services to which I have alluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note in the consideration of this legislation&mdash;it is not directly dealt with in the legislation, but it has been commented on often&mdash;that consultations and discussions have already been undertaken in a preliminary way between the Government, the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Following a meeting between the Minister and the presidents of those organisations, those meetings have got under way. I have been informed this evening that the meetings that were held on Friday afternoon&mdash;which were spoken about during Friday's committee hearing&mdash;led to the documents tabled by me in that committee meeting being slightly amended to meet concerns of the medical profession and to further accommodate its views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the AMA and the RACGP have still to agree formally on the structure, officials are now satisfied with the stage that has been reached in setting up the process of consultation. It is my understanding that it is expected that the general practice consultative committee&mdash;the top level consultative group proposed&mdash;is planning to meet for the first time on 21 November. It seems that the process is getting under way. I expect that will be undertaken in good faith on all sides, and we can hope that the consultations will allow the matters that have been foreshadowed as part of the Budget package to be modified and refined in a way that enables their practical implementation amongst general practitioners in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note the contribution made by Senator Harradine. He expressed a genuine concern about the effect of the co-payment on the finances of a household, a family, in Australia. I can only say again that the safety net proposals represent a substantial improvement in protection for families. As Senator Harradine will know, there is currently a requirement for payment of up to $246 per person; that is the safety net threshold for an individual at the moment. This legislative proposal would make that safety net threshold amount of $246 the same for families as for individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that where a family with one, two or three dependants is subjected to a sudden acute, serious illness or a series of illnesses or there is a chronic condition of one or several members, the fact that out of hospital private medical services can be obtained for a maximum of $246 a year&mdash;where its doctors charge the schedule fee or less&mdash;is a very considerable improvement on what would otherwise have been the family's situation. In fact, I am told that the change would reduce the maximum costs for out of hospital private medical services of a couple with two children from $984 to $246 a year where their doctors charge the schedule fee or less. I think there has been a genuine attempt by the Government to meet the concerns of families which Senator Harradine has quite properly outlined as a matter of concern to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that most matters which have been canvassed in the debate tonight have been exhaustively dealt with during the consideration of these matters in various forums of the Senate over the past couple of weeks. I do not believe that I can usefully add to the discussion. I simply commend to the Senate the Health Insurance Amendment Bill and the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2), which carry out several reforms. As Senator Harradine noted, they introduce a new penalty provision and a new set of referral powers to a Medicare participation review committee. It is believed that the operation of that committee will help to act as a deterrent to medical practitioners who render excessive services. I believe that the empowering of those committees and the penalties in relation to the participation of the medical practitioner in Medicare arrangements will have a substantial effect on the temptation to which a medical practitioner might otherwise succumb to render excessive medical services. I commend both Bills to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill will give effect to the measures announced by the Government in the Industry Statement of 12 March 1991: "Building a Competitive Australia". The Bill will extend the existing wholesale sales tax exemptions to cover a wider range of business inputs for use by goods producers and certain other categories of persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Goods producers include those persons carrying on business in the primary production, mining and manufacturing sectors. Other persons that will become entitled to exemptions include research and development entities and cargo handlers at sea and international air ports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemption will also be available for subcontractors to goods producers or to any of the other eligible persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to reduce the costs incurred by Australia's goods producing sectors. Goods producers will be able to be more competitive in both domestic and international markets as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to revenue is estimated to be $445m in 1992-93, which will be the first full year of operation of the measures. The overall benefit to Australian business, allowing for the flow-on effects of reducing costs earlier in the production chain, is expected to be over $1 billion in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New exemptions for goods producers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will extend sales tax exemption to a wider range of goods used in production-related activities such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">research and development or engineering and technical design of goods or production processes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">mine site rehabilitation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the transport of goods by rail, pipeline or conveyor between production premises, eligible storage facilities or exempt ports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">storage, handling or dispatch of finished goods, raw materials, work in progress or business inputs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">certain ancillary and supporting activities which ensure the efficiency of the production process. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- training production staff</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- accident prevention</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- pollution control</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- lighting or cleaning of production premises</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- scheduling or costing of production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will introduce a new general definition of primary production operations. This will place beyond doubt that exemption will be available for general purpose tools for use mainly in carrying out such operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research and Development Entities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to goods producers carrying out research and development, this Bill will also apply to certain R&amp;D entities, such as those registered with the Industry Research and Development Board. These entities will be eligible for exemption or refunds of tax which has been paid on equipment or materials used for researching or developing new or improved Australian goods or production processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will assist specialist R&amp;D organisations, even where they are not working under contract to goods producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the new exemptions will be subject to a main use test, i.e., goods will qualify for exemption where used more than 50% in one, or a combination of, eligible activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sea cargo and international air cargo handlers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide new exemptions for goods used by persons operating storage or handling facilities for sea or international air cargo. These exemptions will also include ancillary or supporting activities carried out in relation to the cargo handling process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This important new measure will reduce the operating costs of Australia's sea ports and international airports and the benefits will flow on to all goods for export. This will enhance the opportunities for Australia's exporters to be truly competitive in international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subcontractors</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subcontractors will now be entitled to exemption for a wider range of equipment or materials used in work carried out for goods producers. It will be a requirement that the goods producer (or other eligible person) would have been entitled to exemption had they used the equipment in the same circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recognises that there is now a greater demand by goods producers for specialist contractors to carry out activities that traditionally have been performed by the producers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of existing exclusions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current sales tax law, certain goods are specifically excluded from the various exemptions applicable to agriculturalists, miners and manufacturers. The Bill will remove many of these restrictions, thereby extending exemption to the following classes of goods when used in qualifying circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lubricants</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">office furniture, equipment and consumables</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">general purpose road vehicles when used exclusively within or between contiguous production premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional refunds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow for special refunds where stock on hand has been purchased inclusive of sales tax after 12 March 1991, and where those goods are used for the first time after the commencement of this Bill, in newly exempted activities. This important transitional provision recognises that goods producers should not be disadvantaged merely because they are holding tax paid stocks of goods which will be used for the first time in exempt circumstances after the legislation takes effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commencement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes made by this Bill will apply to all taxable dealings that occur on or after the date of Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net revenue cost of the proposed changes is estimated to be $240m for the 1991-92 part year, and $445m in 1992-93.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991, which is being debated today, provides the legislative machinery for the implementation of a number of social security changes which were announced in the Budget. While I envisage that the family allowance assets test will dominate this debate, I would like to concentrate on two other provisions in this Bill which serve to highlight serious deficiencies in one particular area of this Government's social policy framework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill contains two provisions which are designed to benefit a group which is probably the most socially disadvantaged of any group in our society. The group to which I am referring are homeless young people. First, the Government proposes to extend eligibility for rent assistance to independent and homeless people under the age of 18. This proposal will affect under 18-year-olds who are in receipt of the independent rate of Jobsearch allowance, sickness allowance, disability support pension and special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, homeless young people are probably the single most socially disadvantaged group in our community. Anyone with anything to do with these young people is repeatedly told how difficult it is to find accommodation with rising rents, especially in the city, and bonds which make it virtually impossible for them to find accommodation or to maintain permanent or semi-permanent accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These young people face the additional problem that the amount of suitable and accessible accommodation which is available in the inner suburbs of cities like Sydney and Melbourne is rapidly decreasing. It is impossible to overestimate the value of permanent or semi-permanent accommodation to independent young people. Shelter is one of the three fundamental needs. For homeless young people, it is infinitely more important. A home is a refuge from the pedlars, the pushers and the pimps who haunt our cities and cruelly take advantage of the desperate and down-and-out in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a home, these young people are infinitely more susceptible to a variety of problems, including malnourishment, disease, sexual exploitation and physical mistreatment. For these reasons, the Government's proposal to extend rental assistance to people who are in receipt of the young homeless allowance is very much welcomed by the coalition. It is a long awaited initiative that the community workers who spend their lives looking after these kids have been advocating for years and years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill will allow certain special beneficiaries who are under 16 years to be eligible for Jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance. Such people must be above the minimum school leaving age, must have an employment history and must not be living with or being supported by their parents. They must also fulfil the normal criteria for qualifying for Jobsearch allowance. This initiative will end the discriminatory situation in which independent job seekers aged under 16 remain ineligible for labour market assistance simply on the basis of their age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition contends that the decision to extend labour market assistance to independent young people aged under 16 is a sensible but long overdue step in the right direction. For a long time, it has been known that the average age of street kids has been growing progressively younger. Anyone with any knowledge of youth homelessness will tell us that early intervention is crucially important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By placing these children on special benefit, rather than Jobsearch allowance, the Government has, in effect, been fostering a welfare mentality from the earliest age.  By not aligning access to labour market programs with school leaving age, the Government is telling one of the most disadvantaged groups in our society that it is not fit for employment. While the Government deserves kudos for both these initiatives, as well as its improved administration of the young homeless  allowance, its overall response to youth homelessness since Burdekin has been, at the very best, mediocre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe, who has been primarily responsible for the Federal Government's response to Burdekin, admitted in July 1991 that the Government has been `very, very fuzzy about what homelessness was really about and what the causes were'. Mr Howe claimed that there was no way of knowing whether the hundreds of millions of dollars spent since Burdekin had done anything to help.  He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I don't think we'd ever know if we got there because we weren't all too clear what the problems were at the beginning.  It's rare to see a program started with an evaluation built into it, so how do we know whether we've got there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We most certainly have not got there, in terms of solving youth homelessness.  In fact, I believe that we have gone backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last June, the founder of the largest youth services program in Washington, DC, Ms Deborah Shore, visited Australia and she brought with her a grim warning. Ms Shore believes that Australian reports on youth homelessness reveal that we are experiencing the same trends as surfaced in the United States 15 years ago. She urged school administrators, government departments, business and community groups to tackle the problem now before it spirals out of control. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is at a critical stage in relation to young homeless people. What is going on now in US schools is dreadful. Communities are becoming like armed camps, the drug situation is so out of control. The level of violence is such that parents are asking for all the help they can get. </PARA>
<PARA>And a word of advice from Ms Shore to crisis workers in Brisbane:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't wait and study your problems, look at our problems and use them to help solve yours. The very same things that are forcing kids on the street in the US are forcing kids on the street in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>If recent media reports are to be believed, Ms Shore's prophecies need to be taken very seriously. I remind honourable senators that so often we have followed in the footsteps of the United States in a number of the social issues that it has had to address&mdash;the women's movement, grey power and other social issues. I can think of one very recently that was pointed out at a conference I attended in law, psychology and psychiatry, where a psychiatrist from New York who had been one of the people advocating de-institutionalisation was calling on Australians to be careful not to follow blindly in the path of the Americans because the numbers of homeless people in New York had been increased and added to by the people who had been moved out of institutions. We have another warning here from a person in America who has been experienced in this area&mdash;as I said, the founder of the largest youth service programs in Washington, DC&mdash;warning Australia that we are following again in the US footsteps and that we ought to take heed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports that we have seen in the media indicate that in the three years since Burdekin there has been an increase in the number of young homeless people but a decrease in our ability as a society to cope with this problem. One of Australia's longest running and most successful charities for street kids, namely, the Open Family Foundation in Melbourne, is battling to stay afloat due to an increased demand for its services and inadequate government and corporate funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Uniting Church report last month on homelessness in the inner eastern suburbs of Melbourne found that there has been a 26 per cent increase in the number of homeless since 1989. The Wesley Mission in Sydney found in May this year that there had been a 30 per cent increase in the number of street kids since 1989. This is not centuries ago, this is since 1989&mdash;a 30 per cent increase. The Uniting Church reports a 26 per cent increase in Melbourne and a 30 per cent increase in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State-wide report by the New South Wales Youth Accommodation Association last June found that only four in 10 homeless young people find beds each night. We can well think about where the other six out of every 10 spend their nights. These figures are not confined to Sydney and Melbourne. Similar stories are starting to come out of every State capital, the national capital here in Canberra and a number of regional centres such as Cairns, Wollongong and the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these figures do not tell the whole tragic story. A large proportion of these street kids are drug addicts and alcoholics whose only means of supporting their addictions is by prostituting themselves. Only a naive fool would think or pretend that none of these kids are HIV positive or have contracted AIDS. One Kings Cross inhabitant who was recently interviewed by a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> summed up the situation quite succinctly when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you're hanging out for drugs and a `mug'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and for the uninitiated in this Senate that means a client&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">offers you the money for a `job'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that means sex&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">without a condom, then you go for the money. AIDS doesn't seem to come into it.</PARA>
<PARA>These young people cannot wait while the Government fiddles. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what approach should be taken to tackling the problem of youth homelessness? I believe very strongly that there are two overriding principles which the Government must recognise when it finally formulates a policy in this area. Neither principle is revolutionary. Both were very clearly spelt out by Commissioner Burdekin. They are, firstly, to look at the causation and, secondly, to implement early intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain. First, it must be realised that for all the parties involved, including the Government, the best solution to the problem of youth homelessness involves preventing its occurrence in the first place. Put simply, we must all put greater emphasis on treating the causes rather than the symptoms of youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I know that the responsible Ministers, Howe and Staples, accept the importance of this overriding principle, there is little evidence that their rhetoric is finding its way into government programs. The Government must clearly identify the underlying problems which cause youth homelessness. These include unemployment, financial and work related stresses and pressures, the lack of affordable housing, substance abuse, abuse and isolation from support services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far greater emphasis must be placed on preventative measures in the areas of family counselling, mediation in family disputes, the provision of cooling-off periods, temporary accommodation, respite care and reconciliation. It must also be realised that it is not good enough to simply provide family support services. Without effective accompanying communications, marketing and networking strategies, these services will remain inaccessible and under-utilised, if the potential clients do not know that they exist and are not informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a large number of family disputes come to a head during the evening or on weekends. However, counselling services are, in the majority, unable to take account of this important factor. I do not believe that the Government should underestimate the detrimental effect that the absolute dearth of after hours assistance for families has had on family breakdowns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second overriding principle that policy-makers must recognise is that an effective solution to youth homelessness, both in terms of individual victims as well as the overall problem, is very reliant on early intervention. I believe that in the community there is general acceptance that homeless children cannot and should not be held responsible for their plight and that, as a caring and compassionate society, we have a responsibility to assist them, especially to lead meaningful lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to date there is little evidence that this Government, or any of the State governments for that matter, is willing to make the sort of full-blown policy commitment that is required to prevent us from following in the tragic footsteps of the United States. Back in 1988, Burdekin stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective action is urgently needed to address this problem. Such action cannot be half-hearted or poorly planned. Homeless children and young people are dying in some cases and suffering horrific abuses of their rights in many others. Homelessness itself is a denial of rights theoretically guaranteed to our children and young people by the Commonwealth. This Report must be the catalyst for a serious and sustained response if this nation is to consider itself civilised.</PARA>
<PARA>Three years later, it is not possible to say that either the Commonwealth or the States have undertaken a serious and sustained response to the Burdekin report. Nor has there been any coordinated approach to homelessness both between tiers of government as well as across the relevant portfolios such as social security, health, community services, education,  family  and  criminal law  and housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's response to Burdekin can best be described as piecemeal, spasmodic and ineffectual. Burdekin concluded that there were between 20,000 and 25,000 homeless children and young people across Australia. The Government, and particularly the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), have not been able to give me an up-to-date estimate of the number of homeless people, young people in particular, in Australia. Given the effects of the current recession and the fact that youth unemployment is now nearly 30 per cent, it is reasonable to assume that youth homelessness has risen significantly since Burdekin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the first to admit that the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and the youth supported accommodation program have increased the percentage of total public housing stock that is available to young homeless people. However, a number of State governments have been accused of not upholding their end of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement bargain. There are also constant reports that youth refuges either are being threatened with closure or are unable to cope with the demand for their services because of inadequate funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe, has paraded his national housing strategy as the most important housing review in Australia's history, it is telling that not one cent of the $3m being spent on this strategy will go to examining the housing needs of homeless young people. Mr Howe has reportedly told youth workers that the Government believes that it has dealt with young homelessness with the Burdekin report. So we have had a report and that seems to be enough. The fact that not one cent of the $815m better cities program has been allocated to youth homelessness confirms the low priority that this Government is giving to the plight of homeless young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the health area, both the Commonwealth's national better health program and its health promotion program have purported to focus on health issues which affect homeless young people. In spite of these programs, a recent study by the National Health and Medical Research Council has found that the majority of homeless young people have serious health problems. Street workers also report that an increasing number of homeless young people suffer from mental and psychiatric disorders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of education, the Government's disadvantaged schools program caters for students in disadvantaged circumstances. However, this program has also been stymied by inadequate funding and poor coordination between the Commonwealth and the States. These problems are now so dire that a project which the Minister for Social Security claimed two months ago to be the most innovative he had seen is unable to achieve any government funding at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This uncoordinated and piecemeal approach to youth homelessness resulted in Brian Burdekin last May venting his frustration at the lack of an effective response to his report. Speaking at the launch of a report by the Salvation Army into youth homelessness in Victoria, Mr Burdekin stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some serious questions to ask ourselves in. . . the next couple of weeks in terms of where resources will go and what our priorities are and whether the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in our community are getting the sort of priority on the political agenda that they need to get if we are to genuinely consider ourselves a civilised and caring community.</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the urgency of the problem, Mr Burdekin was adamant about the future cost of not paying immediate attention to the problem of youth homelessness. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will probably pay enormous costs in social security for the rest of the lives of these young people if we don't get off our backsides and start providing some decent programs.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burdekin is telling the Government that, even if it does not see youth homelessness as a priority for social justice reasons, it should at least recognise the financial price that will be paid in the future if this problem is not addressed now. It is a call to the Government that, instead of taking a short term approach, it should take a long term approach, both to the social consequences for these young people and the cost for future generations, if there is to be a huge proportion of young people dependent on the welfare system for the rest of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly not all the blame rests with the Federal Government. As Commissioner Burdekin has stated, much of the problem lies with the fact that the Commonwealth funds which are designated for homeless young people are not being translated into practical on-the-ground programs by the States. Quite understandably then, youth housing and community workers across the country are very concerned that, as part of its reform of Commonwealth-State relations, the Government is proposing to untie $100m of SAAP grants that have previously been designated for homeless young people. I am well aware of these concerns, as is the Minister for Social Security who has had them expressed to him many times this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the Special Premiers Conference, if it goes ahead, will provide the Government with a great opportunity to show some leadership on the issue of homelessness and, in particular, youth homelessness. Last July, my hopes were enhanced by Minister Staples who emphasised the need for the development of national policies on the prevention of youth homelessness as part of the new federalism agenda. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're kidding ourselves if we think we will solve homelessness by simply building more refuges. . . the root causes must be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA>. . .                    . . .                      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next step is to improve local level coordination of service delivery through better planning, the provision of State level prevention services, related essential support services and longer term housing options.</PARA>
<PARA>For once, Minister Staples is right. The Government and the Parliament must look at the root causes of youth homelessness. It is high time that we had a national youth homelessness policy. We must set national objectives and a national framework for the solution to this problem. We must devise and implement coordinated, well-planned and adequately planned programs across all portfolios and at all three tiers of government. We must ensure that these are coordinated if we are to address this important issue. Above all, we must realise that these street kids, these young homeless people, cannot wait. They are crying out for us to act now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend my colleague Senator Patterson for her very careful and sympathetic analysis of the problems of youth homelessness. I also take the opportunity to thank her for her versatility in speaking at the stage at which she did during this debate. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), with which we are presently concerned, contains a large number of measures which in many respects go to enhance the social security system. But by far the most significant item is the introduction of an assets test for family allowances. Whilst this measure is in a sense a revenue collection measure, it has nevertheless focused attention on the merits of the family allowance in a way that I do not think has happened in recent years. That is quite unfortunate because, in many respects, the family allowance should not even be in the welfare system. If we believe in horizontal equity, then we ought to be regarding parents and families as having an entitlement to a payment of that sort without it having to be paid from the welfare budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of the other great compensating virtue of it being paid through the welfare system rather than through the tax system, and that is that it enables the payments to be made to the principal carer rather than to the taxpayer. In that sense, of course, it provides a very great and valuable service, in most instances, to the mothers of young children. Therefore, on balance, it remains a very useful mechanism in the way that it is currently structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this Government has done for families in relation to family allowances is very parsimonious indeed. The family allowance is still not fully indexed, and has remained in that condition ever since 1977-78 when it was introduced by the Fraser Government. Despite the fact that it was not indexed in the early years, in November 1982 there was a 50 per cent increase which restored the value of the family allowance to the average value at the date of its introduction. In other words, the Fraser Government is entitled to hold its head high as the Government that maintained indexation throughout its period in government from the date of introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Hawke Government has managed to see the value of the family allowance progressively reduced to the point where it has been estimated that in the order of $6.8 billion has been forgone. That amount of money has been taken from low and middle income families who would, in many respects, I think, value the family allowance above any other payment. That being the case, it is a matter of shame that not only has this Government been the one to cut back on the family allowance to such a significant extent but also its real concern in the context of this Bill will be to cut it back even further. That is a hard decision that it proposes to take and it is one that has caused a deal of anguish on this side, which is well understood. But, at the end of the day, I think we have made the right decision. We will support the initiative and I will elaborate on the details of it tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the Review of Intergovernmental Relations, the October Special Premiers' Conference directed that functional reviews of broad program areas be conducted. The Communique of that Conference also specified that the fundamental objective underlying any change arising from the process would be to improve the existing system for delivery of programs and services in the interests of citizens. The Home and Community Care (HACC) program was given a high priority for review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the July Special Premiers' Conference, leaders and representatives agreed that the Functional Review of Health and Aged Care should proceed with a view to integrating community care for the aged, post-acute and palliative care and younger people with disabilities into the broader functional areas to which they relate. It was further agreed that final decisions would be taken at the November Special Premiers' Conference in conjunction with decisions on roles and responsibilities in the areas of acute health and aged care. Therefore, while it is possible to outline the process and issues to be considered, it is not possible to anticipate the decisions of Heads of Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of policy reviews which relate to the HACC program have formed the basis for advice and recommendations to Heads of Government on the future directions of the HACC program.

This was reiterated by Functional Ministers in September 1991 when they noted the need to ensure flexibility in service delivery arrangements, including sensitivity to local conditions and integration of services.

As a result there has been consultation with the community as part of the Functional Review of Health and Aged Care. The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) conducted consultations with peak community organisations in March 1991 prior to the deliberations of functional Ministers on directions for reform of the HACC Program.ACOSS also hosted two community consultations during August and September in the wider context of the Functional Review of Health and Aged Care. Key documents arising from the Review of Intergovernmental Relations, including the Communiques of both the October 1990 and the July 1991 Special Premiers'Conferences and that of the Functional Ministers' meeting in September, have been made publicly available to ensure that the community has access to information about the course of considerations to date. I anticipate that this process will continue as further decisions are made.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's natural resources include minerals, agricultural products and timber. Overall, the value of exports of these resources in a processed form is small compared to the total exports of unprocessed commodities. The Government is very conscious of the impediments to the further development of the processing industry in Australia and the need to address these both on a sector by sector basis and through general micro-economic reform. The state of industry development in the various sectors of resource processing is described below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mineral Products</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's exports of processed minerals were valued at around $10 billion in 1989/90. There is significant export potential, particularly in the areas of aluminium, steel, mineral sands and magnesium. This is due in large part to our world class mineral deposits and mining industry, and strong R and D capabilities. However, the depressed state of the world mineral markets is limiting our opportunities for export.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are substantial opportunities to expand exports of processed foods, particularly to the Asian region where demand for processed foods is growing rapidly and tastes are becoming increasingly westernised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) With the exception of Senate committee chairs, members of committees as such receive no special remuneration. Senate committee chairs receive additional remuneration determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. All Senators who are committee members are entitled to travelling allowance for each overnight stay away from their home base when that stay is occasioned primarily by a meeting of, or travel to or from a meeting of, a parliamentary committee of which the Senator is a member. (Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 34/1990, paragraph 6(b)). All Senators who are chairs of committees are also entitled to travelling allowance for each overnight stay away from their home base when travelling on committee business as distinct from attending committee meetings. (Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 34/1990, paragraph 16). These entitlements to remuneration and travelling allowance are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal which reviews and varies them from time to time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Committee chairs receive differing rates of remuneration. The chairs of standing committees receive less remuneration than the chairs of certain joint committees, but more than the chairs of select, privileges or legislative scrutiny committees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The level of additional remuneration and additional allowances for committee chairs is set by the Remuneration Tribunal. Chairs of committees are, to a greater extent than other committee members, involved in planning and managing committee inquiries and considering papers, reports and correspondence. They are also called upon to address seminars and conferences on the work of their committees.

Since the material is too voluminous to be incorporated in Hansard with this answer, I will table it in the Senate. I propose to table this material each year since I consider that it should be publicly available in the same way as many other details of parliamentarians' remuneration and allowances are now made public at the end of each financial year.</PARA>
