<TITLE>AIDEX Exhibition</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.</PARA>
<PARA>  And we, your humble petitioners will as in duty bound, ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>  That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio.

<PARA>  (1)  Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>

<PARA>  (a)  recalls the statement by the then Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) at the launch of the Public Service Commission's Disability Information Strategy on 23 October 1990 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>    I regard as totally unsatisfactory the reported decline in the level of recruitment of people with disabilities into the public service. The Government cannot accept a situation where the public service is operating in a manner that is inconsistent with the broader objectives that the Government has set for the employment of people with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  registers its concern that between 1986-89, the percentage of staff with disabilities fell in forty-four out of fifty federal agencies;</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  notes that both the Government's own Disability Task Force and the Labor Force and Disability Workforce Consultancy recommended that the Australian Public Service (APS) take the lead in implementing effective equal employment opportunity and affirmative action programs which would improve access to paid employment for people with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA>  (d)  recalls that the Government spent $50 000 in 1990-91 on developing a public service-wide disability information strategy to help facilitate the employment of people with disabilities in the APS;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Senate--</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  recalls a statement made by the then Treasurer (Mr Keating), on 7 June 1985 to the Melbourne Age Taxation Symposium in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>        . . . We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice. And we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this.</PARA>
<PARA>        . . . It would be all too easy to let the discussion collapse to the lowest common denominator. The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation.</PARA>
<PARA>        But the question is whether we have, as a nation, the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such overdue change.</PARA>
<PARA>        I have no doubt that, unless this climate is acted upon, tax reform will be thrown back into the too hard basket for another 20 to 30 years at immense cost to the vast majority of Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  calls on the Government to accurately and concisely state why this statement is any less accurate on 17 October 1991 than it was when it was made, especially as the mass of Australians, the ordinary taxpayers, now pay a far higher proportion of their income in direct and indirect taxation than they did when the statement was made by Mr Keating.</PARA>

<PARA>  That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to allow losses on valueless shares to be claimed as a capital loss and thus be available for netting off against any capital gains accruing in the current or future years, in circumstances where the company, the subject of the investment, is in liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA>The current capital gains provisions do not allow for capital losses arising from investments in shares in circumstances where the corporation is in liquidation and where a valid and effective transfer of ownership cannot be effected. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the liquidator rarely directs funds for maintaining a share register.</PARA>
<PARA>Timing problems arising from the present capital losses provisions reflect yet another example of taxpayers' restricted rights under taxation law in Australia. Other jurisdictions with capital gains assessing provisions provide a recognition of loss in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will thus allow capital losses to be available to offset capital gains in the current or future years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has acknowledged the problem, since Income Tax Ruling 2643 suggests that a loss can be crystallised by transferring relevant shares to an associate party for a nominal consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the ruling may founder through certain provisions of the Corporations Law as absolute control and ownership of the shares may not be validly and effectively transferred in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to determine the mechanism or technique to crystallise the loss. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the ATO in Income Tax Ruling 2643 has stated that under certain stated conditions Part IV A would not typically apply to "wash sales", there is still a probability that the share sale arrangements between related parties, including family members, could be caught by the anti-avoidance Part IV A mechanisms as the facts of each case need to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>"It is not possible to give an assurance that Part IV A would not apply to wash sales generally"--ATO Ruling 2643. </PARA>
<PARA>Most significantly, I believe the ruling to be wrong in law. One accounting firm has stated that, "The ruling appears to substitute some form of arm's length test for the true test contained in Part IV A. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill defines the valueless shares as having negligible or nil value. A similar situation exists within the UK tax legislation. The "negligible value" is not quantified in the UK legislation, though the UK inland Revenue considers negligible to be less than or equal to five per cent of the par value of the share. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a determination could be assisted by an appropriate income tax ruling. </PARA>
<PARA>To complement the legislation, the ATO would publish from time to time, details of lists of shares where such claims would be accepted. The circulation would be via organisations including the Taxation Institute of Australia, Butterworths and CCH tax services, the Australian Taxpayers Association, Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>The concept of a deemed disposal and re-acquisition is a familiar one within the context of Part III A. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 160WA(2) will require the taxpayer to make an election by notice in writing given to the Commissioner on or before the date of lodgement of the income tax return for the year in which the disposal of the share is deemed to have taken place or within such further time as the Commissioner allows. </PARA>
<PARA>This technique provides a degree of flexibility and a mechanism for current period or future eventualities. </PARA>
<PARA>In Taxation Ruling No. IT2624, the Commissioner exempts companies, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation funds from the necessity to lodge such election notices. The ruling, however, does not apply to individuals or trusts. </PARA>
<PARA>However, once the full self-assessment system, as outlined in the Federal Treasurer's 1991 August Budget, is fully implemented, individual and trusts will no longer be required to lodge such election notices but simply retain them as part of the taxation records. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal beneficiaries from this Bill will be private investors who invest in their own names and who have to dispose of shares before being able to claim the losses but cannot because of provisions in the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill may have been drafted more widely to cover persons who hold units in a unit trust where the value of the units may have been lost, i.e. units in Estate Mortgage or provided for situations where shares in a company are valueless, but no formal winding up has been entered into in order to liquidate the company. Such extensions would have required a more complex Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost to revenue would not be significant. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>  That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>  The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) 1991 gives effect to a number of measures most of which were announced in the 1991 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his Budget Speech the Treasurer recalled that in 1987 the Government introduced the Family Allowance Supplement to provide a basis for targeting income support to families and that during 1991-92 the Government would be building on that work. The Treasurer announced that a major families package would be introduced to provide additional assistance to low and medium income families with children and target Family Allowance more effectively. This Bill provides for the first stage of that package. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 January 1992, the existing parental assets test of $347,500 (indexed each 1 January) for family allowance supplement (FAS) will be replaced by a family assets test. The existing assets test for FAS is based on parental assets only. This can be avoided by rearranging assets among family members to ensure parental assets fall below the test threshold. As a result of the changes this possible avenue of avoidance will be closed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Family Allowance is the only major social security payment not subject to an assets test. This Bill provides for the introduction from 1 January 1992 of a family assets test of $600,000 of net assets excluding the family home. </PARA>
<PARA>  Currently, the parental assets test on FAS removes entitlement when the value of net assets (excluding the family home) exceeds $347,500. In the prevailing economic circumstances, especially the effects of the rural downturn, the Government is concerned about the welfare of children in families with assets above the test threshold but where those assets are returning very low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill proposes to introduce a special financial hardship test to operate for the next two years from 1 January 1992. This change will protect these families by allowing them to continue to receive FAS if the value of their net assets does not exceed $600,000. If the value of their net assets exceeds $600,000, they may continue to receive FA only. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 April 1992, the income threshold at which full rate FAS is payable (currently $18,000 a year) will be increased and aligned with the AUSTUDY income threshold. (This is currently $19,300. From January 1992 this will increase to $20,700 a year, indexed each January.) This increase in the FAS income threshold will increase both the number of families eligible for FAS and the entitlements of families receiving less than the maximum rate of FAS. It will also achieve greater consistency between the AUSTUDY and FAS income tests. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under current arrangements, all FAS recipients, irrespective of whether a full or part rate is payable, are entitled to a health care card. In order to bring entitlement to health care cards more into line with the income test arrangements for eligibility for health care cards for low income earners, from 1 January 1992 health care card entitlement will be limited to existing FAS recipients (full or part rate) and new recipients of full rate FAS. </PARA>
<PARA>  Provisions to give effect to the second stage of the package, namely, integration of Family Allowance, FAS and Additional Pension and Benefit and the continuation of payment of FA until the end of a young person's secondary studies or to the end of the year in which the young person turns 18, whichever is the earlier, will be introduced in the Autumn Sittings next year.</PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 January 1992, a person's FAS will be recalculated where the person's income increases to 125% of his or her base tax year income even though the increase was not related to a notifiable event. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also effect a number of minor changes, from 1 January 1992, in the area of families administration. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other measures contained in this Bill will also benefit families. First, on 1 January 1992 there will be an increase in the rate of Child Disability Allowance by $2.15 a week (after the annual 1 January indexation has occurred) to help restore Child Disability Allowance to the same value it had in real terms when introduced in 1987. The Youth Disability Supplement will be increased by the same amount. Second, family payments will be back-paid to the child's date of birth if a claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the date of birth where the child is born on or after 1 January 1992. At present back payments apply only if a claim is lodged within 4 weeks of the date of birth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sole parent pensioners face substantial up-front costs when undertaking education. Although those undertaking vocational training have course fees, books and equipment paid for, no similar assistance is available to those undertaking general education. Accordingly, this Bill provides for a $200 up-front payment to be made each year to sole parent pensioners who are starting or continuing full-time or part-time education courses and who are eligible for the AUSTUDY supplement. This will apply from 1 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  There can be no doubt that young persons who have to live away from home or who leave secondary studies at an early age face considerable social and economic disadvantages. With this in mind, this Bill provides for initiatives directed at young persons under 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance provisions relating to young persons aged 16 to 17 years have helped to improve the circumstances of many young people. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, many face hardship because, although they have lived away from home for a substantial period, they are precluded from Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance as they do not meet the employment requirement set down in this definition. This Bill provides that, from 1 January 1992, for an "independent young person", 13 weeks registration with the CES will be accepted. At present the definition requires that the young person must actually have been employed. </PARA>
<PARA>  At present, a 16 to 17 year old person in substitute care for whom no substitute care or similar allowance is being paid receives the basic rate of Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance unless he or she qualifies for the independent rate under other criteria. From 1 January 1992, this Bill provides for social security arrangements to be brought into line with AUSTUDY entitlements for 16 to 17 year old persons in substitute care. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are currently unemployed and sick 15 year olds who receive special benefit on the ground that they would, apart from age, qualify for Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance respectively. These special beneficiaries are required to comply with all the usual Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance qualification and payability conditions but are subject to more rigorous income testing, ie, dollar for dollar reduction in benefit for each dollar of income earned. Persons in this category are not eligible for transition-to-work incentives such as the Employment Entry Payment and are not generally eligible, under Department of Employment, Education and Training guidelines, for the labour market assistance available for 16 and 17 year old Job Search Allowance recipients. This places 15 year olds who are essentially in the same position as their 16 and 17 year old Job Search Allowance counterparts at a distinct disadvantage. This Bill extends qualification for Job Search Allowance to 15 year olds who meet the requirements for Job Search Allowance apart from age, who are above the minimum school leaving age or have a formal exemption from attending school, who have an employment history and who are not living with or being supported by a parent. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a need to ensure that any anomalies in social security legislation or administration are removed. To that end, from the day of Royal Assent, neither Job Search Allowance nor Newstart Allowance will be payable to persons receiving income that is paid by a community or group from funds provided under a Commonwealth funded employment program. If the person's partner is receiving such income, the person will not be entitled to an additional payment in respect of the partner. </PARA>
<PARA>  There can be no person in Australia today who is not aware of the special difficulties being faced by the rural community. Although many primary producers are `asset rich' they are often `income poor'. As a result, they may receive reduced social security payments or none at all as a result of the application of the assets test. This may be the case even though they have considerable liabilities. At present, the assets test works by compartmentalising debts so that they can be offset against only the particular asset which provides primary security for the debt and then only if the owner of the asset and the primary debtor are the same person. An example of the problems this causes is where the value of a person's farm is included in the person's assets thus precluding payments. Assume there is also farm machinery valued at $100,000 but it is subject to a bank lien of $150,000. Effectively the machinery has a negative value of $50,000. At present the liability of $50,000 cannot be offset against the value of the farm to allow the person to qualify for payments. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill modifies the assets test from 1 January 1992 to allow primary producers to deduct all liabilities which relate to carrying on of primary production from the value of all assets used in that production. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also ensure that, with effect from the day of Royal Assent, the value of a person's asset will be taken to be reduced by the value of a charge or encumbrance on the asset only if the person or the person's partner gets the direct benefit of a loan secured by the charge or encumbrance. This amendment will close a loophole highlighted by the recent Federal Court case of Clayton whereby mortgages taken out for the benefit of others were held to be allowable deductions. </PARA>
<PARA>  From the day of Royal Assent, the rules for assessing notional ordinary income within the hardship rules will be modified so that owners of residential premises that are occupied by family members in certain situations will not be penalised because the premises are not attracting commercial rates of rent. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill provides for the implementation of two initiatives relating to rent assistance. First, the rent assistance waiting period for recipients of Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance, Sickness Allowance or Special Benefit who have no children and who are aged between 18 and 60 years will be reduced from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. This will apply also for disability support pensioners aged between 18 to 20 years. This will start on 20 March 1992. Also from 20 March 1992, eligibility for rent assistance will be extended to under 18 year olds who receive the homeless/independent rate of Job Search Allowance, Sickness Allowance, Disability Support Pension or Special Benefit and who have been receiving social security income support for at least 18 weeks. A further initiative relating to rent assistance will be included in a bill to be introduced later in the current Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also provides for the extension, from 1 July 1992, of bereavement payments to certain long term social security recipients and their partners. The bereavement provisions generally work by allowing the survivor of a pensioner couple to get paid more for a period of 14 weeks. In some cases a lump sum may be payable. However, at present, the bereavement provisions do not extend to beneficiary couples. The Bill also extends from 12 to 14 weeks the period in which a person receiving a widowed person allowance will be entitled to a bereavement payment. This measure will apply from 26 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>  The aftermath of the recent deaths of people at Strathfield highlighted an unfortunate aspect of current social security legislation whereby child bereavement payments were not available to some families. I gave an undertaking to correct this deficiency at the first opportunity. This Bill gives effect to that commitment and provides that, on the death of a child, a parent may be eligible for payment for 4 weeks of Family Allowance, Child Disability Allowance or Double Orphan Pension as is applicable in the particular circumstances. This measure is to be taken to have commenced on 17 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also makes some minor consequential amendments to various Acts mainly as a result of initiatives effected by this Bill and the introduction from 12 November 1991 of the disability reform package. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for his courtesy in allowing this procedure to take place. I am most grateful and I will try not to hold up the Senate or the Minister's group of advisers too long. Firstly, I will deal with the reservations that I made concerning the Australia Council. The peg is a question I asked about calculating the funding for the Australian Opera. I notice that in that funding there is no indication that the impact of the major award changes that took place last year has been met, apparently in any way, by the Government through the Performing Arts Board. Of course, this creates major problems because the orchestras for the opera and the ballet have, for the past 20 years, been fully funded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I understand it, there is an extra half a million dollars per orchestra--Sydney and Melbourne--involved in costs as a result of that work value case. The consequences of that huge additional cost are very severe indeed for the users of those orchestras. In fact, the Minister will no doubt be aware of a letter sent by the chairmen of the organisations that are mainly affected by this: Mr Redlich, the chairman of the Victorian Arts Centre; Mr Wiederberg, the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra; Mr Fred Millar, the Australian Ballet Foundation; Mr David Clarke, chairman of the Australian Opera; and Sir Rupert Hamer, chairman of the Victorian State Opera Company. I understand that letter went to the Prime Minister and to Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) and to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). </PARA>
<PARA>  I stress that, even today, as I understand it, there has been only a very moderate increase from the Performing Arts Board--something like 2.5 per cent--in the funds available for the orchestras' users, which would go nowhere near meeting this massive additional cost. The consequences are that either the opera and ballet orchestras will play with a smaller number than the required 69 or the users will have to pay for the extra players. For the first time in 20 years, these orchestras will not be fully funded. I hope the Minister will be able to indicate to me, firstly, what sort of response the Government has been able to give to this very concerned letter from these organisations and, secondly, what is going to happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The position is that the Performing Arts Board of the Australia Council was considering this matter last Friday, I am advised, although I am not certain of the result. The position of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is that the Performing Arts Board can, if it chooses to do so, allocate funds to cover this increase. The Minister has so far declined to provide extra funds to the Australia Council to cover the costs of increases in the award for musicians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My concern is that, if the Government has declined to fund this, it means that the Government has decided that it will not meet the additional cost of award decisions handed down by a tribunal. As I understand it, that is the first time this has happened in this area. I do not know of a situation where the Government has refused to meet, in a fully funded organisation, the determinations of a wage tribunal. Maybe there are circumstances when that has happened but I am unaware of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What I do know is that if this situation persists--and the Minister has outlined that the Government has declined to do this--according to these people there will be a crisis in the orchestral end of the opera and ballet. I understand that the Australian Opera has already written to the State Orchestra of Victoria advising that it cannot meet the additional costs because it does not have the income either from government grants or its ticket sales. As Mr Donald McDonald said in a letter to the Victorian Arts Centre Trust:</PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that you agree with us that to merely transfer part of the funding obligation for that orchestra from Government to user companies which are themselves Government funded, is a worrying and potentially dangerous step, which would act only to transfer the problem, not solve it. For over 20 years, Government has fulfilled the responsibility of funding the two orchestras; it is not reasonable for that responsibility to be diluted when the extra funding is required entirely to meet costs resulting from proper industrial process. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether the Minister could give any indication as to what the Government believes to be the correct way to resolve this problem. Is it suggesting to the user companies that they cut their expenditure elsewhere--for example, reduce the number of singers or dancers employed?  It would have to be a very substantial cut because in 1992 there will be a total shortfall of $883,519 in funds to pay the salaries of the two orchestras in the event of this situation remaining unresolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think there would be a number of ways that the orchestras or, indeed, the Opera and the Ballet could meet these costs. It would not simply relate to saying that the Opera would have fewer singers next year. I imagine that there would be a range of measures, including an increase in ticket prices, that could be used. I think what is occurring at moment is a proper examination of not only the financial situation, but also the administration of the orchestras to see which is the best way to go. As I said in answer to Senator Baume's first question, the Performing Arts Board is still considering whether to fund this. Once the Minister has seen a report from the Performing Arts Board, he might be in a position to take the matter further. I do not think this is the first time that the Commonwealth has not fully funded an award increase. I think the usual procedure has been that the Commonwealth and the States together fund such increases, although I will have that checked for Senator Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In so far as the Opera is concerned, we have made some one-off grants over recent years. Each time we make one, we are told that it is the only one it needs, but we have made a few more after each one. So I think the Government's support for the Australian Opera is graphically demonstrated by the number of times we have come in with extra funding. I hope that, whatever happens now, the Opera is not forced to cut the number of its performers. That does not mean there are not efficiencies to be gained in the Opera, the Ballet and the orchestras. </PARA>

In view of the courtesy he has extended to me in allowing me to raise this, I will not raise some of the other matters that I had wished to on the Australia Council. I will proceed to some other matters. I did have some difficulty with one of the replies to a question on notice. I asked how many of the 1,653 grants made to arts organisations were duplicated or jointly funded by State or local governments. In the previous year when I asked that question, I got a figure of around about half. I notice that the response this time equivocates and says in specific terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Performing Arts Board allocates the majority of the Council's general grant funds. In 1990-91 of the 76 companies receiving general grants, 68 were jointly funded by a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I am grateful for that information because it does underline a fairly substantial level of duplication, but I am wondering why the reply says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Council does not give a consolidated tally of this joint funding project by project across all art forms. </PARA>
<PARA>I wondered how the previous year's figure was indicated to me and whether, in fact, a ballpark of around about half, which was indicated last time, is accurate. </PARA>

I imagine that it would be a fairly big task to go through 1,600--or whatever it was--grants to find out which ones are funded by other tiers of government. I do not like the term `duplication', because I do not really think we are talking about duplication. There is an inference of inefficiency in the word `duplication'. Of course, many companies can exist only because they receive funds from two or three tiers of government. So I would prefer to use words like `supplementing' rather than words like `duplicating'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I proceed to the question of film. In particular, I would like to deal with a couple of matters that were raised in response to a question that I asked on Film Australia. It was about the extent to which there may have been a diminution of use by departments of Film Australia's facilities as a result of the change in the arrangements last year under which departments were no longer obliged to use Film Australia for their work. The reply to my question about whether the departments have been building up their own facilities was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Film Australia is aware that several departments do have installations which replicate what is already available in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>This includes Film Australia. It is not aware of any such developments since July.  What is the Government doing to ensure that the change in the arrangements does not lead to a wasteful duplication--in this case it would be a duplication, not a supplementation--of facilities and activities within the Department rather than using either the private sector or Film Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I now switch to the Film Finance Corporation. According to a report that came out after the meeting of the Senate Estimates Committee, the Australian Film Commission noted that there had been a significant decline in feature film production in the latest year, which it said was due to a levelling out of feature film investment by the Australian Film Finance Corporation, as well as a decline in the number of films funded principally by private investors, particularly foreign investors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When I looked at the Film Finance Corporation's previous balance sheet, it seemed to me that there had been a substantial increase in the volume of Film Finance funding in 1989-90. Was the decline in activity in 1990-91 related to the change in the Government's funding arrangements which, as I understand it, involved a slight diminution in terms of grants--I think $5m--but an attempt to raise more money through private sector prospectuses?  I had been under the impression that these prospectuses had been successful; in fact, that was the answer given to me during Senate Estimates. But if they had been successful and the Government's funding was reduced by only $5m, how come there has been this substantial reduction in the funding of films by the Film Finance Corporation, such that the Australian Film Commission says that it is the major reason for this decline in feature film production from $204m in 1989-90 to only $137m in 1990-91. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is best explained by pointing out that, while the Film Finance Corporation can have an allocation of $70m in one year, it does not necessarily spend it all in that year; there can be a carry-over into the following year. As I understand it, that is what occurred here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   As I understand it, the Film Finance Corporation has been quite successful in the private sector; its film funding is fully subscribed. Having said that I, like many senators yesterday, received a delegation from Actors Equity expressing concern that, if projected cuts in years ahead were to go ahead, we might find a substantial drop in the number of films being produced. I intend to seek the Minister's thoughts as to whether that is likely to occur. Obviously, in the aftermath of the end of 10BA, there were always going to be some difficulties. I think they have been substantially overcome in the last few years; I am not necessarily certain of the future. That is why, as a result of yesterday's meeting, I will be seeking some assurances from the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>  In terms of the future, a review is being conducted. I think that should be available to the Minister by the early months of the new year. The Minister then has to make a decision on the level of funding for the Film Finance Corporation.

What the Government does with the level of funding will be critical to the industry over the next few years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Minister. In particular, I am glad he mentioned the success of Proof--I would not have raised it. The thing that is striking about Proof is that it was, of course, a low budget film. As I recall, the Australian Film Commission was involved in its funding, rather than the Film Finance Corporation. What concerns me is that the Australian Film Commission's report on lower production levels dramatises that considerably fewer low budget films were made in the latest financial year. It says that 11 films--around half the number of 1989-90--were budgeted at under $3m. Does the Government have a policy view on this? Should we be looking more at big budget items?  Is it purely the Film Finance Corporation taking a big budget view? That is why I am grateful for the Minister's comment that it was interesting to note that Proof was so successful. Is there a Government policy that the Film Finance Corporation should be getting into the big bickies items and diminishing its role in low budget films?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I hope I am not corrected but, certainly, there was an onus placed upon the Film Finance Corporation for commercial success to enable it to attract significant private sector investment. There is always going to be a problem when one does that because of accusations of the sacrifice of culture in the pursuit of monetary gain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Film Finance Corporation, therefore, is looking at some, mostly in any event, pre-sale interest in a prospective production. Very often that means the Corporation is looking at some likely overseas distribution. Very often that is more likely to occur with a film that has a larger budget. So there may well have been a tendency in that direction. Again, referring to the representations that industry workers are making, the problem with that is this alleged cultural sacrifice in the sense that often overseas actors are put in these films to attract that pre-sale interest. There is considerable criticism; there is no point in kidding ourselves on that, and that is another matter I intend to take up with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not the Government's job to direct the arts. That is always a fine line which governments should never cross. But I am equally concerned to see that the range of films produced in Australia is as wide as possible and does not become too stereotyped--does not rely too much upon a formula. There are certainly many people in the industry who feel that it is heading in that direction. So that is another matter that I will take up with the Minister, and I will inform Senator Baume of the Minister's views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Minister very much for that--all the issues he raised are obviously of major concern, particularly when one is distributing a very limited amount of money. However, I would make the point in passing that film overall takes something like twice the amount of government revenue that is available to the total of all the other arts put together. So there are some problems with other arts groups which come seeking funds, particularly when one takes into account the tax expenditures involved in film making, which would probably have cost the taxpayer something like $20m in the latest year, according to the figures for private sector contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The next matter I want to raise relates to the roof of the Australian National Gallery. When I first asked about this disaster in Senate Estimates, I was told the cost was going to be something like $3m. This time we found that the cost is going to be well over $5m--it is $5.6m. Quite frankly, I find that totally unsatisfactory. I am not suggesting motive, but the response initially was clearly misleading because it did not include a whole range of other expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one asks for the cost of fixing something, one wants the cost, not what an individual contractor is going to get paid for it. In an answer at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing on 18 September 1990 an amount of $3.43m was referred to in connection with the roof repairs.  In fact, this amount referred to the contract price for the roof repairs but, in addition to the contract sum, fees are payable to the Australian Construction Service in the sum of $727,000 for administration supervision. A further $600,000 was spent on design and preparatory costs. The contract allows for a rise or fall in costs, and it is expected that additional costs associated with this will be approximately $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, when one asks a question about how much  it will cost to fix the roof one is told $3m which really, when it is translated into real language, means $5.6m. All I would ask is whether it is possible for someone to take on board that when a senator asks a question about the cost of something we should be told the cost, not a segment, a portion, a smorgasbord or a part of that cost. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason why this is of such major concern is evident later on when one sees what the cost of this roof disaster has really been to the Australian National Gallery. It is not simply a cost of $5.6m to fix it; it is the consequential cost of the Gallery's activities being severely inhibited during the years of that fixing. I asked how much the net surplus was for the year 1989-90--the year before the fixing of the roof started--so that I could get a feeling of just what the consequences of this roof mess have been. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fact, the whole thing has probably cost the National Gallery close to $10m both in expenditure to fix the roof and in revenue lost. In 1989-90 the net surplus of non-government revenue, excluding donations and sponsorship from specific subsidies and grants for the Australian National Gallery, totalled $2 1/2m. This included revenue from the British Museum exhibition and the art of photography exhibition. In 1990-91 that $2 1/2m collapsed to $150,000. For this year it is expected to be $380,000. That means a shortfall over those two years of $4m, perhaps more. That is $4m in receipts that the Australian National Gallery may well have earned had it been able to have blockbuster exhibitions which, we were told at the time, it could not have because of the roof repairs. Close to 10 million bucks lost from the Gallery's revenue of something like $20m a year is, clearly, very significant and very damaging to the Gallery. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I understand it, there is no way of seeking recovery against the people or persons--the designer, builder or whoever it was--responsible for the disaster of that roof. I simply hope, in view of the enormous cost, that the Government, the Gallery or whoever else may be involved in building anything in Canberra and looking at future contracts, will take a fairly severe view of the competence of people who cannot build a roof properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I apologise to Senator Michael Baume if he has gained the impression that a misleading answer was given. I think someone has simply seen that a contract was let for roof repairs for $3.4m or whatever it was, and has given Senator Baume that answer. Clearly there are other costs involved. The sum of $5.8m has been appropriated for it, but I think the total costs are likely to come in at around $5m, because the estimate was made prior to tenders having been received. It appears that the figure will come in closer to $5m than $5.8m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will certainly ensure that Senator Baume receives an answer as to what may have been forgone as a result of the roof repairs. To some extent it is in the area of conjecture but, given the number of exhibitions that do come to the Gallery, it would not be unfair to assume that, had this problem with the roof not occurred, there would have been more. I will make sure that the Department gives Senator Baume an estimate of that cost as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On the subject of the Australian National Gallery, I discovered in the Estimates Committee hearing that the Gallery had rejected sponsorship from the Rothmans Foundation for an unstated amount of which I am not aware. It struck me as strange that, at a time when the Gallery is clearly pressed for funds, when it has enormous expenses, when it is close to $10m down the gurgler in regard to its roof, it has the capacity to knock back sponsorship from the Rothmans Foundation. By the way, a few years ago it was quite prepared to take money from Philip Morris by way of sponsorship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am concerned about this because, as I understand it, the product is legal; the Rothmans Foundation is separate from the company; support from the Rothmans Foundation is not in any way associated with tobacco advertising as such; and Rothmans is not a major brand name of the Rothmans company.  The Rothmans Foundation has as its trustees Sir Roden Cutler, Sir James Hardy, Sir Rupert Myers and John Utz. This is a group of citizens who could hardly be accused of seeking to do anything other than bring benefits to the recipients of Rothmans Foundation funding. I find it extraordinary, at a time when the Gallery is under such pressure, that that decision not to accept the money was taken. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have a letter from Mr Alan Davidson, another distinguished Australian, who is the Executive Director of the Rothmans Foundation, expressing his concern at the response given in Estimates Committee C. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>At no point was it clarified that the sponsorship was submitted to this Foundation and that acknowledgments would have been solely to Rothmans Foundation and not any product. </PARA>
<PARA>We should perhaps explain in broad terms the objectives of the Foundation's different Divisions. . . These are:</PARA>
<PARA>Cultural</PARA>
<PARA>To advance artistic and cultural standards generally by the promotion of the fine arts of music, painting, sculpture and drama, to be achieved by the provision of public performances and exhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA>. . .             . . .                . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The most fundamental point we should make is in relation to the Trustees and executives of the Foundation. The activities of the Foundation are solely directed by the Trustees whose decisions are carried out by the writer and our executive officers. The Trustees carry out their obligations strictly in accordance with the laws in relation to the conduct of trusts and in particular under the Trustee Act of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Neither the founder of the Trust, Rothmans Holdings Limited, or any of its executives interfere with these decisions and there is therefore no opportunity for the executive of Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Limited (their tobacco subsidiary) to in any way direct the Foundation's activities towards the marketing of tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA>We trust this explanation clearly delineates the difference between our community based objectives and those of tobacco sponsorships. </PARA>
<PARA>I find this an extraordinary decision which will require strong defence. It is intolerable, particularly as I note that other organisations are prepared to accept Rothmans Foundation sponsorship. The Australian Chamber Orchestra on an invitation I received this week for 27 October says:</PARA>
<PARA>The afternoon's performance of the Australian Chamber Orchestra is proudly sponsored by the Rothmans Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>This organisation of high repute is made up of people of integrity, but apparently they are not good enough for the Australian National Gallery, which is about $10m behind the eight ball as a result of its roof disaster. It seems to me that perhaps a touch of reality might be appropriate at the Gallery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move on to the sports element of the Department. In particular to 5.2, relating to community sports facilities program, which was renewed in the latest Budget. I also found in response to questions asked about where the grants were made last year that an interesting pattern seems to be developing. In the community sports facilities program grants for New South Wales, for example, a remarkable proportion of such grants seems to go to Labor-held marginal seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It may well be--and no doubt the Minister will claim this--that Labor-held marginal seats are those in the greatest need because they are the most depressed. I suppose that when one looks at the unemployment figures under this Government's induced recession, there may be a case--I have not seen a case made out--for the fact that they are the most needy parts of Australia. In New South Wales, for example, where there are 51 seats, almost a third of the community sporting facilities program money went to just four marginal Labor seats. The largest amount, $250,000, or about 14 per cent, went to just one seat, which magically happens to be Calare, the seat of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) and a very borderline seat indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Western Australia 75 per cent of last year's grants went to Labor-held electorates which only totalled 57 per cent of the electorates, with Canning getting $162,000 or 35 per cent of the State's total allocation. Another received 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Queensland seven marginal seats got 75 per cent of the grants and five of those seven marginal seats were Labor-held. At the time the other two were held by the National Party, but I understand that in Kennedy in particular, which received a fair amount of attention, it was trumpeted around that this was the Labor Government that had brought these goodies. I do not know, but it may well have been a factor in the National Party's losing that seat. The remaining one, Dawson, is held by an outstanding member, Mr Braithwaite. Adding the five marginal Labor seats and the two coalition marginals together, in Queensland 75 per cent of the grants went to just seven seats. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am grateful to the Government for giving me the breakdown of this programs expenditure. I seek an undertaking that perhaps a more equitable approach could take place in future. I would have thought that perhaps areas of greatest need would probably be very safe Labor seats rather than marginal ones. I wonder why it is only the marginal seats that appear to be in such desperate need of the community sporting facilities program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I cannot look to my left for assistance on this matter because the Department did not handle the distribution of these grants; I did. It was done from my office. I understand that the new program will be done from the Prime Minister's office as well. Therefore, it is misleading to talk about the percentage that may have gone to one electorate or to two or three electorates. Sometimes it may well be a big project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We set a rough guide that the maximum grant that could be received was $250,000. In fact, there were very few over $200,000, because the idea was to try to spread the money. If one happens to be in the electorate that got the $200,000, that can distort the figures. I do not think that the percentages mean that much. Much of the money did go to some safe Labor areas. There were very big grants to areas like Penrith, which is part of Ross Free's seat. There were plenty of examples of large grants going to western suburbs seats, and also to a great many rural electorates where there was significant disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  As for Senator Baume's claim that Labor may have won Kennedy because, in his words, we trumpeted the fact that it was the Labor Government that brought the grants to them, I would point out that, if Government policies are popular and we win seats on them, that is an example of good government that is accepted by the people. In fact, the sports facilities program was a phenomenal success. The number of applications for the number of grants was extraordinary indeed. We were literally getting more than a thousand applications for what were only ever going to be the small amounts--small in the context of the whole Budget--that were available. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure that, because of the success of that program, there will be tremendous demand for the next one. I am certain Mrs Kelly would make sure, in the same way I did, that the only rule that is applied is that of need. If that is applied, one would imagine that the more deprived areas will get the bulk of the funds. I live in the electorate of Bradfield, which is represented by Mr Connolly. I doubt very much that the Minister would be looking towards giving my electorate any funding, and she should not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Perhaps the Minister's electorate covering the whole State could receive some attention. I commend the Minister for his recognition that the program has been a phenomenal success. If people are offered money, they tend to ask for it. They tend to put out their hands if $10m is waved in front of them. I do not know that I would necessarily regard it as astounding that there has been enormous demand. One would find it astounding if there were not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I stress that the Minister's response has underlined the political nature of this program, which has very little to do with perceived need by the sporting organisations in terms of what is the best location for the facility. The decisions are not made in the organisations best capable of determining the ideal location for facilities around Australia but rather by the Department or the Sports Commission. Information of that nature is readily available in the sporting organisations, which get together in many instances to establish what is the best locale in terms of the sporting communities and not the specific political interests of politicians. That is where these kinds of decisions should be made. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that the Minister has said that the decisions are made in the Minister's office underlines the political stunt involved in this program, a stunt that is once again using sport for political purposes. I recognise that the Minister for Social Security is highly regarded in the sporting communities for many of his initiatives in his previous portfolio; I do not detract from that. What I will say to him is that many sporting organisations are resentful about the manner in which this large amount of money is being distributed on a basis that is, if you like, related not to what they see as the best interests of the sports involved but to other criteria. It is inappropriate and wrong that this kind of decision should be taken in a Minister's office. </PARA>

The program has been so politically successful at $6m a year that funding has been increased to $10m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I absolutely reject those assertions. All that the decision to increase funding from $6m to $10m a year reflects is the demand of which I spoke earlier. It is not the case that that is in some way politically handled. Many of the grants given were very small. For example, they went to putting lights on some very small ovals so that people could train at night; they went to providing gear for junior sports in a whole range of areas. The truth is that there is phenomenal demand. I am still getting letters of thanks from organisations all over Australia--I might say, organisations that I do not know. The funds are not given to friends; they are simply given on the basis of need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The truth is that we could not go anywhere near satisfying the demand, and $10m a year will not satisfy it either. In that circumstance, it is far better to protect officers of the Public Service from the kind of criticism they inevitably get. I would much rather that the criticism be directed at myself. If I am responsible for the decision, I have to live with it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Out in voterland, there is so much demand for the funds that whatever decisions the Minister makes next time will also undoubtedly attract criticism because she will not satisfy the demand. I know she will do her very best to ensure that there is no political bias in the decisions. Certainly, given the rural recession, I have absolutely no doubt that a greater percentage of funds will be directed to rural areas this time. </PARA>

<PARA>  A limited amount of money is available for all sports in Australia. For example, there is continual disagreement about the `elite' athletes programs as against the `non-elite' programs. The Minister has never at any stage shown a massive determination to protect the bureaucracy from the slings and arrows of outraged recipients. How incredible it is that in this program, which happens to have massive political overtones, the Minister is, out of the kindness of his heart, protecting the bureaucrats from offended non-recipients of such grants. Quite frankly, this kind of double standard sounds terribly exciting and attractive and lovable, but it just does not wash. Will the Minister now give us the real reason why these grants are being made out of his office instead of out of either the Commission or the Department?</PARA>

My understanding is that in the new program to be announced cultural facilities will be included in the list. That is being done because, when we were looking at applications for the recreation and sporting facilities program, there were many cultural organisations which also needed assistance. There can often be a borderline between activities that are recreational and activities that are cultural. We will attempt to step over that line and allocate money to the cultural bodies as well as to the recreational and sporting bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is nothing that distinguishes these grants from any other grants. The Government's decision to have these grants made out of the ministerial office underlines and dramatises their political nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In concluding my remarks on those grants, I was interested to note the response to my request for information about the success of previous grants. Of course, this has some bearing on the criteria for the making of these grants now. The Minister might, at some stage--not necessarily now--outline to us what criteria are used by the Minister in determining magically that Calare and Hunter, for example, have a greater need than apparently any other seats in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note that, in determining whether the grants had been successful so far under the previous regime of, I think, $6m a year, in reply to my question about the failure rate the departmental brief said that almost every project was able to show an increase in recreation and sporting opportunities in the local community. I frankly wondered what `almost every' meant. Why would there be failures? I find that the answer shows that 14 per cent of projects reported no change in participation rate. I assume from that that participation rates in terms of facility are the Government's measure of success. </PARA>
<PARA>  If 14 per cent of projects reported no change in participation rate, I suppose one can assume that there was no evident demand--at least yet shown--for the better facility. The funding did not increase the opportunities of the local community to use the facilities, at least in a meaningful way or, if there was an increased opportunity, there was no evident need for the improved facility. There may be other criteria but, if participation rate is the Government's criterion, it seems to me that a 14 per cent failure rate is pretty high when money like that is handed out. </PARA>
<PARA>  I notice that in only one per cent of cases--that is two projects--there was a decrease in participation. I suppose the Government could say that it was 99 per cent successful because there was a fall in usage in only one case. It seems to me that the Government is required to explain to us whether participation rate is the measure of success, and what criteria are being used to hand out this money. </PARA>

These guidelines are, of necessity, broad. There are many factors which have to be taken into account. I am quite happy for Senator Baume to have a look at those guidelines, together with the application form which accompanies the guidelines when they are sent out to those people who request that they receive a grant. When Senator Baume looks at that, he will see that there are quite a lot of criteria used in determining which bodies receive a grant. In fact, the figures which Senator Baume just gave me would tend to bear out the success of the program. If 86 per cent of facilities have reported an increase in participation, that is good. But it would not prevent us, in looking at grants, from increasing the pleasure, the health and the well-being of those who are already using these programs. If in 14 per cent of those cases we managed to do that, then I think we would be judged as successful.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>  I also noted in the reply that Brisbane had received no assistance in its successful bid some years ago for the Commonwealth Games but did receive a fair level of support in other ways. I find this reply remarkable because I have here a copy of a letter from Mr Hawke to Mr John Bannon dated 13 May 1991 in which he says, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to you separately to provide my Government's support for the bid which I trust proved helpful at the meeting of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation in Malta on 12 April. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Regarding funding issues, you will appreciate that Commonwealth funding along the lines sought in your letter is still a matter which will need to be considered initially in the 1991-92 Budget round of discussions which will commence shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>Either it was to be discussed in the 1991-92 Budget context or it was not. Mr Hawke says it was; the departmental response says that in the end it was not. Does the fact that Mr Hawke says it was going to be discussed mean that it did come up and it was decided at that stage not to commit the Government?  The letter indicates that the Government took a decision that it would not give an undertaking at this stage to support the Adelaide bid. If that is the inference to be drawn from the letter, is it a fact that in the 1991-92 Budget round of discussions Mr Hawke's apparent request that it be considered was not acceded to? Was the decision made to defer it?  Was the decision made not to provide money?  What decision was made?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In fact, both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Department are correct. The matter was discussed and it was generally agreed--with South Australia as well--that there was no need for a 1991-92 allocation. The Commonwealth is not contributing funds to the actual bid to get the Games. I am certain that it would, as it has on every other occasion, assist an Australian city if it were to succeed. It has been agreed that we do not need to commit funds until we see whether that bid is successful. The matter will certainly be raised in the Budget discussions next year. But if Adelaide is successful in getting the bid in the interim, then certainly we will be contributing funds. So both were correct.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would now like to go to the question of the Australian Olympic team's funding and the widespread reports, which emerged from answers at Senate Estimates, that the Government had cut back the money about which there was an understanding it would be providing for the Barcelona Olympic team by $1.5m. I understand that the Sports Commission had a meeting this week. Can the Minister outline whether the Sports Commission has made a decision to meet that $1.5m and, if so, where it came from? Did it come from other sports allocations or did it come from the huge item shown in the books as administration expenses of something like $20m, which covers not simply the normal concept of administration but a whole range of activities carried out by the Commission on behalf of other sports? If, in fact, it has come out of that administration vote, can we be assured that it does not cut services available to other sports?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-First, I should add to my previous answer on the Adelaide Commonwealth Games bid by saying that we have now received a request from the South Australian Government that at least an intention to support the bid be included in the documents that it will be sending off in an attempt to gain success. I do not think that will necessarily be specific in terms of money; just a clear statement of Commonwealth intention. On that basis, Minister Kelly will be approaching the Cabinet, perhaps at its next meeting or the one after. I will certainly make sure that Senator Baume is informed of the result, although I would be very surprised if the Cabinet were to decline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As for the $1.5m from the Sports Commission, the answer is yes, the money has been provided. It has not been taken from any sport; rather, it has come from part of the surplus from last year, it has come from a transport credit and it has come from interest. It is money that could have been allocated later on to other sports, but no sport will have its program cut due to the fact that this grant has been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I acknowledged when I was asking the question that it was likely that the $1.5m would be found out of the administration vote, of something like $20m, which covers many things apart from administration, such as services provided to sporting people and sporting organisations. So to that extent the Minister's assurance that it came out of administration does not necessarily diminish the point, as he conceded later, that it may well have been available otherwise for other sports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister may be aware that Minister Kelly had said on Sydney radio when debating the matter with me that this money had always been available, that there was no suggestion that it was not available and that I was running some kind of scare campaign or misleading people by saying that the money was not being provided. As the decision taken clearly indicates that the money was not being provided until this decision was made, what was the initial understanding that that additional $1.5m would be available? From everyone in sport I have spoken to, that understanding clearly existed in people's minds. What is the basis on which that understanding was made?  What was the basis of the decision not to grant it?  What is the reason given by the Sports Commission for taking money that may well have been available to other sports to top up this needed amount which everyone understood was to be provided by the Government?</PARA>

As to whether understandings existed over time, I am certain that, had there not been a surplus from last year, a transport credit, sufficient interest or whatever, the Government would have found another way. There was no way that we would leave our Olympic athletes unable to get to Barcelona. It would have been done in any event.

I was told there was no staff freeze, but that the Commission was not going to appoint any more staff without approval.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wanted to conclude my remarks by referring to my reservation relating to the appropriateness of having the funding of the National Media Liaison Unit through DASETT but its administration through DAS, so that no questions relating to the purposes of the DAS appropriations could be pursued through Estimates Committee C. This raises a real question about accountability. As I understand it, the splitting of responsibilities creates real problems. For example, in DASETT Estimates hearings, I asked questions relating to the functions of the National Media Liaison Service. I was told that, because employees are, in fact, employed by the Minister rather than the Department, the Department could not answer. The Minister was not there because she, in fact, is a Minister in another chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Here we have the incredible situation of government money being expended but, because of the device used by the Government, proper inquiry as to those expenditures not able to be answered by the Department because, as it has said, `We were simply responding to requests and our function is to do no more than respond to the requests and to provide money, not to have any managerial or effective control over that funding'. </PARA>
<PARA>  This leads me to a whole series of problems. Why has the Government chosen to use this extraordinary device which, to my knowledge, does not exist anywhere else in the Commonwealth Public Service, and have this incredible situation where the National Media Liaison Service is shown on a separate sheet in the Commonwealth Government Directory?  It fits into no departmental or other structure and appears in front of all of the departments. In the pages covering DAS or DASETT there is no link of any kind with the National Media Liaison Service. It is not listed in the Commonwealth Government Directory as being under the care, responsibility or administration of any government department. This incredible device, once again when there is a political issue such as handing out money to marginal seats for sporting facilities, is handled in a Minister's office and the opportunity to ask questions and receive meaningful answers is not presented to us in a committee. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain the reason for the Government operating the National Media Liaison Service in this incredible and highly unusual way. </PARA>

I asked a question about the National Media Liaison Service not monitoring any radio or television interviews made by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Gordon Bilney, when he recently announced the $2m advertising campaign for the Ready Reserve. The Minister has told me that the Service did circulate press releases and speeches on behalf of the relevant Ministers. That is not what I asked.

<PARA>  I said yesterday in response to questions that the National Media Liaison Service is not a huge bureaucracy and that it was not able to monitor everything. It did not monitor this.

It was a matter of national importance: there was a large sum of taxpayers' dollars involved; there was a big flourish of publicity. It was probably one of the most momentous things that had happened in the defence community for a decade. Yet the Minister tells me that the Service did not monitor it. I find that beyond belief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government is very concerned. Both Ministers responsible for defence have made it clear that they are very concerned to see what the public reaction is to this Ready Reserve proposal. I cannot accept that there was not some requirement on the Service to monitor the announcement and the aftermath. Can the Minister tell me differently? I just do not believe it. </PARA>

I would imagine that, when the Service is making decisions about what it will monitor and what it will not, it takes into account what will be available to the Minister directly. In this case, the Department of Defence has a public relations set-up. I am sure that the Service would have believed that that public relations team could adequately monitor the press reports of the Minister in making the announcement.

If ever people on the public payroll need lessons in manners, it is the people employed in the National Media Liaison Service.

<PARA>  In terms of lessons in manners, all I can say is that David Epstein, who runs the Service, is an urbane and charming gentleman. I am sure he would not be guilty of any offence on the telephone. My former private secretary has just gone to work for the Service as well and she is in exactly the same category. I am not aware that the Service ought to be criticised. In fact, a member of Senator Newman's staff is the subject of a complaint from the National Media Liaison Service for persistent rudeness. Maybe when we are handing out the lessons on manners over the telephone we should hand them out where they ought to go, and that is in Senator Newman's office. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other point I should have made on the question of monitoring, and it involves the transcripts, is that it is a minor function of the National Media Liaison Service. In the priorities of the Service, it comes a long way behind the dissemination of information. </PARA>

The Minister has so far refused to give it to me.

That is not a difficult thing to do. It must be remembered that there are quite a number of people with the Service who do not even work in Canberra. There is a representative of the Service in each capital city and in a few provincial cities as well. These people are spread out and what they do will differ dramatically from what people in Canberra do. They all do their jobs.

Often a journalist asks about a particular quotation and very often if there is some important event on and a member of the service in one of the capitals, for example, is listening to a program, it is not hard to jot down one quote, and that can be provided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, that is exactly right--whether there have been negotiations with the Copyright Agency Ltd for some copyright payment in relation to the reproduction of newspaper articles. The reason why that relates to the Copyright Agency Ltd, and not exclusively to newspaper proprietors, is that the law in this country is that the copyright in newspaper articles reverts to the journalist once it has been used for the purpose for which it was created, which is reproduction in a newspaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Copyright Agency Ltd is currently negotiating with the Attorney-General's Department--and any other body which is sucker enough to be sucked into this stupid arrangement--to get a payment of 10c per page from that Department. It occurred to me that, if the Attorney-General's Department is sucked in by this, the Government might be stupid enough to be sucked in by it and be negotiating with it too. It is 10c per page for the residual copyright which rests with the journalist, and there is a portion for layout and design which rests with the newspaper proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is every reason to ask why aNiMaLS might be negotiating with the Copyright Agency Ltd which purports to be acting on behalf of all journalists but, in fact, is not--and certainly not acting on behalf of some of the more creditable ones. The question is, is aNiMaLs negotiating with the Copyright Agency Ltd?</PARA>
<PARA>  As for the Minister's remark that he does not see why newspaper proprietors would want to get payment for the reproduction of their newspaper articles, he might like to look at what is happening overseas in respect of this where the copyright laws are slightly different, and where there is a clear recognition that the newspaper proprietors own the copyright and there is no residual copyright with the journalists. He would find that clipping services--and aNiMaLS, in that respect, is not that different--most certainly pay copyright fees to the newspaper proprietors who are happy to make a buck in any way that they can. </PARA>
<PARA>  It still begs the question:  does aNiMaLS understand the process which it is engaged in, and does it understand, with the law as it stands at the moment, the risk it is running of  being clamped down on for higher payments?  Why does aNiMaLS feel justified in breaching copyright law so readily and frequently?</PARA>

As to why that is, I think that is just an acknowledgment of how important the Government regards the north to be. The person in Townsville not only covers matters that occur in Townsville and Cairns, but also an area to the south--given that the general term `north Queensland' covers a pretty fair area--over to Mount Isa, and up to the Gulf.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Australian Democrats are opposing this clause because it writes into the process that the amendments are putting in place a pre-vetting notification period in the event of proposed changes of ownership, an issue the Democrats strongly support; but this particular clause puts into the Broadcasting Act a provision for confidentiality in the pre-vetting of notification of changes of ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  An essential element of the work of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has been, and in the minds of the Australian Democrats must remain, the open nature of its operations. We are aware that in many instances there will be, and there are, commercial in-confidence matters that should not be made public. However, the Act as it now stands provides for the Tribunal to make those sorts of decisions and provide for the sort of confidentiality that, one can understand, would be needed in many cases in this prior notification exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those provisions are already in the Act. The Australian Democrats cannot see why, simply because we are dealing with the prior notification process, there should be a particular provision for confidentiality. As far as we are concerned, what is in the Act is appropriate. In essence, the fundamental direction is that the Tribunal's proceedings are open and clear to the public. We are conscious that we are not talking about full inquiry. Nevertheless, the prior notification process that is being put in place is very important, and we do not see why confidentiality should be written into these amendments. As I say, if confidentiality is required, it can be put in place under the current provisions of the Act and, therefore, the Democrats oppose clause 3. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to put on record the fact that, since this is a matter about which we feel very strongly, in normal circumstances we would wish the Committee to divide on it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government will not be supporting the Democrats, for precisely the reasons given by Senator Chapman. I add one further matter that is of great concern to the Federal Government in terms of agreeing to this proposal, and it was brought up very effectively last night by Mr Westerway in the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. He advised that the level of cooperation the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is getting in the provision of this information is currently very high. It is being provided on the basis that at this point it is confidential, although obviously, if the matter becomes formal and ends up in a court, it becomes a public process. Mr Westerway made the point that in his view the exclusion of this clause would severely hamper the work of the Tribunal in examining these matters in the public interest. For that reason and for the reasons Senator Chapman gave, the Government will be opposing the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>    `(3A) Where a person fails to comply with a requirement in a notice served on the person under subsection (1), the Tribunal may make application to the Federal Court for an order under subsection (3B). </PARA>

<PARA>2.  Clause 5, page 4, proposed paragraph 90HA(3)(c), line 16, omit "10 days", substitute "28 days". </PARA>
<PARA>3.  Clause 6, page 8, proposed paragraph 92EA(3)(c), line 16, omit "10 days", substitute "28 days". </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to clause 4 is being put forward in order to enhance the powers the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has to gather information and evidence in this prior notification process. We have looked for a way to make sure that there are no delays in this process. Speed is of the essence in the prior notification process. We are dealing in a commercial situation and will be in any future use of the Broadcasting Act as amended by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our concern has been that under the Act as it now stands the Tribunal's powers have amounted to providing the opportunity for continued delays with, at the end of that process, fines which in themselves are not particularly significant. When we think of some of the players in the present Fairfax bids exercise, sums of $1,000 per person per day and $2,000 per day per corporate body are not particularly high fines, those concerned having gone through the courts. I do not think the question is whether people will lie or avoid coming forward with evidence which the Tribunal believes they should be providing; the problem is the potential for delay. </PARA>
<PARA>  By this amendment, if the Tribunal feels that there is a delay, it can go directly to the Federal Court for an injunction to stop the transaction. At that point the question of whether the evidence or information exists and should have been handed over will be dealt with in the Federal Court directly. We believe that this amendment is essential to strengthen the powers of the Tribunal in pre-vetting in the prior notification period. This will be an additional tool for the Tribunal to use. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments to clauses 5 and 6 are related to the question of the time that the Tribunal has to pursue the gathering of information and evidence. A period of 10 days is given in the Bill. I understand the Government's position that time is of the essence in this sort of exercise. Nevertheless, by moving as we are to amend the period of 10 days to a period of 28 days, we will not make the 28-day period mandatory. If a period of 10 days is enough, then that is all that will be used and the process will then go forward to the court. We believe that we must not hamstring the Tribunal and give a possible way out to any of the organisations or individuals being investigated in this process by limiting the time available. In the corporate context, additional time may genuinely be required. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also point out that the Trade Practices Commission is looking to this period of time for its own deliberations. Therefore, we feel that ours is a consistent approach and could be important, if not in the present situation, certainly in situations with which this legislation might deal in future. We commend our amendments to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>  Senator Chapman has accurately described what I said to the Committee last night. We were prepared to consider an extension to the period of 10 days, but we wanted to try to restrict it as closely as possible. The reason that we feel strongly about this matter is that there is a legitimate public interest here to defend, but in this democracy of ours we are also talking of the right of people to deal with what is their own property. That is the reason why we want to restrict the time. The Tribunal advised the Committee last night, as Senator Chapman will acknowledge, that the period provided is certainly sufficient so far as the Tribunal is concerned for it to conduct its business. But the Government is concerned that we do not artificially or unreasonably in the public interest delay individuals from dealing from what is their own business and with what is a legitimate commercial transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulty with what Senator Powell is putting to us in terms of the Tribunal being able to cut down the time required is that it cannot do that. There is no power in the legislation for it to restrict the time, and that is the difficulty. It is a set statutory period of time which cannot be restricted. The ABT has no power whatever to reduce the period of time in the way that Senator Powell is suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA>  I plead again with the Opposition not to allow its perfectly understandable aggravation with Senator Schacht--which I am prepared to say I share, if that is what I have to say to get the Opposition on side--to interfere with an important issue. The problem is that there will be many transactions that are totally legitimate in which in the public benefit where time will not be able to be shortened. There is no power for the ABT to shorten it to 10 days, 21 days or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are concerned not to interfere unduly in the commercial rights of people to deal with their own property. The public interest has to be dealt with, but it has to justify the intrusion that we as a Government are making into the legitimate commercial interests of individuals who in the majority of cases are engaged in legitimate business enterprises. If under this amendment we set a period of 28 days--that is a period of a month--that period must stand. Under this legislation it cannot be reduced at the whim of the Tribunal. Therefore, many legitimate transactions which perhaps should not be delayed will be delayed by a month by statute. </PARA>
<PARA>  We thought that a period of 10 days was a reasonable compromise in intruding into people's commercial interests. We are prepared to concede that that should be increased to 21 days. We consider this a matter of some importance: there should be a limit to the extent to which government can legitimately intrude into people's private business affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  If Opposition senators are prepared at this stage to indicate their acknowledgment that the Democrats are not correct on this and that there is any power for the Tribunal to cut it down, I would be very happy to either move now that the period be 21 days or support an Opposition amendment that the period should be 21 days. If it would assist the chamber for me to stand here for another 10 minutes and talk about broadcasting issues in general while the Opposition has a conference about this so that it accedes, I will. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats are quite wrong; the period cannot be cut down. The majority of these concerns will be dealt with openly and honestly. It will be the exception, not the rule. We do not want to hold up, for a month, legitimate transactions where people deal with their own property, when that does not have to be the case. We simply ask the Opposition to again consider supporting a 21-day statutory period instead of the full month that is being proposed by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is important that I also acknowledge that there was no deal between the Government and the Opposition on 21 days. I was as stunned as anybody else to have that reported to me. We have had a great deal of discussion with the Minister representing the Minister in the other place--with the Minister in fact--and with both Senator Alston and the shadow Minister. I do not recall 21 days being mentioned in any of those discussions. The only person I did not talk to was Senator Schacht.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The point I want to make is that we are dealing with transactions in which there is a concern about whether the cross-media rules which this Government has put in place, with strong support from the Australian Democrats, are being contravened. It is not a situation in which we should be looking at all haste because people's commercial operations are important and we do not want to impede them. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the public interest, practically the only decent, useful, honourable media policy item that has been put in place by the Hawke Government, which is cross-media ownership rules, is at risk. We should certainly give the maximum time that this chamber believes is necessary to protect that piece of public interest against the interests of any commercial operator. If it is going to be 21 days, I can certainly accept that. It is certainly better now than it was in the original legislation. Irrespective of whether Senator Schacht had anything to do with it, we are very happy that we are moving at least from the 10 days even though it is not to 28 days. </PARA>

Equally, the point made by the Democrats is valid. We believe that a longer period is needed under this provision than was originally provided in the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have spoken in this chamber on a number of occasions about the performance of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and, in particular, Senator Cook's ability to play fast and free with the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Honourable senators would recall that Senator Cook has constantly tried to assert that the living standards of Australian workers have improved under his Government. I have produced figures, based on Senator Cook's own definition of living standards, which have conclusively exposed the disgraceful record of this Labor Government in relation to the living standards of Australian workers. In particular, I have drawn attention to how the accord has significantly cut household disposable income per capita in recent years. Not only has Senator Cook's accord cut living standards but it has also cut jobs, as we now know. As a result, we now have one million Australian workers unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind Senator Button that these people are unemployed as a result of his Government, which, as his former Treasurer--the man he would like to be the leader of this country--has admitted, engineered and planned the recession. There is no debate about that particular issue, I would have thought. Mr Kerin said in a recent speech, reported last night from overseas--he did not have the guts to say it in Australia--that this recession we now have is the worst for 60 years. Some record for a Labor Government! What a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA>  I acknowledge that my colleague Senator Crane has drawn attention to the disgraceful comments of Senator Cook on Robe River. Whatever induced Senator Cook to attack one of Australia's most productive mining companies is for him to answer. We can be absolutely sure that the answer he may give ultimately will have nothing to do with Australia's national interests. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, today I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to another example of Senator Cook's capacity to mislead this chamber. I refer to Senator Cook's comments on industrial disputes in Victoria, my home State and Senator Button's home State. These comments were made in answer to a dorothy dixer when Senator Cook referred to recent figures produced by Mr Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs, which is one of Australia's most eminent think tanks. For the record, I would like to quote Senator Cook's own words in this chamber on 5 September. He asserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Since the Hawke Labor Government came to power the rate of industrial disputation in Victoria has dropped by 72 per cent compared with that of the Fraser years. Held against a national average of a fall of 62 per cent, it can be clearly said that the rate of disputation in Victoria has fallen further than in other States. </PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly true that the economy in Victoria under the Kirner and Cain governments has fallen further than those of other States but, as I will show, this assertion by Senator Cook in relation to strikes is not accurate. This is a fantastic assertion which, on Senator Cook's own figures, is misleading, even if we accept his statements as an accurate measure of the true rate of industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Cook's source for his assertion was the ABS figures on working days lost. The fact is that the rate of industrial disputation, as measured by the ABS, fell sharply in the last year of the Fraser Government, 1982-83, and the change since then has been much less than Senator Cook's figures imply. In fact, since 1982 the number of industrial disputes in Victoria has been higher in two years than in the last year of the Fraser Government. These years were 1986, when 245 working days were lost per thousand employees, and 1990, when 239 working days were lost per thousand employees. This compares with 227 days lost in the last year of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet Senator Cook's misrepresentation in the chamber did not stop there. Senator Cook neglected to mention that the ABS figures, which he misleadingly represented in this chamber, failed to give the full picture on the level of industrial disputes under the Hawke Government. The ABS figures do not necessarily include disputes arising from bans, limitations, picket lines, et cetera, because these disputes do not involve any measured loss of working days, although their effect on the companies involved can be quite serious. </PARA>
<PARA>  These forms of industrial disputes have become increasingly significant in recent years as a result of the tactics the trade union movement has adopted and as a result of the important capacity of employers to resort to civil court action to deal with union intransigence and union thuggery. </PARA>
<PARA>  When these forms of industrial disputes are taken into account, the picture of industrial disputes under the Hawke Government is much worse than even when Senator Cook's preferred measure, when accurately quoted, is used. Over the past year, these disputes, while not appearing in ABS figures, have averaged 80 per month, fully 24 per month in Victoria alone. I know that Senator Button is sensitive about these figures, and so he should be. </PARA>

<PARA>  Let me give some examples of the serious nature and extent of the disputes which Senator Cook fails to mention. The first example is the bans and other tactics used by the AMIEU which are crippling the Victorian meat industry and which have contributed to the closure of 12 abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second example is the bans and other tactics by the Victorian Food Preservers Union which have led to a decline in investment in Victoria in this important industry, as Senator Button will know from his constituents. The third example is the frequent failure of Victorian train services to run because of disputes over what is euphemistically called `award restructuring'.</PARA>
<PARA>  The next example is the bans by Victorian TAFE teachers on night classes, in connection with attempts by the Victorian Government to reduce the excessive number of teachers. The examples go on and on. I have a big list here which I can see from the clock I will not have time to read. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will address my remarks to the Chair. Unfortunately, Senator Faulkner on the other side is calling out and I have responded to the provocation from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The interesting thing about these examples is that none of them, not one of them, would have been mentioned in the statistics that Senator Cook produces in order to demonstrate the effect of strikes on working days lost in Victoria. They are a very poor measure indeed. In conclusion, I mention just one example of a major dispute in our State which has imposed huge costs in recent times on the SEC in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>  In response to the massive increase in industrial disputes hitting the SEC which saw disputes in 1989-90 total some 392 compared with an average of only 42 per year for the preceding six years, the Industrial Relations Commission was forced to introduce tough new powers to dock the pay of or stand down disputing workers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The SECV estimated that industrial action during 1989-90 had cost it $22.6m, and during the period July 1990 to March 1991 the cost was some $30.9m. These wildcat bans, introduced by workers at the SECV, went largely unnoticed by the public. It is a new union tactic which has been very effectively used in Victoria to impose as much harm as possible on business or government enterprise, without attracting public attention. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, Senator Cook's measure of industrial disputes, the massive costs borne by the SECV, which led to the strong intervention of the Industrial Relations Commission, would go unmentioned. Yet we should not assume that Senator Cook was not aware of the extent of these disputes, which the ABS figures, which he used in his statement to this Parliament, do not reveal. Indeed, Senator Cook's own Department prepares monthly reports, each called `Monthly Report of Industrial Disputes'. They are some 40 to 50 pages long and include specific reference to the kinds of disputes not measured by the ABS and certainly not quoted by Senator Cook in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is 40 to 50 pages each month which Senator Cook leaves unmentioned, 40 to 50 pages which document case after case of disputes which Senator Cook would rather ignore--and little wonder. Senator Cook's explanation for leaving his Department's reports unmentioned was that those figures do not represent working days lost, which is the basis, as I have mentioned, of the ABS figures. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said, the measure `working days lost' simply does not represent the full picture of industrial disputes which affect industry in this country, which affect the jobs of workers and which, ultimately, affect our living standards. When these disputes are taken into account, the record of this Labor Government--and its failed accord--is shameful. The real position is far from what Senator Cook would have this chamber and the Australian people believe. </PARA>
<PARA>  The nature of Senator Cook's deceptions concerning the true nature of industrial disputes is twofold. Firstly, he misled this chamber by incorrectly quoting the ABS figures on the rate of industrial disputes over the life of the Hawke Government. Secondly, he failed to acknowledge that the ABS figures reveal less about the true level of industrial disputes in Australia than his Department's monthly reports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such deceptive bending of facts and figures by Senator Cook joins his misleading statements on living standards, his unjustified attack on Robe River Mining and his slavish adherence to the accord--an agreement which has seen nearly a million workers unemployed and which has seen the standard of living of all Australian workers fall dramatically. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last week the Senate examined a number of documents relating to education. There was not time then to speak to all of them. One report, in particular, was of some importance and I have chosen to speak to it now, rather than under General Business. The report I am referring to is the one on Australian Research Council awards for 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The introduction to the report includes the major policy issues facing the Australian Research Council. Today I wish to raise some of these issues. Page 5 of the report refers to the Stephen review of the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Australian National University. However, the report does not go on to provide any information about the outcome of the review. Since this has not been reported, I want to take this opportunity to inform the Senate of what has happened since the review and to tell honourable senators about the role of the Australian Research Council in relation to the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the beginning of the year the Government has put forward a very significant proposal to involve the Australian Research Council in the funding arrangements of the Institute of Advanced Studies. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) proposes that there should be a joint agreement between the ANU and the Australian Research Council on the terms of reference and membership of committees that will review the individual research schools of the ANU and the Institute of Advanced Studies as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ANU was strongly opposed to the ARC involvement and argued that all members of the committee should be independent and of internationally recognised academic and scholarly status. After a lengthy exchange of correspondence between the ANU and the Government, Minister Baldwin wrote to the ANU on 15 August setting out the final statement of the Government's position on the future of the Institute of Advanced Studies. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not resile from my belief that the ARC is the most appropriate body to provide advice to the Government on the allocation of funds to the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA>In response to this letter, the Institute passed a resolution on 5 September to the effect that it continued to hold the view that the arrangements proposed by the Minister were against the best interests of research in Australia. It stressed that the Institute would continue to be managed and controlled within the university, as required by the Australian National University Act. The Institute also expressed the view that it regarded the university's position on review procedures for the Institute to be better than the Minister's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Institute believes that there should be a diversity of research funding and research direction across the nation, and that was also a finding of the Stephen review. The Institute is also of the opinion that it is not appropriate for the panels proposed by the Minister to review the research schools in the Institute to make recommendations on levels of funding for each school, and that it is not appropriate for the Government's allocation of funds to the Institute to specify those individual schools. The Institute is still opposed to the Minister's statement that there should be a joint agreement between the ANU and the ARC on the terms of reference and membership of all the review panels. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the meeting on 13 October, the ANU Council reaffirmed that it would not resile from its previous position that the ANU Council should be responsible for the reviews of individual research schools and centres of the Institute of Advanced Studies, with the participation of the Australian Research Council. There the matter rests at the moment; it is a deadlock. The Minister will not resile from his position and the ANU will not resile from its position. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an important issue because it is yet again another example of how this Hawke Labor Government is eroding the independence and the academic integrity of all Australian universities. There is much disquiet in the academic community about the loss of independence and the loss of funding in real terms, especially for research. There have been constant warnings from our universities about the detrimental effects of reduction in research funding, particularly for university research infrastructure, which is one of the outcomes of the centralisation in the hands of the ARC. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Pro-Vice-Chancellors Committee issued a statement last month expressing concern about the ability of universities to maintain the nation's research performance unless further infrastructure funding is provided to individual universities. The Chairman of the Committee, Professor Max Neutze, issued this warning:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian research cannot keep up with its international competitors and train postgraduates for the twenty-first century if it has to be carried out on outmoded equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>I will keep the Senate informed of the progress of the impasse between Mr Baldwin and the Australian National University. It is in all our interests that research in Australia be independent and be of the highest possible standard. This has to happen if we are to achieve the clever country or, more importantly, urgent needed research to solve important world problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The coalition is not opposing the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 2). The legislation to increase the retiring age of the Family Court judges from the present 65 to 70 years of age is the first of what I hope are to be many positive results of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Joint Committee was established pursuant to a motion of the Opposition on 13 March of this year and we actually took on board the suggestion by the Attorney-General of Western Australia that we first looked at retiring ages of judges. It was our understanding that a Western Australian Family Court judge was approaching his sixty-fifth birthday, hence the necessity to deal with this expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee formed the view that in light of evidence that showed the inconsistency in the present legislation regarding retiring ages and the increased community preference for fixing no retiring age for any occupation, and given that the retiring age of judges for other courts was 70 years, there was no good purpose to be served in remaining with the notional 65 years. A referendum at the last Federal election also endorsed increasing retiring ages of judges from 65 to 70, so in many respects this legislation is merely enacting the community's wishes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some submissions made to me prior to the establishment of this Committee complained that the courts were out of touch with the community, that judges were too old to identify with the problems of young families and that the Family Court judges ought to be more in tune with the modern Australian society and more flexible in their judgments. It was suggested that this could only occur if Family Court judges were younger. Strangely enough, the older I get, the less inclined I am to accept that view. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is probably no right age for any individual to retire, and equally there is no appropriate minimum or maximum age at which one is suitably qualified to sit in judgment on family disputes. Clearly, it is expected that Family Court judges have sufficient experience to be able to determine with some authority the legal and moral merits of the arguments put to them, but people also want to feel that those same judges have some understanding of families and the difficulties involved in raising children. What fixed age can be applied? Is it when somebody is too young to know or too old to care?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee took the view that an important qualification for judges of the Family Court was their awareness of social values. The Family Law Council said in evidence that there would not be a substantial difference in this area between judges who were 65 and judges who were 70. The previous legislation did not preclude any judge from retiring before 65 or 70, or indeed at any age, if they wanted to for any reason; many have. Some have been appointed at 41 and have retired at 43. Others have retired at 44, 55, 59, 60 and 65 years of age. Presently in the Family Court there are 17 Family Court judges with life tenure and 34 with a tenure to 65 years. Of those judges appointed for life some have already chosen to retire. They have retired at the ages of 44, 54, 60 and 65, for a variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>  From among those who are opposed to increasing the retiring age it was put to the Committee that if the retiring age were increased, it would increase the risk of judges staying too long and remaining past their prime. However, the Committee came to the view that `there is no reason to assume that judges of the Family Court have a diminished capacity to make a sound decision after age 65 when all other Federal Court judges are considered competent to adjudicate up to age 70'. That, frankly, is the only reason that needs to be put in justification of this legislation and in support of the recommendation proposed by the Select Committee.  If we allow High Court judges and Supreme Court judges to continue until age 70 on the presumption that they are mentally competent to do so, then it must follow that the Family Court judges are equally competent, given that some have commissions in both courts. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me say in summing up that to be consistent, especially with the Federal Court, particularly as some judges hold commissions in both those courts, to make optimum use of the skills and abilities of current judges, to prevent the loss of human capital, to have the potential to save taxpayers' funds, and to encourage the development of consistent principles and guidelines through precedents, the Opposition supports this amending Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I commend the Government for its very sensible decision to agree with the amendments we have proposed, particularly the one that gets rid of age discrimination. Senator Patterson, Senator Chapman and I have been expressing some concern about that for quite some time. The Senate is aware of the fact that to try to get rid of age discrimination in some of the Government's organisations, in the boards of some statutory bodies, we have even put up private members' Bills--for example, for the National Maritime Museum.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-And, as Senator Patterson says, had them rejected by the Labor Party, supported by the Australian Democrats. Our aim was to get rid of the age limit of 65 that exists in some governmental bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The reasons given by the Government for rejecting our endeavours, over something like the last 12 months, to get rid of this age discrimination, have been, on the face of it, quite sensible. The Government said it was having a look at the whole issue and that, for example, it had to work out how to resolve the problem of compensation in the event of injury because Workcover does not cover people over 65. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must say that all through this debate the Opposition has taken the view that, while that is a coherent response, it is not an adequate one. The Opposition took the view that the Government's decision to review the whole problem, and not to do anything about it until it had been reviewed, was not the correct way to go, particularly as there were many governmental bodies which did not have that age limitation. For example, the Australian National Gallery had Mr Whitlam as its Chairman when Mr Whitlam was in his seventies. That was not an isolated instance. There were many other instances of governmental organisations where there was no age limit and where, in fact, remarkably significant contributions were made by people over the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA>  We were particularly concerned about the National Maritime Museum. If one could think of any one structure that would probably benefit from people aged over 65, it would be the National Maritime Museum, through being able to have on its board retired mariners who, one would have thought, might have known what the subject was all about. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Patterson says that there would even be some merit in having ancient mariners on that board. Unfortunately, this Government not only stoppeth one in three, it stoppeth all of them. The Government decided that in all the legislation it introduced it would maintain that age restriction rather than saying, `For those that are already there we will leave things as they are until we correct the situation'. But for all new ones surely the Government should have recognised the anomaly and allowed the provision to go through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I was very depressed indeed that the Australian Democrats, in their naivety, accepted the Government's word that this matter would be resolved with great speed. I think the promise was made that early in the new year--that is, early this year--the matter would be resolved, because it had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department. It might be a charming trait of some members of the Democrats that they actually believe what the Government says. Senator Bourne remembers our discussions in the committee only too well. The cynics and the hardheads like me took the view that they would rather see this situation resolved with each new piece of legislation rather than wait for the eventual navel gazing of the Government to result in some successful outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason that the Government's case did not stand up was a very simple one. There was, and there is, an opportunity for the Government to resolve this problem of lack of Comcare cover out of the capacity of the Audit Act to make discretionary payments. If any such problem arose there would have been absolutely no difficulty in meeting it in that way. I am not suggesting that it would have been a sensible idea to change all boards so that they would have to be covered by the Audit Act at the time. All I am suggesting is that every new organisation that is set up surely should be allowed to be on the same basis as several of the existing ones--such as the Australian National Gallery--so that there would be no problem of an ageist nature, particularly in those organisations such as the National Maritime Museum where there was clearly a need for people over the age of 65 to be given the opportunity to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, I do not want to delay the chamber any more in the second reading debate. I would like to move now into the committee stage. I will ask Senator Chapman, who in fact first raised this matter over a year ago, to move the Opposition amendment relating to the removal of the age discrimination portion of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Democrats have no problems with the matters in the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). One of the Bill's most important features is the implementation of the Government's decision that the Remuneration Tribunal should have jurisdiction over the recreation leave entitlements of full time office-holders on a number of statutory authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are a number of other important amendments contained in the Bill, such as raising the limit to $250,000 for which those statutory authorities mentioned need to obtain a ministerial approval before proceeding on contracts and other transactions. I note that in the case of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School this limit has not been changed since 1973, so an amendment in this instance is well and truly overdue. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the Bill increases to $20,000 the value of materials that the Australian National Maritime Museum and the National Museum of Australia may dispose of without the necessity of obtaining ministerial approval. As with other amendments contained in the Bill, the need for many of these changes has obviously come about because of inflation and the increased cost in carrying out certain functions. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the amendments circulated in the name of Senator Baume, the Democrats will certainly be supporting the first set of these amendments, which deal with the removal of age limits for those serving on these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has also introduced a similar package of amendments which incorporate this ideal into the relevant legislation and, on that basis, they deserve to be commended. But one wonders whether the constant promptings of the Opposition and the Democrats on the issue of age discrimination in Commonwealth legislation have not forced the Government to respond by introducing their own amendments at this late stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been an obvious need to remove age discrimination clauses from Commonwealth legislation for some time, after the Comcare legislation was changed, and the Parliament should be acting on this matter as a matter of social right. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Senate will recall, the issue of age limits and age discrimination has come up previously several times in debate. Since late last year, in fact, the Government conceded the necessity to examine this matter with a view to removing the age limit requirements from all Commonwealth legislation following debate on the National Maritime Museum a year ago. Unfortunately, the Government seems to have moved quite slowly on this matter despite numerous promptings from both Democrat and Opposition speakers, who have expressed a genuine and ongoing concern over the discriminatory implications of maintaining the legislation. Perhaps the Minister could let us know when he expects the results of the Government's review of age discrimination in legislation to be available. Indeed, it seems clear that all State governments also need to accept the realities of this issue and act positively to remove age discriminations in all existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second set of amendments moved by Senator Baume today aims to reduce the financial limit under which a number of organisations mentioned may enter into contracts without ministerial approval. Senator Baume has argued that these increases to a new limit of $250,000 are not really justified and that a limit of only $200,000 would be more appropriate. But given that a number of these organisations and statutory authorities are already well and truly exceeding the financial limits as set by legislation, it is difficult to see how a lower $200,000 financial limit could be of benefit. We do not believe that a difference of $50,000 is particularly significant in this case. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Senate may be aware, the Auditor-General has expressed concern in a number of reports that some of these authorities are already breaching the financial limit that applies. This would seem to argue in favour of a higher financial limit, given the magnitude of the operations of some of these authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>  While we would be concerned at the notion that ministerial approval of any additional expenditure be raised to a level which is excessively high, we understand that many of these authorities engage in activities and operations which should allow them some flexibility. Under the circumstances, the Democrats will not be supporting those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the matter of the Opposition's third set of amendments to this Bill, I must admit that we have given some consideration to those matters. We recognise the case that Senator Baume has mounted and, certainly, it has been disturbing in recent times that charges have been laid against some prominent Australians who are serving on various government boards and commissions. In the end, however, we must fall back on the basic legal principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty. </PARA>
<PARA>  The implications of adopting such an amendment are really quite unpleasant in a social sense and fraught with a number of administrative problems in a practical sense. For instance, how would people be treated if they are suspended because criminal charges have been levelled against them and their term of service on the board expires while those charges are still pending? Would they lose their position on the new board? What if they are found to be not guilty? Does that mean that they will have their position on the board or commission returned to them? There are obvious practical difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>  A case might be made for a board member to be stood down if the criminal charges relate to the carrying out of duties for the commission on which the member serves, but that is a totally separate concept and one for which we believe a rather convincing case could be made if it were required. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the amendments which the Opposition has moved today go considerably beyond that idea. As I have already explained, they are amendments which we are unable to support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I am asked by Senator Bourne how long it will be before the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) comes up with a comprehensive policy on age discrimination. As Senator Baume reminded us, I was told that this matter would be completed some six months ago, or even longer, but my understanding is that the day of completion is not at hand. I think that considerable difficulties have been discovered in dealing with other departments because the age discrimination legislation has considerable cost implications. I also understand that there have been some discussions, and difficulties as well, with the States. So unfortunately I am not in a position to make the confident assertion I made last time and which was wrong. Rather than repeat the mistake, I can only say that I will urge upon the Attorney-General that the matter be dealt with as swiftly as possible; but I must admit I am not becoming very hopeful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government amendments will probably be dealt with first, but whether they are Government or Opposition amendments does not matter much.

<PARA>  "Subsection 11(4A):</PARA>
<PARA>    Omit the subsection.". </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment has been circulated on behalf of the Opposition as the first of a number of amendments that we wish to move to this legislation to remove age discrimination from various bodies covered by the legislation. This follows up amendments which I, in particular, sought to move more than 12 months ago in the committee stage of legislation relating to the establishment of the National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA>  Incorporated into that legislation were clear instances of age discrimination regarding the council established under it. Members of the Opposition regard it as totally unsatisfactory that a person should be excluded on the basis of age from serving on the councils of the various bodies and statutory authorities that are affected by this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is entirely unacceptable to exclude someone who has reached the age of 65 years, or whatever, from appointment as a member of a council, whether it is the Australia Council, as is the case with the amendment that we are dealing with now, or the other bodies for which we will move amendments later. People in the community who have reached that age often have particular expertise which they can provide to advisory bodies such as these councils. We ought to be seeking the opportunity for that expertise and input to be provided to these organisations. Rather than seeking to exclude these people, we should be encouraging them to be involved in that way. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation that we dealt with over 12 months ago relating to the National Maritime Museum was referred to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, acting as a legislation committee, for consideration of these and other matters. We heard all sorts of nonsense from the Minister for Social Security, who is also in charge of this Bill today, about reasons why we should not remove age discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister told us that the Attorney-General's Department was investigating this matter and that it would come up with a comprehensive program for the removal of age discrimination. We were told that we ought to wait for that, rather than doing it on a piecemeal basis. When I subsequently asked representatives of the Attorney-General's Department about that in the Estimates Committee, they had to admit that they were not doing any work on it at all and that they could not advise when those amendments might be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is, as I said, unacceptable to us that people should be excluded from filling these positions simply because they have reached a certain age. It has long been the policy of the coalition to remove age discrimination, as it has been policy to remove other forms of discrimination. It is on that basis that we believe that this and the other amendments with regard to age discrimination which I will subsequently move should be accepted. </PARA>

<PARA>  The executive officers of the Australia Council, the National Maritime Museum, the Film, Television and Radio School and the other bodies that we are dealing with in this legislation should not be denied a similar opportunity if it is determined that there is value to be gained by those organisations in their continuing in office beyond the age of 65 years. That opportunity to continue should be provided in the legislation and those officers should not be excluded from doing so. That is why our amendments relate not only to members of the councils and advisory boards of these organisations but also to the executive officers of those organisations so that they are placed in the same position as public servants. </PARA>

<PARA>I have heard the Australian Democrats' quite proper expression of concern about the consequences of these amendments. Their view is that the amendments would have the effect of judging someone guilty unless proved innocent rather than the other way around. We do not take that view. We take the view that in public office there is a particular requirement, which is met by politicians, who are required to stand aside when they are under any challenge or threat of a legal nature. As I understand it, even the former Premier of New South Wales stood aside while an investigation took place. He was found to be totally innocent and was reinstated. It is a convention among politicians. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that there should be some convention among members of boards. The Australian Democrats do not feel that this is an appropriate convention. We think that there should be particular standards of propriety and appropriate conventions for people in these positions, particularly as we have seen some people who had been members of boards charged with very serious offences. </PARA>
<PARA>  The one case that perhaps prompted this was not so serious, and in fact the charges were withdrawn in the one case immediately prior to this matter. But our view simply is that, if it is good enough for politicians to be expected to stand aside, we should establish some rules for members of government authorities pending the outcome of their case, with reinstatement and all rights being restored in the event of their not being found guilty. </PARA>

I would have thought the fact that the charges were later withdrawn tends to bear out what the Government believes and what the Democrats believe. Had we acceded to the views of people, including Senator Baume, who thought that the person should stand aside, I think that there would have been some sort of black mark against the person in those circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have seen reference in the newspaper to comments on this matter by the Treasurer, Mr Kerin. I cannot say what the basis of his comparison is. Perhaps it is related more to particular difficulties faced by sections of the rural community at this time than on previous occasions. The question of whether this recession is worse than the previous one is not entirely relevant, although comparisons will always be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On some indicators, such as employment, the situation now is obviously serious; however, the evidence is mixed. For example, the participation rate is quite different from that which it was at the time of the previous recession. The 1982-83 recession was a greater problem for the economy in that regard. In 1982-83, we had the double whammy of inflation and unemployment, which left the economy structurally weak.</PARA>

There are a few facts that Senator Kemp has to recognise which he has sought to ignore in the past day or two. The important question is how we come out of the recession. The shadow Treasurer was gracious enough to point out this morning that picking the worst amongst a number of recessions over a very long time scale is something of an academic debate; Mr Reith said that on the AM program this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I have said before, the unemployment situation is bad. At the present time, there are clear gains on the inflation front, the trade front and the fiscal policy front. These improvements allow us to reasonably expect a stronger, more structurally sound economy in the 1990s compared with what was left to us at the beginning of the 1980s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am very delighted with the action of Grocery Manufacturers of Australia in publishing yesterday a code that will regulate throughout Australia this $30 billion industry which puts all those grocery items on our supermarket shelves. By self-regulation, they are ensuring that shoppers and customers, as they go down those alleyways of supermarket shelves making their purchases, will be assisted in making a purchase which helps the environment and lessens the damaging impact on the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The consumers, the shoppers of Australia, do want to use their dollars in order to protect the environment if possible: if they are faced with a choice, they will go for the item which is in some way environmentally friendly. There is no doubt that there is also a certain cynicism or scepticism amongst shoppers that some of the claims that are made are too broad, rather outrageous and quite clearly advertising hype rather than conveying real information about how a particular aspect of a product--its manufacture, the way it is packaged, the way in which the package can be disposed of, or the product itself--actually helps the environment. The information which is provided ought to be absolutely clear and justifiable and defensible. This is what the grocery manufacturers have attempted to do with their code. For that reason, yesterday at Woolworths in Belconnen, I was very pleased to launch their code.</PARA>
<PARA>  At the end of the day, the Government also has in its armoury, under the Trade Practices Act, a provision which provides a $100,000 fine for those who engage in misleading or deceptive advertising. If there is an attempt to deceive the public into buying a product under the guise that it is environmentally friendly to do so, and it turns out that that claim cannot be justified, the Trade Practices Commission has, under this Budget, been given extra resources to investigate those situations and, if necessary, prosecute to the point of a successful conviction and the imposition of a fine of that order.</PARA>
<PARA>  Most honourable senators would consider it far better that the industry regulate itself in this regard. I believe that supermarket shoppers, as a result of this code, can be more confident in the purchases they make with their dollars of enhancing the quality of our environment rather than having a disastrous impact on it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government is committed to the development of a national forest policy by the end of 1992 aimed at providing a national framework for forest use. We cannot, of course, underestimate the importance of this policy. It will mean that, for the first time since Federation, Australia will have a national policy on one of the more controversial areas of public policy in this country--the conservation and judicious use of Australia's forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The policy is anticipated to encompass a number of themes: environmental protection; facilitating value added investments; employment generation; and community awareness of forest science and ecology. Importantly, the policy will draw together the outcomes of the Government's other forest policy initiatives, of which there are many, including:  resource security; the Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into the use of Australia's forest resources; the ecologically sustainable development working group on forest use; the national plantation strategy; endangered species and biodiversity programs; award restructuring; workplace reform; training; occupational health and safety; the review of forest taxation; the review of wood pricing; and the adoption of legislatively based codes of forest practice for public and privately owned forest. There are many other elements in that list, including a national forest inventory.</PARA>
<PARA>  With the above initiatives in mind, the Government's vision for the forest industries for the year 2000 builds on the measures taken so far. Our objective is to steer a path consistent with our environmental agenda and to create a better and more productive industry, that is, an industry which can become the base for a sophisticated paper making industry in the future, providing more jobs for Australians and more prosperity for our nation. It is, in short, a clever industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that this renewable industry is conducted in a way consistent with this Government's respect for and protection of our shared environment. I am confident that this policy framework will help facilitate the resolution of forestry issues in a transparent and predictable way and without the level of discord that has characterised the forests debate in the past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I believe many of us were shocked to hear, on our morning news services, of the massacre in Texas. It seems that a semi-automatic pistol was used in that massacre. There have been very stringent regulations in Australia for decades governing the importing and availability of such semi-automatic hand guns. I believe that they are at a level of stringency which does not need a great deal of improvement. But it is encouraging to know that in relation to other semi-automatic weapons--certainly the military style and, I believe, all semiautomatic rifles--there is a convergence of views now between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Government which augurs well indeed for the Police Ministers Council meeting to be held in Melbourne next Wednesday leading up to the Special Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I believe that, for the first time, the Special Premiers Conference will be able to put in place nationwide proposals to deal with gun control which will have the support of the Australia-wide community, without reference to the petty divisions which sometimes can cause jealousies and turf disputes between States in matters as important as the availability of these lethal weapons in our community. Senator Reynolds is quite right to point to the need to deal with other elements in our culture. One could refer to the question of domestic violence, which is a euphemism and misnomer for criminal violence in the home. I believe that the women's refuge movement initially, and governments latterly, with their various programs, have brought that problem to the forefront of the consciousness of Australians. I believe that is an area in our culture which certainly needs continual addressing, as does the question of child abuse.</PARA>
<PARA>  One could also refer to violence on the sporting field. In recent weeks, for instance, the South Australian football grand final, a soccer grand final in Sydney and also the grand final in Tasmania were marred by terrible violence. Once again, one has to look at violence on the playing field as containing elements of criminal assault which need to be dealt with as such.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-To come to the question of films and videos, which Senator Reynolds raised, it is true that once again there needs to be a stringent application of the various criteria relating to the classification of videos and films in circulation around Australia. I believe that limits on what sort of violence can be portrayed in films and videos in Australia are already reasonably categorised so that excessive violence, explicit or unjustifiable depictions of violence associated with sexual activity and violent scenes which are relished or cruel are already denied or refused classification. But I do not think that censorship Ministers have been altogether happy with some of the applications of those criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Indeed, as recently as the meeting of the censorship Ministers in July of this year considering the film Silence of the Lambs--and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it as a film--I believe that the Ministers indicated that there could be a more stringent examination of the appropriate classification for films to ensure that violent films are not necessarily available for general viewing.</PARA>
<PARA>  In short, I believe that the Special Premiers Conference will be well placed to deal with the whole question of violence in our community, not only in relation to the question of gun control but also in relation to the whole social underpinning of our culture. I believe that this will help prevent that slide into the gun-ridden violence which, as Senator Reynolds says, characterises much of United States society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Crane has been warned that I will make a statement which will reveal that he is, in fact, misleading this chamber. I do not intend to comment now on his accusations. I say again that the use of the word `mislead' in the context in which it has been employed by Senator Crane and by Senator Bronwyn Bishop in debate--no, I do not think it is true in Senator Panizza's case, but at least in the case of those other two--and, indeed, by Senator Kemp today in a fraudulent expose devalues the importance of the crime of misleading the Senate by making it a petty political accusation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. It has been suggested to me by developers of modern energy efficient office space that, when seeking to lease such offices to government departments, they are advised that the main criteria applied by government departments is the cost per square metre of space. Apparently, there is no consideration given to the savings to be made over time due to substantial reductions in energy costs in such buildings. Can the Minister advise the Senate whether this reflects the Government's policy when seeking rented premises? If so, does the Minister agree that this is not only economically questionable, but it is also contrary to the Government's commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2000?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2265" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Devereux does, in fact, raise a question which has been under government consideration. The answer to his question, in respect to both aspects of it, is essentially no. Before I go into it in major detail, I should ask the Senate and Senator Devereux to take into account that my Department no longer has a regulatory role in relation to accommodation standards. As part of the Government's common services reforms, which were announced and introduced on 1 July 1989, individual departments and agencies have responsibility for decisions relating to their own accommodation needs. Within that context, my Department provides services to assist other departments in making their decisions, and these services are provided in a competitive environment. The departments can choose whether they take DAS services or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, when a government department is deciding on its accommodation requirements, I think it is fair to say that it does take into account a whole range of factors of which total cost is a key factor. For instance, where the APG--the Australian Property Group of Administrative Services--is engaged to assist departments to analyse accommodation options, advice provided by us includes concepts such as full life cycle costing of occupancy. These considerations, of course, include not only rent, but also outgoings which include energy costs. We recognise that energy management is an important matter, and it is one that should be considered by government departments in their choice and use of office accommodation. Within that, we keep in mind the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>  As Senator Devereux and the Senate would know, we build buildings. We are responsible for standards in relation to buildings that we construct. In respect of those buildings, we take great consideration in achieving energy efficiency and conservation. I think there have been four instances in recent years where Commonwealth construction through DAS has had energy conservation as a target in its construction and has succeeded quite enormously in achieving the objective. The first example I can point to is in my home state of South Australia, in Adelaide. The Commonwealth Centre there had design operation concepts which included an atrium, efficient lighting through the use of programmable time switching and dimming based on occupancy and also computer-based air-conditioning operation using ambient air for cooling the building. In fact, the Adelaide building was so successful that it won the BOMA, the Building Owners and Managers Association, award for excellence in 1988. A special mention in that award was made of its overall cost effectiveness and quality of services which promoted low life cycle costs. Of course, energy is a very important aspect of life cycle costs.</PARA>
<PARA>  In Senator Devereux's own home state, in Hobart, the Hobart Place stage 2 development includes concepts which reduce reliance on energy and make the building energy efficient. Air-conditioning is one aspect of it. High performance glazing and lighting, which once again is sensitive to demands rather than being kept on broadly through the building at all times, are also incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA>  So energy efficiency has been a major consideration in those two buildings, in Sydney Central and also Casselden Place. Senator Devereux raises a point which is important not only in terms of an overall energy and environmental concern, but also in respect of the Government's target of 20 per cent CO2 emissions by the year 2000. It is one where I think DAS is leading by example. As I say, we have indicated by example that it is a major consideration for government.</PARA>

Thirdly, recognising his own frank comments on Australia's uncompetitive business tax environment and the cost of capital, does the Minister agree that his Government's fiscal, monetary, taxation and corporations and securities policies have created not only a recession but also a capital crisis which will create a rolling recession and not a recovery?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am not here to answer questions like that which might as well have simply been put in the form of `are you responsible for everything?'. The answer to that question is no. The Government is not responsible, for example, for the somewhat extraordinary lending habits of the banks during the 1980s. We are not responsible for that. We are not responsible for financial institutions which made loans to almost anybody who went into some of them on the basis of very little security or presentation of adequate business plans or anything like that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Crichton-Browne might have got something out of it. He should not be bitter about it. It is all over now. He cannot go back with his nose in the trough again, for the reasons which I identified in Senator Campbell's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will try to provide Senator Campbell with a more detailed answer, but there are one or two points that I can deal with directly. Senator Campbell referred to a figure of $30 billion being the estimate of non-performing debts in the banks. I have not seen that figure. I saw a figure pretty close to it. I do not think the size of the figure is the point. He asked me whether that sort of figure curtails the ability of banking institutions to provide finance. I think it would be pretty obvious that it does; of course, it does.</PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, he asked me whether the new prospectus provisions are an impediment because of their complexity to companies and financial institutions. Certainly, they are more complex than previous prospectus provisions and, certainly, there is a debate in the financial and business community about the contents of those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>  In trying to resolve some of the issues to which the honourable senator points in the first part of his question, I suspect it is certainly an improvement on the sort of situation which has prevailed previously. As far as I am concerned, some companies complain about the complexity and other companies see the provisions as a necessary thing.</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable senator raised the issue of what he called `uncompetitive business tax' and my alleged frank admission that we had an uncompetitive business tax system. I have made no such admission. If I had made such an admission, the honourable senator might have been able to point to it. However, what I have said is that we have from time to time reviewed business taxation and we are doing it again at the present time because, in terms of the competitiveness of the business taxation system, the whole world is changing.</PARA>
<PARA>  Since 1988, when we introduced the lowest corporate tax rate this country had ever had, there have been corporate tax rate changes in the United Kingdom, I believe in Canada, and in certain other European countries. Historically, we have always compared ourselves with OECD countries in terms of the business tax environment. All I am saying is that it is a dynamic environment internationally and one of which we have to take account. I am not saying we have an uncompetitive tax structure; I am saying it is an issue which has to be examined constantly.</PARA>
<PARA>  I think those were the essential parts of the honourable senator's question. He went on to ask me all sorts of questions about whether the Government admitted responsibility for everything that could be listed in his demonology. I cannot answer that part of the question, but if I have missed anything I will try to provide him with a more detailed answer in the future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I am sure Senator Maguire is aware, over the last 18 months or so there has been a drop in the number of tourists from North America, which has been a matter of concern to the industry here and, of course, to the Tourist Commission. Accordingly, the Tourist Commission recently completed the screening of what it called its `Fair Dinkum' television and print media campaign in the US which featured Greg Norman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The campaign generated the largest response since the heady days of the Hogan advertisements a few years back. This response augurs well for a big increase in the number of visitors from, what is for Australia, an incredibly important market. The Norman campaign ran in major magazines from February to June and on television from 27 May to the end of June. It attracted more than 270,000 inquiries--that is, 110,000 for television and 160,000 for the print media segment. This was followed by a campaign on New York taxi cabs featuring Greg Norman, which was also very successful. It ran for five weeks from late August until September and attracted a further 72,000 responses.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of encouraging signs from this that the US visitor market is starting to pick up, given that it has been sluggish for quite some time. I think this response suggests that it will now recover strongly and the short to medium term prospects for growth are very good.</PARA>
<PARA>  Arrivals from the US grew by 17 per cent in June. I suppose this figure cannot be taken too much at face value because there was a Lions convention in Brisbane which was very big and no doubt caused an increase that will not be reflected every month. Nonetheless, that is very significant and it is the first significant rise in the number of US visitors since before the Gulf war.</PARA>
<PARA>  A high level of visa applications from the US over recent months also leads us to make some fairly confident predictions about the growth in the number of US visitors. In July, total visa issues in the United States were more than 75 per cent higher than in 1990, with some posts recording increases of more than 100 per cent. In August, the result was 23 per cent. They are quite phenomenal figures.</PARA>
<PARA>  The increase in US visitor interest obviously reflects that Greg Norman campaign, as well as the extraordinary fares which are now being offered because of airline competition on the route--in particular, the addition of Northwest to the route. Obviously, the economic benefits to Australia are quite considerable. The Bureau of Tourism Research estimates that for every 26 US visitors to Australia an additional job is created in the industry. So, with an average expenditure of more than $2,050 per visit, the US market alone contributed $520m to Australia's economy last year. About half of that amount was spent on food, drink and accommodation. Although arrivals from the US to June are slightly below 1990 levels, all the information I have just imparted suggests that they will go up again, they will go up solidly and they will contribute to a deserved recovery in our tourist industry.</PARA>

Therefore, recruitment has not been as great as it might have been in ordinary years and the slimming down process has led to some distortions--one of which the honourable senator has referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>

With respect to the depreciation issue which Senator Watson raised with me on the previous occasion, I will give an example of what I mean. If a company is in a position where it can nominate the effective life of a piece of equipment, perhaps at five years or 10 years, and then passes that equipment on to a subsidiary company, with no rules as to the economic life in the hands of the second user, that would be a very difficult situation open to all sorts of abuse.

These will be taken into consideration when this evaluation is made.</PARA>
<PARA>  I can confirm that both contenders expect to be putting forward firm innovative plans for the purchase of Australian sourced equipment and export opportunities. The details must remain confidential at present, but the Minister has been advised that these plans are highly regarded by the relevant officials and hold out prospects for significant gains to Australian industry over the next decade. The consortia have also provided recent briefings for the industry in a number of States on their approach to industry development and the opportunities that will be available.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I have indicated on previous occasions, Senator Tambling's interest in the establishment of these vitally important tourist facilities for the Northern Territory is a very latter day interest indeed. During the 10 years of blood, sweat and tears that it took to get these terminals for the Northern Territory, Senator Tambling contributed absolutely nothing. All that he has done is knock these projects, along with his colleague in the Northern Territory Mr Fred Finch, who is the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The petty minded, negative, attacking approach that has been taken to these facilities by Mr Finch, who is the relevant Minister in the Northern Territory--and I am going to commend Senator Tambling in this respect--has been taken to the extreme. Despite repeated invitations from the Federal Airports Corporation to inspect the now completed magnificent facilities in both Alice Springs and Darwin, the Minister For Transport and Works in the Northern Territory is so petty minded that he has never set foot in either terminal. It is a disgrace. I hope he does not have the hide to turn up to the official opening. On the other hand, I concede that Senator Tambling has responded to these invitations and visited both facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  The interesting thing about the security arrangements at Alice Springs--and as the relevant Minister I have checked with my Department and the FAC--is that, so far as these temporary arrangements for security that have allegedly thrown thousands of people into the gutter are concerned, the only complaint that has been made has come from Senator Tambling.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have been fortunate enough recently to visit again the completed Darwin terminal. Without a doubt, it will be the best terminal building in Australia. It has been a most successful design. Senator Tambling has been one of the chief critics of the artworks in the building. Could I say to him in passing--and I am throwing this out to tantalise a few people into coming to the opening--that the Aboriginal artwork Feathered Serpent, which is now in place on the wall of the main entrance of the building, is one of the most spectacular Aboriginal artworks I have ever seen. If Senator Tambling has seen it I know he will concede this. We will be opening these facilities at both Alice Springs and Darwin early in December--$100m worth of badly needed facilities for the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>  Recently I wrote to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, and I expect to get a positive response from him, pointing out that, along with Senator Macdonald and a number of my Senate colleagues, I recently officiated at the opening of the new airport terminal in Mackay. It is a beautiful terminal building, but a tiny building compared with Darwin--a $16m project. Some 32,000 people turned out in Mackay for the opening of that building and the associated air shows. It was a magnificent day for promoting the district.  As I pointed out in the letter to the Chief Minister, when the Northern Territory is finally going to get $100m-worth of tourist facilities, the Northern Territory Government and the senators representing the Northern Territory, instead of continually knocking the project, should get behind it to help promote the Northern Territory as a tourist destination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yesterday Senator Boswell asked me a question about the sugar industry deregulation. In that answer I indicated that I would refer the question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Simon Crean. I have done that and I have received some further information from Mr Crean which I wish to add to my answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The burden of these remarks is that Senator Boswell may well have invented a new art form--not that of selective quoting but of selective punctuation. Mr Crean says that Senator Boswell has clearly misinterpreted comments made by the Minister in a radio interview on the ABC Country Hour program on 30 September. Throughout the interview the Minister's answers referred to the need for a successful outcome from the GATT Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and in the event that such an outcome was not forthcoming then--this is where the emphasis goes--the Government would have to reassess our total trade position.</PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Boswell has quoted words used by the Minister but has not used the punctuation. Instead of merely reading the words, Senator Boswell should have listened to the tape. There is a clear sentence pause between the words. The Minister talked of the generality of trade policy, and then the specifics of the Industry Commission into the sugar industry. I trust that clarifies the issue.</PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of a further answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Panizza on 22 August 1991, relating to the House of Representatives inquiry into bank practices. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to put a few points on the record about foreign currency loans. I do not intend to pick up where former Senator McLean left off on banking, but I do propose to keep the Senate informed about the Australian banks which marketed foreign currency loans, causing so much hardship to at least 3,000 Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  My original question was not asked to embarrass the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Australian banking industry, nor the Senate, but to bring into focus the admissions made by senior officials of the Commonwealth Bank after the CBA had been examined at the inquiry, including discouragement towards hedging, contrary to that which was told to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was interested to know whether the issue of FCLs--that is, foreign currency loans--would or should be a big part of the Martin inquiry. On making a personal inquiry to the Committee Secretary, Mr Elder, regarding the expert adviser to the Committee on foreign currency loan dealings, I was advised that those submissions would be dealt with by the expert advising the Committee on consumer affairs. I believe that that person is hardly qualified to look after the interests of foreign currency borrowers. The expert on consumer affairs looks after matters such as banking fees, how banks have treated small account holders and so on. With respect, that is hardly the expertise that is needed for foreign currency loan matters. I would like the Government to take to the Committee the suggestion that it appoint an expert to advise specifically on foreign currency borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just to give a very brief idea of the problem of foreign currency dealings, in Australia 3,000 people were affected. The loans totalled $3 billion--in other words, 3,000 people borrowed an average of $1m. The total of the pay-back was $6 billion--in other words, 3,000 people lost an average of $2m. If we look at the WA Inc. scandal--bad as it was, outlandish as it was--the total loss was $1 billion. This is three times as much. I believe that the Government should make sure that the FCL borrowers are given a good hearing of their concerns and that an expert should be appointed to the Committee who can deal with that particular issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At lunchtime today, in a long speech to the Senate, Senator Kemp accused me of misleading the chamber. He put forward an analysis of strike statistics. Senator Kemp said that the figure for the rate of industrial disputation in Victoria in the last year of the Fraser Government was 227 working days lost per 1,000 employees in the year ended June 1983, that it was 245 in the year ended June 1986 and that it was 239 in the year ended June 1990. Senator Kemp has selectively quoted Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. I said that the average rate of industrial disputation in Victoria for the Hawke years, compared with the average of that for the Fraser years, fell by 72 per cent. That is correct. Senator Kemp also completely ignored the latest figure for Victoria for the year ended June 1991, which is 183 working days lost per 1,000 employees, which is, incidentally, half of the figure for New South Wales of 378.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The other misrepresentation is that the statistical year that Senator Kemp chose as the last year of the Fraser Government was the year ended June 1983. Any student of Australian politics knows that the Hawke Government was elected in March 1983. The honourable senator may well slap himself, but he knows that if he takes the statistical year ended February 1983 the days lost in Victoria was 255, which is above the figures Senator Kemp has used to attempt to prove that disputation was less in the Fraser years. It is a fraudulent statement. </PARA>

<PARA>  I shall return to the details of the Government's proposal in a moment. First, let me put the whole question of reform of the industrial relations system in a rational perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>  In any logical debate on this issue, the greatest attention would be focused on the greatest obstacles to reform. The problem with much of the debate that we have is that it tends to be misdirected. It pays more attention to the amount of working time lost than it does to how productive is the time we spend at work. </PARA>
<PARA>  As an illustration of this weakness in much of the present debate, it is worth looking at the attention given to lost working time. This debate concentrates on the symptoms rather than the causes. Moreover, it concentrates on the least important of these symptoms--that is, strikes--and all but ignores the far more important ones of absenteeism and work-related illness and accidents. </PARA>
<PARA>  The accord between the ACTU and the Government has been enormously beneficial in many ways. One of the most significant of its benefits has been its impact on the level of industrial disputation. Ten years ago, this was a major problem for industry. The number of working days lost through industrial action has consistently been 60 per cent lower during the accord than during the preceding period of coalition government. The accord was aimed, among other things, at resolving conflict over income shares. Its spectacular success in this regard is shown by the fact that working days lost as a result of disputes over wages have fallen by 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, there are many sources of conflict at the workplace over which public policy can have little direct influence. There has been no major reduction as yet in disputation over what the Australian Statistician defines as managerial policy issues. In recent years, however, the accord process has set in train a process of workplace reform which will--with the goodwill of the parties--see a major improvement in workplace relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been a clear move towards greater cooperation between management and unions. This process still has a long way to go in most areas and, during the transition to a more efficient, dynamic and participative workplace culture, there will inevitably be disagreement about how work should be organised. Nonetheless, the time lost through disputes over managerial policy, wages or any other issue pales by comparison with that lost through absenteeism and work-related sickness and accidents. </PARA>
<PARA>  Studies undertaken during the 1970s suggested that time lost through strikes was only one-twentieth of that lost through other forms of unapproved absence from work. The comparison would be even starker now because the large decline in disputation has yet to be matched by a large decline in absenteeism. In 1979 an average of 3.8 per cent of full time employees were absent from work because of illness, accident or absenteeism. In 1989 the figure remained relatively steady at 3.4 per cent of full time employees. This reflects the fact that management has yet to address fully issues such as work organisation and job satisfaction which are central to reducing absenteeism. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unjustifiable absences from work are widely accepted as being a symptom of unfulfilling work, poor job satisfaction, weak organisational commitment and rigid work organisation which makes difficult the blending of work with family and other responsibilities. It is not that Australian workers are idle. Such absences will not be solved by sanctions against them. The truly effective way to solve these absences is by making work more interesting and rewarding and by giving workers more responsibility and more influence over how work should be performed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Work-related sickness and accidents have been estimated to cause the loss of nearly 14 million working days a year of productive industry time. The reality is that, for many Australians, the workplace is a dangerous place to be. About 500 workers lose their lives each year in work-related accidents; at least 300,000 workers are injured. </PARA>
<PARA>  The answer to this problem is not just to concentrate on compensation for work-related sickness or accident--hugely expensive as this is--but also to tackle the much more complicated business of making the workplace safer. This means involving workers in planning the way work can be designed, organised and performed so that it is safer and healthier. </PARA>
<PARA>  The average employee now loses less than 1 1/2 hours a year in working time as a result of taking part in industrial action. The 1991 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey--the most comprehensive, up-to-date survey available--found that 72 per cent of workplaces had never had any industrial action. A further 10 per cent had not had any form of industrial action for two years or more. </PARA>
<PARA>  These facts are not reflected in the debate over industrial relations. This debate is characterised by an extraordinary imbalance resulting from the ideologically-driven preoccupation with industrial relations as an issue of political conflict. At the workface, however, employers and employees have to operate in the real world. They have to make a living in this practical real world; they have to get results to make a living. Using industrial relations to score political points or as an ideological laboratory is a self-indulgence that neither they nor the community as a whole can afford. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has designed an industrial relations reform strategy that deals not with ideological marginalia but with the real impediments to industry efficiency and productivity that stem from such issues as absenteeism and occupational sickness and injury. The fundamental principle in this strategy is cooperation rather than conflict. The essence of the strategy is to stimulate teamwork, goal sharing, consultation and participation at work; to facilitate the development and spread of skills acquisition throughout industry; to encourage equal opportunity in skills development and career prospects; and to strive for greater safety in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Industrial awards have been modernised and restructured to get rid of the old task based job classification structure which so obstructed the more flexible use of labour. A union rationalisation program and the move to single bargaining units is helping to eliminate the complications associated with union coverage which have been identified by many investigations and ignored by previous governments over the years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Wages policy has been used as an incentive to revamp industrial awards, thus facilitating structural efficiency, underpinning the new decentralised focus of the system and increasing the viability of bargaining at the workplace level. A greater degree of cooperation than ever before is now taking place between Federal and State industrial relations systems. This should help bring about more consistent outcomes, less forum shopping and simpler and more cost effective procedures. So far the Government has allocated $40m to its workplace reform program. This promotes labour market reform and industry restructuring and encourages better work and management practices, work organisation and industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Work related health and safety has been brought to the forefront as a reform issue. Occupational health and safety regulation is basically a State responsibility. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission--Worksafe--has, however, been active in promoting it as a national issue with high significance for the costs and performance of industry. Worksafe has carried out valuable work on such issues as the industrial use of chemicals; the health and safety factors which have special impact on women workers and workers with non-English speaking backgrounds; and the development of national health and safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  Much remains to be done in a task that has been complicated by the fact that it has been put off for so many years by governments of all political persuasions. The new productive culture has yet to take hold in all workplaces, to be reflected in work design, work organisation and work decision making. Management and union structures still need to adapt to accommodate the move in a decentralised system away from control and hierarchy toward integration and teamwork. Industry has yet to develop the flexibility to enable it to take up the fullest potential offered from among women and other workers whose skills have traditionally been under-recognised and ignored. Most companies still prefer to buy the skills they need rather than develop their own skills and offer their employees better career prospects through training programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The central thrust of the Government's reform strategy is to establish a framework and offer financial and other resources by which these issues can be tackled. It is up to industry itself to take advantage of this assistance. The Government has established the Australian best practice demonstration program as a catalyst in the process. It has allocated $25m to this program, which is designed to illustrate the productivity gains made possible by analysing international benchmarks and striving to achieve them, a process already under way in our own enlightened enterprises. The Government is seeking to galvanise both management and the work force into cooperative action by this process. Only those enterprises which can demonstrate that they are prepared to undertake a comprehensive reform and restructuring program within a reasonable time frame will be eligible to take part in the scheme and share in its rewards. The Government will continue to support these foundations of reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having put the foundations in place, the Government has to consider the structure of the system to be built on them. The Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia have both recently put forward reform proposals which acknowledge the significant progress achieved in the reform process. They go on to make the valuable point that it is now timely to consider further change to the system which will build on this progress. The Government shares their view. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, accord mark VI committed the Government and the unions in February last year to move beyond the award restructuring outcomes that were available at the time through the centralised system and to embrace the concepts of decentralisation and enterprise level industrial agreements. The accord, the debate at the recent ACTU Congress and the reform proposals recently issued by key employer organisations indicate that all parties are agreed on the need to keep the process of change going. This kind of change goes beyond what the current national wage case review of wage fixing principles can consider. This review is necessarily restricted to what is possible within the present structure. </PARA>
<PARA>  In all the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Government should now express a view which, while grounded in its accord commitments, describes the logical conclusion of the moves made towards greater flexibility, more freedom of choice and the process of managed decentralisation. The Government has had extensive consultation with leading employer bodies and the union movement on this issue. Many interesting and sometimes challenging suggestions have emerged. Essentially, however, there is broad agreement that there is a place for bargaining beyond the existing conciliation and arbitration framework for those who are able to do so responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA>  Experience with section 115, certified agreements, under the Industrial Relations Act demonstrates how effective and constructive such agreements can be. The Government believes that more could and should be done to encourage such an approach to the joint determination of employment conditions and work relationships. To achieve this objective, it proposes to reform the present legislative arrangements which recognise the direct bargaining process. This should take account of the views of the representative employer and employee organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government does not accept, however, that unions should be excluded from a revised system, nor does it accept that there should be no mechanism to protect the public interest where it may be jeopardised by the direct bargaining process. Both sensible economic management and equity require a measure of regulation of the formal bargaining process. Workplace agreements should be reached fairly and freely. This, however, does not imply restricting the organisational rights of workers and their unions nor ignoring public interest requirements. The Government disagrees with the proposition that tribunals and unions should have no part in reaching and finalising workplace agreements. It has aptly been said that the typical relationship between an employer and an individual employee is one between a person with power and a person without power. Labour law operates in civilised societies to prevent this natural inequality from being abused. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government included provisions in the Industrial Relations Act when it was introduced three years ago to encourage greater flexibility, particularly at the workplace level. These amendments gave employers and unions the capacity to operate in an environment of their own design, with internally determined agreements on wages and conditions certified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Employers and unions were given the scope to reach agreements which covered as much or as little of the employment relationship as they wanted. Examples of the results can be seen at ICI sites such as at Botany and at Southern Aluminium in Tasmania. Similar agreements are operating at the Daimaru department store in Melbourne and are likely at the new Toyota greenfield site at Altona. </PARA>
<PARA>  Essentially, the Act allows the parties to reach agreements and bring them to the IRC for certification as awards. The provisions of the Act have some important characteristics. An agreement will be certified where the IRC is satisfied that it is in the interests of the parties concerned, but not if it regards the agreement as contrary to the public interest. Certified agreements operate for a fixed term and can be varied in only a limited range of circumstances. Notably, they do not have to conform with the IRC's wage fixing principles which regulate other awards. Provisions exist to prevent the flow-on of the terms of certified agreements to other awards. </PARA>
<PARA>  Though this regime has allowed parties in the Federal system to reach some very productive agreements which now have the force of awards, many employers and unions regard the provisions as not providing enough guidance or a sufficiently clear alternative to the usual arbitral process. It is fair to say that the IRC itself has not found the current provisions free of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me explain what the Government sees as essential elements in the direct bargaining alternative to be provided for in the Act. Broadly, the Government considers that this option should be more clearly defined and separated from the mainstream conciliation and arbitration system. For the reasons I have already given, the IRC should have a role at the entry point of the process. It should be satisfied that the decision by the parties to regulate their relationship by such agreements has been reached fairly and with a full understanding of its implications. Bargaining outside the arbitral framework, however, would not occur in an `anything goes' way. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a common view among employer representatives and unions that direct bargaining carries with it both rights and responsibilities. The obvious flexibility which such a system implies should be tempered by recognition of the need for bargains, once struck, to be observed. Clearly specified consultative and grievance processes must be followed. The parties could request a role for the IRC in resolving disputes arising under an agreement without varying its intent. Standard conditions of employment should be observed to avoid exploitation. Workplace agreements should not be vehicles for leapfrogging and flow-ons. </PARA>
<PARA>  Importantly, having opted for such an industrial relationship, a party should not be able simply to abandon it unilaterally during the term of an agreement without the consent of the other party. There should, nonetheless, be a place for the IRC to review the continuation of the agreement if it appears to be operating in a manner contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  There should be no industrial action during the life of the agreement over matters that are the subject of the agreement. Equally, the parties should, subject to reasonable conditions, be able to have resort to certain forms of industrial action in periods of negotiating new workplace agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>  One final point should be appreciated by all concerned. When governments, or anybody else, entertain options for remodelling the industrial relations system, they cannot avoid addressing the question of the legal framework--including rights and penalties--that should underpin the integrity of the remodelled system. There has been much debate of late about the finding by a key United Nations body--the International Labour Organisation--that our present legal framework appears to contradict our commitments to freedom of association which we assumed when Australia ratified ILO Convention 87. This finding by the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations--an independent body of eminent jurists--has already underlined the need to revise the existing machinery for securing compliance under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Opening the system to direct bargaining, as the Government proposes to do, makes the question raised by the ILO even more pressing. This question is not just about legal sanctions or the right to strike, to which most of the current debate is confined. With a fundamentally reformed system, we need to be sure that the existing legislative framework can guarantee its integrity. I have already explained that the Act should prescribe when industrial action is permissible in direct bargaining and in what circumstances. The fact is that workplace bargaining cannot be genuine without the right by both parties to engage in certain forms of industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has been consulting widely on this issue for some time, particularly in the National Labour Consultative Council, which brings together employer, union and government representatives. But narrowly focusing on rights, obligations and penalties can deflect attention from the main game: to develop a cooperative culture in the workplace. We will give most attention to this objective. Success in achieving this broader goal will render much of the current debate over rights and sanctions irrelevant and anachronistic. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me conclude by making the Government's position clear on reform of the industrial relations system. It is a system which has already undergone a great deal of reform in recent years in order to make industry more flexible and productive. Encouraging and facilitating more bargaining at the workplace level is a logical extension of this reform process. The Government intends to encourage it. Such bargaining must be done freely and jointly, however, and in ways which do not damage the public interest. The system will be reformed so as to accommodate these essential conditions. The whole process raises questions about the shape of the legal framework which must be fairly and honestly addressed. I commend this statement to honourable senators. I table the statement and I move:</PARA>
<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the statement and document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to respond to the statement that has just been tabled by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. It is a long and totally uninspiring statement. Indeed, when trying to find one's way through the morass of words and strange phrases and tortuous language that it contains, one can only really conclude that the main purpose of it is to get the Minister back into the industrial relations game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The past six months has been a highly confused game indeed, with a lot of notable players taking up new positions--contradictory positions, conflicting positions--with the result that the Industrial Relations Commission, which the Government and the ACTU tried to marginalise in April, has called for a second national wage case much earlier than would normally be the case. I think that case is still proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, the attempt by the Minister now--I suppose on behalf of the Government--is to make some positive contribution to this debate, which is, of course, the first attempt to do so made by the Government since the national wage case six months ago. Just to recap, the decision of the IRC in the national wage case last April was repudiated by both the Government and the ACTU on the ground that the Industrial Relations Commission had the cheek and the nerve to reject the submissions made to it by the Government and the ACTU. It exercised some independence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That just shows how marginal and how irrelevant Senator Cook is. I remind the Minister what his friend the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty, said when that case was brought down. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is a sickening decision, but there is no reason for the trade union movement to eat the vomit. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by the Government's mate, its big mate, Kelty. That is what he had to say about the matter. The Government said--and the Minister announced this--that it would implement the accord in the Commonwealth public sector--the only area, of course, in which it could act. The Government has in fact acted in that area. In public, the Government--perhaps not in such revolting terms as Mr Kelty's--was very critical of the decision of the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister was critical of the IRC despite the fact that he had been chiding the Opposition in this place for not respecting the umpire. The Government did not respect the umpire's decision in that case; in fact, it rejected the decision. It is just hypocrisy for Senator Cook to come in here time and again and try to suggest that the Government will have some respect for the IRC in this statement, after the way the Government and the ACTU have treated that body for the past six months. How the Government could believe that in future the IRC would be able to assert any authority in the industrial relations world, after the way it has been treated by it and the ACTU, is a complete mystery. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said, this statement is very long indeed. It contains a great deal of generalisation and points to matters about which Senator Cook has great concern, a lot of which would be shared by the Opposition. At the end of his speech, the Minister said that the Government's object in this matter is to develop a cooperative culture in the workplace. If the Government is interested in achieving a cooperative culture in the workplace, then I point out that the Opposition is offering a policy which is very much more designed to develop that cooperation than anything the Government has come up with or anything the ACTU has been able to come up with. I will come back to that matter later. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real defence of the Government is still its relationship with the ACTU and its much vaunted accord. It is interesting that the Minister should spend a great deal of his time criticising what he calls the obsession with strikes of so many participants in the industrial relations debate. He seems to be doing a great deal of shadow-boxing in this respect because, indeed, that is a debate that has occurred in the past. It is not at the forefront of the debate at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister uses some interesting statistics that are a severe reflection on the Government's record in relation to matters to which the Minister claims it pays great attention; namely, the degree of absenteeism. Indeed, on the second page of his statement, he regrets that there has been little achievement over the years of this Government in relation to encouraging people to work more regularly or harder or more happily. I quote from his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1979, an average of 3.8 per cent of full time employees were absent from work because of illness, accident or absenteeism. In 1989, the figures remained relatively steady at 3.4 per cent of full time employees. This reflects the fact that management has yet to address fully issues such as work organisation and job satisfaction . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Typically, he tries to put that responsibility on management. Perhaps the Government should look at itself and at how far its famous accord has worked in achieving the alleged goals of the Government. As I said, the general goal of cooperation instead of confrontation in the workplace has always been shared by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is still sticking to the accord as the linchpin not only of its industrial relations policy but of its policy generally. We should reflect on where the accord is at this stage. What has it achieved for the average member of the work force, for ordinary Australians?  We keep hearing claims by the Government that the accord has done remarkable things for the people of Australia. One thing the Government does claim is that the accord has caused fewer strikes. It has always claimed that the accord is not simply a wages policy or an industrial relations policy; one has to look also at the totality of the Government's economic policies in relation to the standard of living of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the result of 8 1/2 years of Labor government in relation to the standard of living of Australians?  First and foremost, it has delivered, as the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has finally admitted, the worst recession in Australia for 60 years. At last the truth has been admitted by this Government. The worst recession for 60 years is what this Government has delivered to ordinary Australians. What about employment?  According to the latest statistics, the unemployment rate is 10.2 per cent, and there is a forecast by the former Treasurer that unemployment will go higher this year. All the economic commentators agree that it will go higher. So we are looking at more like 11 per cent unemployment. This is what the Government has delivered to the Australian work force. Ordinary Australians, whom the accord is supposed to help, have had this treatment by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a few other features of the accord that also ought to be recorded. It has delivered lower real wages in Australia, and that is the constant complaint of the Government's great mate, Mr Kelty. He has threatened to pick this up in subsequent wage cases, by enterprise bargaining or by union muscle or whatever--he does not care much. A man who thinks and speaks the way he does is hardly going to be squeamish about the methods he uses. He has identified the great weakness of the accord. All the Minister is saying in this statement is that the Government is virtually going to carry on in the future the way it has in the past. It is pleased with the accord, despite all the criticisms of it, the failures of it and the rejection of it, in effect, by the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA>  The statement records some of the new developments that have been occurring very rapidly over the past few months. One of the bases on which the national wage decision in April was rejected was that it threw a bucket of cold water over enterprise bargaining. Certainly, the Opposition shared with the Government that criticism of the decision. But what the Opposition means by enterprise bargaining, what the Government means by it and certainly what the ACTU and the unions mean by it are probably very different things. Nevertheless, there has been a good deal of discussion about enterprise agreements being reached over the past few months. In so far as these are movements towards genuine enterprise bargaining, the Opposition has welcomed them and will continue to welcome them. However, during this time there has also been a great deal of confusion, and presumably this statement is meant to clarify in some way where the Government stands. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a bit odd that the Government has brought this statement down at this particular time when the national wage case has been brought on early in an attempt by the Industrial Relations Commission to reassert some of the authority it deserves to have and which it does have under the legislation but which has been severely damaged by actions of the Government and the ACTU. The national wage case has proceeded in a fairly normal way. The Government and the employer bodies have made submissions to it, but as yet there has been no decision by the IRC in relation to the matter. One would think the Government might have waited until that occurred before it made a general statement of this kind. The timing of the statement is a little odd. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems that the Minister is so anxious to get himself back in the game in which he has been a bit player for so long that he has decided to amend the Industrial Relations Act. This is the solution now to the major economic and social problem that has been facing Australia for many months!  It is the typical answer by the Government: `We will pass some legislation and that will fix it up'. We had the national wage decision in April, followed by the confusion created by the Government, by the ACTU and particularly by Mr Kelty. It was not helped very much by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, who seemed to be fully in agreement with Mr Kelty at that stage, although he left the field altogether shortly afterwards, and that has probably led to even further confusion. It did seem that there might have been some sort of special relationship between the ACTU and the Government at that stage and that there might have been some new way of proceeding, but the rug came out from under that when Mr Keating resigned. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a statement by the Minister in which he says that the Government is going to bring in legislation. I do not know when that will come forward. Of course, we will have to wait until we see the details of it before we can state any position in relation to it. What marvels me about this particular proposition is that the Minister is going to amend section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act. This is the very section of the Act which the Minister has fallen back on in defending himself in debates in this chamber when the Opposition has been calling for a new voluntary enterprise agreement and enterprise bargaining at the shop level. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have been saying that true enterprise bargaining is not possible under this present system and that the system has to be radically changed. The Minister has constantly poured scorn on us. He said, `Well, this is within the existing system. Here it is. Section 115 is working very well indeed. The Opposition does not seem to understand the system. It does not understand about this. It is not necessary because of section 115'. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Minister doing now? The one solution he has is to amend the very section that he has seen as the answer to the Opposition's complaints about the system. He does so because he says that there are some elements in section 115 that are too restrictive, although it has had some benefits. It is fair to say that the IRC itself has not found the current provisions free of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me explain what the Government sees as essential elements in a direct bargaining alternative to be provided for in the Act. One's hopes are raised. At last the Government has seen the light. It is accepting the criticisms that we in the Opposition have been making of this system for years now. In 1986, the Opposition basically unveiled the policy which we have in industrial relations--correct, true enterprise bargaining at the shop level or on a larger scale if the parties wish, but an option that they can take up without the interference of the ACTU, the Government and the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this new proposal, the Government is now moving a step further towards the Opposition's own policy. It is certainly accepting the very consistent and heavy criticisms that the Opposition has made for many years about the way the system is working--the system which Senator Cook defended time and time again in this chamber and elsewhere. Senator Cook said that the system was working all right; he now says it is not working all right and the Government is going to tinker around and make some changes to it. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is rather difficult to understand exactly what the proposal is. I do not propose to speculate about how it could work. The Minister is very vague about what the Government is going to do. We will see the legislation and, as I said, we will then decide what our view of it is. What can be said about the decisions is that the Government is accepting the criticisms that we have made about the system for a long time. It is moving further towards a freer system of enterprise bargaining and, at the same time, it is still trying to preserve a role for the Industrial Relations Commission and, presumably, for all the big players, their mates in the ACTU and the employer organisations--all of whom love the existing centralised system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The system is still going to be bureaucratic. The Industrial Relations Commission is going to determine the entry point of this process--whatever that means--and Big Brother will still be there keeping an eye on how these agreements are being entered into and the way they are going to be operated. Big Brother will still be in the system, and in that regard, of course, the Opposition totally rejects the principles of the legislation as stated by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I reaffirm the pillars of the Opposition's policy on industrial relations. Firstly, we will free up the system to give employers and employees the freedom to decide their own terms and conditions of employment in a voluntary agreement. </PARA>

If people do not want to enter into agreements or if they cannot enter into agreements, then the industrial relations system is still there for them to use if they want to. But it will be a very different role for the Commission under our system. Secondly, we will end compulsory unionism. I think that will be one of the major and most welcome steps for Australians in the future. Thirdly, we will allow for the establishment of enterprise unions instead of these great big amalgamated unions that we have debated here and opposed here. We will allow people to form themselves into unions at the enterprise level. That will, of course, greatly assist in the implementation of our policy. Finally, of course, we will preserve the rights of people in this community as exemplified by sections 45D and 45E. We will preserve the exercise of those rights in the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I notice that those matters have not be dealt with in this statement by the Minister.

But this statement is silent on that very vital matter. </PARA>

Senator Durack, who has just led for the Opposition, said that what the Government and the Opposition say and mean are entirely different. That is the only thing that I can agree on with Senator Durack. Senator Durack said it was an uninspiring statement and contained strange language. Once again, I can understand that from Senator Durack because he cannot understand the language of the industrial workplace as it is in Australia in this decade, particularly as a result of the vast changes that have occurred in this country under this Government. They were probably strange words like `spreading skills acquisition', `encouraging equal opportunity' and `career prospects for ordinary people'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  You, Madam Acting Deputy President, will appreciate this: there are people here with law degrees, including Senator Durack, Senator Reid and Senator Bishop. They understand what it means to have a career with a starting point and finally a point of success that they can aspire to. But this Government is giving to ordinary people, who have not always had the advantage, the opportunity of a career within industry. This is a revolutionary change that has occurred which is, I believe, something that Senator Durack cannot comprehend. </PARA>
<PARA>  `The flexible use of labour' is an expression best exemplified by the fact that the Minister has announced the program for best practice demonstration. The money going into that program indicates that the Government is giving its full support to what is new in industry--not the blind conservative policies we just heard Senator Durack talk about but the movement towards a cooperative culture, so that we can transform industry and thereby compete with the overseas countries that are challenging our tradition in industry. So the language is entirely different. </PARA>
<PARA>  The essential thing in what the Government is proposing is collective bargaining--the form that workplace agreements will take within the system in the future, as the Minister has outlined. We have to contrast that with the Opposition's approach, which contains two basic characteristics. The first one, and Senator Kemp demonstrated this again today, is the obsession with industrial dispute figures. The Opposition always concentrates on the industrial disputation figures; yet, as the paper points out, only one-twentieth of time is affected by industrial disputation compared with the tremendous sickness, accident and other aspects that affect our work force and which are the direct result of our archaic system, which has not given enough emphasis to the development of the most precious thing we have in this country--our human capital. This Government is trying to develop that human capital. Unfortunately, the Opposition is concerned only about the machinery; it does not understand that it is the people who make the tremendous difference. In this case, the Minister has shown that the Government, through a variety of means, is attempting to develop that precious resource--our human capital. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, firstly, we have that initial traditional obsession of conservative oppositions. Secondly, we have the simple proposal by the Opposition to favour capital over labour. That is what enterprise bargaining is. It is very crude and deliberate, and as time goes on I hope more and more people will come to understand that. I welcome the Minister's clear statement that he rejects the New South Wales Greiner Government's proposals and, of course, the New Zealand experiments. There is a common thread in the New South Wales and New Zealand legislation: it gives employers enhanced bargaining power over employees. In New South Wales, the employees will be locked into a three-year agreement but, as I will point out, there is a vast difference between this Government's proposals and what the Greiner Government, the New Zealand Government and Senator Durack would do. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Durack has outlined the way in which the Opposition would do things, so let us look at that. The most serious issue of all is what happens before an agreement. What  Senator Durack has not told us is that he will give us a one-sided system. He will give us a system in which, as Senator Cook pointed out in his paper, a person with power and a person without power will characterise the system. Senator Durack, under his proposal, will make sure that that is what happens. When Senator Durack says that there will be a lot of freedom, he is really talking about freedom for the employer. People who are now members of a trade union--for example, 40 people in a factory--according to what Senator Durack has outlined will form their own enterprise union. Who will be the secretary of a union with 40 members? Effectively, those people will be on their own. But the employer in this situation will remain a member of his association. He will still have access to the lawyers and the economists; he will still have industrial knowledge from the employer organisation about what is happening everywhere else--and, of course, knowledge is power. However, the people in the enterprise union, so-called, will be left to their own devices. </PARA>
<PARA>  When Senator Durack says that he wants a freer system, he means that he wants a free kick for the employers to give them unlimited power in dealing with their employees. It is absurd. When Senator Durack talks about not giving preference to unions, he really means smashing unions. Even now in the Australian community people with New Right tendencies are challenging the system. One can well imagine what would happen if these people--particularly some ruthless employers--had a system that allowed them to have open slather. Charles Copeman of North Broken Hill-Peko is a type of employer anarchist, a person who is out to destroy the system. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have recently been involved with a dispute in New South Wales. I have some knowledge of and a background in the printing industry, and at Vista Paper Products in Emu Plains there has been an industrial dispute involving an employer who refuses to follow the rules. This company has 55 employees and has produced carbonless paper. For 20 years, while it was owned by several different companies, including the American giants Nasua and Visyboard, it did not have an industrial dispute. Under the new employer, an industrial dispute has been going on for five months. For five months there has been a picket because the employees were locked out in the course of an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>  The employer undertook no effective negotiation. In other words, he did not follow the proposals set out in Senator Cook's paper whereby people would have a free choice, proper negotiation and the ability to bargain properly. This employer reduced the hourly rate from $13.22 to $12.49, lengthened the hours of work, and effectively cut the pay rate by 11 per cent. The employer's attitude was, `Stand and deliver; you take it or you are out the door'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have mentioned this dispute because it has all the ingredients of the proposals that are in place in New Zealand and will be put in place in New South Wales if the Greiner Government is successful. They will turn our society upside  down. One of the characteristics of this dispute is that, although the employer in this case has the Chamber of Manufactures behind him, the workers have their union behind them. Under the Opposition's proposals, those workers would be defenceless and they would be crushed by the power and the finances of the employer organisations, which could be mobilised to destroy a group of people. Senator Durack had the audacity to talk about Big Brother from the unions. Compare that with the power of the employer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The important thing is that, in this dispute, ordinary men and women who have never been involved in an industrial dispute are still out there battling. Australians will never be slaves. So no matter how the Opposition thinks it will crush the people, it will not be effective. As in this case, people will continue to go ahead. The Australian people will not accept the system Senator Durack has outlined because, as Senator Cook has said, the system must be fairly and freely negotiated. That is at the heart of this Government's proposal. It is the very opposite to what has occurred in the Vista dispute to which I have referred, and it is in contrast to the other developments that would result if the formula Senator Durack outlined to the Senate were to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>  I congratulate the Minister and point out that the $25m proposed for the best practice demonstration program is a particularly important and positive development. It is something that shows an increasing Government commitment to the attempt to modernise our industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also congratulate Senator Cook because I know that for some time he has pressed that Australia play its part in adopting ILO conventions. There is nothing more important than for us to move in conformity with ILO Convention No. 87--the freedom of association and the protection of the right to organise. It is one of those things that should have been done before. It is to Senator Cook's credit that he now takes us further in adopting that proposal. I think that proposal sums up the spirit of the Minister's statement, and I congratulate him on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have been presented with a statement which has as part of its title `Reforming the Industrial Relations System'. The statement translates into some eight pages of written script, telling us--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bishop" NAMEID="SE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator Bishop</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Just a little.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, just a little. It consists mainly of generalities, and I contend that it lacks precision. As an introduction to a debate about the industrial relations system of Australia, it is extraordinarily gentle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first part of the statement expends most of its energy emphasising the virtues of the present system and its achievements. We are told further into the statement that the system needs reform; in fact, that is in the title--`reform'. I looked forward to hearing some actual details of those reforms, but this statement does not provide them. The lack of detail enables us to agree with some of the statements, not because they are particularly inspirational but because they are bland and unsensational. </PARA>
<PARA>  Early in the statement the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) refers to and identifies the causes of time lost from the workplace. Quite rightly, he emphasises:</PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, the time lost through disputes over managerial policy, wages or any other issue pales by comparison with that lost through absenteeism and work-related sickness and accidents. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA>Unjustifiable absences from work are widely accepted as being a symptom of unfulfilling work, poor job satisfaction, weak organisational commitment and rigid work organisation--</PARA>
<PARA>I strongly agree with this statement a couple of sentences later:</PARA>
<PARA>The truly effective way to solve these absences is by making work more interesting and rewarding and by giving workers more responsibility and more influence over how work should be performed. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, that means worker participation in management decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats were looking forward to a few hints as to how this might be implemented. What we really have is a statement by the Minister which is notable not so much for what it says but, rather, for what it fails to say. It fails to lead us directly to a system which would include effective worker participation, profit sharing or sharing of the decision-making process, whether that be through board membership or any other vehicle which brings about the understanding that workers, owners, shareholders and all interested parties share a mutual interest in the success of any enterprise. I was looking forward to seeing some of that in this statement. I think it skirts around the issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  My interest was sparked when we were told in the statement that at least 300,000 workers are injured at the workplace each year. As a country, we should be ashamed of that statistic. It brought home some immediate relevance. I think we were all horrified with the graphic colour pictures and even the graphics that we saw on the front of the Age newspaper recently of a little boy who was injured by machinery in an avocado packing place. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the moment I am not questioning who was liable in that case, nor am I questioning the machinery, the layout, whether it was up to Australian standards or whether particular industrial safety practices were followed. That is not what is at issue here. I am drawing attention to the potential for immense costs to workers, their families, their employers and the community in general. Senator Crowley mentioned that the cost to the community would possibly have been quite immense in that instance. Nobody in the community would dare question it; in fact, I think the community is elated that we have in Australia the technical and medical expertise to meet the problems that would have been faced by that little boy. In fact, we triumph with the community that this particular accident was probably medically overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw attention to the fact that we had an accident that occurred at the workplace which may have been preventable by having effective work-based child-care. That is an issue which has not received a great deal of attention. Perhaps that is because it is not immediately apparent to those who are involved just what costs there are to the community in not having sufficient and effective work-based child-care. Those costs may be graphic, as we saw in the case of this little boy; or they may not be so graphic, not so easily understood. We should look at the cost to the community of having a very large part of potential contributors to our economic success in this country unable to attend work because of our lack of work-based child-care. Perhaps that problem would at least be addressed by what we are told by the Minister in the last sentence on the second page of the statement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>This means involving workers in planning the way work can be designed, organised and performed so that it is safer and healthier. </PARA>
<PARA>I was pleased to note--the statistics helped to make it a little more attractive than the surrounding wordage--that there was no industrial action in 72 per cent of our industries; a further 10 per cent of our industries had not had any form of industrial action for two years or more. In other words, most employers and employees are mainly concerned with actually getting on with their own common task. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was also very pleased--I am sure that it was part of the language that Senator Childs was telling us we should be familiar with; I must admit that it was unfamiliar to me--to know that the Government is not concerned with ideological marginalia. If I had to be concerned with that I would be thoroughly confused. We were told that the Government is not concerned about that. That is most pleasing, indeed. The fundamental principle in this strategy is cooperation rather than conflict. That message, after struggling through the previous terminology, was made quite clear to me. The Government believes that the most important principle in this is cooperation rather than conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further on, I came to some conflict in reading the statement. On page 4 of the printed statement we are told:</PARA>
<PARA>Industry has yet to develop the `flexibility' to enable it to take up the fullest potential offered from among women and other workers whose skills have traditionally been under-recognised and ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>That to me says that the status quo is far from satisfactory. The Democrats would certainly support that statement. We contend that these considerations of flexibility, in finding a way to bring about a greater contribution from those people who have traditionally been under-recognised and ignored, should not be considered in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Industrial relations is not a subject which stands in isolation. It is fundamental and integral to the economy, the environment and our education, health, welfare and social justice systems--indeed, our whole socio-economic environment. To properly consider this, we ought to ask some fundamental questions. For example: what do we define as work?</PARA>
<PARA>  Anybody in receipt of any payments through either the Department of Social Security or the Austudy system has to grapple daily with the definition of work. While people are studying or preparing themselves for a career, seeking work, engaging in voluntary work or in what is euphemistically termed domestic work, they are nevertheless all working. Some are in receipt of benefits, social security payments or pensions and others are in receipt of nothing. When considering these injustices and different levels of equity, we really should be considering a proper definition or redefinition of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are told in the statement that industry is yet to develop flexibility. I contend it is not only industry but also all Australians who need a different attitude to employed versus unemployed. When we consider those things then I will consider that we have moved from the superficial to a level of debate which might achieve something. If we accept that the present system is not perfect then this statement, in this part, is certainly superficial in its discussion and its proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further in the statement, we are informed that the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia recently put forward reform proposals. We are told that they go on to make the valuable point that it is now time to consider further change to the system which will build on that process. That is one of those statements with which it is very hard to disagree. It does have a certain blandness. I could stand here and say that the Democrats agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the point that is most important to support is the need to consider what further improvements should be made and not just that improvement is needed. Really, we should be getting down to a discussion of what further improvements can be made. Until we do so, again, it is very much a case of agreeing with not very much. I am pleased to see that the word `flexibility' is repeated consistently throughout the statement. Therefore, the centralised and monolithic nature of the status quo will be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also further into the statement there is something else with which it is certainly possible to agree, and that is the statement that there is broad agreement that there is a place for bargaining beyond the existing conciliation and arbitration framework. However, we are eager to see exactly what the Government proposes doing rather than agreeing that there is a place for such bargaining beyond the existing arbitration framework as defined by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  We were told of the essential elements of any direct bargaining system. We were given a hint on what would be contained within any proposition to remove the centralised arbitration system from the linchpin of this system and replace it with a direct bargaining system. We were given a hint about that but no direct proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Near the end of the statement, we were told, with reference to the ILO and its participation in this process and the deliberations of the committee of experts, that that underlines the need to revise the existing machinery for securing compliance under the present system. What will the Government do to meet that need which has been identified? We are anxious to see what the Government will do to meet that need. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no hint in the statement of heavier penalties. That is an assumption that has been made by many commentators on this issue. It is an assumption which I do not think such commentators have the right to make. In this statement we are told quite plainly on the final page, as we have been previously, that narrowly focusing--this is characterised as an obsession, and I would agree that commentators have been obsessed with this--on rights, obligations and penalties really can deflect attention from the most important part, and that is the need to develop a cooperative culture in the workplace. I certainly do not ridicule that statement; I support it completely. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such a statement does not ring hollow with me as it might with Senator Durack. The words are quite plain and they are words which need to be endorsed. The Democrats certainly support the Government in that aim to bring a cooperative culture to the workplace. I contend that such a development will not occur without leadership, example and an indication of how we can leave that narrow, blinkered, misguided concentration upon one aspect of the lost time, or the reduced productivity in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to have our attention turned away from industrial action and towards cooperation at the workplace, then cooperative models must be identified quickly and provided so that we are able to follow and be inspired to adopt the cooperative model instead of being allowed to assume that the only model to follow is one of confrontation. With that hope in mind, I look forward to the next statement in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I join my colleague Senator Childs in congratulating the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) on this very positive statement which is about moving to the next stage of industrial relations reform that has been carried out by this Government, a reform unrivalled by any government in the history of this country. It is about reforming the whole workplace culture not only for workers but also for management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I do not want to traverse the areas covered by my two colleagues who have already spoken. I want to talk specifically about one area and give an example of exactly what has been achieved and the hard work that was needed. Before doing so, I should comment on what has been said by Opposition members and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Durack commented that for the past six months the Minister has been a bit player who, along with many others from the ACTU and other areas, has been making conflicting statements. In reality, in the past six months there has been a debate about moving to the next stage of this industrial reform. We are not afraid to have that sort of debate in a public way. There is nothing wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, Senator Bell joined Opposition speakers in `the magic wand club'. They think they can solve all of the problems in the industrial system that have been built up over years and years simply by coming into the Senate or by going public and saying, `We will make a few changes here and write a few things in somewhere else and all the culture that has been built up over the years that has been the big problem within industry in this country and the efficient operation of industry will disappear as if by magic overnight'. </PARA>
<PARA>  That just will not happen. We have to work very hard on it. There is a lot of work being done by unions in the workplace and, to their credit, many employers, to change this culture and create a much more effective workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Durack said that what this statement really did was entrench the Big Brother, because there would still be a role for the Industry Commission and big unions would still have a role. He said that the answer is to adopt the Opposition's policy. I suggest to the Senate that if we were to adopt the Opposition's policy we would certainly entrench Big Brother all right. We would simply turn back the clock by 50 or 60 years and allow all the little employers around this country to exploit workers just as much as they liked. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we would have, if the Opposition's policy were to be implemented, is hundreds of unions all over this country--the very thing that I have heard the Opposition complaining about in the past. People in small workshops would be absolutely exploited. They would be in such a position that they would have absolutely no chance of achieving any justice. I suggest that the establishment of the Big Brother syndrome is simply what the Opposition's policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Durack quoted from the statement and said that it was the Government's intention to develop a cooperative culture in the workplace. He said that he certainly agreed with that and that the Opposition's policy would achieve it. I suggest that the Opposition's policy in no way would achieve it. What it would achieve is that eventually we would return to where we started 40 or 50 years ago, workers would get to the stage where they had to rebel against the system and there would be enormous conflict in the workplace. What has been said in the Opposition's policy is simply a recipe for confrontation and has nothing whatsoever to do with cooperation in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to use as an example what has occurred in my State with one of the major enterprises in that State. I want to use it to highlight just how this Government's policy is working, how there is cooperation going on and what can be achieved in the future. I speak of the Hydro-Electric Commission in Tasmania. I suggest that in terms of the diversity of skills available in that organisation there is probably no organisation comparable to it in Australia. It is involved in the construction of power stations and dams, and the construction, installation and maintenance of power lines across the State. It delivers services through power distribution to industry and to all the individual consumers in the State. There is an incredible diversity of skills and work carried out by that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is only in the last six months that that organisation has been completely changed. Until a couple of years ago there were 13 awards in that organisation--some were State awards and some were Federal--and there was an enormous number of unions. Within those awards there were 3,500 classifications, which was a quite ridiculous situation. In order to change that, what the Opposition would have done--if one looks at its policy--is confront the workers at the HEC and try to break down the system, and there would have been enormous upheaval. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has occurred by cooperation, by the policies of this Government being put into place, by the cooperation of the unions and by discussion with the workers--not going out browbeating them--about how they could establish career paths and so forth, is that we now have one consolidated Federal award covering all of the workers in the HEC across that diverse range of work. In that award there are now only 42 classifications. In addition, an apprentice now, for example, could start with the HEC, and it is possible for that apprentice to proceed along a career path and end up in the top classification--which is a senior engineer in classification 42--and to achieve all that by working through the system and doing additional education.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the past the position was that an apprentice working anywhere in the system had no way to get any accreditation and no opportunity. In fact, such an apprentice was debarred from entering any engineering courses. That is the sort of thing that has been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to give one other example of what has occurred. I heard Senator Walters make a comment about the dam a moment ago. The HEC workshop is now the biggest engineering workshop in Tasmania and probably compares, in terms of skills, with any in Australia. In 1983-84 people like Senator Walters and others were running round the country saying, `If you don't dam the Franklin River this place will dissolve. There will be no workers left here in this workshop'. I must admit, the workers in the workshop had very much the same view and they were very despondent about their future. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened over the last two years--and I have to give credit where it is due; the opportunity to do this was due to a Liberal Government in Tasmania--is that an organisation called HEC Enterprises has been set up and allowed to go out and compete on the open market. Initially when it was set up people did not really take up the opportunity but, because of the greater cooperation between the unions, management and the workers themselves and much greater discussion, they have realised the potential that they have. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened at the workshop is that now it is doing some extremely heavy engineering work for major private companies around Tasmania and companies on the mainland, and they are now involved in doing work overseas. A lot of that work has been carried out in that workshop. I venture to say that it will expand and become one of the biggest and most effective workshops in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  All that has occurred because there has been a change in this mind-set due to the policies of this Government and the cooperation between this Government and the trade union movement in trying to get the message across to workers that there is a need to change their attitude, and there is a need for management to change its attitude. It will not be changed by simply trying to browbeat them. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say this to establish the credentials of this Government in what has been achieved. That is just one example of where it has occurred. It has occurred in many other places. I guess none of us on this side would pretend that we have a perfect world at the moment. There is a lot more to be achieved. But those examples can be used as role models for other industries--a path for them to go down and to achieve the same sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government can really hold its head up and say that it has done an enormous amount to change the industrial system in this country. I congratulate the Minister for this paper, which now identifies where we are going. There has been a debate about what ought to occur in the future. We are now moving to the next stage, and I think the next stage will be just as beneficial for the workers in industry across Australia. I commend this statement to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>  Senator Devereux explained how good the HEC workshop was. He acknowledged that it was all the result of the Liberal Government in that State of Tasmania. I agree with him. I agree with him entirely. It was because the Liberal Government in that State opened it up so that it could compete in the private market; I agree with him. That has nothing to do with the reform of this Government--not one iota. Senator Childs said that we do not understand the terminology.

<PARA>  Let us look at the first of the Minister's statements on the accord. He told us how magnificent it had been for industrial relations. The accord was so good and worked so fantastically in this country that the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, decided that things were so crook he would have to engineer a recession. So we have had the recession we had to have. The present Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has assured us that it is the worst recession for 60 years--a wonderful result of the accord!  All the accord has done is to encourage dreadful, obscene work practices. It has encouraged people to take sickies. There has been a lack of productivity and it has resulted in the worst number of bankruptcies that this country has ever seen. We have over one million people unemployed--a wonderful accord!  It is a wonderful accord for those who are still in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we talked about the recession and what a dreadful situation the accord had produced, Senator Maguire stated, `But we have got a lower inflation rate'. Those opposite should go out and tell the one million people in the dole queues what a wonderful accord it has been for them. Frankly, I do not think they will believe those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all remember Robe River and the action the Government took there. Look how viable it is now. We all remember that. We all remember SPC Ltd--where a solution had been worked out between the employer and employees--and the Government's interference there. We all remember how the action by government employees who formed a picket line at Mudginberri sent it broke. As all this has gone on, the standard of living in this country has gone down and down--all because of the accord. It is absolutely wonderful. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have been told--and I would like to quote from the Minister's statements--that the accord has reduced strikes. In the middle of the worst recession in 60 years, it is not likely that people will go on strike too often. The Minister said that these factors are not reflected in the debate over industrial relations. Does the Minister not understand that the number of sickies that are being taken are a direct result of an accord that says, `You will get paid whether or not there is productivity;  you will get paid whether or not your business goes broke or whether it is viable;  you will get paid and you do not have to do a darned thing'? The Minister either does not understand or he will not listen to our industrial relations policy. Our industrial relations policy makes it possible for an employer and an employee to come to some agreement about sickies. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have had the instance of ICI Australia Ltd. That organisation came to an agreement with its employees that sick leave would be unconditional. Its employees could have as much sick leave as they liked, so long as there was no abuse. The first time that any person was caught abusing the sick leave provisions, that person would be sacked. All the employees agreed and that agreement has stuck. ICI now has fewer sickies than it ever had before. This is the sort of agreement that we in the Opposition believe is the only way to overcome the problems, the ills, of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at some of those work practices that I have been talking about. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, has told us that he has done wonderful things on the waterfront. Indeed, he promised that he would resign if he did not achieve them. This has been going on for quite some time. The problem is that he is attempting to reform the waterfront at the margins. He has not even tried to increase productivity in any real way. Since 1989 attempts have been made to improve the waterfront by creeping along and making a few redundancies along the way, so the Minister tells us. </PARA>
<PARA>  Britain has achieved a 130 per cent productivity improvement in its ports, while we have been creeping along doing nothing. New Zealand has improved productivity in its ports by 98 per cent. We have had Bill Kelty telling us that there must be a halt to waterfront reform because we have gone far enough. Yet in Australia it costs $237 to shift a 20-foot container, almost double what it costs in Singapore at $137, or in Britain at $150. That is the sort of reform that this Government is attempting. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also have Australia's biggest stevedoring company, National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, saying that, even if the reform that the Minister is telling us is achievable is accomplished fully, it will only average a movement of 23 containers an hour. Yet the American port of Philadelphia already shifts 33 containers an hour. We can achieve something so long as we do not set our goals too high. That is pretty easy. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are the sorts of reforms that the Minister is talking about. He has made this statement because he has been dragged screaming by our policy to do something, just to say something about enterprise agreements. He is now advocating enterprise agreements, a term that was not acceptable in any situation by the Government a couple of years ago. Enterprise agreements were out. The big unions and the Industrial Relations Commission had the say. Now that the Government has had a brawl with the Industrial Relations Commission, when the Government set the accord and it was ignored by the Commission, the Government is threatening the Commission and moving towards enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>  We know that the last accord was not accepted by the Commission, and the Government and the ACTU would not accept the umpire's decision. So now the Minister for Industrial Relations has made a statement setting out some new rules, but he will not go all the way. He will not take the final step that would set this country on the right path. There is a very big difference. Why not go for voluntary unionism? Why does the Government insist on forcing people into a union? Despite that, unionism is decreasing rapidly in this country because it is not supplying workers with anything at all. I quote from the second page of the ministerial statement:</PARA>
<PARA>Unjustifiable absences from work are widely accepted as being a symptom of unfulfilling work, poor job satisfaction, weak organisational commitment and rigid work organisation which makes difficult the blending of work with family and other responsibilities. It is not that Australian workers are idle. Such absences will not be solved by sanctions against them. </PARA>
<PARA>ICI managed to come to an agreement with its workers. That company told its employees that they could have unlimited sickies, but made it clear that the first time they abused the system they would get the sack. The Minister said that such absences would not be solved by sanctions, and continued in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The truly effective way to solve these absences is by making work more interesting and rewarding and by giving workers more responsibility and more influence over how work should be performed. </PARA>
<PARA>We say yes, definitely, that is the way to go; that is part of our policy. We believe that if the employees and the employer get together and decide on how the work will be performed, decide on the hours so that some people can work different hours from others, the work will become more meaningful because they will have some say. They will not be in the same position as those who were involved in the Mudginberri dispute, where the union said, `You will only slaughter X number of beasts per day'. Those involved will be able to come to an agreement that employees can work as hard as they like; they can slaughter as many beasts as they want to. They will not be restricted by a union telling them what they can and cannot do. </PARA>
<PARA>  If I were in a union where I could not work as I wanted to, if I could not work with my employer and decide what action I could take or how hard I could work but was told by a union that I could not slaughter more beasts a day, although I was prepared to do so, I would not want to be in the union. Is it any wonder that the unions are losing power and members? There is a vast difference between the steps this Government is prepared to take and how far it is willing to go and what the Opposition is prepared to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government is trying desperately to hang on to some sort of Industries Assistance Commission input. We have been telling the Government for years that people want to be free to work as they want to work. In the end it does not matter what ideology one has, people will demand that freedom. They are demanding it now, and this is why the Minister is coming screaming along, telling people, `We are not really against enterprise bargaining, we are really for it'. But he is not telling the full story and saying, `However, only if the union agrees'. Later in his statement the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, however, there is a broad agreement that there is a place for bargaining beyond the existing conciliation and arbitration framework for those who are able to do so responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA>What arrogance on the part of the Minister! Who is he to say who can do these things responsibly? Does `responsible' mean according to the Government's view on that or does it mean according to the employees' and employers' decisions? The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>To achieve this objective, it proposes to reform the present legislative arrangements which recognise the direct bargaining process. This should take account of the views of the representative employer and employee organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>The reference there is not to the employees but to the employee organisations. What happens in a business where none of the employees are union members? I do not know what would happen; the Minister has not spelt it out. He has not said that in such a case an employer would have to seek out a few unions and make sure that they came along and negotiated on the part of his employees who are not union members. I do not know what the Minister is talking about; certainly he has not attempted to clarify the position. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Devereux was talking about Opposition members wanting hundreds of unions. I make it clear to him that, if necessary, we would want to see thousands of unions. Any business, it does not matter how small, can have a union for that particular business if it wants to. We are objecting to the fact that there are perhaps hundreds of unions in the one workplace, as there are in many workplaces at the moment. We believe that there are not enough small unions but that there should be only one to each workplace. This is not what the Government wants. It wants large, powerful unions so that if one union goes on strike it can hold the whole country to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA>  To return to the statement, the Minister says how wonderful the accord has been. I would ask him to go out and tell the unemployed how wonderful it has been. The accord has been a disaster for the unemployed. It might be all right for those who still have a job, but as unemployment continues to grow the Government will be told what the people think of the accord. It does not take me to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is amusing to listen to the litany of lies and stupidity over a number of speeches in this chamber. I should like to put the record straight because I am in a position to do that, having had many years experience in the trade union movement. I have been part of making that history, not talking about it, as do those ignorant people on the other side of the chamber. They get their experience out of books and newspapers. They do not know what it means to be involved in industrial relations. They believe in confrontation and not consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  All my life in the trade union movement I was considered to be a militant and a fighter, but one of the very important things in my armory was the capacity to talk in a friendly way to employers, to look at consultation and to seek agreements that are honoured. I never went to the question of legalities, but to what was fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Walters and other Opposition senators talk about penalties for workers who do not do the right thing and lie down when they are told to and get up when they are told to. If the workers make a suggestion to the boss, they are told that they are not paid to use their brains and that they only have to do what they are told. According to the Opposition, penalties should be imposed on workers if they strike. I suppose that a better idea would be to throw them in gaol, as has happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  Industrial relations is about establishing performance and behaviour standards for people in industry who create both services and products--that is, consumer goods and capital goods. It goes to the question of work practices; health and safety; payment for work done and not done; hours of work; and human relations, treating people as human beings and not just as figures on a balance sheet or an extension of the machines they use. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislative framework within which these rules are made is tremendously important. If that legislation provides certain requirements for the standard of behaviour of both labour and capital, it provides the opportunity and the compulsion on both sides to seek to reach an agreement that can be mutually beneficial. The Liberal Party does not have that view, but the Labor Party has had it for many years. If we talk about history and some of the terrible things that have been perpetrated on workers, there are those who would say to us that we should not look at history but at the current situation. My experience has always been that intelligent people realise that one has to look at the past and the present to see where the future might go. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Walters talked about the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) being dragged into a situation where he had to talk about enterprise agreements. I have heard some rubbish in the Senate in my time, but that nearly tops the lot. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Unions have been making enterprise agreements--and Senator Crane can either show his ignorance or agree with me--for many years. I have made many where there was a set of rules for wages and conditions in a particular workshop or enterprise or construction site which covered many unions and many members of unions. Those agreements were made with people who were intelligent, mature and sophisticated and who represented employers in those areas. On the other hand, they were made by trade union officials who were looking to get a set of wages and conditions that would benefit their members. They agreed to conditions such as no strikes for two years and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The unions would never agree that there could not be a strike if a safety issue was involved. However, they did say that they were prepared to isolate safety issues and work on all the other parts of the site or in every other part of the enterprise. Very often, employers would use safety issues to create a dispute. While there has been much talk about the level of disputes and the intensity of some of the struggles, I can assure the Senate that many disputes were created quite consciously and purposely by employers. In fact, I have been instrumental on many occasions in advising members of one or more unions not to tumble into the trap and to stay on the job. </PARA>
<PARA>  The enterprise agreement proposition is one that the Labor Party, the ACTU and individual unions have been involved in for many years. The main attraction in an enterprise union has always been for the employer. For example, an employer may have been in a position to pay additional money and placed a very high value on continued production--in other words, he did not want any disputes. Those agreements were made and registered in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission over a long period--20 years or more, to my personal knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true that at one time we had overaward payments in many areas, but the unions that were thoughtful about the matter made a decision that we should try to get rid of those overaward payments and enterprise situations and look at an across-the-board award payment where people doing similar work would get similar rates of pay. For instance, when one looks at how manufacturing, which I know well, developed in this country and in other countries before Australia had a manufacturing industry in a fairly rudimentary way, one can see that it was very crude. It is well known to those of us who were involved in industry and have read many things about it that in America there was a proposition called tailorism, which took the skill of the tradesman and divided it up into many tasks. That created a position where people with very low skills were doing parts of a particular task, with no real responsibility for care. They had very limited value and very limited capacity to work outside that job. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was the employers' wish that that be done in this country, so the metal trades award was established and developed whereby lower rates of pay were paid to people who did part of a journeyman's job. That meant that the skill base in this country was never developed in the way that it should have. It was even against the interests of those employers who were not prepared to look at it in a constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA>  We went through a period where employers were quite happy, for instance, to build a ship in a shipyard on a cost-plus basis. They did not care how long it took or how inefficient it was. The longer it took the more wages they paid, and the more expenses they had the more profit they made. As time went on, they had to have fixed price contracts. They had to put in a price, and if they did not meet that price in terms of their ability to produce the goods they lost money. The employers expected the trade unions to change overnight and do whatever they wanted them to, under the threats of no employment security, dismissal when it suited the boss to make a few bob, and total submission to the idea of supervision in the workshop or on the work site. </PARA>
<PARA>  That did not happen. In the main, trade union people are not highly educated; they are not university graduates. They were very low loathe to make those changes, particularly when they could see that the employers were still very inefficient and hopeless managers. They used to have a view--I have heard it said and even said it myself at one time--that on that occasion it was appropriate to take action. The unions took the view that if the boss wanted to be stupid and not organise the process of production or manage his factory or workplace and went down the flue--if he went broke--that was his problem, why should we help him?</PARA>
<PARA>  People went from job to job; but suddenly it was no longer easy for people in industry or in enterprises to get other jobs. As we developed technology, jobs structurally disappeared. Jobs are structurally disappearing even now. So the trade union movement, which is much quicker on its feet than employers, decided, `It is about time we saved these dopey managers because they cannot save themselves'. We developed a process where we advocated greater skilling for the work force; training for management; more training for workers in the workplace; and the creation of career paths. I can assure the Senate that it took a lot of convincing as far as the employers were concerned.  We did that; we felt that it was our obligation, and that was our initiative. However, if one listened to those opposite in this place, one would think it was the employers' initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over time, the trade unions, in some instances but not all, have also invested quite a lot of money in training shop stewards and other workshop representatives. Contrary to what those opposite would have people believe, we realised that if we had shop stewards who were properly trained and understood the sort of system the Minister talks about in the statement--some of it has been put into place and other sections of it will be put in place to develop the cooperative, consultative approach--we would get much further down the track. The trade unions have known that, and so they have worked towards it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I picked up a copy of the journal of the Metal Workers  and Engineering Union which is made up of some seven unions. Over many years, of its own accord it has gradually amalgamated to form a very good and functional union, a very thinking union, that has contributed a lot to the education of workers and employers. This journal related a story about an engineering company in the Hunter area. One of the organisers had a talk to management and said that there needed to be some changes in the way in which management and labour operated. The organiser said that there had to be more consultation; that people had to know what the future held. He asked how people could be expected to have any loyalty towards the company or any feeling about being part of the company if they were kept in the dark all the time, did not know whether the job would last a week or a month, were given only restricted training and the old demarcation operation was still there. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following those discussions, the demarcation lines were blunted and, in some cases, they disappeared. There were fairly constant discussions between management and the representatives of the workers in which they talked about how they would go about a particular job; what work was available; how they should quote the job; and whether they could deliver if they quoted a price and a time. It is of tremendous importance for a company to be able to do that and to have some confidence in its ability to communicate with the workers and get a result. Even Senator Crane would agree that it is important if a company can get that sort of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>  One small section of the journal article quoted a crane driver. I would have fainted if I had read this 10 years ago. The crane driver said that he was going to start a welding course in the next week. So here we have a crane driver who will be trained to weld. He will be able to drive a truck and he will learn certain basic skills in areas which he would have never thought possible. That initiative was taken by the Metal Workers Union and the Iron Workers Union, not by the employer. The employer would not have dared looked at or touched that area. So that is a situation in which there is an enterprise agreement, where there is enterprise cooperation. Members who are part of a larger union of almost 200,000 members are able to operate within that enterprise in a cooperative way, having consideration for their future and recognising that the employer has some rights and responsibilities too, and they were able to make a success of it. It does not have to be a little defenceless union. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to this proposition of enterprise unions, Senator Walters says, from a position of ignorance, that we should have thousands of enterprise unions. Do honourable senators know any sensible, intelligent employer who is not part of an employers organisation which can give advice on award conditions; how to negotiate; and how to handle any matters relating to employment? I do not. I know some dopey employers who are not members of such an organisation, but I do not know of any intelligent ones. They are all members of organisations and they are all fairly well served. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the same way, workers are entitled to have that sort of representation, by unions which are of such a size that they can finance and carry through the sorts of programs that will train shop stewards so that when they talk to an employer--who almost always has beside him an industrial officer from a Metal Trades Industry Association, the Chamber of Commerce, or a similar organisation--they also can have their trade adviser with them. They are entitled to be in an organisation that will have enough finance available for the sort of training that will equip them to negotiate in their own right; so that they can make comparisons of the way in which operations take place in other workshops of a similar kind or that may employ people with similar skills but which may produce quite a different product. Of course, workers are entitled to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we want to make small enterprise unions--some with only four or five unions--then we deny the worker his right to organise and to be trained and properly represented. For that reason, we say that enterprise unions are a device meant to deny workers of their rights. It is a device which is intended to get the most work for the least possible pay by the employer. There is nothing evil about that; one cannot go to gaol for such a thing. But I can assure honourable senators this: the trade union movement will not let it happen. Within the legislation that this Government proposes--and some of the ideas that are included in the statement--we will be maintaining and improving the unions in terms of size and their capacity to operate on behalf of the workers. At the same time--and I repeat--there will be no problem with working within an enterprise by way of dealing with the local shop steward and by way of an enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a particular view on training. My mind goes back to the years when employers used to train people in what they called skills. They trained people sufficiently to do what they wanted them to do. They may have had a very limited production line or a particular task to carry through or a product to make; and that is all they ever did. Of course, when they shut down they sacked those workers and the workers' ability to get another job was very limited because they had not been trained properly. If they were fortunate enough to have an apprenticeship with a good employer who was proud of his training capacity, they were okay; but if they were not fortunate, the employer, left to his own devices, undertrained people and exploited them for years. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are saying now that we want training that provides the skills that will increase productivity and get a better level of quality--and that is what we are about. We are about total quality control. We do not take the view, `Let's get a thousand of these items out the end of the line' and then when we have a look, find that there is a 50 per cent rejection rate. We want a rejection rate of one per cent or less. We want to build quality into the product. We want to build pride into the workmanship of the people who produce the product. That is quite different to the attitude of employers in the past. Some of them are now waking up to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The trade union movement will not cop--and this Government does not expect it to--a situation where only limited training is given. We are happy about additional training, either at the workplace if people have the facilities and the skills, or in institutions such as TAFE. We are saying that when that training is done, it has to be recognised and it has to carry qualifications with it. We do not want the situation of the employers providing the level of training that suits them, but which does not give any rights or any rewards to the workers who have done that training. </PARA>
<PARA>  I return to the question of confrontation in terms of agreement and award making. For years, the employers used to make demands and say, `We want settlement of disputes in our agreement'. I used to look at them with horror and say, `Why would you want that? Why do you not have a prevention of disputes clause in your award? Why do you not put together a process whereby, with consultation, you do not have a dispute?'. That shows that the trade unions had a very positive view; they did not want disputes. Anybody who believes that workers want to go on strike has to be very, very stupid; there is possibly the odd exception. I do not say for one minute that every worker I have ever known or am likely to meet is perfect, totally honest and intelligent. I guess employers also have more than their share of people who do not qualify in that regard. </PARA>

But of course, if Wally Curran is involved in a dispute and the community is affected, everybody wants to come down on Wally. They do not say too much about employers putting kangaroo meat in boxes and sending it overseas and bringing us into disrepute. I have not heard the Liberals or the Nationals going crook about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But again Wally Curran is only one person in the trade union movement. If somebody is seen as giving an opportunity for criticism from those on the other side, they never stop pounding that one person mercilessly. They never want to look at the other side of the ledger where people have actually gone on to the job--and I have actually done it myself--and prevented a strike that employers were too stupid not to let happen. We never hear about that. We always hear of somebody doing something that might not be seen by the community as correct or based in equity or a good case being made by the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have not met an intelligent trade union official, anybody in the Labor Party or anybody in the Government, who does not believe that the community out there is made up of very important people. The Party and the Government want to put into place the sort of legislation which will guarantee continued productivity at the highest possible level. We do not want to inconvenience anybody but rather we want to give recognition and we want to get reasonable wages and reasonable conditions under which to work. The accord, which has been a resounding success, has provided not only that sort of situation but also a fairly subdued demand in terms of wages to the extent that, as a result, labour costs have been reduced by some 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, the Party and the Government want to put in place legislation which will provide for that sort of continuous production and prosperity in the community. The trade unions themselves also want a position where their members can work constantly, consistently and in reasonable conditions. There is no way that they want confrontation or disputes because their members only lose money. That is not a very smart way to operate. </PARA>
<PARA>  But if there is an issue such as the workers being attacked by unscrupulous employers--supported by an unthinking, foolish Liberal Party--then they will stand and fight in a way that will have the least possible effect on the community. That has always been my attitude and the attitude of officials that I have known. Let us consider what is going to happen in terms of community problems; that is, certain services and goods might not be available. Let us try to use every opportunity we can to avoid having a dispute so that we do not have lost time and we do not have to cut off supplies or anything else. That has been our attitude. </PARA>
<PARA>  For so many years trade unions were hoodwinked when asked to leave particular people on a job in a dispute. The employers would use those people to try to defeat the dispute. But we got to the stage where we did not trust them and we used to say, `Sorry, we can make no allowance; everybody comes off the job'. But we did say that we would have somebody available for any emergency, any problem within the workshop when other people were working there or within the community. Quite often those people whom the employers had said were imperative to keep on the job were never asked to do a thing. That was always a dishonest approach by the employers who were trying to take advantage of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know these things because I experienced them. I know the history because I was part of making that history. I did not read it out of books. I did not have somebody ring me up and tell me how I should attack anybody else's opposition. I am very pleased with the statement that the Minister has made. I will continue to work within the trade union movement, with the people that I know and within the Government to enhance a situation we have got where, even though there is a great deal of structural unemployment--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This debate began with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) reading what I can only describe as eight pages of turgid prose which was meant to pass for a ministerial statement. I suppose we can be quite relieved that indeed he did not attempt to do it in Question Time and actually had the decency to do it outside that, unlike Senator Button who went on at great length today. Senator Burns said there might be something that he and I could agree upon. Well there is. He said that there were going to be more than one million unemployed. I certainly agree with the policies of this Government that we are going to see more than one million people who are in unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Looking at the document itself consisting of eight pages of turgid prose--which really says very little, as Senator Bell said earlier on--one could say that the first five pages of it were a sort of preamble which summed up why we have lost production in this country and one could say that it recites strike action and work practices which encourage absenteeism, sick leave and accidents. He tries to argue in the first part of the paper that strikes are not very relevant to lost productivity but that sick leave, accidents and absenteeism are major causes of lost productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister could, of course, have taken the opportunity in this paper to answer the splendid question which Senator Vanstone asked him yesterday and which he was incapable of answering. Her question very simply stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Why has productivity growth in Australia been so dismally low under the various accords?</PARA>
<PARA>In her supplementary question, when Senator Cook had failed to answer her question, she reiterated the point she wanted to have addressed and stated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Do I take it that the Minister denies that productivity growth--GDP per hour--has been markedly less on average under the Hawke Government than it was under the Fraser Government?  Does he deny that it has fallen in six of the last nine quarters?  How does he explain its being so poor compared with the OECD performance?  How does he explain its being so poor compared with the performance of our Asian trading partners?</PARA>
<PARA>Then Senator Vanstone came back to her original question:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . why has productivity growth in Australia been so dismally low if the accord is so good?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook, instead of trying to answer those sensible questions, seems to say that the accord has been the greatest thing since sliced bread; that the Government has done a magnificent job; and the fact that we now have one million people unemployed, a huge international debt and a recession that this Government's policy has engineered is somehow a result of the excellent policies in the economic and industrial relations area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Page 5 of the paper actually says:</PARA>
<PARA>In all the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Government should now express a view. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure we would all be very pleased if the Government really did express a view. But the turgid prose in which this paper is couched or, as my colleagues Senator Walters and, I think, Senator Durack said earlier, the rather strangled language is really a masterpiece of dissembling, because what it is really all about is a reactionary statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one goes through and digs out the odd phrase, one will find that it really means to amend section 115; that it means to create the right to strike; and that it means to abolish sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. In other words, it is aimed at getting rid of common law rights. Senator Cook could have saved us all the trouble by saying what he wanted in three paragraphs, instead of eight pages of diatribe and statements which are dressed up to make it sound reasonable. But be under no illusions; that is what this statement is about. Senator Cook says in his last paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>The system will be reformed so as to accommodate these essential conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>According to him, the essential conditions are to ensure that the framework is changed so that bargaining can be done freely and jointly so as not to damage the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our policy is about having enterprise bargaining which is done freely and without duress. It has the radical concept that employees should actually be allowed to talk to employers without the intervention of third parties to either harass or impede the negotiations. It has the radical thought in it about the ability to negotiate freely, with the existing system remaining in place for those people who wish to remain in it. But, for those people who do not, they have two alternatives. As I said, they can have that magnificent concept of being able to talk to each other and work out something that suits each other with a built-in guarantee in the system that nobody will be exploited. It will also leave in place section 115 agreements so that for those people who like to have an agreement which is registered, such as large corporations who have chosen to use it, it will still be available. But, most importantly, not only will we have freedom in the workplace but also we will have true freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his statement, and indeed in other press releases he has put out, Senator Cook likes to cite the ILO and likes to cite the conventions concerning freedom of association. But true freedom of association also guarantees that we have the freedom not to associate with people with whom we do not wish to be associated. The Government cannot have it both ways. De facto compulsory unionism in this country, as distinct from de jure compulsory trade unionism, has resulted in our industrial relations system being rigid, being unable to attract the right sort of investment and being uncompetitive. It has left us in a situation where we have run up huge international debt. With this tailor-made recession, which was the Government's way of trying to bring down our import bill, we have managed to land a million people out of jobs. That means families who are unable to pay the mortgage; kids who are unable to go to excursions in school; kids who cannot have a new uniform. It means a whole range of hardship being imposed upon 10.2 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Cook has brought down a statement which states that since 1983 the Government, by its reforms, has brought about valuable change. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this statement to the Parliament is to explain how the process will continue. </PARA>
<PARA>If that gives joy to a single constituent, I will be amazed. A continuation of that process means higher unemployment, greater debt, low productivity and basically Australia losing its standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is the Opposition which offers freedom of the workplace and deregulation of the workplace which will make it attractive to investment. This will mean that we will get examples such as we had in the SPC case, where once work practices were changed--because the company was about to go into liquidation-- it brought about huge changes and improvements in productivity. We have seen the examples at Robe River, which Minister Cook likes to try to malign and likes to try to tell this Parliament has been a vexatious litigant. The only trouble is that, when he sets out his facts, he gets them wrong and he misleads this Parliament. Indeed, when we see that the purpose of this statement is to explain how the process will continue, I think that most readers would find a chill in the heart. </PARA>
<PARA>  But as I read on I find other things that raise more questions. I read that the Government has allocated $40m of taxpayers' money to the workplace reform program. How is that money being spent? To whom has the money been allocated for spending? Did it end up in trade union pockets? Where is the accountability for the expenditure? I ask a similar question when I read on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has established the Australian best practice demonstration program. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It states:</PARA>
<PARA>It has allocated $25m to this program. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I would like to see the manner in which it is being expended. If we could achieve a best practice or a best international standard being accepted in the workplace in Australia as what we must and will aspire to, then perhaps that would be a well spent amount of money. But I will be most interested to see the accountability and the accounting for that $25m and the results that flow and are verifiable. I am intrigued by the sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>Only those enterprises which can demonstrate that they are prepared to undertake a comprehensive reform and restructuring program within a reasonable timeframe will be eligible to take part in the scheme and share in its rewards. </PARA>
<PARA>I am interested to know what sorts of criteria will be used to see that the best practice demonstration program achieves anything at all. Senator Cook then goes on in his statement to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Having put the foundations in place, the Government has to consider the structure of the system to be built on them. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the foundations are crumbling. I am afraid the Minister's foundations have been built in the sand. As we go on to look at why it might be built on that foundation, I think it does not augur well for the productivity of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am tempted to say that almost all the contributions today have contained more substance than this paper itself. It does not mean to say that I agree with all the statements that have been made. Certainly, I would not agree with those that have come from across the chamber; nonetheless even Senator Burns had something of substance to say when he pointed out that we are going to have more than one million people unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can only take it that the Minister has decided to bring down this statement as a precursor to a more, shall we say, militant campaign to bring about the things that I said could have been expressed in three paragraphs, that is, his intention to amend section 115 and the way the agreements are registered. The hint to that is given on page 6 where he makes the statement that the IRC should have a role at the entry point of the process of both negotiations and registration of section 115 agreements. He has put out press releases, particularly the one on 2 September which stated that there was a need to have a right to strike. That is obviously buried in this dissembling document, together with his aim of abolishing sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, which the Government tried to do previously but the Democrats had the good sense not to succumb. I am sure that they will hold to that position, or I sincerely hope they will. Of course, the overall aim is to abolish common law rights, which have introduced some fairness into what has been a very unfair system of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose I should not be surprised at the nature of this statement--after all, Senator Cook was the secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Western Australia before he was transposed into the Senate. We have had much cause in this chamber to wonder, when he stands and speaks on industrial relations, whether he speaks as a Minister of the Crown with the interests of all Australians at heart or whether he still speaks with the intransigence of a trade union master, because the power of the trade unions has indeed been very strong. It is only now that we have entered into a new phase where we are seeing a deregulation of the centralised wage fixing system and the devolving of functions onto enterprises so that we can indeed begin to see the hope of freedom in negotiations. We hope that after the imposed recession those people who are left in employment and those one million people who are without jobs and who will still be endeavouring to find them will have the opportunity to work in places where they will have a say in the conditions and the employment terms instead of having them imposed upon them. That is something that many thousands of Australians will look forward to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to speak on the paper entitled Reforming the Industrial Relations System. Upon reading it, one cannot but come to the conclusion that about seven and a half of the eight pages are rhetoric and gobbledegook. It is very unfortunate that a paper of this nature--which fails to address the issues and is full of cliches--has been brought down. I have tried to analyse what it says, and I have come to the conclusion that, firstly, it will amend section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act to make it freer than it is currently. One must say that, under the current system, that is an improvement. But, against that, we also find the intention to introduce the right to strike. The paper is strangely silent on common law and sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, in particular. But, reading between the lines, one can only conclude that they are certainly not off the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to make a few comments about the right to strike. I do so in the context of our Constitution, which expressly states that the Commonwealth has a responsibility to prevent strikes, yet in this paper we see a statement about the right to strike. I would suggest that in fact that is in conflict with our Constitution. How does the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) reconcile the right to strike with his constitutional responsibility?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister spent much time on absenteeism and sickness. Nobody denies that they are important and that they are a cost to industry; but they are State matters. The Minister does not address how he intends to deal with these matters in the context of the required negotiations with the State governments. Once again, the paper falls short in this area. The next point I come to in this area--it is very similar to the national wage case--is that we are currently awaiting the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with regard to the future of wage fixing policy. Why has the Government introduced this at this time?  Does the Government intend to pre-empt the decision of its own Industrial Relations Commission?  I have often been critical of the Commission in this place but, nonetheless, it is the Government's policy to have an Industrial Relations Commission. Will the Government agree with the recommendations which come from the current inquiry only if they happen to agree with the Government's position?  I believe that is a very valid question which should be answered by the Government. Why waste taxpayers' money going through the process of having these inquiries if the decision has been made already?</PARA>
<PARA>  I now turn to productivity. I have searched this document--albeit not as thoroughly as I would have liked--and I have found the words `productivity' or `production' have been mentioned only three times. Following what Senator Bishop said about Senator Vanstone's question and the answer we received yesterday, it would seem to me that, in reforming the industrial relations policy, it is absolutely essential and imperative that the issue of productivity be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have already mentioned sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. I think it is now incumbent upon the Minister to make a clear statement as to exactly where the Government stands on this issue. One would have thought, in view of his previous comments, that it would have been addressed this time. In terms of industrial relations policy, it is very important that common law rights apply in all parts--not just selected parts--of society. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will now touch on a number of points in the paper. I turn to the statement which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Accord between the ACTU and the Government has been enormously beneficial in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA>I say, as I have said before, that the accord has promoted mediocrity. What has been produced while the accord has been in place?  Let us analyse it. There has been a blow-out in our national debt of some $110 billion net. From a figure of just over $20 billion--which we reached 82 years after Federation--it has reached in the order of $135 billion net in just eight more years. What has the Government done about productivity?  That matter has already been touched upon and I will not dwell on it, but it came out very clearly in Senator Vanstone's question yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>  What else has the accord produced?  A recession we had to have according to the former Treasurer. Yesterday, while overseas, the Treasurer made the statement that this is the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have record unemployment and record bankruptcies. I believe it is totally irresponsible for the Minister to write in a paper:</PARA>
<PARA>The accord between the ACTU and the Government has been enormously beneficial in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA>Just ask those people who have had to pay record interest rates; ask those people who are unemployed and those people who are bankrupt. Think for a moment of our children and our grandchildren who will have to repay the debt we now have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We now move to the top of page 3 and find this extraordinary statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The 1991 Australian workplace industrial relations survey--the most comprehensive, up-to-date survey available--found that 72 per cent of workplaces had never had any industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a totally predictable statement because 80 per cent of union members are employed by the top 100 companies in this country and only approximately 33 per cent of employees are members of a union. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must comment on the words `ideological marginalia'. Like honourable senators on the other side of the chamber, I do not understand what it means. We have asked a number of them and they do not understand, and I doubt whether Senator Faulkner knows what it means. The definition in the dictionary is, `marginal notes'. When that definition in used in place of the word `marginalia' it does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to page 4 of the statement, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has established the Australian Best Practice Demonstration Program as a catalyst in this process. It has allocated $25 million to this program which is designed to illustrate the productivity gains . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Robe River. In four years it has had a 320 per cent increase in productivity. Why are we not looking at those companies and those operations in Australia that have increased their productivity?  Why are we not introducing the reforms that they have made so we can get them across the board?  We can then start producing real wealth; we can start producing jobs, because jobs flow from wealth; and we can start producing profits. If we are going to overcome unemployment, we must have profit, we must have incentive and we must have reward in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Robe River has been described by the Minister as a vexatious litigant. I remind the Senate that for every appeal that it has made there has been an application lodged first. Robe River has been the catalyst for the reform of the iron ore industry in Western Australia, including such companies as Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd. Robe River Mining overcame the problem of work practices--there were in excess of 250 removed--and the problems of weak management. It now has stability in employment. We have had some debate in this place with respect to the situation of Cape Lambert Services and West Tug. When the Seamen's Union went on strike over that particular issue, not one employee of Robe River supported it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to Senator Cook's answer to me today. I will put the documentation down when I am ready. I am also giving him the opportunity to correct his mistakes. Page 5 of the document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia have both recently put forward reform proposals . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is indeed true. It is also worth noting that they have both rejected the accord. The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, accord mark VI committed the Government and the unions in February last year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Since the Government has adopted its position, how many unions have taken the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, taken the 2.5 per cent, and got on with the job?  How much time has been lost as a result of those unions that did not and took industrial action to try to get the provisions of accord mark VI put in place?  A classic example of this exists in the meat industry, particularly in Victoria. I will deal with that at a later time in another speech. The document further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Workplace agreements should be reached fairly and freely. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody will argue with that. The difference between the policy position of the Opposition and that of the Government is that an individual or a small group of individuals will not have the right to negotiate fairly and freely under the Government's policy. It is a very fundamental difference. They will not have that right under the Government's policy. They will under the Opposition's policy. They can choose for themselves--once again freedom--whether they want to be represented by a union or by an industrial advocate. Similarly, the employer can choose whether he wants to be represented by his employer organisation or represent himself. That is what freedom is all about. Page 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>There should be no industrial action during the life of the agreement over matters that are the subject of the agreement. Equally, the parties should, subject to reasonable conditions, be able to have resort to certain forms of industrial action in periods of negotiating new workplace agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the right to strike proposals come in. Once again, I pose several questions. Is the Government going to legislate for no industrial action during the life of the agreement?  Is the Government going to legislate for the right to strike while negotiating new workplace agreements?  Is it going to legislate in total to cover all situations?  This document is not clear on that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Page 7 also refers to the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the ILO Convention No. 87, which allows for freedom of association for individuals or small groups. There is no restriction on numbers. They can be whatever size they want to be. More importantly, the report from the ILO Committee of Experts is subject to employer redress in 1992. In other words, it is an overview. The Minister, in hanging his argument for the necessity of these changes on that, is pre-empting the outcome of that overview. The last page states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been consulting widely on this issue for some time, particularly in the National Labour Consultative Council . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Who are the members of the Labour Consultative Council? The Confederation of Australian Industry and the ACTU. Those who are not members of the Labour Consultative Council include the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Chamber of Manufactures, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the Australian Bankers Association and the Australian Road Transport Industry Association, to name but a few. They are very important employer organisations in their own right. I have no doubt that there will be unions which are not members of the ACTU. If there are, where will their input come from?</PARA>
<PARA>  This paper falls far short of what is required in addressing the various aspects of industrial relations policy in Australia: in productivity; where people are unfortunate enough not to have a job; and where people are on the brink of bankruptcy who could, with proper policies, become strong employers. We have consistently heard from Government senators about exploitation of workers. What absolute nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA>  I will not deny that in the last century and beyond workers were exploited. However, under our policy, workers still have the option to remain in the centralised system, but they also have total freedom to negotiate as individuals or groups with or without the support of their union or their employer organisation. Surely, that is what voluntary unionism and ILO Convention No. 87 are all about. </PARA>
<PARA>  This ministerial statement could have been summarised succinctly in one page. Then we would all have been a lot better off and had a much clearer direction of where he is going. I re-emphasise that the statement does not address the problems of absenteeism and sickness in the workplace. The Minister does not spell out how he will tackle this problem with the States. The statement puts in place this determinant of the right to strike. That is in conflict with Australia's Constitution. The Minister should look carefully at what he is doing as a Minister by bringing before this place such a recommendation which is in conflict with the Constitution of this great country of ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This statement by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has brought praise from the Government and some condemnation from the Opposition. That is to be expected because it is on industrial relations, perhaps more than any other issue, that the parties in this place differ. It comes down to a concept of what one makes or does not make of people and what the reality of life is or is not. For example, the presumption that people are always in an equal bargaining position goes against experience and the sorts of provisions that we have in the law. Even the Trade Practices Act contains a provision that talks about unconscionable conduct. Senator Crane said that all the problems in the workplace have now gone and this is no longer the nineteenth century. It is certainly not the nineteenth century, but there are still plenty of problems in the workplace in the twentieth century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I quote as evidence for that assertion the actions that used to be brought under section 119 of what was the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which is now the Industrial Relations Act. My family eats a better quality dinner on Sunday than it otherwise would because we went to the Federal Court and sued for wages owed to people who worked in all sorts of industries. That sort of action was quite common in the courts. It illustrates the difficulties in the workplace and that there are still ongoing problems in the employer-employee relationship. A proper balance has to be established. It is true the employer can be harsh with the employee and the employee can be harsh with the employer, but some sort of system has to be set up--the sort of system that can be examined again and again as a result of changing relationships and new provisions being needed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the ministerial statement, the Minister has set out a basis for debate. He has done that successfully; what we have had today is a debate. There are some problems about some concepts that have been put forward today: for example, the question of freedom of bargaining, that people should have the freedom to choose how they go about things and that an employer should be able to negotiate with an employee on equal terms. On some occasions a person might have a rare skill. For example, if that person was a doctor who had a particular knowledge of some sort of pharmaceutical product that a company wanted and needed, the doctor would be in a very strong position to negotiate a good agreement. However, if a person did not have such a skill or had skills that are plentiful, that person would be in a weak bargaining position unless that person proceeded as part of a group or a union. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a statement that is worth putting into the debate. It is a statement that small nations used when they were approaching the more powerful nations in the United Nations--`It is just as unjust to treat unequals as equals as it is to treat equals as unequals'. Unfortunately, there is a tendency in this debate to treat unequals as equals. That can have a devastating effect, especially on people who want to offer themselves for work and who cannot find it in today's market and also on people who, if they were alone, would be tempted to accept poor conditions and wages. That does happen; it is happening in the community at the moment. We have inspectors under the Act to ensure adherence to awards. The fact that those inspectors find breaches of awards from time to time is a strong indication of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also want to talk about the accord. It has been blamed today for the economic disasters the country is undergoing. Senator Crane said it was the cause of all our bankruptcies and high inflation and unemployment rates. At least we have identified what the Opposition sees as the cause of all our economic problems. I am interested to learn that. I should have thought there might have been other causes such as low world commodity prices; the European community and America throwing their grain on the world markets for next to nothing; the conduct of the financial institutions during the 1980s; and the rate of our imports compared with our exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have been assured by inference that none of those things have caused our problems; that the only cause for the financial disaster of this country is the accord. No doubt Senator Crane did not have time to produce the evidence, but it will be interesting to see how he and his colleagues in the Opposition produce the evidence that the one cause of Australia's economic problems is the accord. </PARA>
<PARA>  The right to strike has also been mentioned. Whether or not one agrees with that right, Australia, in effectively not allowing the right to strike, stands in isolation. There is a right to strike in England. There is a right to strike even in New Zealand. The fact that there is no such right here ought to be discussed, hopefully with some result. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sections 45D and 45E have been discussed. I always find it difficult to reconcile those sections being in an Act of Parliament which has everything to do with consumer protection and with the encouragement of competition in the marketplace. It is strange that there should be two sections in the Act--sections 45D and 45E--which are aimed not at protecting competition in the marketplace, and not at consumer protection but at a specific process. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should be of concern to people in this chamber that we have an Act of Parliament, the Trade Practices Act, which has these sections awkwardly put in. Those two sections are awkward because, as I say, they punish conduct as distinct from the rest of the Act, which does not punish conduct but protects competition and consumers. Why we should disturb the symmetry of the Act by doing that, I am not sure. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, if the sections are to be in legislation at all they should be in legislation other than the Trade Practices Act. They should be in a comprehensive set of legislation which gives some logical sense to where they are put. Of course, if they are put in a piece of legislation that deals with relationships in the workplace where there is a particular process of carrying them out, that would constitute some offence, although I will be arguing over the next few months--subject, of course, to being convinced otherwise--that they are the sorts of sections that would be better out of the industrial relations field altogether. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Crane also spoke about common law. He spoke of that as something that is sacrosanct. Of course, it is not. The very evidence that it is not sacrosanct is the fact that we, day after day, legislate in here and State parliaments legislate in their respective States to modify it in some way. </PARA>

In this area, in the area where the common law deals with industrial relationships, there are unhappy legacies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to speak very briefly in this debate on the statement on reforming the industrial relations systems by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). I had not intended to, but I am prompted by remarks made by my colleague Senator Cooney. He raised the question of whether people on this side think that the whole problem of Australia's economy is the accord--and that that is the only problem--the implication being that everyone thinks that. I think Senator Cooney has misunderstood the argument that has been put. I would like to put some points to Senator Cooney that he might like to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first point is this: the accord is not responsible for everything that is wrong with the Australian economy, but it is responsible for restricting Australian workers and employers in being able to get together and make negotiated agreements amongst themselves that we say would result in greater productivity than can possibly result from the current centralised system. That is why we say that on coming to office we will change the system to allow those people who want to stay in the centralised system to do so and those who want to shift out to do that and, therefore, make much more productive agreements. We say that that is what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I was first elected to this chamber the Government said that enterprise bargaining was totally out--it was just not acceptable and it would never move down that track. What I have seen in the 6 1/2 years that I have been here is a slow progression towards the coalition's industrial relations policy. This is just another step in that direction. I have full confidence that it will not be long before our policy is implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also want to refer to the first page of the Minister's statement and the fourth paragraph, in which he says that one of the problems with the debate in this area is that it focuses attention on the amount of working time lost. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. That is not the only aspect one wants to consider. Many people have made contributions in that respect during this debate, pointing out that time lost is not lost only through disputes or bans. An enormous amount of time is lost through industrial accidents. I have a particular interest in that area because of my own interest in drug testing in the workplace, and the problems that legal and illegal drugs contribute towards absenteeism and accidents in the workplace.  I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister goes on to say that paying attention to the working time lost is a mistake if we do not look at how productive the time is that we spend at work. That was exactly the point that I put to the Minister yesterday in a question, and exactly the point that he was incapable of answering. I asked him: why has this Government put wage restraint through the accord on Australian workers yet failed to implement the other policies? It has failed to implement not only a changed industrial relations system but also other policies that would allow productivity to improve. </PARA>
<PARA>  One needs only to look at the fact that, of the last nine quarters, six have had a negative productivity growth. The average productivity growth under the Hawke Government has been significantly worse than during the Fraser years. If the Minister is interested in how productive the time we spend at work is, he should have something to say about why the system that this Government has implemented has resulted in a fall-off in that sense, because average growth in productivity is not as good. </PARA>
<PARA>  If one compares us with OECD countries one sees that the situation is not attractive at all. The productivity growth that they have achieved between 1983 and 1990 is almost double the productivity growth that this nation has achieved. If one does not want to compare us with OECD nations, one can compare us with the Asian nations that we trade with, such as the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong. One would see that, while we have been struggling to get up to, say, 4 per cent productivity growth over a limited period, they have been booming ahead with productivity growth at 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is the question that this Government needs to answer. If it is so wedded to the accord, why has the industrial relations system under the accord not produced greater productivity? One answer is that it is not flexible enough. The other answer is that the Government has steadfastly failed and refused to introduce the other policies that might allow wage restraint under the accord to be turned into productivity growth. </PARA>

<PARA>  The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report of the Committee entitled Report on the Visit of the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA>In July the Defence Sub-Committee inspected defence facilities in the Adelaide area. These inspections were made in accordance with the tradition of the Defence Sub-Committee of conducting familiarisation visits for its Members. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sub-Committee visited RAAF Edinburgh where it was briefed on the surveillance role of the Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft, the P3C Orions. The visit afforded Members the opportunity to gain first hand knowledge on the Patrol's search and rescue function. Members were able to gain some appreciation of the equipment used in carrying out search and rescue, particularly in light of the attempted rescue of the crew of the yacht Rockin' Robin last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Through the discussions with the Commander Maritime Patrol Group Air Commodore Staff James AFC we were also able to obtain a better understanding of the events surrounding the loss of the Orion aircraft in the Cocos Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>The visit fulfilled its aim of keeping Members up-to-date with developments in technology in Defence equipment. The Sub-Committee inspected a P3C Orion at RAAF Edinburgh where it was briefed on the aircraft's computer-based sensor system, the Barra Sonobuoy and the AGM-84 Harpoon. This was complemented by a briefing at DSTO on the project for the refurbishment of the Orion. </PARA>
<PARA>At RAAF Edinburgh we were also interested to ascertain the percentages of aircraft undergoing maintenance and `on line' at any given time. We gained a clearer understanding of the nature of the maintenance program and of the tests conducted on, for example, the F/A-18 Hornet and the Black Hawk helicopter by the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). </PARA>
<PARA>During the visit to DSTO we were briefed on the impact of the Force Structure Review on DSTO and the approach adopted by the Organisation to accommodate the changes to their operations. </PARA>
<PARA>We also received briefings on a number of major projects in train at DSTO such as DORIC, the KARIWARA Towed Array Project and the support provided by DSTO to Operation DAMASK during the Gulf War. We were also interested in DSTO's task of adapting the RBS 70 for shipboard use, particularly as our visit to Adelaide included an inspection of the RBS 70 at Woodside Barracks. </PARA>
<PARA>At Woodside the Sub-Committee appreciated the opportunity to inspect closely both the RBS 70 Missile System and the Rapier Fire Unit which had been set up for the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Sub-Committee are concerned that the limited numbers of Rapiers held by 110 Air Defence Battery are insufficient to defend more than one vital asset or one airfield in northern Australia at a given time. </PARA>
<PARA>We were also concerned to learn that the numbers of missiles available for use by 110 Battery are inadequate for proving the ability of the equipment to fire. </PARA>
<PARA>We were told that 111 Air Defence Battery (Light) also suffers from receiving insufficient numbers of RBS 70 missiles for proving their equipment--the Battery receives an allocation of only 6 missiles per year. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst in Adelaide we inspected the Submarine Project at the Australian Submarine Corporation's plant at Osborne. The inspection complemented another element of the Sub-Committee's program, that is, of receiving briefings on aspects of Defence or Defence support at our regular meetings in Canberra. Earlier this year the Managing Director of the Submarine Corporation had addressed Members on the Submarine Project. We were therefore interested to monitor progress on the construction of the submarine fleet. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the visit provided Members of the Sub-Committee with opportunities for informal discussions with Defence Force personnel. One such occasion was arranged at Keswick Barracks where discussions with Regular and Reserve personnel from Headquarters 4 Military District, 9 Brigade and 4 Training Group proved most productive. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Debate (on motion by Senator Tate) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA>  The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled Australia's Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt, together with the minutes of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The report contains not only an excellent description and analysis of Australia's position with regard to its current account deficit and overseas debt, but considers issues that go to the heart of the economic policy debate in Australia. Its recommendations are designed to comprehensively address the current account deficit in ways which would also reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>Current account deficits have been a feature of most of Australia's economic history. Over the 1980s, however, there was a marked increase in the relative size of that deficit. At the beginning of the decade, the deficit was less than 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By the end of the decade, it had risen to around 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also a radical change in the nature of the current account deficit over the 1980s. At the beginning of the decade the current account deficit reflected primarily a trade deficit; by the end of the decade the current account deficit was overwhelmingly dominated by our foreign debt servicing obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>By international standards, Australia's current account deficit of GDP is amongst the highest of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country. </PARA>
<PARA>The current account deficit fell to 4 per cent in 1990-91 and the recent continued decline is heartening. The improvement in Australia's export performance, particularly in relation to the growth in manufacturing exports, is most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA>The decline in imports, however, has been marginal and the situation concerning our debt servicing obligations and other income payments overseas has improved to an even smaller degree, despite the severity of the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Committee is concerned that the current account deficit will again return to high levels as Australia comes out of the recession. Unless concerted action is taken to address the underlying causes of Australia's high current account deficit, imports and foreign investment in Australia are likely to return to pre-recession levels. </PARA>
<PARA>There is considerable risk that Australia could become complacent about the current account deficit because of the reduction in its size over the past year. It must be remembered, however, that it has taken a very severe recession to halt the growth in imports and further declines in imports cannot be expected once the recession eases. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's overseas debt also grew sharply during the 1980s, increasing more than tenfold to over $145 billion by 1989. It now stands at $165 billion--almost 44 per cent of GDP. While Australia's overseas debt has not yet reached the crisis proportions evident in some countries, it would certainly do so by the end of the l990s, if its debt accumulation were to continue unabated at the rate we have experienced, particularly in the mid-eighties. </PARA>
<PARA>In responding to the problems identified in the report, the Committee has rejected the calls made in some quarters for a return to protectionist policies and regulatory controls. In our view, such a course of action would only serve to reduce Australia's ability to adjust to changing global circumstances. Ultimately, a failure to make the necessary adjustments would reduce the living standards of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally, the Committee has rejected the view that the growing current account deficit and overseas debt is no longer a problem requiring government action, as this debt has been largely incurred by the private sector which is responsible for its repayment. </PARA>
<PARA>While those who have incurred the debt are individually responsible for its servicing and repayment, there can be no question that Australia's vulnerability to global economic changes will be greater if debt accumulation continues unabated. </PARA>
<PARA>The market has clearly failed to respond to the situation. In the Committee's view, in the interests of efficiency and equity, it is therefore up to government to take the lead. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Committee has recommended a package of proposals designed to comprehensively address Australia's current account and overseas debt problems. The three main thrusts to these proposals are: :</PARA>
<PARA>  to improve Australia's international trading performance through further reductions in tariff and other universal protectionist measures, while at the same time implementing a comprehensive package of positive measures to assist the development of Australia's export and import replacement industries, particularly those adding value to our exports;</PARA>
<PARA>  to introduce a range of measures designed to increase domestic savings and reduce Australia's reliance on overseas borrowings to finance investment; and</PARA>
<PARA>  to put in place a set of appropriate macroeconomic policy settings and necessary microeconomic reforms that are consistent with lowering the current account deficit and the level of overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Amongst these are recommendations that real interest rates be reduced so as to encourage investment and a fall in the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA>I am confident that, if implemented, the Committee's recommendations will create the climate and conditions necessary to bring about substantial and sustained reductions in Australia's current account deficit and the level of our overseas debt. I urge the Government to quickly accept and implement the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>This inquiry was carried out by the Trade Sub-Committee and I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Sub-Committee for their contribution to this challenging task--particularly the Chairman, Mr Langmore, the Members for Berowra, Reid and New England and Senators Chapman, Beahan and Childs. </PARA>
<PARA>I also wish to thank the staff associated with the inquiry--Jane Vincent, the Secretary to the Sub-Committee, our advisers Greg Barrett, Tom Fitzgerald and especially Chris Robinson for his excellent analysis and drafting, Margaret Brown who provided administrative support and Jennifer Blood who took over as Secretary towards the end. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to Honourable Senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was intending to speak on the report of the Trade Subcommittee this evening. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we were still discussing the industrial relations statement. We then had to deal with Government papers. I came into the chamber at about three minutes past eight and found that we had already gone past the report of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. What is going on in this place?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--The report of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade investigating Australia's current account deficit and overseas debt targets issues which are crucial to our national economic policy. I want to take only a few brief moments this evening on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Firstly, in speaking to the report, I thank all the Committee staff who were involved with us in very lengthy hearings and who contributed to the smooth operation of this inquiry. The inquiry was somewhat drawn out and involved and was conducted over about 18 months. Nevertheless, the proceedings were conducted very professionally. There were wide-ranging submissions--some 72 in total--which had to be considered in reaching the conclusions contained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that those submissions reflected very real, although broad, community concerns about our hefty overseas debt and the country's massive current account deficit. The conclusions and recommendations of the report do not have the full support of the Opposition members of the Trade Subcommittee or, indeed, of the full Joint Committee. As a consequence, we have produced our own minority report, which appears between pages 141 and 153 of the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of the 25 main recommendations adopted by the Committee and contained in this report, only recommendations Nos. 1 and 8 have the support of the Opposition members. Recommendation No. 1 deals with the explicit taking account of the objective of reducing the current account deficit and the level of overseas debt and recommendation No. 8 relates to the introduction of an anti-dumping and countervailing duty system to ensure that Australian industries are fully protected from unfair import competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, we do not believe that the remaining recommendations in this report are at all a suitable response to the issues that were under reference. In the view of the Opposition members, Australia urgently needs a comprehensive and complete program of policy reform to effect fundamental change to boost national production, productivity, savings and exports. This report does not sufficiently emphasise those issues and those requirements. As Deputy Chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, I want to reinforce the fact that our minority report, although it is brief, does include an extract from the current Treasury Budget Paper No. 1. We say of this in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . examines developments in the 1980s and puts the case for relating economic policy more to the medium term and spells out a comprehensive package of policy and reform, notably labour market and micro economic reform--to which we would add tax reform--to achieve sustained low inflation, economic and employment growth, rising living standards and--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress this--</PARA>
<PARA>a reducing current account deficit, as specified in the terms of reference. It stresses the importance of making significant progress simultaneously on all these policy concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have two key difficulties in supporting this document in toto. They relate first to its inadequate underlying analytical framework. We believe that there is an excess of specific information on specific areas, such as merchandise trade, but a lack of information on other areas such as productivity. Secondly, there is difficulty in regard to the general questions that are often asked by people concerned about foreign debt which we believe were not effectively or efficiently addressed in the inquiry. I refer to questions such as, `What actually brought about the large and rapid increase in the nation's indebtedness over the past eight to 10 years?' and `It is said that because a large proportion of the debt is private rather than public that overseas debt is not a problem. Is this a proper view?'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such questions are commonly asked by people in the community about our foreign debt, yet they were not adequately addressed in this report. That is why we do not fully endorse its contents. Too much is left unanswered and unaddressed in the conclusions and recommendations. There is insufficient attention to detail with regard to the medium to longer term. We believe that this can best be addressed by specific reform agendas. </PARA>
<PARA>  As we say in our minority report, Australia urgently needs an across the board program of reform to effect fundamental change. We need growth in gross domestic product of 3 1/4 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent in the medium term to take up some of the existing unemployment in Australia. With imports increasing at much the same rate, there is a need for a sustained increase in exports of the order of $4 billion each year for five to six years in order to effect the necessary transfer of resources to net exports and thus reduce the deficit to the more normal level of 2 1/2 per cent of GDP. We require that to happen if we are to stabilise the debt; that is, our net foreign liabilities to the ratio of gross domestic product. That will not allow us to reduce the foreign debt; it will simply allow us to stabilise it at about its present level. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to recognise that Australia has never before in its history achieved such a sustained transfer of gross domestic product and net growth into exports. That is an indication of massive challenge that this country faces if we are to do anything about the problem of foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to reinforce the message, which is worth repeating and is emphasised in our minority report, that we need across the board programs of fundamental reform and changes if Australia's economy is to emerge in a healthy state in the coming decades. A reform that is required most importantly is that of the labour market. The pace of reform on the waterfront still remains inadequate. Reform is also required in land transport and in the tax system, which the coalition is committed to reform with its proposal for a goods and services tax and substantial income tax reductions--and so the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need a government that will not place obstacles to manufacturing or trade in our path. We must look much harder at the medium to longer term, not just to the short term, in terms of policy decisions. Each time a government interferes in our economy or in business activity it creates obstacles which make it increasingly difficult for growth and change. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the past few years we have all been reminded of the great difficulties that macro-economic policy faces when economic events are unusually difficult to predict, where economic trends are not easily discernible and where policy responses operate with substantial and uncertain lags. Those circumstances will always confront in varying degree an internationally open economy such as Australia. This points to the advantages of relating policy more to the medium term and assigning policy instruments to their area of greater effectiveness. Such a framework would entail a close consideration of all aspects of monetary policy, fiscal policy and wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to overcome the problems that are effectively detailed in this report we do not need the sort of interventionist approach that is recommended in the majority report. We need an approach which will remove impediments and obstacles to business and economic activity and which will enable this economy to produce efficiently and productively, as it will be capable of doing if those obstacles are removed, so that we can stabilise the debt which has developed to great proportions over the time that this Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the report to the Senate with the reservations that I have highlighted. In particular, I commend the minority report and hope that it will bring about a wider understanding of these issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to say a few brief words on the Australian Research Council Awards report 1991. In this report are detailed grants made to tertiary education institutions by the Australian Research Council largely under the aegis of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Its charter ensures that funds are spread adequately through the higher education sector across disciplines to establish, in the words of the Council, `a broad research base in Australia'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats fully support this concept. Whilst it is clear that the innovations, technological advantages and scientific breakthroughs going on at our universities are an important element of helping to improve our international competitiveness and agricultural productivity, it is essential that a diverse research program be pursued in tandem with seeking to meet so-called national goals and priorities established by government policy. Research projects should not be rejected on the grounds that they fail some long or short term financial criteria or that there is no perceived economic benefit to Australia as a whole. Science, technology and development research is all very well but should not be pursued at the expense of the humanities and social sciences, which help improve the quality of life and add valuable insights into the history, function and nature of human relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, I highlight the relatively small growth in the size of budgetary allocations for Australian postgraduate research awards outlined in the report. An amount of $38.2m was expended in 1990 and has increased to $42.7m in 1991, representing a 12 per cent increase in funding. I note that the Government offered 1,000 new awards this year, an increase of 100 on 1990, which is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, this in no way meets the demand for these scholarships. Nearly 4,000 of our best and brightest undergraduates applied for postgraduate scholarships this year, an increase of nearly 25 per cent on 1990 applications. The selection criteria is extremely high and narrow. Many students with very good grades simply do not bother applying because they know that they will not get a place. If we are going to foster university research and become in some measure the clever country, the Government must consider increasing the Budget allocations for postgraduate scholarships in real terms next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is tremendously encouraging and a great tribute to our higher education institutions to read of the enormous diversity of research currently in progress across the country. This report contains a staggering wealth of information about these projects and details of how each program will add to the body of knowledge at the local and international levels. It is worth noting that in some research fields, such as the biological sciences, Australia is a world leader. These efforts and talents should be fostered and encouraged by government. </PARA>
<PARA>  In particular, I draw the Senate's attention to a number of archaeological projects which have received ARC grants this year. In addition to projects conducted in Australia, universities send archaeological missions to Italy, Turkey, Syria, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Jordan. Australia has a long and distinguished history of active archaeological activity in many of these places, research which has helped add significantly to the body of knowledge of the ancient world. Significantly, the presence of local teams overseas has helped to foster bilateral relations between Australia and these countries. Indeed, this has been recognised by the Government with the awarding of the Order of Australia to Professor Alexander Cambitoglou and Professor Basil Hennessy, of the University of Sydney, for services to archaeology and international relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thanks to an ARC grant, Professor Hennessy is once again about to lead a team to the site of Pella in Jordan after an hiatus of work caused by the Gulf war. This site is recognised as one of the richest and most important sites in all of Jordan, with habitation material in  its  environs  dating  to  12,000 BC and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>  This report is at the cutting edge of the clever country. The Democrats take the view that all learning is of value and not just that which can be quantified in financial and economic terms. It is to be hoped that those who criticise humanities and liberal arts education and who condemned a number of these research grants as a waste of money will not gain undue influence over research funding which would undoubtedly see quality of life issues sacrificed at the altar of economic rationalism. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Australian Democrats support the broad thrust of the discussion paper entitled TAFE in the 1990s: Developing Australia's Skills produced by the Employment and Skills Formation Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. It is imperative for Australia's economic future that the proportion of young people attending post-secondary education in Australia should increase, as has been the case in the world's most successful export economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Sadly, the report acknowledges that `at the present time participation by the 15 to 64 age group in TAFE is declining'. This is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>  The paper goes on to indicate some reasons for this unacceptable situation. It states that `governments' attitudes to resourcing TAFE are anomalous and unsatisfactory'. I can only agree with this statement as it is in my home State of New South Wales that some of the most unsatisfactory anomalies are present. For example, the New South Wales Government has mismanaged TAFE funding to the extent that last year's budget has blown out by $60m, with no benefit whatsoever to staff or students and no increase in enrolments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VC5">Senator SOWADA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is indeed a Liberal government. Even worse is the prospect that this year's budget will be reduced as a consequence of last year's overspending, with a resulting decline in student numbers. This has come about because of the New South Wales Government's ideological commitment to overpaid, top heavy bureaucracies, which has found expression in its restructuring of TAFE organisations in that State. The unbudgeted $60m was spent almost entirely on increases in salaries for middle and top level managers under the Greiner Government's wasteful Special Executive Service scheme, with the effect that expensive new hierarchies of administrators have grown and prospered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  No benefits have trickled down to the teachers and students who are supposedly the reason for TAFECOM's existence. The inevitable cutbacks will hurt enrolments and courses while leaving the bureaucratic empires created under the then State Minister, Mr Fahey, unscathed. Such are the problems facing TAFE as it enters the 1990s under State administration. The discussion paper also notes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while women constitute 67 per cent of total TAFE enrolments, they form only 41 per cent of enrolments in. . . vocational streams. . . This compounds the disadvantage many women face in labour market participation or progression. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is heartening to read that this problem is being confronted in the National Plan of Action for Women in TAFE, which seeks to `provide a more nationally consistent approach to equal opportunity for women in TAFE'. The report also recognises `an urgent need to increase women's participation in engineering, building, rural and horticultural study areas'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The under-representation of Aboriginal people in TAFE courses is also addressed in this paper. This deficiency in the system will be addressed by the use of Aboriginal access courses that teach life skills as well as focus on English and mathematics leading to TAFE diploma or higher education study. </PARA>
<PARA>  Overall, the discussion paper seeks to create greater coordination between industry and industrial education in the context of greater participation by school leavers and mature students in the further education system. As we move towards a century which is likely to be dominated by a fiercely competitive transnational information economy, the quality of technical and further education available to Australians will be an essential factor in assuring our continued prosperity and security. It is to be hoped that the discussion paper now before this chamber will act as a catalyst for the necessary changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Senate is considering the report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on a national strategy for rural Australians. The Board was given a reference to identify achievement and gaps in rural education and training and to propose possible initiatives. The overall conclusion by the Board is far from reassuring. In the report it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The provision of post-compulsory education and training in and for non-metropolitan Australians remains uneven and inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the report identifies more gaps than achievements and the Board is deeply concerned that, if Australia is to have an education and training led economic recovery and is to become a truly clever country, it can ill afford to permit discrimination against one-third of the nation's labour force in terms of access to education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report identifies three major gaps: participation by rural young people in senior secondary schooling, particularly those living in remote areas; participation by the 15- to 29-year-old age group in higher education and TAFE apprenticeship and trainee training; and participation by the adult rural work force in skills training and reskilling. A number of reasons are included in the report. One is that non-metropolitan Australia has proportionally higher concentrations of demographic groupings which are under-represented generally in education and training. For example, three-quarters of the number of Aborigines live in non-metropolitan areas; unemployment figures are higher; there are more early school leavers and more low income earners; and there are more limited employment opportunities. This suggests that there is a high proportion of doubly disadvantaged people in rural areas. However, the Board has decided that the single most significant factor in the lower participation rates is the obvious one--lack of access to facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Board recognises that there have been major attempts in the past to increase the participation rates of rural Australians in education and training, but they have proved to be only marginally effective overall. There is a high degree of agreement that the central issue of rural participation in education and training requires a coordinated national approach. Therefore, the Board makes certain recommendations as an initial step towards a coordinated national response to addressing the situation which can be summarised as follows: that a national rural education and training coordinating committee be established to develop a national strategy for rural education and training; that new guidelines be developed for Austudy assistance schemes for rural students; and that the levels and types of skills training and accreditation required for the rural work force be studied. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, these recommendations are really calling for yet another committee and for more proposals rather than for specific action. However, the report is valuable for the information it provides on the causes and the extent of the problem. I commend the report to all honourable senators since all have some responsibility for rural areas in their own States. </PARA>

I can assure honourable senators that it was an experience I will never forget. I only wish that more members of parliament from this august body could have the opportunity to go to the United Nations. It has definitely broadened my horizons.

<PARA>  I was hoping that Senator Jones would speak first tonight because he was our leader at the mission.

<PARA>  Living and working in New York was an experience. Work would start at about 8.30 every morning and would not finish until quite late into the night. We would read the cables and have our chance to make a big input to the mission. Sometimes our ideas were taken on board by the permanent members and sometimes we were told that we needed a little more experience in foreign affairs. When Senator Evans was there, we had some quite interesting exchanges around the table. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some outstanding events were taking place when we were at the United Nations. One of them was the children's summit, when 70 heads of state, for the first time ever, congregated in the one place to discuss the plight of children around the world and to make sure that they put forward their point of view. In our joint report we point out that Margaret Thatcher made a very good speech and stressed the importance of the family unit. This, she suggested, could be used as the basis for solving children's problems around the world. We both concurred in that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had an opportunity to speak at the United Nations on numerous occasions. I think Senator Jones spoke four or five times and I spoke four or five times. We spoke on a variety of subjects, from world debt through to the Decade of the Disabled, human rights issues and the like. Another highlight was when the Security Council moved resolution 678, which was only the fourth time in history that foreign Ministers from member nations of the Security Council came to give their nations' views around the table. Shevardnadze put forward the position for the USSR, and it is sad that he is not still at the forefront of Soviet politics.  What a change there has been over the past year or so in the UN and the job it has had to do. On World Food Day, the theme was that space has been conquered but poverty has still not been conquered. That was also quite a big event. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our report states our points of view very clearly. We have some suggestions at the end of the report which I will leave Senator Jones to expand on when he speaks. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to discuss the report of the Australian Education Council Review Committee entitled Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training, otherwise known as the Finn review. This report is far-reaching and deserves more discussion than the brief comments I am able to make. The changes proposed have enormous implications for school and post-secondary education and deserve serious debate, both in the wider community and in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The current recession has brought home to Australians the need for better education while at school and vocational training afterwards, so that our young work force is skilled and therefore employable. The dreadful spectre of thousands of our most valuable assets as a nation, our young people, unemployed and in many cases unemployable must focus our minds on the steps we need to take to give them improved prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most important aspect of this review of young people's participation in post-secondary education and training is the attempt by the Commonwealth to introduce national policies on training and education and to encourage the adoption of standard national criteria in curriculum, qualifications, standards, assessment and funding. I shall return to the funding question later. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats welcome many aspects of the report, in particular the establishment of national targets for post-secondary education. The review suggests that, by the year 2001, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds should have either completed year 12 or an initial post-school qualification or be in formally recognised education or training. This is a laudable and very desirable goal. The report says this would be achieved by the introduction of, amongst other things, a post-compulsory education and training guarantee, and states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all young people would be guaranteed a place in school or TAFE after year 10 for two years of full-time education or training or its equivalent part time for up to three years. The Guarantee should apply for all those who are under 20 at the first of January each year. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, recommendation 5.4 suggests that the introduction of uniform compulsory school education to year 10 should be given serious consideration by the States and Territories. A national assessment policy outlined in recommendation 4.7 would go a long way towards assisting students in achieving a high level of portability in education qualifications between the States and would also help employers gauge more realistically the relative on-paper suitability of job applicants. These are but a selection of very positive suggestions raised by the Finn Review. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, I note that the Committee recommends the development of major proposals which will substantially improve the participation of disadvantaged groups in post compulsory educational training, in particular the needs of women; students from non-English speaking backgrounds; the homeless; young people with disabilities; and Aboriginal students, who often face enormous hurdles even at the secondary school level. </PARA>
<PARA>  For many years I have been of the view that one of the greatest barriers to serious micro-economic reform and the development of national goals and strategies is our Federal system of national and State governments. This complex and sometimes difficult relationship is clearly illustrated in this report. None of this will work without the cooperation and compliance of the States. I note already that several State Ministers have responded angrily to the proposals contained in the Finn Review. Quite clearly, the review recommendations, and the Minister's support for Commonwealth control of TAFE education in particular, fly in the face of the Prime Minister's new federalism. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Federal Government cannot and must not simply bludgeon the States into accepting this new direction. The process must be orderly and debated fully. For these strategies to work, the Commonwealth must take into account the State-based diversity which already exists in the system. National reform of post-secondary education should not result in the development of institutions which become bland sausage factories of students pouring forth the same product. Regional differences, educational diversity and choice must not be forsaken. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Democrats will look closely at funding proposals to ensure that the financial situation of students is not a barrier to participation. The Government must take care that, in shovelling students into higher education, adequate resources are provided to ensure the current overcrowding situation at universities is not replicated at TAFE and in other training courses. This report, whilst making many recommendations for the improvement of post compulsory education and training, leaves many questions unanswered. These include the issue of funding, the agreement and compliance of the States, and the existing diversity and choice offered by post secondary institutions. In addition, the question of jobs--that is, what these students will be doing once they leave these institutions--is one that the Government must urgently address in the current economic situation. The document is a stimulating starting point for debate. I commend it to the Senate. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Senate is considering another extremely short report from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). These reports usually contain vague generalities and no useful information or useful data. This report, entitled Overenrolments and Overcrowding in Higher Education Institutions, informs the Minister that the Higher Education Council has been conscious this year of difficulties facing students and staff at some higher education campuses because of overcrowding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the view of the Council, the high level of enrolments across the system has increased pressure on facilities that have not expanded quickly enough to keep pace with the strong growth in this sector over the last few years. The report also states that the Council is reluctant to make judgments about the individual factors involved in producing the overcrowding until confirmed data is available. Yet the Council admits to having known that there has been a strong growth in student enrolments for the last few years. Why have records not been kept until now about the effect of increased student enrolments on higher education institutions?  Why does the Council not have the relevant data by now?</PARA>
<PARA>  I looked at the second part of this report, which consists of a letter from Mr Ian Chubb of the Higher Education Council to the Board, for answers to these questions, but the letter simply states that the Council can make judgments about causes and means of avoiding similar problems when it has better information. The first half of this very short paper has revealed only that there is a problem with overcrowding in higher education institutions, but the exact causes are unknown. Therefore it is not possible to determine how to prevent similar problems in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the second half of the report does provide some tentative comments by the Higher Education Council. For instance, it offers some suggestions for the causes of overcrowding. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA>Overcrowding is rather caused by the large growth that the system has experienced in recent years and the inability to construct facilities to parallel the growth; overenrolment naturally exacerbates the problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA>The clever country agenda, significantly increased school retention rates . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If this is true, it has happened remarkably quickly since the first Hawke statement on the clever country was delivered last year. The figures that do exist are based on 1989 figures. Thirdly, the report states `widespread youth unemployment has created unprecedented levels of demand for higher education'.</PARA>
<PARA>  Next, the Council apportions blame for overenrolment and the subsequent overcrowding. Honourable senators will not be surprised to learn that it is not the Government which is at fault but the institutions themselves, according to this Government report, which says that `some of the responsibility rests with institutional management' within certain universities. The Council justifies this statement because it claims that regular overenrolment occurs in only a few instutions. It says that institutions did not adjust well eugh to wt was a predictable high demand for places. Once again under this Government we have a conflict between it and the universities. On its own admission, it is too late to adjust student numbers or resource levels for 1991, with the result that there will be overcrowding and cutbacks in tutorials, lectures and laboratory classes and there will be less personal involvement with the students by staff. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Council has made a number of recommendations for action by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training: explore the renovation of existing but poor quality teaching space; explore the practicability of bringing forward the 1992 capital program; allot to each institution a total load target, a commencing load target that may be adjusted by negotiation; and give a commitment that performance in relation to targets will be averaged over a triennium before any funding adjustments are made. These recommendations are too late to alleviate the situation in 1991. The Opposition will be anxious to see whether these recommendations are implemented and urgent action taken as a result to head off overcrowding in 1992. At least this report is a thought in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The present crisis of excessive numbers squeezed into inadequate facilities is one of the greatest problems faced by our vital tertiary institutions in their entire history. It is this crisis which the report entitled Overenrolments and Overcrowding in Higher Education Institutions details. An increase in the number of students seeking higher education is a good thing in itself, but when they cannot be accommodated this boon becomes a problem. Having students who need tickets to attend lectures, waiting lists at libraries and photocopiers and overcrowded lecture theatres cannot be allowed to become the norm at our tertiary institutions in Australia if Australia is to have any hope of maintaining its competitiveness into the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the structural sources of the overcrowding crisis in our tertiary institutions has been strangely neglected in this report. As Senator Tierney outlined, the report largely places the blame at the door of the institutions themselves and of poor management practices conducted by them. The Australian Democrats reject this. A great deal of the overcrowding problem has been caused by the practice of determining the number of students for the purpose of funding allocations during the second semester each year. </PARA>
<PARA>  This method of funding allocation has led to students being locked out of lecture theatres at Macquarie University, and has forced Adelaide University to issue tickets to first year students before they are allowed to attend their lectures. Under this system of funding, each university or college receives an allocation partly based on the number of students attending courses during the second semester each year. However, an attrition rate of 10 to 20 per cent of new enrolments in the first semester reduces the funding to which the tertiary institution is entitled. This means that administrators make strenuous efforts to deliberately over-enrol students during the first semester in order to maximise their funding, based on those who are left in the second semester. A vicious cycle is the result, with appallingly overcrowded positions leading to more students dropping out during the first semester, which in turn drives university administrators to seek even greater numbers of new students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats support reform of this funding regime so that allocations can be determined on a more realistic basis. A first step would be to put a lid on funding-driven over-enrolment by assessing the maximum number of students who could be adequately educated at each institution. This number would be used to set an upper limit for funding, thus removing the incentive for administrators to overload courses in search of extra money. Student numbers would be assessed in the first semester, with adjustments made for likely attrition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another factor which has contributed to overcrowding is the Government's retrograde policy of charging fees for higher education and its failure to provide adequate financial support for students. This forces students to enrol for the maximum possible number of courses in order to complete their degrees as quickly as possible and so minimise their financial problems. I suggest to the Government that the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme has actually in itself resulted in this problem, and the Government has failed to take adequate notice that students telescoping their courses would result in overcrowding at institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's failure to anticipate this consequence of its short term mercenary policies is now reflected in the inadequate conditions at universities on which our economic future depends. The vital tertiary education sector has been squeezed for finances at the same time as it has been required to take on even more students. Such starvation of educational institutions is intolerable while wealthy individuals and huge corporations are allowed to evade tax through overseas havens. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats fully supported yesterday's national day of action on overcrowding at universities. An educated population and work force is an essential resource which must not be sacrificed to the altar of economic rationalism. I commend the report to the Senate and ask that it take note of its recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I heard the interjection from Senator Tate that I am a bit late, and I apologise to the Senate. I will be brief in my comments on the report. As one of the parliamentary advisers to the forty-fifth session of the United Nations, and on behalf of myself and my co-delegate, I would like to express my gratitude to the Parliament of Australia and to my Party for allowing me to attend the United Nations. At this stage, I would have to say that this was probably one of the best experiences that I, as a parliamentarian, have ever undertaken. I also say that my co-delegate Senator Brownhill and I worked very well together. I congratulate Senator Brownhill on the way in which he participated in his role as an adviser to the United Nations. I thank him for the personal way in which we were associated when the United Nations was not sitting. I will not say too much more because I do not want to affect his endorsement. Thank you, Senator Brownhill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We presented a written report as part of the Australian delegation to the forty-fifth session of the United Nations. It is not my intention at this stage to cover in detail all the points included in our section of the report covered under annex D. I believe it is worth mentioning the headings which outline the structure of our report and cover those matters dealing with different sections in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the first items that the report covered--and one of the first things that the United Nations covered--was the Middle East. I believe that the Middle East crisis was the single most important item on the agenda for the 1990 session. The Middle East crisis, of course, overshadowed everything else that was undertaken at the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another heading in the report was `Changing world'. In this section we dealt with the changing role of Europe. Of course, when one looks at the forty-fifth session of the UN Assembly, one looks at the changing role within Europe, German unification, the changing attitude in Russia and, of course, the end of the Cold War which brought about great changes not only at the United Nations but also in a lot of countries throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other headings which had a marked influence was `Statements by key-note speakers'. When one goes through the list of keynote speakers, one of the ones that come to mind is the People's Republic of Bulgaria. A few years ago, one would not consider that Bulgaria was the greatest democratic country of all times. But on this occasion, the speech made by the speaker from Bulgaria certainly showed that changes were taking place. I think about two or three days ago in the newspaper, I noticed that there were democratic elections taking place in Bulgaria itself. Other keynote speakers who outlined changes were from the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States and, of course, the USSR. The keynote speaker from the USSR was Eduard Shevardnadze, the then Foreign Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other headings was `New attitudes give strength to UN action'. I believe that this strength was shown by the support for the Security Council's positive action in the Middle East. Another heading was `World under discussion'. Many changes took place, and one that comes to mind more than anything else is the changes in Africa. Of course, one can see the continuing path towards the ending of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA>  As delegates, we also attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. It was attended by both advisers--Senator Brownhill and me. There was a discussion on Cambodia. I think the other discussion was on literacy. I was lucky enough to be appointed chairman of one of the sessions of the conference. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think one piece of advice that I could give to other parliamentary advisers that go to the United Nations is that they not be quite as conscientious, enjoy the visit a bit more and not spend quite as much time at the United Nations as we did. However, as advisers, we participated in the debate on the report of the Economic and Social Council. We also participated in the debate on the global fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome--AIDS; the international decade for natural disaster reduction; the restructuring of the economic and social sector in the UN; the human rights issue; and the drug control program. I think there were other areas that we also participated in, but we actually participated within the Assembly and within the committees discussing those items on behalf of Australia and putting the point of view of the Australian delegation forward. (Extension of time granted)</PARA>
<PARA>  There was also a briefing of countries prior to the committee meetings, and I think these briefings showed more clearly than anything else the extremely high regard in which the Australian delegation was held. The way in which Ambassador Wilenski and his team acted and the discussions they had with the other countries certainly assisted Australia and the world in relation to the matters discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia also participated in the World Summit for Children. The delegation was led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and we were proud that Australia was a signatory to the declaration and plan of action. I am cutting my speech fairly short; I probably should go a little further. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only other point I would like to make concerns the summary and conclusion that we made within our report. As the report came from the parliamentary delegates, we decided to put forward a number of points which we believe should be taken up. The first thing we recommended was that the United Nations be asked to form an elected body or representative assembly with a member or members from the governments of individual states. This group could provide some form of accountability through the elected representatives who would report back to their own governments. When one considers the changes that are taking place in the world, it is quite obvious that the United Nations needs to change in some way. I believe that we ought to look at the charter of the United Nations and that there should be some discussion about bringing some form of elected assembly into the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also made a number of other recommendations. One, which was prompted by Eduard Shevardnadze, involved the re-establishment of the military committee. If the military committee for the United Nations had been re-established, after the Iraqi affair we might not have had the problems we experienced in Kuwait and in those other countries because we would have had the advice of the military staff committee, which could have advised the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to make one more very quick point. When one attends the United Nations it is fairly difficult to look at all of the addresses, but when I looked through the papers I received I again looked at the address by Eduard Shevardnadze. I think it is fairly important to quote a couple of points that were made in his statement. I will quote them fairly quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are dealing here with the Income Tax Assessment (Valueless Shares) Amendment Bill 1991, which is a private member's Bill introduced by Senator Watson. As has been the case with similar initiatives by Senator Watson in the past, I would acknowledge--not for the first time, but perhaps for the first time in this chamber, because it is the first time I have been called upon to discuss it--that the issue dealt with by this Bill is a real problem. It is not the sort of problem that is central to the whole structure of the tax system, and it is not fundamental to the principles of equity, efficiency and simplicity in legislation. But for the people affected it is a real problem, nevertheless, and one that needs to be addressed properly by the Government and the Parliament. I want to put that on the record right from the start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In summing up the Government's response to the proposed Bill, one would say that Senator Watson has asked the right question, although we are not convinced he has the right answer at this stage. But that is not to say that this is not a proper matter to come before us. It is an issue well worthy of consideration and an issue on which action needs to be taken. There has been some consideration of this issue within the Government already and some advice has been forthcoming. It is a matter which, as I will indicate at the conclusion of what I hope will be a relatively brief contribution to this debate, I will be referring to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) upon his return from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Broadly put, the issue concerns the problem that arises for shareholders who have shares in a company which is in liquidation and who are unable to trade in those shares. They are unable to realise what would otherwise be a capital loss and offset it against capital gains otherwise earned and,  therefore, would pay a higher tax bill than they would pay otherwise. That is not in conflict with the fundamental principles of capital gains tax, which is that gains and losses are realised at the point of disposal of the asset-- and these assets have not been disposed of. So, in principle, one can see the underlying premise of the legislation as it stands, but the human cost to the individuals is real and needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having dealt with that as a broad principle very briefly, but I think adequately for the circumstances, I would now like to deal with some of the problems we see with this particular formulation as a solution to the problem before coming back to indicate the direction in which I think action might be taken in order to deal with the problem before us. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the problems we see with the legislation as proposed is that it is considering that, subject to various prerequisites set down in the legislation, the disposal will be deemed to have taken place. We do not think that is the trigger mechanism which most effectively meets the common objective of dealing with the objectives of the taxpayers involved. At the moment, on the basis of our consideration, which is not concluded--it is an issue which requires further study and consultation; that is why as yet we have not taken action on this matter--it would seem that it would be more appropriate that the disposal be triggered by action of the liquidator: the person who is likely to be in the best position to assess the value of assets and the extent of liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is probably more appropriate that the disposal be triggered by a written declaration by the liquidator rather than by the Commissioner of Taxation. We would expect that that declaration would indicate that there was no likelihood that the shareholders would receive any distributions on those shares. The liquidator is the person who is, in effect, looking after the interests of the shareholders as well as those of the creditors. It is our view that this would be a neater, cleaner, more appropriate and more direct formulation. It has a second benefit also with regard to timing, which I will perhaps come to at a slightly later stage. But I think the liquidator's triggering mechanism would give us a cleaner and easier timing device for the realisation of the loss. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the drafting of the legislation before us, it is unclear--according to advice that I have received--exactly which shares would be covered or to which years the amendment would apply. I understand quite clearly from the legislation--it is set out there quite clearly--that the provision would commence upon royal assent. It deems a disposal of a share in certain circumstances where, at the end of the year, it is worthless. This legislation, as it stands, does not have any further clarification, and without that further clarification it is not clear whether the measure is intended to apply to shares that were worthless at the end of previous years--that is, shares that were worthless in 1986, 1987 and 1988 and which are still worthless--or whether it applies only to future years. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the current trend of the Government's thinking, I suggest that the most likely course of action would be--this has not been finally considered by the Government; it is a matter I will be making representations to the Treasurer about on his return--that the provision would apply to any declaration made by a liquidator after a certain date. That is the second leg of the argument. That is why we think that a declaration by the liquidator being the trigger mechanism is the more appropriate formulation. It has the second benefit with regard to timing. This has the benefit of giving the taxpayers some certainty at the time, rather than having to wait until the end of the year. That is what the provision is properly designed to do. It would, I think, enable people more quickly to take advantage of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a second and related timing question. The Bill as it is before us deems the share to have been disposed of at the end of the year, even though it has actually become worthless some time during the financial year. Closely related to the point I made before--and Senator Watson and others who have taken an interest in these issues would understand this--in general, the capital gains provisions provide that where an asset expires or is destroyed the loss comes into effect at the time the asset expires, is destroyed or, in this instance, loses its value. I would have thought that the preferred approach would be to deem a disposal when the liquidator declares there is no likelihood of distribution or there is no value in the shares. I think that timing matter has benefit in it. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was also some uncertainty as to whether the value should be nil or negligible and whether we should deal with it as though the value in the circumstances is nil. I understand that there is some international precedent for the negligible aspect. I am aware of that point. There is no unanimity of view at this stage from advisers and from people whose opinions have been brought forward as to what is the best solution to that matter. Unlike the other three points I have made, where quite clearly there is a better alternative formulation to solve the problem than that which is in the Bill, I would not go so far with regard to the fourth point. It is a matter for subsequent discussion and determination. The Government does not have a final view about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is likely that the Government will want to clarify how the provision applies to different classes of shares. I expect that it will be more likely to look at a formulation that dealt with shareholders--that is, taxpayers--rather than shares. The Government may well need to look at a drafting provision that clarifies how the provision applies to different classes of shares. In a sense, once this provision applies to them, all shares are equal; they are all of nil value. It may be that this is a lesser problem than it appears on the surface. At the end of the day, they will all be deemed to be of the same value. That is an issue which we are seeking to address. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the sake of completeness, although there is not a matter of debate between us, there is one aspect of the drafting which I certainly share with Senator Watson; that is, the view reflected in the Bill that there ought to be a choice for shareholders as to whether they wish to take advantage of this provision to crystallise their losses earlier than existing legislation would require. I think that is pretty uncontroversial. I do not suggest anyone would think otherwise. I do not want honourable senators opposite to think I have ignored that provision, and I indicate that that is my thinking. I am fairly confident that that will be reflected in any final action that the Government takes with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to extend the discussion of this Bill. I conclude essentially as I began. I wish to indicate what it is that I will be doing about this matter so that it does not become just an interesting debate in the chamber which disappears into the ether and Hansard but is not of any practical value to the people who have a real human and financial problem. To recapitulate, while the issue that has been dealt with in this private member's Bill is not one of the central and determining tax issues that will determine the nature of, the equity of, the efficiency of or the simplicity of our tax system over the coming months and years, it is for those individuals affected a very real and substantial problem. It is agreed that we need to address it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I indicate once again that the Government will not be supporting the Bill. It is not satisfied that the mechanism in the Bill adequately meets the problems that we agree exist. I certainly give an undertaking to Senator Watson directly, and to the chamber as a whole, that I will raise this issue and ensure that briefs from the Treasury and the Tax Office are available consistent with that on the Treasurer's return. I will seek prompt action, if possible, for legislation that might be introduced in the course of this session of the Parliament but, if not, in the next session. For those reasons, while I have clearly indicated sympathy for the objectives of the legislation, the Government will not at this stage be supporting the Bill. It will seek to take action with a similar objective but with a slightly different style to achieve what is, if not exactly a common objective, a similar objective shared, I suspect, by the whole Senate, but certainly by the Government and the Opposition. I will do that promptly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise in support of Senator Watson's private member's Bill, known as the Income Tax Assessment (Valueless Shares) Amendment Bill. I believe that Senator Watson has the respect of all sides in this chamber because of the expertise he shows on tax matters. Senator McMullan made a similar point. Senator Watson has a well-deserved reputation for mastering complex tax matters. This Bill is yet another contribution of Senator Watson to achieve a greater sense and equity in our taxation law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think it is correct to say that Senator McMullan gave some comfort to Senator Watson and his colleagues who are concerned about this issue--probably not quite enough comfort. We were pleased to hear Senator McMullan say that he viewed this as a very real problem. While he felt that he was not able to support the legislation as it stands, he gave assurances to the chamber that he would be pursuing this matter with some vigour with the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on his return from overseas. Senator McMullan said he believed that Senator Watson had asked the right questions, but was not altogether sure that he had provided the right answer with this Bill. I think Senator Watson has provided the right answers in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  Considering the present climate and the large number of private investors who have been affected by share losses, this Bill could not have come at a better time. The purpose of this Bill is to allow losses on valueless shares to be claimed as a capital loss and thus be available for netting off against any capital gains accruing in current or in future years in circumstances where the company, the subject of the investment, is in liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is an urgent need for a Bill of this kind, and I think that point was conceded by Senator McMullan. The current capital gains provisions do not allow for capital losses arising from investments in shares in circumstances where the corporation is in liquidation and where a valid and effective transfer of ownership cannot be effected. Further, the liquidator rarely directs funds for maintaining a share register. This is a very real problem. Therefore, private investors and their advisers have been worried about how to claim losses on worthless shares. </PARA>
<PARA>  Private investors holding listed shares which have become worthless cannot easily dispose of them once the company goes into liquidation. This means that, even though investors have made the same losses on the shares as anyone else, they cannot deduct the loss from any capital gains unless they find another way of disposal and/or rely on tax rulings. </PARA>
<PARA>  In July of this year income tax ruling 2643 set out some ground rules for `wash sales', though it left many areas still vague. This followed an earlier ruling by the Australian Taxation Office that for private investors--those not classified as traders or investing via company structures--suspension or delisting of the stock did not, in its eyes, constitute disposal. Although the Australian Taxation Office in income tax ruling 2643 stated that under certain conditions part IVA would not typically apply to wash sales, there is still a probability that the share sale arrangements between related parties, including family members, could be caught by the anti-avoidance part IVA mechanisms as the facts of each case need to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to the Tax Office rulings, it is not possible to give an assurance that part IVA would not apply to wash sales generally. Further, my colleague Senator Watson and a number of eminent experts within the industry believe ruling 2643 to be wrong in law. One accounting firm has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The ruling appears to substitute some form of arm's length test for the true test contained in part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA>The Income Tax Assessment (Valueless Shares) Amendment Bill is thus being brought before this chamber to overcome the apparent vagaries of income tax rulings. The Bill would allow for a statutory mechanism or technique to crystallise the losses. I urge all members of the chamber to support this Bill, as it brings the Australian taxation system into line with that of the USA and the UK. </PARA>
<PARA>  The British Inland Revenue Office publishes from time to time shares listed as having negligible value, while in the USA the Internal Revenue Code section 165(g) allows a deduction for worthless security. Therefore I think we can say that there is an international precedent in favour of putting all investors on the same footing when it comes to claiming legitimate investment losses. In fact, the various clauses of the Bill before us are based largely on section 22 of the British capital gains tax legislation, which allows notional disposal where there is an entire loss on an asset. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Bill, the valueless shares are defined as having negligible or nil value, as in the UK legislation. The negligible value is not quantified in the UK legislation, although the UK Inland Revenue considers negligible value to be less than or equal to 5 per cent of the par value of the share. For our purposes, such a determination could be assisted by an appropriate income tax ruling. </PARA>
<PARA>  To complement the legislation, the Australian Taxation Office could publish from time to time details or lists of shares where such claims would be accepted. We are fortunate in Australia to have a large number of organisations through which this information could be disseminated. The circulation could be via organisations such as the Taxation Institute of Australia, Butterworths and CCH tax services, the Australian Taxpayers Association, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most importantly, this Bill allows for restitution of taxpayers' rights. The present capital gains provisions, by not recognising the loss on shares in the circumstances I have described, restrict the taxpayer and put him or her in an unfair position. Overall, I think the Government should note that the financial impact of this Bill is not expected to be significant. It is a Bill directly concerned with the justice and the protection of taxpayers' legitimate rights. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator McMullan raised a number of issues of a more technical nature. I think it would be wiser if I left those for Senator Watson to tackle. I commend the Bill to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Income Tax Assessment (Valueless Shares) Amendment Bill is another piece of specific legislation brought forward by Senator Watson in the very complex area of income taxation. At the outset, the Australian Democrats would like to compliment Senator Watson for his consistent and persistent endeavours to ensure that taxation law is refined and improved and that anomalies are speedily dealt with by this chamber, thereby ensuring that the Government addresses them. A recent example was his Bill which sought to correct the injustice in the substantiation provisions, which was highlighted by the Evangelist case. The Democrats supported that Bill and we will also be voting for this Bill tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Bill proposes to address the technical problem which arises because of inconsistent legal requirements between the taxation law and company law. Realised capital losses may be offset against capital gains derived during the current year, or they may be carried forward to be offset against capital gains which are derived in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>  For a capital gain or loss to be realised, the legislation requires that the taxpayer must dispose of the relevant asset. In the case of the shares in a company to which a liquidator has been appointed, sections 468 and 493 of the corporations law prevent the transfer of the absolute control and ownership of those shares. This means that an investor whose shares have become worthless or virtually worthless is legally unable to realise the capital loss which he or she has sustained. The Commissioner of Taxation has recognised that there is a problem in this regard in taxation ruling No. 2643. However, I think Senator Watson is correct in his interpretation that the ruling is not correct at law and that an amendment to the legislation is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill proposes that investors whose shares have become worthless or virtually worthless will be able to make an election when a company is in the process of liquidation which will deem that they have disposed of the shares, thereby allowing the loss to crystallise. There are other ways to achieve this aim. Indeed, Senator McMullan has informed us that the Government is examining alternative approaches. We are certainly not solely endorsing the method proposed by Senator Watson. However, the Australian Democrats believe that this Bill will solve the problem whilst not allowing an avoidance opportunity, therefore we are supporting it. However, we are willing to consider the merits of any other approach that may come before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I would like to thank all honourable senators who participated in the debate on the Income Tax Assessment (Valueless Shares) Amendment Bill. Naturally, I am disappointed that the Government has not chosen to follow the approach that I have adopted. I would like to pay a special thanks to those people who have supported the Bill, enabling it to reach the second reading stage. I thank the Australian Democrats for their support. They will naturally share in the success of this Bill and in the promise of what is to come, in the manner in which the Government wishes to take this up. I also thank my colleague Senator Kemp for his kind remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill is essentially a question of restoration of taxpayers' rights and, as Senator Kemp said, a question of justice. That is what it is all about. I acknowledge that there are a number of approaches and that each approach has its own limitations. Rather than giving the discretion to the liquidator, I have chosen the option of an election, which is essentially a very simple and straightforward approach. Of the three or four approaches that we had the choice of pursuing, we chose this one for reasons of simplicity and certainty as far as the shareholders were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government believed that there should be another way of producing the trigger mechanism to produce the particular loss. The trigger mechanism in our case, of course, was the election by the shareholder. The shareholder need not make the election this year or next year. It is a question of shareholder choice. We believe this to be fundamental, rather than a decree or fiat from a particular liquidator. </PARA>
<PARA>  The choice the Government may take of giving a choice to the liquidator, of course, places a great responsibility upon the liquidator. That approach will require much more voluminous legislation because safeguards will have to be built in to allow for circumstances in which there is an excess on final realisation. This could happen. For example, the mine could suddenly find a pot of gold right at the end. The trigger mechanism of an election provides that degree of flexibility not only for the current situation but also for a future situation where, for example, additional revenue may be found and it is discovered that there is not a nil value after all. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the approach that we have followed is a sound one. I have to defend the integrity of the approach that I have used. I acknowledge that there are choices. If the Government chooses to follow another approach, obviously, providing it is based on sound criteria, we will endorse that. I thank the Minister for the fact that he is going to raise this with the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on his return and seek a prompt response. I certainly look forward to seeing similar legislation in the nature of an amendment coming before this Parliament, hopefully before it rises at Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that with my approach there would not be problems with different classes of shares. This would be a decision that would be confirmed, of course, by the Taxation Office. It would not readily agree to listings if there was a lot of doubt about them. My Bill is a question of timing. Obviously, once the shares have been struck off the register the loss could be crystallised but, in many cases, this might take a dozen or so years. It is not an expedient remedy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, what shareholders are looking for is a means of crystallising that loss so that it could be offset, not against income but against any current gains or future gains. Therefore, I support the mechanism that I have used, that is, the mechanism of an election followed by certain rulings that could be made by the Australian Taxation Office. I thank the Senate for its support for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate--</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  condemns the Government for its failure to provide direction and support to Australia's depressed rural sector, especially during the present devastating drought; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  calls on the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>      (i)  to adopt policies to remove the obstacles which are preventing rural producers from operating effectively and efficiently, including a reduction in real interest rates, an efficient waterfront and transport system and a competitive tax structure, and</PARA>
<PARA>      (ii)  to pursue all opportunities to liberalise international trade to minimise the barriers confronting Australian primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This time last week, when the Senate was debating a similar motion condemning the Government on its ineptitude in getting mineral resources off the ground, I mentioned that the mining industry would have to lift Australia out of despair because the primary industries are not able to do so at this stage. The Government was soundly condemned on that day because the Senate carried the motion. In fact, the Government condemned itself by its silence. However, I presume that even the Government is entitled not to incriminate itself any further. </PARA>
<PARA>  While Australia's eyes are firmly fixed on the mineral sector, it does not mean that primary industry does not have a future. Primary industry will come good again as it has in the past, time and time again. Farmers just cannot be kept down for too long--that is, if the Government gives them any sort of encouragement. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-If Senator Cook will be patient, we will come to the market. If the Government were simply to remove the obstacles put in the way of Australian agriculture, deliberately or by default, it would thrive again and--pending getting top money in the market again--regain its rightful place, the place it had in the past when it was Australia's biggest exporter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To show exactly how much Australia's agricultural income has dropped I will refer to the latest figures available to me which show the downturn.  I will take wheat first. In 1988-89 Australia's exports were valued at $2.107 billion; in 1989-90, they went down to $2.56 billion; and by the year 1990-91 they had dropped right down to $1.782 billion, which is a decrease of 15.4 per cent. I turn to wool, which went through a big fiasco last year and the year before. In 1988-89, Australia exported $5.54 billion worth of wool; in 1989-90 it had dropped to $4.078; and for 1990-91 it was down to $2.725 billion, in other words, exactly half, working out at 50.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we look at the figures on a per farm basis, we see that the net farm cash incomes for the last five years have decreased dramatically. In 1987-88, for a single farm the figure was $6,948; 1988-89, $6,685; 1989-90, $6,397; 1990-91, $4,150; and the estimate for 1991 is $3,157. At the same time, total farm costs have risen, which tells a very sorry tale. In 1987-88, costs were $16,678; 1988-89, $18,651; 1989-90, $19,983; 1990-91, $20,100; and, hopefully, on provisional figures there may be a slight drop in 1991, but there has still been a vast increase since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>  Income is going down while costs are continually going up, although the increases may have slowed in the past 12 months. What encouragement is the Government giving to help turn around this trend?  Australian farms are still 93 per cent family worked and owned. That figure is equal to or higher than in any other country in the world. It is imperative that we keep it that way. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we were in Eastern Europe a little earlier in the year we were told that various countries are hoping to get their economies going by getting back into rural production. Given the situation that has existed for the past 45 years, all that two of the three countries could talk of was returning farms to private enterprise and getting them going. They have quite a bit to learn from Australia, which is one of the most efficient primary producers in the world. They would do well to follow our methods. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I asked before, what has the Government done?  In this year of record unemployment, with one million people already out of work caused by this recession we had to have, one would have thought that this Government would bring down a Budget to try to relieve the situation. I cannot find anything whatsoever in the Budget to help the rural sector, except a small attempt to provide some social security benefits to the farming community. This may be of minimal help to those in extreme circumstances, but it does nothing to help the whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  We cannot let the industry sink to the lowest point, otherwise it will never recover. If the Government had at least retained the income equalisation deposit scheme that was instigated by the Fraser Government, it would have prepared farmers, who would have had ready cash from the better times, for this downturn. After all, the farmers enjoyed four or five reasonable years. But the Government altered the scheme over and over again until it was absolutely useless and the farmers did not use it. Of course, they now pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has failed to provide an efficient system through which we can compete with the rest of the world. The Government has failed to provide an efficient and competitive transport industry. As I see it, the road transport industry in Australia continues to be taxed out of existence. Instead of rationalising the rail system by cutting expenditure, the Government tries to keep the rail system moving and get it back into a competitive situation by flogging the road industry system out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has also failed to provide an internationally competitive waterfront. We are told that we have to restructure the waterfront. I know that restructuring is taking place, but it is not moving anywhere near fast enough. The use of the waterfront for trade has dropped by between 30 per cent and 33 per cent in the past two years, yet the number of people employed on the waterfront has been reduced by only 13 per cent, which amounts to between 600 and 700 people. They have to be paid by somebody. Eventually, of course, those costs are picked up by whoever pays the freight costs. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government did manage to provide Australia with the Western world's highest interest rate, which put our farmers and small businesses in a very dangerous position when world commodity prices were at such high levels that they were prevented from consolidating. Had we been in a position to make the best of those commodity prices, Australian farmers would have been in a far better position. This Government has failed farmers at every turn. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has now put the farmers into a peasant class. Based on the figures for the average farm income, which will provide a provisional profit of $3,157 this year, that cannot be denied. The Government has abandoned them altogether. Perhaps that is where the Government wants them. The wheat industry in particular had its cushion taken away after 47 years of the old marketing system. In 1986 the Government took away the guaranteed minimum price when it paid out $385m. That is a small figure compared with the amount that the wheat industry has put into the kitty of all governments since 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, this downturn has had the effect of reducing the number of hectares planted for this year's crop. We have now reached the situation where we cannot supply traditional markets, albeit at the current low prices. In Western Australia, to the credit of the Premier--I do not normally sing her praises--a one-off guaranteed minimum price of $150 for one year has been provided. At least in Western Australia the planting was kept up. That is just as well because, I believe, the seven million tonnes of wheat that will be produced this year to satisfy our traditional customers will all come from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  If measures similar to those that have been put in place by Premier Lawrence were repeated in the rest of Australia, it would give farmers some incentive--above all, an incentive to remain on their farms. We have farmers leaving the countryside and going into the cities, which only puts pressure on housing and jobs in the city and leaves country homes and country towns empty. Once the farmers leave, it has been my experience that they very seldom return, especially the younger ones. </PARA>
<PARA>  Measures such as the isolated children's assistance under the means test must be addressed again. The isolated children's assistance should be totally divorced from Austudy. It only causes confusion. Those measures were separated for a certain time, but a heap of confusion was caused when they were amalgamated. I believe, and I always will, that all children, no matter where they live in Australia, should have the basic right of access to education. If anyone denies that, that person should tell me. Therefore, the isolated children's assistance should be available to all students who find it impossible to go to school. When I say `impossible', I mean impossible. I do not mean children that may be within 40 or 50 kilometres of a school;  I mean those who find it totally impossible to get to school every day and have to go to boarding school. That should be the basic right of all those children. Senator West might agree that the isolated children's assistance should be available to them. The figure of about $1,500 per year, payable by way of assistance, does not cover anywhere near the minimum fees of a student boarding at a government hostel, which in Western Australia costs at least $5,000. Fifteen hundred dollars does not go anywhere near meeting that bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the farm has a cash flow the children have a chance of getting an education, but if there is no cash flow whatsoever those children will suffer and their education will end. I suppose that they could take correspondence lessons, but anyone who has had experience with that method of education will know that it is fairly hard. If this allowance were adequate, these children would be able to remain in the system and take part in this clever country that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others always talk about. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1988 Mr Kerin, as Minister for Primary Industries, decried the fact that young people in rural and remote areas lacked education. But what did he and the Government do about it? They did nothing. Mr Crean this year in a communication to a backbencher, after sympathising with the fact that more money was not available for the education of isolated children, said, `I realise that no increases in allowances were sought for AIC'--Assistance for Isolated Children. One would have thought that the Government, having considered the matter, would have put in submissions to the Expenditure Review Committee so that money could have been allocated out of the Budget for this purpose. But that did not happen, and that is what this Government really thinks about children in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  If Australian agriculture is to revive, the Government must adopt policies to enable it to compete internationally. A little earlier Senator Cook asked, `Where are the markets?'. If we can get our costs down, we will compete. I know that operating in international markets is hard at present, but even with the dumping and the subsidised prices that now exist in the world I believe we have an opportunity to get into certain markets. Certainly our beef industry is not doing a bad job in competing internationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Well, wool is different. If we cannot sell our wool now with the present price structure, we never will, but wool will revive. If we are provided with measures to get costs down, we can start gradually to get our market share back. These measures include a reduction in real interest rates. I know that there has been a reduction in interest rates over the past six months, but what is the farmer paying? Even somebody on top security at the top line of a bank still has to pay 13.5 per cent; that rate applies even if one is the best risk in the land. Certainly the average farmer who has to borrow must pay around 20 per cent interest. What can a farmer do in the face of such a rate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Government policy must include the attainment of efficiency on the waterfront.

There may be a day when the troops will be needed, just as this Government put the troops in during the airline dispute. The day may come when the coalition government might have to do what the Labor Government did then, but at present there would not be a need. That does not mean that in time a coalition government might not have to do the same on the wharf. That is my position on it. As I have said, there are 600 to 700 people on the waterfront who are still being paid, whereas trade has dropped off at a great rate. Therefore, the sooner that something is done the better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We must have an efficient transport system. I know that the Government has made a start in reorganising that system, but things are happening far too slowly. I know that in Western Australia rail freight rates are rising rather than falling. Where are the Government's rationalisation measures in this regard?</PARA>
<PARA>  Government policy on agriculture must include a tax system that is internationally competitive. I could launch into what a goods and services tax would do for this country, but I believe there will be enough debate on that topic in future, and indeed there has been quite a lot of debate in the past. Senator Cook will hear about it if he is patient and waits a little longer. All will be revealed. We certainly need to become internationally competitive.</PARA>

Australia has given total commitment to the United States, no doubt for favours in the past. We have got involved in everything the Americans have got themselves into in the last 50 years. The latest was the Gulf war, the result of which was a certain loss to wheat growers. Not all those losses were recouped. I know that there was compensation at around 80 per cent, but wheat farmers lost a certain amount of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Furthermore, Australian motorists paid through higher fuel prices as a result of the Gulf war, as did farmers with diesel fuel and as did the mining sector. But when it suits those in the United States, they take no notice of Australian protests and sell wheat at subsidised prices. I hope that the forthcoming visit by President Bush will not be only a back-slapping, `My mate George' exercise. I hope that there will be some solid negotiations about United States dumping of subsidised products on world markets. The discussions can include almost anything, including the future of American bases on our soil. </PARA>

The point is that it is useless going to Europe or to the United States just once and then forgetting about it. I believe that the delegations should be made, in good times and in bad times, at least every six months. Let us keep those countries on notice that we mean what we say.</PARA></TALK.START>

Those countries are seeking `developing' status markets, but are all applying to join the Common Market. As soon as those countries get into the EC, we will be left lamenting. </PARA>

No other group in the rural sector has been mentioned in their condemnation. I do not know what makes the Opposition feel that it is the only group in this Parliament that has any concern for primary producers or people living in rural areas. It is an absolute falsehood for Opposition senators to come up with that proposition. We have also heard tonight about where they think we have gone wrong. Not only have we not heard any concrete proposals from them; we have also heard nothing about the costing of what they are suggesting we might do. We should do some things more quickly and maybe we should do some things differently, Opposition senators say, but those things have not been spelt out. If the Opposition wishes to be the alternative government, it has to start off by costing its proposals and telling us clearly what they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government is aware of the hardship the drought is causing and the hardship that is being suffered by primary producers, particularly with the fall in their incomes, caused mainly, I might add, by factors external to this country. However, that seems to be forgotten. It is even more unfortunate that the present weather conditions are compounding the problems caused by the drop in commodity prices and the trade war being fought by the USA and the EC. </PARA>
<PARA>  One way in which this Government has responded to the needs of the rural community has been through the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling programs. Funding for RAS has been substantially increased this year. The Government has also embarked on a comprehensive program of infrastructure reform which directly benefits primary producers. Historic progress has been made in the area of the waterfront and negotiations are proceeding with the States on the reform of the road and rail transport systems. Again, the conservative parties are totally devoid of any understanding of the reform processes. They are devoid of any constructive ideas on these issues, except to want to make things happen faster. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had an example recently of what the current Liberals think of previous Liberal governments when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) expressed concern about the achievements of the conservatives under Malcolm Fraser. He was certainly less than complimentary in his assessments, which makes one wonder precisely what they will do. However, they have yet to spell out their plans. Have the Liberals learnt anything from that period in government? I am not sure, for the only serious policy proposal we have heard tonight has been for troops on the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Panizza said it; I have made copious notes. What sort of solution is this? The Government has always believed that any program of reform of our domestic economy must be accompanied by a corresponding reform in the international sphere. Of central concern to that belief has been the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations which commenced in 1986, otherwise known as the GATT. Since opening the round, Australia has taken a leading role in the negotiations and has ensured that agriculture has remained at the top of the agenda. Australia has played a pivotal role in the formation of the Cairns Group of free trading nations, all of which have a common dependence on agricultural exports and share a desire for a more open, international agricultural market. The formation and continued effectiveness of the Cairns Group is a triumph for Australian trade diplomacy and a tribute to those Ministers who have had responsibility for that portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Cairns Group now represents an effective third force in the current round of negotiations, which means that agricultural reform cannot be ignored. Today, no trade negotiator doubts that a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round can be achieved without substantial liberalisation of agricultural trade. I defy anybody in this place to disagree with those points. It is important for us that we win the Uruguay Round of GATT, not just for Australia's primary producers but for the whole Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also had groups of bipartisan members of parliament, including members of farming organisations, travelling to both the USA and the EC. These have had some benefit and have allowed our members to understand the thinking of the people in those countries and allowed those people to understand our thinking. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that I am repeating myself, but I made the point in the debate on the Appropriation Bills, and I will continue to make it, that many members of parliament, whenever they get an opportunity, badger and attempt to make visiting members of the US and EC parliaments explain why they have policies that provide massive subsidies for their primary produce to the detriment of all other nations in the world which are trying to compete with them. It is vitally important that this Government be assisted by all those who can do so to continue to apply this pressure. It is pointless moving motions of condemnation and then not putting up concrete proposals. All we have heard is that some things need to be--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was not going to say anything about Senator West's speech, but I have to make one point. I am sure she did not really mean it when she criticised Senator Panizza for not putting forward any proposals and then said that the proposals had not been costed. I find that rather hard to believe. I know that Senator West does have the interests of rural areas at heart. I am pleased that she has joined our newly formed Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. I am looking forward to hearing her views on the problems facing rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I certainly support Senator Panizza's motion. Regardless of what Senator West has said about a lack of policies being put forward from this side, if Senator West reads the motion Senator Panizza has framed she will see in the second part that he has pointed out the sorts of things that need to be addressed to help the rural community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are other speakers too. I was not intending to get into the nitty gritty detail; I just wanted to point out to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and to those opposite that, if they thought that mainland Australia was the only place in Australia that was having problems, I can assure them that things are no different in Tasmania. I read the papers today, and I cannot remember in my lifetime seeing the rural areas in such a disgraceful situation. Even the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has said that this is the worst recession in 60 years. I do not think it is really at the stage depicted in some of those old movies I have seen where the American farmers were forced off the land into the cities, but it is fast approaching that sort of situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I know farmers whose families have been on the land in Tasmania for four generations. Their forefathers came out and settled there and carved their farms out of the wilderness four generations ago. I see them in a situation, through no fault of their own, where they are having to sell up their farms. They are moving from wool growing, because of wool prices, into vegetable growing areas. I cannot see the sense in that. I believe they are putting another noose around their neck. When people like Slim Dusty compose songs about the farmers' plight, that really points out just what a mess the rural areas are in. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It could not have been any worse. The situation in the rural areas now is that not only do the pubs not have any beer but also the cattle do not have any water. In 1960, when there was a downturn in the wool market, we had a brief glimpse of what can happen to Australia. On this side of the Senate we know, and I am sure that Senator Cook would agree, that the drop in wool prices has not been the fault of the Government to any great extent. But we know the effect that the downturn in 1960 had on the economy in general. I know what effect it had on me when I first started out. In 1980 to 1982 we had a horrendous drought. We came out of the drought when Mr Hawke was elected Prime Minister and I think he even tried to take credit for ending it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are now back in the situation we were in in 1982. We have a very severe drought. It has been put down to the El Nino effect again. The drought has exacerbated the situation of rural producers. In good times, they tend to dodge along; in better times, they tend to forget. As long as they have a dollar in their pocket, they do not seem to mind and the Government does not mind taxing them more and more. We get used to all the taxes--provisional tax, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was interested to hear Senator West praise the Government for its very adequate rural adjustment scheme. In some cases, that scheme is really only extending the agony of some people, but it does hold out some hope. I will give credit to the Government for its initiatives in the area of rural counselling. But farmers certainly need more than rural counselling and rural adjustment schemes. They need fundamental changes in the rural areas.  Senator Panizza points out in his motion some of the areas that are causing concern: interest rates, for one. Interest rates have been one of the biggest killers for farmers, particularly the farmers who have to get off their farms. The situation has now been exacerbated by the drought, but it was started by the high interest rate regime inflicted upon this country by the former Treasurer who engineered this recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Collins has been telling us how he is going to make the waterfront more efficient. I believe that he has tried very hard in this regard. But we only have to read a report that was tabled in the Senate this week by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. It pointed out that one of the biggest bugbears in exporting meat to overseas markets was the inefficiencies on the waterfront. As Senator Panizza said, some of the reforms that the Government is attempting may be coming into place, but they are too little, too late, and they have been far too slow. Also in his motion, Senator Panizza mentions a competitive tax structure, but he said it was not worth going into the detail of that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am looking forward to attending the Royal Hobart Show next week because I will be able to get at first hand some other anecdotes and thoughts and perhaps some ideas from farmers around Tasmania. I have been getting many phone calls and many letters from not just the wool growers or the cattle growers but also the vegetable growers in Tasmania who have a big problem. They are finding it very hard to compete. We used to be the biggest producers of export potatoes for the manufacturing industry in Australia. McCain set up in Tasmania, and Edgells has been there for many years. They are concerned now. McCain imports some raw materials--potatoes--from Canada and New Zealand.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-They are forcing down farmers' prices. These potatoes are coming in from Canada and from New Zealand and I do not know whether they are being dumped. The point is that the New Zealanders have an advantage with their relatively low dollar compared with our high dollar. The inflated value of our Australian dollar is another thing that is affecting the rural industries severely. We have potatoes from New Zealand competing with a local product. They have been forcing the price down to about $32 a tonne. That is the last figure I heard. So where are our vegetable producers in Tasmania going to go? I will tell honourable senators: they are going to go broke. The last I heard was that Edgells is very seriously thinking about closing. It is of great concern to me and it should be of concern to the Minister because once Edgells goes out, there will be one producer--McCain--and it will be screwing the vegetable growers even further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Rural adjustment schemes--rural reconstruction, as it used to be called--are all very well, but often they do not help when people are at the end of their tether. I was most disturbed to hear Senator Brownhill saying last night that, as a result of the drought and the rural recession in western New South Wales, there had been an increase in the number of people walking off their farms and, most importantly, an increase in the rate of suicide. That really does sum up the grief and despair of people in our rural areas. It is a huge problem to tackle but I am sure that, if adopted, the matters raised in Senator Panizza's motion would help to resolve it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter Senator Panizza raised in his motion is the transport system. A national road transport system is going to be set up. From what I can understand from people who have contacted me--and I had discussions with the Minister's advisers the other day--whilst I admit it is in the early stages, a lot of problems seem to be arising with this proposed transport system. By the time this matter sorts itself out, it will probably be too late for a lot of the truck owners who cart our cattle and stock around the country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today I just picked up a few papers to have a look at how things are going. I noticed this article--thank heavens--entitled `Slight price lift hopeful' concerning the Launceston wool sales. I must declare an interest there because I did have a few bales there. Further down, the article says that, despite a terrible autumn and a dry spring, the wool on offer was generally sound but overall production was down about 10 per cent and the return to growers was 50 per cent lower than at this time last year. How the dickens are those wool growers in Tasmania going to survive when they get a wool cheque 50 per cent less than last year and at the same time have all the extra costs and interest rates around their neck this year?  It is no wonder that they are walking off their farms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another little area of concern in Tasmania is highlighted in another article that I picked out where it says that Gunns Kilndried Timber Industries is feeling the pinch because it has been a very depressed year with sales revenue down 14 to 15 per cent. The company has stood down 40 workers, which is a sign of the depressed logging industry in Tasmania. Other articles are headed `Cattle industry at four-year low' and `Industry looks for optimism'. The latter article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Two weeks ago, the price of Australian wool hit its 10-year low, closing even lower last week on 438c/kg clean. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a far cry from the 870c and 900c which we saw 12 to 15 months ago. I have not painted a very bright picture for the rural industry but that is the fact of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am very pleased to see that my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Panizza, has brought this matter forward because it is of great importance. One has to get out there, talk to the people and actually see for oneself just how bad the situation really is. I just hope that the Democrats support us on this particular motion and that the Government will take some notice of what we are trying to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The time remaining for discussion does not allow proper consideration of the full extent of the motion. The Australian Democrats would certainly be tempted to support much of what the motion says. I hoped that we would have the opportunity to move an amendment whereby we would omit in paragraph (b) (ii) the words `to liberalise international trade' but, as the debate will not be concluded tonight, I do not see the opportunity to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Order!  Senator Bell, am I to take it that you are simply informing us that, if there were time, you would move an amendment but now you are not going to?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is correct. In the time remaining I will just look at some aspects of the motion. In the first sentence the Government stands accused of a failure to provide direction and to support the rural sector. In this context we could define `direction' as perhaps indicating, without any ambiguity, the most satisfactory means to reach a goal, to provide signals or indicators which would guide the rural sector along the path to a goal for the nation's benefit; or perhaps we could say that `direction' means to discourage deviations from a path which would be in the nation's interest. There should be considerable discussion about it but, according to those definitions, I would say that the Government has failed to provide direction to the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Perhaps the best indicator would be to ask the question:  has this Government demonstrated its concern for, and faith in, the future of Australian farming and the communities which support Australian farmers?  The answer to that question would have to be no. The evidence is that financial hardship has been visited upon Australian farmers but that those same farmers cannot be held responsible for the financial problems in which they find themselves. In other words, they are in financial difficulty, but whose fault is it?</PARA>
<PARA>  I contend that the blame lies squarely at the feet of all those who have been duped by the economic rationalists, by the bank deregulators, by the tariff reducers, by those who choose to allow interest rates to remain high and the foreign exchange rate to float, and by those who choose to fight inflation with engineered recession. We have heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, indicate here in answer to a question from Senator Coulter that he does not understand the meaning of interventionist policies. He would wash his hands and deny any capacity or any need for the Government to intervene in the economy; that is, to provide any meaningful signals or alterations which could ameliorate some of the excesses which are suffered by the rural sector which supports this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  This economy shows as much evidence of being well managed as a boy on a bike careering off down the hill shouting, `Look, Mum, no hands'. We all know that the next line is: `Look Mum, no teeth'. Well, that is what is happening here: the Government's responsibility to steer this economy has been abandoned. It has lost its teeth; it has lost its capacity to have any effect on the economy; it has lost its capacity to do anything but munch its gums at the problems which surround rural Australia. Because of that, I am very tempted to suggest that we would be supporting this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the trouble is that in many cases we have been encouraged to allow this managed chaos of the so-called free market forces to prevail. The people who have encouraged us to allow that managed chaos of the free market forces have been the coalition itself. We have before us a partnership of Government and coalition which has quite blithely sat by and allowed the mismanagement of this economy to occur to such an extent that our rural sector is now reduced to something which is going to be very difficult to resurrect. </PARA>
<PARA>  I share the optimism of one of the previous speakers, who said that the rural economy will prevail because we have people out there who have faced all sorts of adversities in the past. But I would not like to be in their shoes now and be facing this particular adversity. Apart from interventions such as fixing interest rates, fixing exchange rates, investing in infrastructure to support efficient transport systems and further removing any remaining inefficient work practices which might prevail at transport nodes such as railway stations, airports or on the waterfront, there are many other interventions which the Government should make on behalf of the entire community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say the entire community because there is another aspect to this whole debate, which I have raised before in this chamber, and that is associated with the concept of user pays. So often in this place we pass Bills for the application of various levies and funds to various branches of our rural industries. These levies cover the whole range from the honey levy to the cattle transaction levy and pig levies, et cetera. I do not think any of us could possibly keep track of the incredible number of inspection levies, research levies, administrative levies and the like. These are all collected from the rural sector's producers with the assumption that the producers benefit most from the improved or cleaner products. I suggest that that assumption is false--the whole community benefits and the Government has responsibility to meet those costs on behalf of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Similarly, the community--through its successive governments--has established a series of award wages, local government charges, sickness benefits, holiday pay, superannuation benefits, inspection charges, packaging standards and the various other standards which Australian consumers have come to expect and appreciate. The community has established these standards and is willing to pay for them when purchasing Australian produce, and logically it should expect a responsible government to protect those standards. Quite simply, if the Government allows free entry of overseas products which do not need to meet these standards, the Government has not properly accepted its responsibilities. Senator Boswell has so often espoused such a move. The Democrats would support him and thank him for his efforts to bring about such a change. </PARA>

The tender calls for pilot training and flight screening for the RAAF and Army for a period of three years, plus two by one options. This is in replacement of current training conducted by RAAF at Point Cook in Victoria. There would be approximately 88 students requiring training per year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to talk about security issues this evening and put somewhat of a different complexion on the usual definition of security. There has been a great deal of community debate about certain areas of Australian Budget expenditure, such as superannuation and the lack of adequate provision for the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One area that got by unscathed was defence, which took up 9.3 per cent of total Budget expenditure. The coalition offered some comments on the subject, but only to complain that the Department of Defence was buying the wrong equipment. This surprised me as I thought it would grasp the opportunity to slash Budget expenditure in this area, in line with all its other proposals to cut every other area as savagely as possible. Predictably, the Australian Defence Association said that Australia should be spending more on the military and referred to 22 possible threats that needed to be countered in the next 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given the hard rethink that is going on in strategic defence circles and the end of the Cold War, it is sad that no-one has addressed the advantages offered to us by these profound changes. It seems as though the peace dividend is back on the agenda in many other countries post-Gulf War. It never really got on the agenda in Australia and is still not on our agenda. I think it is high time for a reassessment of our defence expenditure in relation to our foreign affairs budget, in light of the dramatic changes that are taking place globally. Instead, we have a ludicrous spectacle of the military admitting that the Soviet threat has, indeed, dissipated but desperately trying to drum up new threats in enemy images to justify a continued level of military expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Europe, NATO has noted the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact. Yet, while trying to justify its continued existence, it has proved completely impotent when it comes to maintaining the peace in Yugoslavia. It is the European Community which has sought to set up a ceasefire to monitor that very sad situation. It is not doing too well either, but at least it is making the attempt. It seems to be completely beyond the capacity of NATO to try to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Australia, the Royal United Services Institute had a conference in Canberra at the end of September on realignment of the world order--implications for Asia-Pacific security. The new Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, Mr Sabam Siagian, was far more perceptive than most of the men in uniform who still seemed locked in the past. While Senator Ray said that Australia accepted a continued strategic role in regional security, Mr Siagian pointed out that the US military presence in South East Asia has not suppressed regional conflicts. This  implied that ASEAN countries had done more to reduce tension in the region than the United States because they had carefully avoided any suggestion that ASEAN would become a military bloc. </PARA>
<PARA>  General Gration was prepared to look ahead as well, but reverted to drumming up the usual invisible threat scenarios, though conceding that the military would need to concentrate on both military and non-military situations. It is not prepared to accept that the end of the Cold War and the need to address new concepts of security meant that there also had to be a fundamental rethinking about the role of the military and its current capital equipment programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  To consider that, we need to note the words of Gwyn Prins, Director of the Global Security Program at Cambridge University and a fellow of Emmanual College at that university. He was in Canberra in September this year to speak about new options in defence strategies, personnel and equipment, presented as a result of the end of the Cold War. There is obviously some reassessment going on in New Zealand on this issue of equipment, in particular, with a certain amount of discussion on possible threat scenarios in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  General Gration, who was speaking at the RUSI conference, criticised what he called the popular myth that Australia faced no military threat for 10 years. He said that it had never reflected present military thinking. Rather, the debate seems to focus on whether Australia faces a major threat or just minor threats. There does appear to be agreement that minor threats, such as terrorist attacks, are likely to arise far more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question I want to raise here is the relevance of proceeding with the Anzac class frigates program as well as the Collins class submarines. Low level or minor threats are things like piracy, drug running, illegal fishing and abuse of and pollution of enclosed waters. If there is to be a regional effort to deal with these problems, say, a regional maritime safety and surveillance organisation which has been voted in ASEAN circles this year, then the Anzac class frigates are not really the kinds of surface ships that we should be tying ourselves to for the next 20 or 30 years. It would cost us money to cancel the existing orders, of course. But military plans are legendary for their ability to be changed at the last moment and it would cost us far more in the long run to build the frigates when we do not need them and at the expense of building the kinds of ship that we do need. </PARA>
<PARA>  We really need more ships in the water--smaller ships, technically simpler, vessels with long endurance and, of course, a much lower weapons density. Instead, we are locked into a capital equipment program reflecting the days when our submarines were used by the United States Navy to run around checking on Soviet nuclear submarines in the North Pacific and when the enemy was the Soviet Pacific fleet. This refusal to take up the challenges of the twenty-first century, which will be global security rather than national security and making sure that we do not let the East-West confrontation be replaced by a North-South one, is reflected in Europe where NATO is desperately floundering around trying to justify its continued existence. It is totally incapable of suggesting any positive role in the one major conflict now raging in the Balkans. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have precisely the same situation in this part of the world. Just as NATO is set up to counter the perceived threat of Soviet domination in Europe, so the ANZUS alliance was brought into existence as part of the US strategy of containment in the Asia-Pacific region. Now the threat no longer exists the military is desperately trying to justify its continued role in acquisition of capital equipment, so that we get Admiral Jeremiah, Vice-Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying in Canberra on 27 September that the United States would need to retain powerful military forces because the world is an unstable place. He asserted that as many as 20 nations could develop nuclear weapons in the next 20 years without saying anything about how they would acquire them or why his own country should have them while others could not. </PARA>
<PARA>  He then warned that the world would have a population of 10 billion by the year 2025 and that a quarter of these people would be hungry. Why then did he not suggest that instead of spending billions of dollars on Trident submarines and missiles, the B2 bomber and Star Wars--or Brilliant Pebbles as they are now called in the toned down version--the United States transfer its resources to combating the courses of this insecurity, hunger, poverty and disease? These are the real risks to our security. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certainly there are conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region but, just as NATO does not know what to do in Yugoslavia, the military has no real long term solutions to offer with regard to the conflicts in Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Burma, the Philippines, East Timor, West Papua, the two Chinas, the two Koreas, Bougainville or anywhere else. The implication of Admiral Jeremiah's speech was that the military would be used to maintain the injustice of the status quo in the name of the new world order--in essence, replacing the enemy images of the East-West confrontation with enemy images based on a war against the South. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a time of shifting alliances and unstable governments, this can backfire very easily, as yesterday's friend becomes tomorrow's enemy, armed with the weapons that we equipped and supplied. We need to look only at Panama, Iran, Iraq and Syria for proof of this boomerang syndrome with weapons transfers. What we really need, of course, is a new definition of security. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two hundred years ago the founding fathers of the United States of America in the Declaration of Independence had a list of three principles: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The problem today is that many people in industrialised societies have confused the priorities and have come to see their rights to the pursuit of happiness as more important than other people's rights to life or liberty. We then end up with a definition of security that is exclusive. We do not see our security as being bound up with other very different definitions of security.  National security has come to be seen as the same thing as the security of the individual living within that particular state. So the individual's security becomes part of maintaining the territorial integrity of the state, or the maintenance of the ideological supremacy of a set of ideas which that state is said to represent. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the appetite for raw materials and also for markets in these very wealthy states grew during the twentieth century, so did these same states' concept of what constituted their minimum security. It came to involve not only their right to territorial integrity, but also access to raw materials that came from other parts of the world at fixed and stable prices. Indeed, we have reached the point that John Kenneth Galbraith warned us about when he argued that, once an individual, a company or a country has reached a certain point of wealth, its economic rationale comes to be less and less driven by the pursuit of profit and more and more by the pursuit of predictability and control of its environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Once security was a concept defined at the national and international scale above all, but now we add both the small scale, that is, the personal security, and the large scale, environmental security. The fact of the close coupling of these two--the very small and the very large--is one of the distinguishing characteristics of global security. The introduction of the environmental dimension into the concept of security could not have come at a more timely moment, for the inherited concept of security from the last generation has reached a time of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>  The dropping of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki confronted us with the question of how strategic thinking and international relations could accommodate this monstrous increase in the destructiveness of war. Then the Cold War arrived. To deal with this new threat, the United States devised a doctrine of containment, armed with its new lethal weapons. The psychology of the nuclear age demanded the dehumanising and demonising of the potential enemy as a necessary prerequisite for people who wish to retain their sanity, while at the same time planning the nuclear incineration of millions of other people. Suddenly, with the end of the Cold War, the pattern of more than 40 years has begun to disintegrate rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our leaders cast about desperately for new enemy images, and in the last couple of years we have been presented with a number of unpleasant Third World dictators: Colonel Gaddafi, Manuel Noriega, Saddam Hussein, and possibly someone like Kim Il Sung as the next bad guy. These enemies are terrorists who blow aircraft out of the sky; they are drug runners, fundamentalists and religious fanatics, or anybody who seems likely to pose a threat to the normality of life in the rich nations of the North--a term which, for this purpose, includes Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Curiously, it is Time magazine that has pointed out that the cuts announced by President Bush in the area of tactical nuclear weapons do not save money and still leave the US with a strategic advantage--whatever that means in today's world. It is precisely the continuation of forced modernisation, the continued deployment of the Trident submarine and ongoing research on the B2 bomber and Star Wars that constitutes the kind of skewed thinking I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>  I fear that it is also reflected in the other nuclear weapons states, as the French continue to test in the South Pacific, the British continue to build Trident submarines while there are riots in their cities, the Soviet Navy goes on building its new aircraft carrier and new surface combatants and submarines while its people cry out for consumer goods, and the Chinese go on with the development of their blue water nuclear navy while they ignore calls for democracy within China and the call for self-determination by Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA>  Needless to say, seen from the perspectives of the poor South, the range of threats to security is very different from the perceptions of the North. For them, war, famine and pestilence ride together. Virtually all of the armed conflicts since 1945 have been in the South--a significant change from the pre-war era. Yet we have military leaders such as Admiral Jeremiah arguing that the US has to retain powerful military forces because other countries can now obtain nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals; because a quarter of the world's people are hungry; and because the United States was a Pacific power and would remain militarily involved, even if it is now making other nations, such as Japan, foot the bill for its continuing global presence. The contradictions are ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA>  The North is to keep nuclear weapons to safeguard against other countries that might acquire them. We are to perpetuate world hunger because we refuse to transfer dollars and research expertise from Trident missiles and submarines to feeding the hungry and dealing with the root cause of much of their insecurity; topping it off by arming the regimes that maintain this oppression in the name of national security and the right to national defence.</PARA>
<PARA>  In Australia, we are told that we cannot reap the peace dividend because there is a lot of conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. Yet, as in Europe, the military is equipped with totally inappropriate tools and is useless in helping to resolve these longstanding conflicts. None of the conflicts in the region pose a threat to Australia, but they cry out for third party diplomacy, non-military forms of conflict resolution, the strengthening of international institutions that can assist, and new diplomatic initiatives that will devise a response to the second wave of self-determination now that the colonial era is virtually over. </PARA>
<PARA>  One exception to this generally bleak picture I am painting of Australia's role at the moment is the case of Cambodia. The Government certainly deserves to be congratulated for its efforts there. It is indeed a tragedy that the kind of new thinking we require is more or less absent from current Government policy--with that major exception--and certainly within military circles, with the exception of a few other United Nations initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned earlier the introduction of the environmental dimension into the concept of global security. Many analysts are redefining the term `security' to take account of the fact that the most serious and immediate threats to most of the world's population are posed by environmental degradation. We saw this year how abuse of the environment can be used as a weapon, with both deliberate and consequential oil spills and the burning of hundreds of oil wells. There were also threats to divert or withhold vital fresh water supplies-- water being the only resource other than oil that has been suggested as a possible catalyst for a resource war in the Middle East. The environment has been a major casualty of other wars too. The intense use of defoliants in Vietnam and their continuing effects should not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a much wider sense in which our security is intrinsically linked to the health of our environment. Consideration of the major environmental degradation occurring today--global climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, deforestation and desertification at rates never before seen on the planet, and pollution of air and water--makes it difficult to ignore the fact that these are the real threats to global security. On this issue, one scientist-analyst has said:</PARA>
<PARA>Viewed with traditional concepts, any force that had the power to inflict such harm upon a state--kill some of its citizens and displace others, reduce its agricultural output, threaten its water supply, and destabilise its ecological balance--would be received with considerable attention. Today, therefore, just because these particular challenges are not being issued and controlled by a national leader does not mean that they should be ignored. Indeed, the fact that they are beyond such control makes them all the more threatening and ominous. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the nature of the threats to global security has changed radically, it is vitally important that we develop responses that recognise the changes. For a start, we need to acknowledge the global dimensions of the problems and the need for international cooperative responses. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased that Australia played such a leading role in one global approach which recently gave heart to environmentalists around the world. The agreement to ban mining in Antarctica for the next 50 years and to give priority to nature conservation and appropriate scientific research there will, I hope, be the forerunner of future global decisions that will put humanity's common aspirations ahead of the economic demands of those who already exploit more than their share of the earth's resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, there have been attempts to deal with other issues on a global scale, but we have not reached the stage of being able to set aside national and sectional interests even when they clearly conflict with global and, hence, our own long term interests. </PARA>
<PARA>  While there has been considerable progress towards the reduction of ozone depleting substances globally, the difficulties which were encountered in negotiating the Montreal Protocol, and the difficulties in ensuring not just compliance with the protocol but continuous reappraisal by all countries of the adequacy of their response, are unfortunately being experienced again in relation to a global response to climate change, and are even greater when we start to talk about possible responses to loss of biodiversity or global deforestation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the case of ozone depletion, we saw years of stalling by the main producers of ozone depleting CFCs because of inadequate information and scientific uncertainties. The major producers argued vigorously that there should be no obligation for them to do anything unilaterally and that they should not have to contribute to the cost of alternative strategies to dissuade developing countries from taking the same destructive path. It was only when the evidence for ozone depletion became overwhelming, and in fact the depletion was shown to be far more severe than had been detected a few years previously, that the industrialised countries which produced and used most of the world's CFCs finally agreed to act. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are seeing exactly the same sort of delaying tactics again in the negotiation of an agreement on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The first predictions of global climate change as a consequence of the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations came in the nineteenth century. Despite some attempts to play down the consequences of greenhouse warming, no-one has yet disproved those initial estimates of either the nature or the possible magnitude of the changes we are forcing on the global climate through the emission of greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA>  The international community has at least accepted that it is a real problem and, with such a time lag between actions and consequences, we cannot wait for all the studies to be completed before we think about a response. Accordingly, the inter-governmental negotiating committee was convened to draft a framework climate convention which would hopefully be ready for signing at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil next June. We have already seen the patterns of the ozone debate re-emerging: the industrialised nations are refusing to accept their responsibility for the problem, pointing at the potential for the developing countries to increase their emissions as somehow absolving us from action. The developing countries are quite understandably saying that global warming should not become an excuse for maintaining the existing inequities in resource use between the developed North and the developing South. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is what I was referring to earlier when I said that there was a danger of East-West confrontation being replaced by North-South confrontation. On the one hand, the North wants to address individual environmental issues without any consideration of restructuring of international economic relations. On the other hand, the South sees that this involves threats to its sovereignty over natural resources and future development, and that the North is not willing to face the systemic courses of the threats to environmental security; that is, the gross inequities in financial resources between North and South. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1989 we saw a net transfer of $44 billion from the poorer nations to the richer nations, despite all aid and private sector investments. In addition, there is a large transfer of natural resources from the South to the North because the South is forced to trade its way out of its massive and crippling debt at the cost of its own people's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, more than $2 billion is spent in the world each day on armaments. In the past two decades, the world has spent 70 per cent more on arms than it has on health and at least 15 per cent more on arms than on education. While this is going on, we are bogged down in negotiating a climate change convention--we have not got anywhere on a biodiversity convention--because of the fear of the developed nations that they may have to contribute financially to implementation of those conventions. It is almost unbelievable that disarmament and the redirection of resources from military to life-developing purposes such as the provision of water, food, health, housing and alternative energy sources are not even on the agenda for next year's UN conference on environment and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  The developed nations have contributed most to the global warming by being the biggest users of fossil fuels. They are the nations which have for the most part largely destroyed their own forests and woodlands. Australia's record of forest removal is a classic example. It is the developed nations which have the resources and the technology--if not the willpower--to make the biggest changes in their economic systems and their lifestyles to reduce dramatically their output of greenhouse gases and to start restoring some of the planet's carbon sinks through reafforestation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, however, it is the developing countries which are likely to be most severely affected by changes in the sea level, increased climatic uncertainty and the consequent incidence of storms, floods and droughts. The countries which are already marginal, and already locked into the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation, will be the hardest hit and the least able to cope. </PARA>
<PARA>  No wonder then that there is some scepticism from the developing world at what it sees as our hypocritical concern over global warming. It sees us refusing to accept that, because we contribute more to the causes of climate change through our high per capita use of fossil fuels, we should therefore accept a commensurate responsibility for decreasing the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Instead, what Australia and most of the industrialised world are saying is that, because this is a global problem, everyone has to share the responsibility--even though they did not get to share in any of the benefits of industrialisation. Furthermore, the developed nations are not going to countenance any action that may disadvantage their economies in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Protocol on the Reduction of Ozone Destroying Substances was being negotiated, the developing countries saw the same thing happening. The North decided that the South could not be allowed to proceed in the same way as it had because of the harm that would be done to the environment if everyone used resources at such rates. This led to the astute observation that the South was being coerced into forgoing the development that the North had already undertaken so that white northern skins could be saved from melanomas. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is equally hard to see why the South should resign itself to its current level of development so that the North can continue to use a disproportionate level of the earth's resources while pretending to be so concerned about the planet's state of health. If a forum such as UNCED is to have any real effect on ensuring our environmental security, we will have to learn to be less selective about what we are willing to share and more aware of the interconnectedness of poverty, environmental degradation and individual security. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new world order will keep looking like the old world order unless we can both recognise those connections and start to address them. To do that, we need to examine our own priorities in Australia and to introduce some of these broader concepts of security to our political and economic systems. For a start, though, we would need to shed the old concept of security as territory and security as maintenance of the status quo, especially through military regimes. The status quo has not been working too well for the unemployed, the young homeless, most of our Aboriginal population or the environment at large.</PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, a common reaction to the prospect of change--and the magnitude and nature of the changes are unprecedented--is to cling myopically to what we think we know best. In Australia, and most of the developed world, we cling to a system in which any development is good development and the best is that which is biggest. While other nations are talking about environmental security in terms of being able to feed and house their own populations and the growing</PARA>
<PARA>number of environmental refugees, we corrupt the term to talk about resource security by guaranteeing diminishing native forest resources to multimillion dollar pulp mills--which will be established through more overseas borrowing--to employ a fraction of the people who would be employed in small scale, high quality saw logging operations. </PARA>
<PARA>  While we are paying lip service to the concept of global responsibility to reduce greenhouse warming, we are building new coal-fired power stations instead of introducing some effective energy demand systems which could reduce both our environmental and economic costs. We are directing 9.3 per cent of the Budget into defence against invisible threats and a paltry 0.37 per cent into overseas aid against the all too visible threat of poverty and environmental degradation. </PARA>

<PARA>  The process of listing properties on the World Heritage List is a matter of international law which does not of itself require domestic legislation. For the same reason a domestic law, such as a Commonwealth Act or regulation, could not operate to remove an area from the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA>  The World Heritage List is established under Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Australia is a Party to that Convention. Although the Convention itself does not provide for removal of a property from the World Heritage List, the Operational Guidelines issued under the Convention do. Under those guidelines there are two circumstances which may give rise to removal. The first is where the property has deteriorated to the extent that it has lost those characteristics which led to its inclusion on the World Heritage List. The second is where the property was under threat at the time of its nomination to the List and the necessary corrective measures to remove the threat have not been taken within the time allowed. A removal can only take place if approved by a majority of two thirds of the World Heritage Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) In light of the fact that defence export applications to the Philippines worth $1,097,050 were granted for 1989-90, and that the actual exports were only worth $33,450 as at 7 February 1991 (see answer to House of Representatives Question on Notice No. 559, House of Representatives Hansard, p.W2233) : (a) what defence material was actually exported to the Philippines in 1989-90; (b) which companies supplied this material; and (c) why is there such a great difference between the value of export applications granted and the actual exports that went to the Philippines.</PARA>

<PARA>  (b) A.V. Skelton Firearms, IBM Australia Limited, Olin Australia Ltd, Precision Guns and Ammo, Australian Defence Industries Limited.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) The amount of $33,450 represents the value of actual exports reported to my department against the export approvals granted in the 1989-90 financial year. As noted in footnote (1) to the Table on Hansard page W2234, the value of actual exports will differ from the value of approvals granted because sales do not always proceed after approvals have been granted. Also export permits are valid for twelve months which means that there will always be a lag between export approval and actual export figures.</PARA>
<PARA>  The value of actual exports reported to the department relating to the approvals granted in 1989-90 as at 18 September 1991 was $351,450.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) (a) The value of export approvals for the Philippines granted in 1990-91 was $331,907. As at 18 September 1991, the value of exports reported to my department was $116,282. This amount could increase as the export permits granted in 1990-91 result in further actual exports.</PARA>

No records were made of the individual operators who attended these meetings.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The public launch and media briefing on the Railway Industry Council Public Comment Document was necessary to stimulate interest in the Council's work, rail reform generally, and encourage a broad range of responses to this document. This interest would not have developed if the process had occurred by more remote, low key means such as telephone or simple distribution of documents.</PARA>
<PARA>  The background briefings on 30 July Special Premiers' Conference reforms were undertaken to inform local and specialist media about the highly complex decisions taken at this Conference.</PARA>
<PARA>  They were accompanied by written briefing material but past experience in publicly explaining road transport reform indicated that a clear understanding of these decisions required direct communication. More than half the time allocated for these briefings was taken up with questions and answers.</PARA>
<PARA>  The meetings with transport operators in Queensland referred to in 1(d) were primarily question and answer sessions and provided an opportunity to discuss some of the practical problems that will need to be addressed under the national system.</PARA>
