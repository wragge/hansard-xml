<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the $2m package of assistance to South African groups, including approximately $80,000 direct to the African National Congress (ANC), announced by the Minister during his recent visit to South Africa. I ask: when is it appropriate to apply Australian taxpayers' funds to an overseas political movement? If the economic policy measures included in the package are as important as the Minister has said, why did the ANC fail to allocate to these purposes any of the $15m placed at its disposal by the Australian Government last year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4641" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is based on a false premise because the $15m that was announced last year as a three-year development assistance package was not in the form of money given directly to the ANC for any purpose it chose. As has been amply documented on the public record, that money has all-to the extent that it has already been allocated-been arranged to be administered by non-government organisations or persons other than the ANC itself. It is for a variety of purposes, including training and education and the repatriation of exiles coming back into the country who manifestly need assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason why taxpayers' money in the form of aid funds has been devoted both to that $15m package of measures that were certainly agreed in consultation with the ANC in terms of the direction in which they have been allocated and to the additional $2m package which was the subject of detailed announcement by me in South Africa last week, devoted specifically to the purposes of economic planning capacity assistance, is simply that we are engaged here not in the task, obviously, of assisting one political organisation in some looming partisan battle with other political organisations within a country but in the task of assisting a country which is in the process of nation-building.</PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a country which for all practical purposes has denied 28 million of its 38 million citizens any rights in the active participation in the affairs of that country. They have had no political voice. They have had no role in the institutional structures of the government, and the implications of that in terms of the Third World status those people now live in is there for anyone who visits the country to see. It is a deeply depressing spectacle.</PARA>
<PARA> What we are engaged in is assistance in the process of developing what is, for all practical purposes, a brand new nation-a nation not with 10 million participating citizens but with 38 million participating citizens. The assistance that is being given is quintessentially, classically, development assistance, so defined, so regarded, by the international agencies that monitor these things; and we make absolutely no apology for it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I pursue further the answer to the second part of my question, which the Minister answered first. Is it not the case that about $13 1/2m of the $15m that the Australian Government agreed to apply was for projects to be approved by the ANC, agreed over a period of three years? I therefore ask again: why did not the ANC, in negotiating with the Australian Government on the projects which it saw to be of priority, reach the same conclusions as the Minister did when he recently visited South Africa?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4641" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fifteen million dollars was for projects defined in consultation with the ANC, not approved by it. The projects were essentially of a humanitarian kind but did have, in many instances, an education and training component. The particular more recent supplementary package of $2m, which will be the subject of a supplementary appropriation and which does not in any way involve the redirection of existing aid funds, represents a wholly new policy concept-one that was devised, initiated and stimulated by the Prime Minister himself in the form of a team of economists, led by Professor Garnaut, that he sent to South Africa and asked to report to him and to the Australian Government on the ways in which we could assist the post-apartheid South African economy to in fact take off in an environment where participating in the policy making process would be a completely different group of people than had been the case previously and where it was manifestly important that those new policy makers, decision makers and economic administrators have a sound and solid grasp and standing in economic policy matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is still a development assistance exercise but a development exercise of a rather unique and distinctive kind and one which the Prime Minister should take full credit for devising. I acknowledge his role in this respect. It is a particular package of measures which was extremely well received in South Africa right across the whole spectrum-not only within the liberation movements themselves but also in the white business community, which saw much more clearly than the Opposition is capable of the point of this particular package of measures. It was also well received by the Government Ministers to whom I spoke and to whom I advised the general content of this package before it was publicly announced.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport, is prompted by calls from a road trauma expert for the introduction of improved safety features in Australian motor vehicles. Taking into account the financial and personal cost of road accidents, does the Government have any plans for the introduction of safety features, such as air bags, anti-locking brakes and better seat belts, as standard equipment in Australian motor vehicles?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4642" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided me with the following response, which honourable senators may be interested in hearing-it was news to me. The fact is that Australia's road safety record is among the best in the world. Australia has a lower rate of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles than any other country. In terms of fatalities per 100,000 head of population, Australia's safety record is just behind that of the United Kingdom and Sweden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year, road deaths in Australia were slashed by 468, or 17 per cent; in the first five months of this year fatalities are down by 52, or 6 per cent on the same period in 1990. In the past 18 months or so, the Federal Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve the safety of all Australians on our roads. It called upon all States and Territories to adopt a 10-point package of road safety measures relating, among other things, to speed, alcohol consumption and the provision of more time for young drivers to gain experience under controlled conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has also allocated $110m to get rid of 2,000 to 3,000 of the worst accident black spots in Australia. The National Road Trauma Advisory Council has been established to provide advice from a panel of eminent Australians to the Federal and State governments on road safety.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, for the first time, the Government took responsibility for Australian vehicle safety standards and these standards are among the most stringent in the world. Australia has led the world in a number of safety areas, such as seat belts and safety requirements for forward controlled passenger vehicles. The Government is determined that Australia will maintain its position at the forefront of international developments in vehicle safety.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government asked the Monash University Accident Research Centre to examine how Australian vehicles were performing in real life crashes with a view to identifying areas for improvement. Its report recommends the examination of a number of measures to improve occupant protection, and the provision of air bags is one of them. A high level committee is considering the report. It includes Federal, State and Territory motor vehicle industry and consumer representatives. The objective will be to achieve the most cost-effective protection against the background of our high seat belt wearing rates.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, dramatic developments in seat belt and other technology have offered an alternative to air bags. All round, seat belts provide the cheapest and most effective protection. Air bags are only totally effective in frontal crashes. They do not help in other types of crashes where seat belts are effective. The cost of air bags is still high in spite of the economies of scale. Air bags have to be engineered into a vehicle from the early design stages. They are not simply add-on options.</PARA>
<PARA> We will proceed rationally to analyse all the options before we come to a decision in this complex area. The Government has put into place a comprehensive test and research program to determine the real facts and the most cost-effective way to ensure that the level of safety enjoyed by Australian motorists continues to be at the forefront of international standards.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It follows the response that he gave to Senator Hill's question earlier this afternoon. What is the Government's total commitment to the African National Congress (ANC)? Is it correct that the Government has committed more than the $15m referred to and more than the $2m supplementary grant that has been referred to? How much more? What is the total? What special checks does the Australian Government have in place to ensure that the money is used by the ANC for the purposes for which it is granted?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4643" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The total direct commitment to the ANC that we made is $83,000 for the establishment of an economic planning department within the ANC, in terms and circumstances that were fully described in the text of my announcement. In terms of moneys allocated, following consultations with the ANC, the total commitment, so far as I can recall, is just the $15m over three years that was announced last year. It should be understood that the $2m that is the subject of the current announcement is not really money to be regarded as even allocated in consultation with the ANC in the same way as the $15m announced last year was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other elements in this particular economic planning assistance program involve the establishment of an institute of economic research at a selected university, a number of consultancies, visits to Australia and upgrading training at university for black economists whose training hitherto may have been only in Eastern European universities or the University of Sussex or other such equivalent institutions. That kind of program is one that will be implemented in a variety of ways and, although it has been the subject of some generalised consultation with the ANC, it has also been the subject of consultation with government officials, with economists in the private sector in South Africa and particularly economists working in a number of tertiary institutions. It is really not at all accurate to call that latter sum of $2m which I announced last week as being ANC-related money in the same way as it is possible to describe the $15m that I referred to earlier.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister did not refer to the second half of my question, which I now repeat: what special checks does the Australian Government have in place to ensure that the money is used by the ANC or by any of the others receiving these moneys that have been referred to for the purpose for which it is granted? Is it correct that the only audits carried out are internal ANC audits?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4643" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true so far as my present understanding and recollection is concerned. There is quite an elaborate system of auditing involved with all Australian International Development Assistance Bureau moneys that are expended. It varies depending on whether the moneys in question are spent through particular non-government organisations, such as the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad-which does have a significant role in relation to some aspects of this South African money-whether it goes directly to government, as is often the case in the South Pacific and South East Asia and so on, but not so much the case in the South African context, or whether it goes directly to Australian private firms and so on that are contracted directly for particular program purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The auditing arrangements differ in each case depending on the nature of the moneys paid, but they are substantial and effective. I will be happy to provide further information to the honourable senator on the specific means by which it is proposed to audit the moneys to which I have referred in this answer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot do a great deal about these things by means of direct intervention, but it is important that the Government act as a catalyst in bringing people together in industries such as this. The Government recognises the importance of this industry, as does the Opposition, I suspect. When I spoke to a seminar of this industry about two weeks ago the Opposition was represented at that seminar by its shadow spokesman for the environment, Mr Chaney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The world market for the management of waste is estimated to be about $200 billion a year. We believe that this provides many opportunities for Australian industry, both domestically and in overseas markets. For that reason, the Government has made waste and environmental management a generic technology under the industry research and development program. Grants have been made under that program to companies such as BHP, Australian Newsprint Mills, Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, Pasminco and Caltex. A wide range of inquiries about this industry are made on a State basis. The waste and environmental management technology committee was very impressed by the quality of the applications from various States.</PARA>
<PARA> I referred in my opening remarks to a seminar which took place in Canberra a couple of weeks ago. It is proposed to hold seminars in particular sectors to identify gaps in technologies and to invite proposals relating to processing of agricultural commodities, recycling of plastics and recycling alternatives to land fills. These seminars will take place over the next few months in various States. The important thing about them is that they bring participants in waste management technologies together. There are a number of Australian companies interested in this issue and capable of obtaining a slice of the international market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface my question by noting that Australia's export performance is hampered by multinational parent companies prohibiting competition between subsidiaries. Firstly, how can a foreign takeover which will affect approximately 25 per cent of the sugar market by a firm involved in price rigging in Britain not be contrary to the national interest? Secondly, what are the specific reasons for the Treasurer's finding that the proposal by Tate and Lyle to acquire Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd is not against the national interest? Thirdly, given that the Treasurer has the power to impose any conditions on foreign investment proposals, what conditions have been imposed on the Tate and Lyle bid? Fourthly, if no conditions have been imposed, why not? Finally, if the takeover is not contrary to the national interest, what benefits will accrue to the nation, given that the Queensland Government, which regulates the sugar industry, is opposed to the acquisition?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At last Senator Spindler has enlightened some Opposition senators from Queensland. Let me say, firstly, that the Foreign Investment Review Board has approved Tate and Lyle's application to make a takeover offer for Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd. The question of whether that takeover is successful or not will now be determined by the existing shareholders of the company. That is a matter which is appropriate for the marketplace to determine. Whether this is in the national interest or not has been determined by the Foreign Investment Review Board in its granting of the application to make an offer for Bundaberg Sugar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Spindler prefaced his question by suggesting it was a fact that a number of foreign companies operating in Australia operate export franchise arrangements that prevent their Australian subsidiaries from exporting to overseas countries in this region in particular; those subsidiaries have been prohibited by their parent companies from doing that. Certainly instances of that have historically taken place in Australia. I think there are fewer instances of that now than there were a few years ago, largely because of some exposure of these practices and some pressure being put on overseas companies in relation to their export activities from Australian subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the specific questions about the terms and the conditions of the Foreign Investment Review Board's approval, I will seek an early answer from the Treasurer and will provide it as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question: in view of the Minister's answer to my question, would the Minister consider changing the test of `not contrary to the national interest' to `net economic benefit to the nation' when foreign investment propositions are being assessed? Would the Government be prepared to legislate accordingly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in the fortunate position of being able to officiate at a ceremony in Adelaide last week where, on behalf of the Federal Government, I handed over all the airports-with the full support of the South Australian Local Government Association (LGA)-plus a cheque to assist that Association to provide maintenance grants for local operators to enable them to operate those aerodromes in the future. As a result of that agreement with the South Australian Local Government Association and a number of local authorities, the Whyalla Airport was transferred to the City of Whyalla, and the mayor of that city presented me in return with a 10-pound red snapper.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I told him I was glad it was the Mayor of Whyalla who was giving me the dead fish rather than the Mafia. Unfortunately, I was not able to take the fish back to Darwin with me; nevertheless, the local community was extremely pleased to get its airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as Whyalla, the 17 remaining South Australian airports withdrew from the aerodrome local ownership plan (ALOP). This transfer and withdrawal is an excellent example of cooperative effort between the Commonwealth Government and State and local governments. The basis of the agreement is that the Commonwealth has paid a total of $1.596m to the LGA, which will distribute payments to aerodromes on behalf of the Commonwealth. These payments are for airport maintenance expenditure purposes. A small amount of money will be retained by the Local Government Association for the administration of this scheme. Negotiations between the LGA and the South Australian Government concerning State Government support are continuing and the outcome of those negotiations is expected shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> This completes the transfer and withdrawal of airports in South Australia, with the single exception of Gawler. In addition, another 28 airports have withdrawn from the ALOP: five in New South Wales, 17 in Queensland, three in Western Australia, two in the Northern Territory, and one other in South Australia. These withdrawals have occurred since the new policy was announced in August 1990. As well, four Commonwealth airports have transferred to full local ownership and agreement has been reached on another one to transfer early in 1991-92. Officers of my Department have visited some 90 other local authorities to discuss the new policy and negotiate full local ownership with local communities. These visits will continue until all airports have been visited and the new policy explained to the relevant local authority.</PARA>
<PARA> The revised policy provides for the access and equity needs of smaller remote communities. The Government will provide social benefits subsidies where necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of social amenities at airports. When airport transfers or withdrawal to full local ownership are completed the Government will cease the collection of landing charges at the airport, allowing the new owners to develop their own charging regimes in line with the operating costs of each individual airport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did have one sharp exchange with the South African security official who was in charge of the arrangements for my first visit to a South African township complex. The circumstances of that exchange should be put on the record because it has been the subject of a massive amount of disinformation. The context was this: I had arranged to have a visit to the township complex of Crossroads and Khayelitsha outside Cape Town-a depressing spectacle for anyone who has any shred of decency or feeling about them because of the scale of the poverty and the immensity of the deprivation of the people there. It was an important visit to make and I wanted to make it in the company and with the guidance of two community workers-one black, one white-associated with a particular self-help program which the Embassy had been assisting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to enable the visit to take place on that basis it was agreed-and this agreement was confirmed the night before with the security authorities-that the visit would be on a low key and unobtrusive basis with a minimal police presence. Namely, it would consist of three cars: me and my wife with the two community workers in the front car, an unmarked police car immediately behind, and a third car with other Australian officials.</PARA>
<PARA> There was an unresolved question as to whether there would be a camera crew going with us. That was resolved in favour of their exclusion the following morning when we discussed it with Alan Boesak, who said that the volatility of the situation in the township was such that it would be most unwise to draw that additional degree of attention to ourselves. That was understood and agreed with the Australian media accompanying us.</PARA>
<PARA> It was on that basis that we climbed into the cars from the agreed meeting point and set off. For reasons that still remain somewhat unclear but may have been, conceivably, the result of some failure of communication between the South Africans and ourselves-but that certainly was not apparent at the time because the agreement had been reached only the night before and there had been no further developments in terms of a worsening security situation on the ground-those arrangements went completely haywire. We had not got very far into the townships before that initial three-car convoy was joined by six or seven others, complete with people wired for sound in a variety of ways and, unequivocally, members of the South African security forces of one kind or another-either the township police or the security forces more generally.</PARA>
<PARA> The media, having seen this circus parade developing, decided that all bets were off and joined in as well. So we had something like 10 cars when we made the first stop. It was at that point that I realised for the first time what was going on. An attempt to talk to local people suddenly became totally impossible because there were security people everywhere and at that point the whole visit had to be aborted. I was extremely angry about that situation developing in that way. I was angry for two reasons, the first being that I wanted the visit to be conducted in a low key and unobtrusive way because I believe that visits of this kind should not be zoo inspections: that the dignity of people ought to be respected and that their private space should not be invaded to any greater extent than is inevitable by any visit of that kind. I have a very strong view to that effect-a view manifestly not shared by those insensitive souls opposite but one that I happen to take very seriously. A much more important consideration even than that was my concern not to prejudice in any way the position of the two community workers involved. They had made it very clear indeed to me beforehand that their effectiveness-to put the point at its most mild-would be very much diminished within the community if they were seen in the presence of a large scale contingent of security people. Even those people opposite should be able to understand the dynamics that are at work in those communities and the sensitivity of people being associated with that kind of situation.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason that I was upset. That is the reason why, when we returned to the airport and the security officer in charge of arrangements came into a private room at the airport in which the only other person present, to my recollection, was the Australian Ambassador, I engaged in what I readily acknowledge was a very sharp exchange indeed. Whether I used the particular words in question I cannot recall. The emphasis-</PARA>

The concept that was advanced thereafter in the media, that the security service was doing no more than acting in my interests to protect me and that therefore it was entirely unreasonable for it to be responded to in this way, completely misses the point that this was an agreement reached jointly with the security service beforehand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I make is that the exchange that did occur was one that was made in private, in the circumstances that I have described-in a private room at the airport with no more than one other person within earshot, namely, the Australian Ambassador. The only reason that that exchange-which was, on all the evidence available to me at the time, a thoroughly justified exchange-became public was because of a deliberate leak to the media by the South African security establishment and, moreover, a deliberate leak in terms that were highly prejudicial to me and completely ignored the context in which the exchange had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian media, and obviously the Opposition, thereafter allowed the agenda to be set for it in its reading of the situation by the combined efforts of the South African security establishment and the more paranoid elements of the South African media. It was only obviously a matter of time before that kind of thing, put into the media, became a lightning rod, as I have said publicly since I have returned, to attract oceans of the kind of angst and resentment that have long been felt against Australia by white South Africans, and the rest of the trip proceeded on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA> But that is the context which should be understood and that is the reading of the situation that any reasonable non-cringing observer of the scene, anyone who believes that diplomacy should be conducted not on one's back or belly but on one's two feet, would in fact have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of the level of concern in the community about the use of force by police in raids which are connected with their investigation of suspected criminal activity or in their attempts to apprehend those who are engaging in such activity. Particularly because of the nature of the work of these special squads-the tactical response squads or the special weapons squads-around the Commonwealth, I believe there is widespread concern about their operations and a general concern that they should be restrained as much as possible in the force that they use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is mainly a matter for commissioners of police in the States and Territories. However, I am concerned because many of these squads form the backbone of those response groups for terrorists incidents, and the Federal Government involves itself in some funding for training and equipment for these particular squads.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to be able to tell the Senate that the Australian Police Ministers Council, meeting here in Canberra some fortnight ago, when dealing with the question of the use of force by police tactical response squads and special weapons squads throughout Australia, determined that there should be a putting together of a uniform set of guidelines. The police commissioners throughout Australia requested that this be done. Therefore, at both the police and political level there is a commitment to the production of these uniform guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, I acknowledge the fact that when police are in a very dangerous situation they are of course entitled to use such force as is necessary in their self-defence or in the defence of innocent members of the community. In extremely perilous situations, they can be very vulnerable to violence, particularly when they are confronting a criminal or suspect who is armed and shows some willingness to use a weapon.</PARA>
<PARA> But there is also no doubt-and this came from the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence-that there is a need for training which emphasises that violence ought to be used by police forces as an absolute last resort. Maximum restraint ought to be used up to the absolute limit where it becomes necessary for the police to use violence or even weapons in a particular instance. I believe these various concerns can be accommodated in a very clearly drafted set of guidelines. I believe the police commissioners will, with their particular squads, work on these guidelines in a way which can be brought to the Ministers for endorsement in September or October of this year so that throughout the Australian community we can have absolute confidence-as we ought to have-in our police forces when they use maximum or lethal force in particular situations where they are confronted by a violent criminal or suspect.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Family mediation services are designed to take some of the heat out of conflicts that can occur when couples are separating on the dissolution of a marriage-disputes about financial and property matters and, in particular, custody and access to children. Quite clearly, the danger of emotion overwhelming a sensible discussion between the parties in that situation is very real. For that reason, it has been thought useful to provide an alternative to the court-imposed solutions which are generally given out through the legal processes of the Family Court of Australia, and which can, of course, increase the bitterness between the parties as the court imposes its solution rather than the parties coming to a mediated solution for themselves and an agreement as to how custody or property matters might best be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this financial year the Government has allocated $1.12m for such family mediation services across Australia. This provides for some 10 services in every State, and it certainly will be maintained in real terms in the future. I have had the pleasure of opening several of those mediation services-in Sydney, Canberra, Hobart and, last week, Perth-and I believe that this process will continue.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a very good example of cooperation between the Government and community groups in this area. We provide the funding and clinical oversight. Marriage Guidance Western Australia, which is a superb organisation providing counselling, intervention in family violence situations and inappropriate sexual behaviour within family situations, is one of the most innovative and creative of the marriage counselling organisations around Australia. Certainly, it is an example of a community-based organisation providing the premises and staff. The referrals come from the Family Court of Australia, legal aid commissions, family law practitioners and others.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that mediation services, alternative dispute resolution services, are becoming more accepted and understood throughout the community whereby parties can come to a resolution of often very difficult conflicts-particularly if children are concerned in a custody or access dispute-with the aid of a neutral third party. Separating couples coming to a decision by themselves leads to sensible arrangements which can endure because the parties have actually created the solutions themselves rather than have them imposed on them.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the mediation services in the family area will continue. They will be guaranteed real funding into the future. I believe that there is every prospect that they will expand as community organisations and counselling groups provide the trained personnel for this important mediation service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the particular article in the Australian. BHP's production at Port Kembla has been reduced in the last few months because the No. 5 blast furnace has been down for repairs. They have now been completed and the blast furnace is apparently operating satisfactorily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, approximately 40 per cent of BHP's steel production is now exported-contrary to the desired strategy of the company, which was to export in the order of 20 per cent of its steel output-largely because of the downturn in the domestic economy. Last year, steel exports were valued at something in excess of $1 billion, which is quite a significant achievement for BHP. I have had representations by letter and so on about the compact steel mill proposal. I think that members of my staff have met with representatives of that consortium.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of industry measures are in place at present which may be of assistance to that venture. They were not in place at the time BHP received assistance between 1983 and 1988, the five years of the steel plan. The steel plan was introduced because of particular circumstances of the Australian steel industry in 1983, which may well have meant that the steel industry went out of business in Australia, with huge consequent effects for the cities of Wollongong, Newcastle and Whyalla. There is no such analogous situation pertaining now. A number of measures are in place which may be helpful to compact steel.

<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal recently issued a forthright statement regarding the delays in finalising the financial future of the Seven Network, to which Senator Kernot has just referred. The Tribunal stated that the group licensees and bankers had had plenty of time to remedy the breach of the 60 per cent audience limit and to put the network back on a sound financial basis. The Government supports the Tribunal's action to bring this delay to an end.</PARA>
<PARA> As has been reported, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, wrote to the Tribunal in April assuring it that the Government would not tolerate schemes which tried to evade the Broadcasting Act's ownership rules. The Minister is of the understanding that the Tribunal will write to him if it is not satisfied with the proposed sale of the Seven Network. The Tribunal has been told that if the Broadcasting Act is inadequate to ensure compliance with the spirit of the Act, the Government will legislate to make sure that the spirit and intent of the law are upheld.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 February 1991 (Hansard, 909) Senator Panizza asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the sales tax on `luxury' cars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Panizza has referred to reports that the sales tax on `luxury' cars has resulted in a revenue shortfall of $350m. Claims like this appear to be based upon an inappropriate comparison of current sales of vehicles with sales in the peak year 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA>The revenue estimate published in the 1990-91 Budget Papers of $97m recognised that the sales volume in 1990-91 would be lower than in 1988-89 and would also be affected by the tax. Also factored into the revenue calculations was a substitution effect resulting from a switch to motor vehicles not subject to the higher tax, together with an estimate of the effect on customs duty.</PARA>
<PARA>However, since the estimates were made, the cyclical downturn in the economy has had a particularly marked effect on the luxury car segment of the motor vehicle industry. The extent of the effect was not anticipated by the market or Treasury. Speculation about the future of the tax also generated uncertainty, which would also have affected demand adversely.</PARA>
<PARA>The influences mean that revenue would have been lower than the $97m anticipated from the new higher rate of sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the contraction in sales in the luxury car sector and its impact on the overall operations of vehicle importers, a reduction in the rate of sales tax on luxury cars to 30% was announced in the Government's Industry Statement on 12 March. This measure will reduce collections of revenue from luxury cars by $15m in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no proposal to replace the higher sales tax on luxury cars with other revenue raising measures to meet the Government's road funding commitments. This expenditure will continue to be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>

<PARA>The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA>It is correct that tax collections for the period July to December 1990 were $1100 million lower than expected at Budget-time. It is not correct, however, to imply that the Australian Taxation Office will try to recoup this shortfall by placing even further pressure on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. While there is evidence suggesting that some employers are failing either to deduct or remit tax instalments, Deputy Commissioners of Taxation in Offices across Australia have merely been asked to ensure that appropriate levels of enforcement are maintained in order to protect the revenue. All taxpayers are treated equally by the Australian Taxation Office and all taxes administered by the Office are administered with the aim of achieving maximum voluntary compliance while ensuring that taxpayers meet their responsibilities. By maintaining a balanced collections policy over all areas of tax collections no undue pressure falls on any one sector. The Treasurer has already indicated that the estimated Budget surplus for 1990-91 has been revised down from $8.1 billion at Budget-time to $1.7 billion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 June (Hansard, page 4507) Senator Michael Baume asked me as Leader of the Government in the Senate a question without notice about youth unemployment figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>In seasonally adjusted terms in May 1991, the total unemployment rate fell to 9.4% from 9.9% in April. However, the full-time unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds moved in the opposite direction, rising by 0.5 percentage points to 27.5%. This should not be interpreted to mean that over one quarter of teenagers were unemployed; while it is correct that 27.5% of 15-19 year olds in the full-time labour force were unemployed, these young people represent only 8.5% of all 15-19 year olds.</PARA>
<PARA>Since employment peaked in July 1990, the full-time unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds has risen by 8.9 percentage points to 27.5%. The total unemployment rate has risen by 2.4 percentage points to 9.4%.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the youth labour market has been hardest hit in this recession. The active labour market programs this Government has in place and our commitment to education and training, together with new initiatives announced in the March Economic Statement, ensure that education, training and employment opportunities are available for young people.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer you to my detailed answer to Senator Harradine's question on youth unemployment on 16 May (Hansard, page 3521) for information on these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment should start to fall after the economy begins to recover later this year. It is important that the Government remains farsighted and adopts a long term focus in addressing the unemployment problem. We must protect the skill base of the workforce and ensure that government policies assist sustainable recovery and job creation.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>On 3 June 1991 Senator Boswell asked me a question regarding arrangements for servicing and maintenance of 34 Squadron's Special Purpose (SP) Falcon 900 fleet.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I did respond to Senator Boswell in writing during the recess, I take this opportunity to provide that additional information to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Operating level maintenance, which involves routine flight line inspections and on-aircraft rectifications, for the SP fleet is performed by RAAF 34 squadron personnel at RAAF base Fairbairn. All higher level maintenance for the SP fleet is contracted to Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>This maintenance effort is conducted primarily at Hawker Pacific's facilities, but for unscheduled occurrences, Hawker Pacific can perform maintenance at RAAF base Fairbairn. Under the contract, Hawker Pacific are also required to supply consumable items, breakdown spares and sufficient repairable components to ensure aircraft availability targets are met.</PARA>
<PARA>Lastly, Hawker Pacific are responsible for maintenance of aircraft ground support equipment and management of SP fleet technical publications.</PARA>
<PARA>The current Hawker Pacific contract runs until December 1992. However, Hawker Pacific's contract can be extended for additional periods of up to seven years. The current cost of the contract is approximately $A9,700.000 but this amount will increase over time due to unscheduled maintenance arisings. The contract requires the Commonwealth to pay for unscheduled maintenance rectifications on the basis of survey and quotation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated to Senator Coulter when he raised the question of Exercise Termite Spray that I would come back into the chamber and give a full response. The answer reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In response to a question by Senator Coulter on 6 June 1991 I advised the Senate that I had asked my Department to inquire further into information provided to the Senate regarding a Defence exercise called termite spray conducted on Beecroft Peninsula in May this year. I am now able to provide the results of that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>I should say at the outset that I am very concerned that misleading advice was provided to my colleague Senator Richardson and also to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that service officers or Defence officials set out to provide misleading advice or to cover up the facts of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it is apparent that the complexity of the channels of communication between Army, Navy, the Rangers and Defence Canberra exacerbated by their geographic separation and the large numbers of people involved allowed some misunderstandings to occur.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me assure the Senate I have indicated to my Department that measures must be put in place urgently to prevent a recurrence.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the specific questions which required further explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>The first issue relates to whether or not the Army felled casuarina trees in the course of the exercise and the nature and timing of advice provided by my Department on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>On 20 May 1991 a local resident advised the Parks and Conservation Service (PCS) rangers that while walking on Beecroft Peninsula he had come across a number of stumps of felled casuarinas. He also indicated he had seen what he considered to be a number of recently felled casuarina poles on the back of an Army truck.</PARA>
<PARA>Following that advice the rangers located the stumps of a number of young trees and saplings, generally less than 20cm in diameter.</PARA>
<PARA>While trees have been cut down I must stress that investigations by Army and Navy have yielded no direct evidence that the trees were cut down by Army.</PARA>
<PARA>On 21 May Army instigated an inquiry through the commander of the relevant unit. A further inquiry was conducted subsequent to the conclusion of the exercise. On each occasion all members of the unit denied any such action.</PARA>
<PARA>There were no operational reasons for Army to fell any trees as Army vehicles on the exercise carried poles specifically provided to support camouflage nets.</PARA>
<PARA>The location of the area where trees were felled-close to a main road-and the fact that only casuarina trees were taken, a species which I am advised is used for wood-turning, does raise the possibility that these trees were illegally taken by a third party.</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of whether officers adequately responded to earlier advice provided, the sequence of events was as follows.</PARA>
<PARA>First advice to Defence that trees had been felled was on 21 May in a minute from the rangers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Navy range officer and Army personnel immediately made unsuccessful attempts to locate the stumps.</PARA>
<PARA>Defence facilities staff visited the exercise site on 22 May and were informed by the rangers of allegations that trees had been cut down. However, no evidence was shown-nor were they advised that any stumps had been located.</PARA>
<PARA>Following media comment on 24 May Navy and Army officers, ACF representatives and the media undertook an inspection of the exercise site. They too were unsuccessful in attempts to find the stumps or to contact the resident who had made the allegation.</PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of this advice, Defence in Canberra provided a briefing to my office on 29 May which stated that no evidence of tree cutting had been found. This advice was conveyed to the Senate by Senator Richardson in response to a question by Senator Coulter. At the same time, my office asked the Defence Department to double-check the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA>On 30 May Defence Canberra received copies of the rangers minutes indicating the tree trunks had been found. It was not until 31 May that the rangers actually showed Navy officers the location of the stumps.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the advice that was originally provided to the Senate-that is, that no evidence existed that trees were felled during the exercise-remains the case.</PARA>
<PARA>The second issue relates to whether or not new tracks were made by the Army during the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the majority of exercise activity at Beecroft was confined to preexisting access roads, I am advised that some new tracks were put in to facilitate access within the designated harbour area at Long Beach South.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department had provided advice to my office on 29 May that no new tracks had been bulldozed. This advice was in direct response to Senator Coulter's assertion in his media release that new tracks had been `bulldozed'.</PARA>
<PARA>Except for one small drain-crossing, topsoil was not removed, nor bulldozers used in road making. However, some new tracks were made for the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>Defence officials in Canberra were not aware of this because of the devolved management arrangements and the inspection by Canberra based officers on 21 May did not identify the tracks at Long Beach as being in any way new.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a clear breakdown in communications which I have directed my Department to rectify as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>While it is regrettable that a few incidents occurred which could and should have been avoided, overall I believe that the conduct of the exercise was consistent with the intention of appropriately managing the impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a need to review and enhance approval and monitoring procedures, drawing from lessons learnt during this exercise. That activity is already in train.</PARA>
<PARA>Lastly I undertook to examine the files with a view to tabling documents relating to termite spray. Accordingly, I now table those documents held by my office relating to the felling of trees or the creation of new tracks during exercise termite spray, as well as a copy of my letter of 4 June 1991 to Senator Coulter which gave a full description of the facts up to that time.</PARA>
<PARA>Senators will understand that in an organisation as large and complex as Defence, the occasional communication foul-up will occur. What is relevant in this case is that as soon as the facts became available, Senator Coulter was informed. There was no intention to deliberately mislead and swift action has been taken to prevent a recurrence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, these are serious issues and I wish to briefly put them in context. With Australia's economic decline, our capacity to influence events in our national interest has been significantly reduced. Even within our own region, we are not seen as being of the same consequence as we once were. Regrettably, we are becoming increasingly irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not yet identify ourselves as being part of Asia, yet Europe does not identify us as part of Europe. In economic terms, we are of the north but located in the south. We are being increasingly isolated on world bodies, whether they be economic blocs or political blocs. In these circumstances, more than ever before, a clear definition, a clear enunciation of our national interests promoted by skilled, professional diplomacy is absolutely vital. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does the impatient, arrogant, foul-mouthed posturing by Senator Gareth Evans in South Africa fit into this important national responsibility which faces Australia? His style of diplomacy, apparently calling security guards who are provided for his own safety `F-ing useless'-as we heard today and which was not denied-causes us international embarrassment. His answer to today's question was totally inadequate. There was no justification for abusing an official who had sought to protect Senator Evans's person. Yet because he was frustrated, that is the course of action he adopted and that is to our international embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances by which this remark became public are really irrelevant. Australia should expect more; it has a right to expect better of its Foreign Ministers. In addition, Senator Gareth Evans's clear refusal to listen and learn, but rather to lecture and dictate, reinforces the sort of spoilt brat's image of Australia which those such as the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir, often identify with us. Senator Evans should know better. We understood that he was going to South Africa to listen and learn, but did he do so? No. Senator Evans, in his usual style, always knows better, and he went to South Africa to tell them so. </PARA>
<PARA> His intervention in the domestic affairs of South African politics by supporting one black political movement over other black political movements also reinforces the image that we have the right to choose those who should govern elsewhere. That continues this atmosphere of arrogance. It does Australia no good. We have no right to do such a thing. We have no right to choose between the alternative black forces that might come to the fore in a democratic South Africa, but Senator Evans is of a different view which he portrays personally and in Australia's name-which is the important thing that he does not seem to understand-when representing us in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance, he went one step further and portrayed his view with Australian taxpayers' money, which locks us even further into his personal assessment of which of the black political organisations should be supported. Therefore, not only does he choose his own favourites when out of our country and in another country, but also he indicates that he is prepared to support them, to the exclusion of others, with Australian taxpayers' resources. Even his choice of the African National Congress (ANC) over all others in these circumstances is questionable. His choice of the ANC with its discredited Marxist philosophy and, until recently, its support of use of violent means and the application of violent means to achieve political objectives also tells the world something about Australia. Senator Evans's assessment of the legitimacy of the ANC and the way it operates becomes the assessment that is perceived of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister-because we are talking of his favourites in this instance-that it was the ANC in the 1980s that got the black kids out of school in South Africa and kept them out of school for years to serve its political objectives, as a result of which a whole generation of black children in South Africa went without education. This is the body that Senator Evans has chosen for the future of South Africa and which he is prepared to support with Australian taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that the international community is bemused. It is no wonder that most editorial writers in this country were embarrassingly writing last week, `Gareth, please come home'. Australia's relations with South Africa have been poor. That is understandable. We have stood with others in opposition to the abhorrent system of apartheid. Along with others, we applied sporting sanctions, economic sanctions and the like to press the South African Government to reform. We can therefore understand why relations in the past have not been good. </PARA>
<PARA> But Senator Evans needs to address the fact that apartheid is now being dismantled. Legislation was passed at the very time Senator Evans was in South Africa. President de Klerk has kept all of his promises. Everyone accepts that the next elections in South Africa will be on a multi-racial basis. Surely, in those circumstances, it is in Australia's interests to support that process of change and to rebuild its relationship with South Africa. Is that not what Australia's interests should dictate-to re-engage South Africa in the international economic community which will contribute more to the well-being of the blacks in terms of jobs, better education and the first steps towards alleviating the awful poverty that we all recognise that Senator Evans saw in the townships in South Africa?</PARA>
<PARA> Within our very limited capacity-and I stress that, Mr Deputy President, because it is totally overestimated by some-is it not within our own interests to help build bridges between the races, between the tribes and between the deeply divided society in South Africa which will give the people the best hope for a peaceful, democratic future? If those things are in our national interest-and I cannot see how they could not be-they were not advanced by Senator Evans's visit. He offered very little support to President de Klerk and the white reformers-and I mention the white reformers despite opposition that President de Klerk is still experiencing within South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans opposed lifting the economic sanctions which are now serving no other purpose but entrenching poverty. In his very public promotion of favourites, he contributed to the deepening divisions that already exist in South Africa, rather than contributing to building bridges. That is why this trip was such a diplomatic disaster. That is why it brought no credit upon Australia and that is why it did not even help South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said in his defence-if one could call it that-that this should be treated as a one-off situation, that his record in the past is not such as it was in South Africa and that in some way he should therefore receive the benefit of that fact. During my political involvement, I cannot recall a time when Australia has been in more trouble with so many of its bilateral relationships, particularly within our own region. We are experiencing problems with India, with Malaysia and with Fiji, and one can go on. Regrettably, in all those difficulties in our bilateral relations that exist at the moment and that have not existed in the past, we see a touch of Senator Evans. Senator Evans's style, as well as his confused definition of Australia's national interests and his confused priorities as to what is in our best interest in some ways have contributed to all of these difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> In justification of his South African experience, Senator Evans said that his failure to control his temper and his arrogance should be related to the circumstances of his visit. I remind the Senate that only a few months ago, in October of last year, he attacked the outgoing Indian High Commissioner, Mr Bhutani, at a conference in Melbourne. Those who attended the conference regarded it as an unbelievable performance. India had good reason to complain about Australian policy, which had seen Mirage jet aircraft sold to Pakistan when India was on its highest level of alert and the chance of war in the Kashmir was imminent. Did Senator Evans appreciate that India would be frustrated by that? Of course not. Again, it was its fault. It is always its fault; it is never Senator Evans's fault. </PARA>
<PARA> The last retort was the worst of all when, in his exchange with Mr Bhutani, Senator Evans said that Mr Bhutani did not speak for India. To say that of an Indian diplomat or of any other representative of a nation is probably the worst thing that he could say. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans has probably forgotten his attack on John Major at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at Kuala Lumpur, because again he was tired and frustrated. Interestingly enough, that was over a different perception of the appropriate policies to help South Africa with its problems. What did he say of the then newly appointed Foreign Secretary of Britain? Senator Evans described him as `ungracious to the last'. As it turned out, it was Australia's judgment which was wrong, not Britain's. Australia went into that CHOGM in Kuala Lumpur arguing for more and deeper economic sanctions to try to change the position in South Africa. History has shown that that was unnecessary: South Africa had turned the corner and what it and President de Klerk needed was support. He got it wrong, and then he abused Mr Major because he adopted a different position. It is typical of Senator Evans. Unless one is with him, one is the fool; Senator Evans is never the fool. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that Senator Evans claims that his intervention in the domestic affairs of another country is limited to South Africa, that is also not so. I remind honourable senators of what happened in the last few weeks in relation to India and his comments on the Hindu Nationalist Party, the BJP. What did he say? When he was in India he volunteered the opinion that a BJP government would be difficult to deal with and a source of concern for Australia and the region because of its aggressive nuclear policy and `enthusiasm for promoting communal tensions'. </PARA>
<PARA> In three distinct ways, this was an appalling statement. Firstly, he claimed to speak for other countries in the region, which he had no right to do. Secondly, interestingly, whilst Senator Evans was speaking for other countries in the region, Mr Advani was meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, which showed how ridiculous it was. The statement was appallingly timed, because it was a moment of national mourning, during which political activity had been suspended. Any political comments from Senator Evans were not called for, let alone a direct intervention in internal politics. Thirdly, the statement that other governments would have difficulty working with a BJP government was obviously an insult to the Indian people in their democratic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I must put on the record the fact that Mr Advani responded with greater grace when he said that Senator Evans's remarks were indiscreet and that this sort of thing was just not done. The press called it a breach of diplomatic tradition or diplomatic protocol. Senator Evans would not even accept that; he never accepts criticism. He compounded the original gaffe by calling the criticism an absurd misunderstanding of diplomatic protocol. I do not think that Senator Evans is qualified to speak on the subject of diplomatic protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans intervened in Fiji's domestic politics last year by supporting the Australian Labor Party and by being part of the decision-making process to give funds to the Fijian Labor Party. No wonder he got the response that he did from Ratu Mara. It is not surprising that he is not welcome in Fiji, not only because of that but also because of his appalling misjudgment in going to last year's United Nations General Assembly to abuse and criticise Fiji to the world community-thus losing the opportunity that Australia should have as a neighbour of Fiji of trying to build bridges within communal difficulties rather than picking sides and trying to pick winners and abusing them in international institutions and only losing respect and influence for Australia as a result. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar examples abound of Senator Evans's lack of judgment within his field. Senator Teague will speak more on the Cambodian situation. The position that he has got Australia into, which has only benefited the Khmer Rouge, is typical of his style because it is Senator Evans who always knows best. He wrote the Bible, and aptly called it the `Red Book'. He said that this was what was necessary in Cambodia. It is interesting that the pressure is now on to exclude Australia from the process. Honourable senators will have heard of the greater involvement of Indonesia, France, Japan and so forth. He again got it wrong; he again made a misjudgment. </PARA>
<PARA> We witnessed Senator Evans's promotion of this new body, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Asia, for collective security within the region. He knew better; the region did not know better. The whole of the region has criticised him for his naivety, because the region is simply not ready for a form of collective security. There is not sufficient common interest within it. He would do better to help try to build bridges within the region, but that is not the way in which he operates. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on for a lot more than the 15 minutes I have, but the issue is vitally important. His misjudgments, his failure to assess Australia's national interests properly and his appalling use of foul language when he diplomatically represents us overseas are simply not good enough and he ought to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having coped over the last few days with the combined ministrations of the South African security establishment, the South African media and the Australian media, it really was with a quite profound sense of relief that I came to Canberra last night, because Her Majesty's Opposition was always going to be the least of my worries. So it has proved to be the case with these absurd popgun assaults to which we have been listening in Question Time and now in the debate on this particular matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has demonstrated today that it has no understanding of the structure and shape of Australian foreign policy or the principles on which it is conducted. Senator Hill's speech demonstrated that the Opposition has no understanding of the dynamics of the present situation in South Africa, in particular, and what is necessary to complete effectively the reform process there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also demonstrated that it has no pride and no confidence in its own country in terms of its demonstrated willingness to score cheap political points against me and the Labor Government; to accept at absolute face value, without demur and without any willingness to explore the issues involved, the characterisation of events and incidents given by a combination of the South African security establishment and, as I have said publicly, the most paranoid elements of the South African media. As I will show, the South African media reports, which were so enthusiastically embraced by both the Australian media and the Opposition, did involve a fundamental and systematic distortion of what actually happened. Pik Botha said as much to me at the airport on my departure when he said that the media have got it completely out of perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin at the beginning with the Opposition's approach to Australian foreign policy generally. The Opposition, and, I have to say, a lot of the Australian press too, seems absolutely captivated by the `Good Relations' approach to foreign policy-the notion that good relations are ends in themselves and the notion that if there is any ripple on the surface of any relationship with any country it must reflect adversely on the conduct of Australian diplomacy. That sort of approach, as I said at Question Time, is a recipe for conducting Australian foreign policy either on one's back or on one's belly rather than on one's own two feet. I think I know-as I think the overwhelming majority of Australians know-which is the more dignified posture.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course it is the case that good relations with other countries are important, and I have striven mightily to achieve those good relations in every one of the 27 overseas visits I have made, with results that have been more or less universally acknowledged around the world-the carping of the Opposition always excluded. But good relations are not ends in themselves; they are means to ends. Good relations with other countries are means to ends, and those ends are Australia's national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I have done more-and I think it has been widely acknowledged-to define with systematic precision what exactly Australian national interests are and how they should be prioritised and defined than anyone else who has occupied this particular position. I have sought to systematically articulate them in terms of geopolitical and strategic interests, economic and trade interests and Australia's interests in being and being seen to be a good international citizen. I have sought to explain and to describe the various major world-recognised initiatives that Australia has taken in terms of those interests and in terms of that kind of prioritisation and the principles that underlie it. Cambodia, chemical weapons, Australia's role in the Cairns Group, the Uruguay Round, in pursuing the Antarctic minerals initiative, in inaugurating the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, in helping to generate a major new debate on Asia-Pacific security, and South Africa are all initiatives and specific examples of Australian foreign policy at work, not in an ad hoc or unsystematic way, but within a structured framework that has careful regard to what is achievable and what is legitimately to be regarded as the pursuit of our national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is squarely in that context that we have taken a major interest over the years as a country on the subject of apartheid. It is not a matter of our geopolitical, strategic or security interests being involved-manifestly they are not-nor is it really a matter of our economic or trade interests being involved in any but the most indirect sense. What is involved in terms of the role that we played in relation to South Africa is essentially that characteristic of our foreign policy which I have described as good international citizenship: the capacity we have as a citizen of this region, as a citizen of the Commonwealth and as a citizen of the world to play a role-a particularly significant role in the case of South Africa because of the cultural and sporting ties that exist between us-to try to rid the world of what has been its most lingering and in many ways distasteful human rights problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There are fundamental issues at stake here that go to the dignity of us all as human beings, and I make no apology for the significance that this subject has occupied in Australian foreign policy. The Australian Government's policy response to South Africa has been tough, clear, consistent and consistently right. As a country we were the prime mover in the early 1970s in the push for sanctions generally, and sports sanctions in particular, with the latter culminating in the Gleneagles Agreement of 1977. In many ways we have been a prime mover throughout the 1980s in applying and extending those sanctions, especially in more recent years, and in refining, developing and arguing the case around the world for financial sanctions limiting the flow of capital to South Africa in such a way as to inhibit the growth of the economy there-manifestly the most effective of all the different sanctions that have been applied against South Africa, as was unreservedly acknowledged to me by both business and government circles during my visit to South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Now Australia is playing the role of a prime mover-not the only one-in developing and applying the concepts of, first, the phased relaxation of sanctions generally in response to developments as they occur, not simply commitments as they are promised; and, secondly, in the selective relaxation of the sports boycott, which is a policy involving response to the unification, when achieved, of particular sports and when that unification is recognised by the relevant non-racial sporting bodies. None of that represents a policy approach which is universally liked within South Africa. Foreign Minister Pik Botha has been widely reported as saying that the Australian sanctions policy has made no impact on the South African Government except to make a mess of the country, but as Mandy Rice-Davies was once heard to say, `He would say that, wouldn't he?'. That is not an unusual or unexpected thing; it is entirely consistent with the whole policy approach that the South African Government has been adopting for years. </PARA>
<PARA> Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha-that particular group-have never agreed with sanctions, and have always preferred to fight apartheid from the comfort of the executive suites in KwaZulu rather than in the streets in the way that other groups have chosen to do. By contrast-in the case of yet another group in South Africa-the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and others perhaps to the left of the African National Congress (ANC), have not liked, from another perspective, the phased relaxation of our policy; they have not liked Australia for promoting that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that Australia could hardly expect its sanctions policy to have won universal approval, and it has not. But the truth remains that sanctions have been enormously effective, simply in making apartheid unaffordable, and have been absolutely crucial in producing the reform momentum we now see. Moreover those sanctions have manifestly been supported by the overwhelming majority of black South Africans, notwithstanding the obvious economic pain they have caused. The truth of the matter is also that sanctions go on being supported by the overwhelming majority of black South Africans to the extent that remains necessary to achieve the final destruction of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill today repeated the common mistake, which is made over and over again, by saying that apartheid is disappearing and all that is necessary is the repeal of those three pieces of legislation that are coming off the statute books in this particular South African parliamentary session. The truth of the matter is that the complete abolition of apartheid cannot and will not be achieved until the South African Constitution itself is rewritten and those 27 million to 28 million black South Africans come on to the voting rolls for the first time and become participating citizens in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition policy is hopelessly confused on the sanctions issue. It is the case that the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, when in government supported sanctions but his successors-Mr Howard and Dr Hewson-have never done so. The policy of the Liberal Party of Australia in opposition as articulated in 1989 makes it absolutely clear that the sanctions policy is regarded as counterproductive, to use the language of that particular platform, which says `the record shows that sanctions have in fact been counterproductive in achieving the desired objective'. Similarly, there is a series of statements in recent times from Dr Hewson. For example, on 14 June he said that I and the Government have been `consistently wrong' on the subject of sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not, however, a view shared by Senator Hill. As the Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs he has made it consistently clear in recent times that sanctions have achieved real change. That is a phrase he has used over and over again, most recently on 16 April when he argued that their continuation now would be counterproductive, but he did not argue about the original effectiveness of them. That is the case the Government continues to put: sanctions have been effective and in our judgment will go on being necessary for some time yet because there is a very real danger of that reform momentum being lost. There is plenty of evidence that a lot of that reform momentum has been lost already over the past six months as the South African Government has positioned and manoeuvred itself to build post-apartheid political constituencies rather than getting on with the main game. The important thing is for the world to ensure that it stays with that main game. I believe that for some time yet-not necessarily until the Constitution itself is enacted-financial sanctions in particular will be a crucial disciplinary mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as support for the ANC is concerned, we dealt with this matter pretty systematically in Question Time today. I make no apology for the political support we have given the ANC and, indeed, for the anti-apartheid movement generally over the many years it has been fighting the apartheid system. I make no apology for regarding Nelson Mandela in particular as a thoroughly decent, dignified, compassionate and moderate man. He is someone who is and who will be a great leader of his people and his nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology for believing that around him in the ANC there exists a large core of mature, intelligent, sophisticated and moderate people who will make splendid leaders of the country, should they be elected to play that role in later times. I make no apology for that part of our development assistance program which involves the expenditure of moneys on projects identified in consultation with the ANC in relation to training and education, the return of exiles and, more recently, some aspects of the project to develop an economic planning capacity within the opposition movement. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this represents support for the ANC as a political party or as a political organisation for campaigning purposes against other political parties or organisations. It is, as I said in Question Time, development assistance because South Africa is, so far as its black people are concerned, a developing nation. What we are involved in here is really nothing less than the creation of a wholly new nation out of the imperfect ashes of the old. It is in that context that Australia's support is being directed and it is in that respect that it is being welcomed. We have chosen to work primarily, but not solely, through the ANC as an opposition organisation simply because on all the available evidence it is and remains the most representative black organisation of all. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the circumstances of this visit are concerned that have given rise to the various diatribes we have heard today and the last part of the matter of public importance before us, in the time available and given the number of misrepresentations and sheer falsities that have been involved in various assertions, I would find it difficult to know where to begin in setting the record straight. One way of approaching this question would be to adopt what might be described as the Chief Buthelezi principle-that attack is the best form of defence-and to refer to some of the information I have had about the way in which Dr Hewson conducted his foray into foreign affairs recently in China. I still remember a very senior Chinese official wincing as he told me about the clumsy ineptitude with which Dr Hewson had approached the human rights issue and related matters in the course of his consultations recently with senior Chinese leaders.</PARA>
<PARA> I could go down that particular track, and I assure those opposite that I have plenty of ammunition, but I prefer not to do so. I prefer simply to make the point, as I did in Question Time, that there is essentially only one thing that went wrong on that South African trip from which everything else followed when a highly prejudicial version of the incident in question was deliberately released to the South African media. I have described the circumstances of the incident involving the breach of an agreement, reached as recently as the night before with the security police, in circumstances which caused me a great deal of distress, in particular because of the adverse implications for two community workers whose future effectiveness I held as a very important thing to be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made clear that any response I may have made to the security people, given my distress at the situation, was in private. The fact that it became public was none of my doing. Moreover, it is worth saying that in four subsequent township visits I made to Soweto, Alexandra, Soshanguve and Port Elizabeth, the arrangements-lest there be any lingering feeling that there was something odd about the arrangements for that first day-proceeded on exactly the basis that had been originally negotiated and were reconfirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> The point remains that, for all the bumps that occurred during that trip, its basic objectives were met. It was highly successful in terms of the various objectives we identified before we left. We wanted to inform ourselves as to the current conditions and political currents running in that country in order to provide an input into the larger policy process within the Commonwealth and elsewhere over the next few months. We wanted to take the opportunity to make clear our and the international community's intense concern that, while major changes were occurring, they should continue through to fruition. We wanted to develop the foundation for a sound bilateral relationship in the future with the likely future leaders of that country, black and white. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in all those objectives we amply succeeded. Nelson Mandela made it perfectly clear that, so far as he and the ANC were concerned, I had made many more friends among South Africans during my visit than I had had before I arrived. So far as Pik Botha is concerned, in his departure press conference he said, `I believe that relations between the two countries will further improve as a result of this visit'. Perhaps I can offer as further testimony a source that the opposite side would regard as unimpeachable, and that is the South African Ambassador to Australia, Mr David Tothill, who accompanied me for much of this trip. On ABC radio at lunchtime today he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think from our point of view and also from Australia's point of view it was a good visit.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that there were diversions but they came with a happy ending. Describing the meeting I had with Ministers, including Ministers Botha and Viljoen and Finance Minister du Plessis, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the chemistry at that meeting was very good indeed. Senator Evans expounded Australian Government policy as did the South African Ministers South African policy, but they interacted well. I think it was a fruitful meeting. It was the first time that Pik Botha had met Gareth Evans. As you say, both are men of decided views and both are, I think, highly intelligent men -</PARA>
<PARA>may Hansard record a blush at this point-</PARA>
<PARA>with slightly different styles. I think they sized each other up and came to the conclusion that each was a worthy opponent.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the final paragraph of Ambassador Tothill's comments, which is in response to a question about those incidents. It makes the point that from his point of view, from every point of view, it was a very effective visit. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Tothill: I don't really want to get into those incidents because they were quite peripheral to the substance of the visit. I know that the media, both South African and Australian, beat themselves into a frenzy, for them these slight incidents provided entertainment. I think everybody was slightly amused but they didn't interfere with the progress registered during the course of the visit. Senator Evans I think came away from South Africa with his eyes opened to South African realities, and his South African interlocutors, including Pik Botha, obtained off Senator Evans the impression of a highly intelligent, highly able Foreign Minister who articulates Australian Foreign policy very effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It cannot be said that the trip to South Africa by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) was an unmitigated success, but neither can it be said that it was a disaster. What did we all expect? After 40 years of isolation and vilification by Australian governments of all political persuasions, what were the South Africans going to do? Were they going to welcome with open arms and joyous greetings the first Australian Minister to visit the country after all that time? That is not what I expected. I expected South Africans to have a go at Senator Evans at every possible opportunity, and that is exactly what they did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should have come as no surprise to the Opposition, and to some of the mainstream media also, that this diplomatic visit resulted in controversy. It took place under difficult circumstances. Instead of focusing on those few instances of embarrassment and disorder that arose on the visit, the Australian Democrats believe that the Parliament would have been better served today if we had debated the challenges to Australia-South Africa relations-if we debated anything at all, as this is our last week of sitting in this session-and how best this country is placed to help South Africa back into the world community of nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly it would be fair to acknowledge that the Foreign Minister's visit was deserving of greater support from this Parliament. I think I can say that it does reflect the Minister's personal commitment to the issue. It was, of course, the first visit by an Australian Foreign Minister in more than 40 years, and in many ways it was an opportunity we just could not pass up. The Democrats believe that it makes good sense to encourage the South African Government to respond more positively to major reforms as they are introduced. In this context, international recognition and greater acceptance by the world community will play an important part in the changes in South Africa. That is why it is important that the Foreign Minister's visit took place. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as Australia played a key role in Commonwealth sanctions being implemented against South Africa, so it is important for this country to be in a strong position to be able to influence Commonwealth opinion about when sanctions should be lifted in response to reforms, and not too soon. The Foreign Minister's visit will now provide him with an excellent opportunity to give a more realistic assessment of Australia's attitude towards the lifting of sanctions at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Zimbabwe in October. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent decisions by the United States Administration and the European Community in relation to South Africa also made it important that the Foreign Minister went to South Africa when he did. The decision by the European Community to lift its ban on imports of gold, iron and steel from South Africa put an onus on countries such as Australia and groups such as the Commonwealth to justify why there should be no change to the sanctions policy. Without the information the Foreign Minister has gathered on his mission to South Africa, Australia would quite obviously have been at a disadvantage in both international affairs and trade terms. In other words, it was in Australia's international interests that the visit went ahead and was supported by all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans is not renowned for his even temper, although I must say that, given the circumstances leading to his altercation with a member of the South African security forces after the motorcade through the township, I imagine it would have taken someone with the temperament of a saint not to react very strongly in private. Having the temperament of a saint is another character trait not usually associated with Senator Evans. Mother Theresa might have coped without raising her voice; I do not think I could have and I do not think Senator Hill could have either. It is unfortunate that Senator Evans's language was not a little more temperate, but he was speaking in private and we have to keep that in mind. The unacceptable behaviour in that case was that of the South African security man who went to the media with details of a private conversation. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the grant to the African National Congress, it is, I believe, a result of recommendations by a delegation, headed by Professor Garnaut of the Australian National University economics department, which visited South Africa quite recently. That delegation also recommended that the rest of the grant be used to set up an institute of economic planning at a South African university and to pay for scholarships, training and consultancies. Rob Rasche, the correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in South Africa, identified some problems with some of that aid. He said on AM last Saturday that there have been early suggestions that some of the aid has been badly spent and, obviously, there was little consultation with other important black movements as to how it would be best applied. Mr Rasche also commented on Australia singling out the ANC. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans was rounded on for calling the ANC the most representative organisation in the country, a fact so obvious it's inescapable to any serious observer. That upset Inkatha and the Government, but given their long-term plan to form a coalition to try to secure power, that's to be expected. Senator Evans' assessment was based on plenty of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>The most important and fundamental points of interest about Senator Evans's visit to South Africa are not concerned with yelling at a security officer in private but rather with the details of the Foreign Minister's discussions with black and white leaders and with his own experience in visiting townships. When will the Internal Security Act be amended? How fast are reforms progressing? That is the sort of thing we want to know about. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up much more of the Senate's time. I will finish with a small piece from today's Australian Financial Review editorial, entitled `No time for diplomatic niceties'. It concludes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As the trip was predictable and is likely to be forgotten in the coming surge of diplomatic visitors to South Africa, the senator's temper had its uses in ensuring that South Africans, particularly white South Africans, will not easily forget our foreign minister. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Evans' basic message is not one that white South Africans want to hear, the trip may well have done some good.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to South Africa was a disaster and an embarrassment to him personally, to his Government and to Australia. It was ineffective for four reasons. Firstly, he interfered with the internal political affairs of South Africa by selecting only one political party-the African National Congress (ANC). It is a failure of politics. If any country tried to do that in our region we would call it interference, for that is what it is. Secondly, he lectured and abused his host in South Africa to his own and to Australia's discredit. It is an abysmal failure of diplomacy and yet this is the first diplomat of Australia, so-called-the Foreign Minister of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, naively, he failed to ensure that reasonable and sound checks were in place to ensure that the $15m grant to the ANC and the further $2m grant to the ANC that the Minister has just announced would in fact be spent for the purposes that even he has defined. This is a failure of ministerial control. If there is time I will come back to that matter and refer to the review report of the special assistance program for South Africans and Namibians published just three months ago within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau which shows that there is a failure, that there are insufficient checks and that the Minister's answer to my question during Question Time today is totally inadequate and amounts to a misleading of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, there was a failure, demonstrated in the media over recent days and in the Senate here today, by Senator Evans to apologise or to see himself as being in any way at fault with regard to any of his activities in South Africa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has walked out; he is no longer in the chamber to hear the Senate's debate on his appalling mistakes and the disaster that his visit has meant for Australian diplomacy in South Africa. He has roundly abused everyone except himself. Mr Deputy President, did you hear his remarks at Question Time? He abused even the Opposition. He abused the Australian media. He abused the other blacks of South Africa who are not members of the ANC and he even abused his host, the South African Government, and the security officials in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He has failed to be accountable. I am afraid that we have seen such behaviour in his actions in relation to India, Cambodia, Fiji, the Asia-Pacific region and so on. It is yet again demonstrated to the world that it is a trait in Senator Evans's conduct as Foreign Minister to go to a country and offend that country through the kinds of disastrous activities that I have just outlined. To claim, as he did in his speech today, that he was just opposing apartheid and that that was sufficient excuse for all of his mistakes is, frankly, an insufficient excuse. We all oppose apartheid. The question is: what policies have we put in place, what policies do we espouse and in what manner do we, by our personal and government activity, pursue those policies to see the effective end of apartheid? There has been a great gulf between the Opposition's approach to how to end apartheid and this Government's approach. The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has rightly described some aspects of Senator Evans's visit to South Africa as an attempt to catch up with the Opposition's more productive approach to see the end of apartheid. It is certainly no excuse for Senator Evans just to claim that he was doing all of these things and making all of these errors in the name of opposing apartheid.</PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the case of Senator Evans offending India. In August last year he went to India and not only offended the Government of that country but also the journalists of both Delhi and Islamabad. When he was corrected in Australia over the way he had misled both India and Pakistan, he again blamed the journalists and the Government. When I asked him in November last year whether he had received a letter of complaint from the Foreign Minister of India he replied, `I do not recall'. The kind of behaviour that we have seen from Senator Evans in South Africa is the kind of behaviour we saw from him in India last year and which he has demonstrated in so many other instances. He has become an embarrassment to the Hawke Labor Government and I believe--</PARA>

Those opposite have been apologists for South Africa for longer than many of us can remember-with the honourable exception of the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, who, if most of them could get their way, they would expel from the Liberal Party forthwith because he has been the only Liberal in 30 years who has had the guts to stand up to South Africa on the issue of apartheid. The rest of those opposite have ummed and ahed and nibbled and nitpicked, but none of them have had the guts to put squarely on the record their opposition to apartheid with sanctions that count. All they have done is whinge and whine and complain about Malcolm Fraser. It has been a disgrace to the Liberal Party, and to many Liberals who campaign openly against apartheid, that their parliamentary representatives have consistently run away from taking some tough action against South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not claim to be an expert on South Africa although I did have an opportunity to visit that country briefly earlier this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I certainly will. As I say, when we are dealing with an abnormal society, we are going to get abnormal responses. When we deal with people who have justified the most racist society in the twentieth century, of course they are going to take every opportunity to abuse those people who, in the international forums, have opposed that system, have proselytised against it and who have put forward processes of direct action to bring that system down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us make no bones about it: if it were not for the international sanctions, apartheid would not now be in the process of being dismantled in South Africa. It is because of international sanctions that the system has fallen down. Members of the white society in South Africa will admit that quietly and privately but they will not say it publicly. Their economy was being wrecked by sanctions. They have had to give up the system for purely economic, not altruistic, motives. They could see that in the end even their standard of living was going to go down the gurgler. I think we ought to understand and not beat around the bush with the apologists opposite who scream all the time for the end of sanctions, that international sanctions have brought the end to the apartheid system. </PARA>
<PARA> It also has to be remembered that tens of millions of black people have bravely and with great dignity, despite the fact that they have had to exist under one of the worst governmental systems in modern history, been able to conduct a protest campaign, even if at times there has been violence because of the violence directed against them, to help to bring that system down. It is true that a number of white people dislike what Gareth Evans said and it is true that some black people dislike what he said. But there is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of black people cheered Gareth Evans to the echo for his strong remarks in attacking apartheid in South Africa. He is a hero of the black majority-the majority of South Africa-in the black townships. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I think this matter of public importance is a mealy-mouthed typical piece of liberal wimpishness from people who think that the only way we can conduct foreign affairs is by doing nothing. That is not the way we achieve change in the world. We have to be active and at times take a risk in getting those changes made. We could be like Senator Hill and all the other Liberal shadow Ministers of foreign affairs who have sunk without trace in the last couple of years and have not achieved anything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would be delighted to. Let us then examine the sorts of things that Senator Evans has done to shame this nation. It could well be said that Senator Evans marches to the beat of a different drummer. He certainly is not in step with the rest of the people of this nation who find his behaviour absolutely contemptible. Even members of his own Party were not in the chamber to give him any backing until the Whip sent out the message, `Bring some people in here at least to pretend we are supporting him'. As a Foreign Minister, he is supposed to ensure good relations with our neighbours and our trading partners and safeguard the interests of Australia and her citizens. What is his record? In his so-called defence he said to the nation at large, `Of course good relations with other countries are important but what I think and what I `-that is, Senator Gareth Evans, otherwise known as `Biggles-goes-to-Africa'- `want to impose is more important'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy President had to ask that the Minister be heard in silence. Silence he can command; respect he cannot and will not. The brash nature of his self-defence was no answer at all. His behaviour is simply indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of the Minister's confused interpretation of the Australian national interest. The Minister can rage upon the stage as he will. He can promote his own self-imagine as he will.-But let us look at a country close to us, a country with which our relationship is in tatters-and I refer to Malaysia. Last week in that country Malaysian television was running an anti-Australian campaign, the like of which has probably not been seen since the campaign to buy British last. We have seen a complete insensitivity by this Minister in respect of the handling of Malaysia. Not only have we re-run the second series of Embassy, which on 13 November Senator Evans admitted was a major component in our bad relations with that nation, but also the fight between Hawke and Keating has led to the Prime Minister cancelling his London meeting, which was to have included a meeting with Prime Minister Mahathir. That meeting having been cancelled as the result of an internal brawl, our relations have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> The anti-Australian campaign has resulted in major setbacks to Australian trade patterns. A major contract worth some $160m has been lost simply because of the attitude that Malaysia presently has to Australia. Senator Hill made the point that the behaviour of Senator Evans is that of a spoilt brat and that is exactly the way that Malaysia presently portrays Australia's attitudes. Last year and during the course of this year I have mentioned the behaviour of the Australian Customs Service. I have spoken about the way in which two of its officers behaved in relation to seizing and keeping documents in the face of a High Court of Malaysia order. This almost resulted in extradition proceedings and damage to the five-power defence arrangement. Senator Walters said, by way of interjection when Senator Evans was speaking, that his defence was the kind that we were used to hearing from our children: `They made me do it, mummy; it wasn't my fault'. Senator Evans, out of his own mouth said, `None of it was my doing. Somebody told on me'. He then went on to quote the Ambassador to South Africa as somehow defending his honour-what an extraordinary thing for a man to do! The Ambassador to South Africa was showing up the Foreign Affairs Minister. Indeed, he demonstrated that he knew how to behave and how to try to salvage something out of the ruin that was the visit to South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and again we see the manner in which foreign affairs are conducted being reflected in the way the whole Department is administered. Not only do we see the behaviour of some of our ambassadors reflecting the high-handed attitude of the Minister but also we see our relations deteriorating in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of his address Senator Hill pointed out our geographical situation, how we live in the Pacific region, and how we need to have good relations with our neighbours. He dealt with the current visit to South Africa as what had become the epitome of the behaviour of the Foreign Affairs Minister. Senator Teague has dealt with the ramifications of that behaviour in India, and I am now dealing with the ramifications of that behaviour in Malaysia. Yet what we hear from those opposite are interjections that somehow it does not matter, that somehow it is all right. </PARA>
<PARA> When questions are asked of the Foreign Minister about the seriousness of the situation and the way in which these problems are being tackled, we get a glib answer, `We sweep it under the carpet and pretend it does not matter'. Perhaps Senator Evans thinks he ought to be conducting the Senator Evans Charm School of Good Diplomacy. I would have thought the things he ought to learn-and needs to learn-are patience, tolerance, good manners and negotiating skills. In his defence today, the Foreign Minister showed quite clearly that, firstly, he possesses none of those attributes, secondly, aspires to none of them and, thirdly, does not mind very much whether others follow him or not--</PARA>

I suppose in this chamber we ought to be profoundly relieved that Senator Evans has not taken to throwing things at other senators.

One could say that he said today that the end justifies the means. The end of his diplomatic foray would justify his either being sacked or resigning. It certainly does not justify his remaining in office. He owes an apology not only to those people whom he insulted but also to the Australian people because he has brought them into ill repute. Other people in the region see that he is the man who represents this nation.

It is a very lengthy document with numerous advances as we approach the end of the financial year. There are four or five that I wish to mention in the very limited time available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> At least two of the advances highlight the significance and depth of the recession that we were not going to have-the engineered recession that the former discredited Treasurer, Mr Keating, brought upon us. One of those relates to an additional requirement for child-care fee relief. The other relates to additional payments required for vocational training and income support for persons affected by structural change in particular industries or regions. </PARA>
<PARA> The first one, dealing with child-care, seeks an additional $2.9m by way of additional urgent and unforeseen expenditure to cover late advances and additional adjustments for the period April 1991 to June 1991. The main reason why it was unforeseen-according to the Department-is the strong evidence that the amounts required are the direct outcomes of this recession. The Department of Community Services and Health says that the trend of reduced incomes of families using child-care and the increased utilisation of family day care could be direct effects of the recession. This is not the first month in which similar additional payments have been required for this purpose, if my memory serves me correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very significant indicator of the depth of the recession, as is the fact that an additional $0.5m is being required by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, as I said earlier, for vocational training and income support for persons affected by structural change in particular industries or regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite having three goes at getting this figure right this financial year, this late in the year requirement has been brought forward, according to the Department, because the earlier attempts to get the figure right did not foresee the large numbers of retrenchments in industry-particularly those in the passenger motor vehicle industry-that have occurred in recent months. There is much more one could say on those but they are both significant indicators of the extent of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The third advance I want to comment on-and I think the Senate will be hearing a lot more of this because it is a classic example of a waste of government money-is a requirement for an additional $1.8m to meet the costs of the compilation and distribution of the energy guide to every household in Australia. I will not go into the details, but people will remember getting this guide in their letterbox in recent times. It was an absolute waste of money. It was trying to show people how to save energy. That is a desirable thing in its own right but the involvement of the Government in this was just extraordinary. That figure, I might point out, is not a final cost, nor does it appear to include the cost of postage to 5 1/2 million households in Victoria. At something like 80c a stamp, that is a very significant additional amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to two items relating to the payments to meat inspectors in Victoria who have been made redundant. The first is a payment of $450,000 to 10 Victorian meat inspectors who have been made redundant. The second is a figure of $890m which the Commonwealth of Australia is loaning to the Government of Victoria to enable it to make the appropriate separation payments to those 10 officers. I doubt whether we have ever had a more classic example of how broke the Kirner Government has made the State of Victoria. The Victorian Government has to borrow $890,000 from the Commonwealth to enable it to meet its superannuation redundancy pay-outs. That is absolutely extraordinary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Advance to the Minister for Finance document, as did my colleague Senator Short. I make reference particularly to the last item he raised-that is, the superannuation pay-outs to the redundant Victorian meat inspectors-and also to the loan arrangements that have been put in place for the Victorian Government. The activities occurring in that State are a classic example of the misuse of funds into an industry that has been continually abused and downgraded. We find the Commonwealth being forced to lend moneys to a State government when I believe, if that is the track that has to be gone down, the responsibility should be that of the State Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look for a moment at what is happening in the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS). When we examine what is occurring there, we find that the workload in the meat industry has been significantly reduced as a result of the blatant abuse of both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, resulting in the drop-off in Australian exports and the very significant cuts in export revenue to this country from the lack of exports from this great country of ours. That figure now is in excess of $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> Setting aside for the moment the problems that exist within AQIS and the need to restructure and commercialise that organisation-in fact, I would go one step further and privatise it-had those losses not occurred, and had there not been the abuse that has occurred consistently in the meat industry, I believe that under the current structure it would not have been necessary to make these people redundant. This is a side effect of a show that has been running for some 15 to 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> When are we going to get a positive policy statement from the Government for the future direction of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service? Are we going to see the roles of quarantine and inspection separated and run as separate operations? Is it going to continue as the muddled operation that it is at present? What happens now in that industry? For example, in my State of Western Australia, where the domestic inspection and the export inspection are separated, for domestic inspection the cost is $44,000 gross per year per man whereas for export inspection done through the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service it is $65,000-in effect, another $21,000 per man doing the same job to provide a service. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time I have to speak, I emphasise the point that I think it is an absolute disgrace how broke a number of the State governments in this country are. In this case it is Victoria, but the situation existing in Western Australia, which we will be talking about shortly, is no different to that which exists there. I find it totally untenable that we find, slid in here under this allocation to the portfolio of Primary Industries and Energy, a loan to a State government to carry out a responsibility which is essentially the responsibility of that government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I can say, if you like, that I am speaking on item 1, but the documents are entwined in a way in which they really cannot be separated. So I will speak to document No.1 and have another go on document No. 2.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Document No. 1 lists that there is an allocation of moneys to the Australian Federal Police sought. The reason given is:</PARA>
<PARA>An additional $207,000 is urgently required to meet expenses expected to be incurred within the next month. </PARA>
<PARA>The application is dated 23 May. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>This amount includes claims on hand and further compensation and legal claims expected to be received and become due for payment before 6 June. </PARA>
<PARA>In the explanation as to why the requirement from the AMF is required, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The level of expenditure in the compensation and legal item in the year to date has been greater than anticipated. Historically, this has been a difficult item in which to forecast the level and timing of payments. </PARA>
<PARA>There is something rather inconsistent about those two statements. The first is that we urgently require money to meet expenses which we expect to be incurred within the next month-not that we know we have incurred or that we have received but that we think we might incur. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the page it says that it is desperate that we get the money because it is really rather difficult to calculate. None of those reasons are acceptable reasons for an Advance to the Minister for Finance to be drawn upon. If I look at some of the other applications and the reasons why these matters are either urgent and unexpected or in one of the other categories acceptable, at a cursory glance-and we only get these documents a little while before we have to speak on them-the payments seem to be becoming easier to get. I find it very worrying to think that such a practice might be slipping in. </PARA>
<PARA> In Estimates I asked whether we could have a list of all the unsuccessful applications for Advances to the Minister for Finance to be drawn down so that we could see those departments which are able to properly prepare their accounts, both for the Budget Session and the Supplementary Estimates hearings. I think a practice that ought not to be countenanced, nor tolerated, is departments thinking that they can improperly prepare their Budget forecasts and get away with making applications to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. It is important that all members maintain the scrutiny of these documents on a regular basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw attention to two matters in the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The first, relating to the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio, is the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Additional funding is required because it was not expected by the Government that this agency would be operating on its own account at the time of the Budget. But, as a result of pressure from the Opposition, that agency is now in place, and legislation which was not ready to go through the Parliament was hurried through at the end of last year on the Opposition's insistence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention this matter because of the news at the weekend that Mr Martin Vinnicombe, an Australian cyclist, claimed that he had been harassed by the Australian Sports Drug Agency in respect of his drug testing, which provided a positive result and resulted in his being suspended for two years and turning professional. I understand that it is not correct for him to claim that he had been subjected to unfair testing by the Australian Sports Drug Agency. On the contrary, I understand that normal testing has proceeded and that there are automatic requirements for testing when a world time is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the random testing that the Australian Sports Drug Agency undertakes, I am assured that there has been no harassment and no unfair concentration on Mr Vinnicombe whatsoever. The Australian Sports Drug Agency has been behaving in an entirely proper way in this matter and should be commended for ensuring that people who seek to cheat on their country and their competitors should not be allowed to get away with it, no matter how high their status has been in a sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to refer to relates to the Antarctic Division of that same Department. Mr Acting Deputy President, you have raised this matter consistently and are to be commended for your continual criticism of the contracts entered into by this division relating to the Aurora Australis and the general polar research program. The Additional Estimates indicate that another $74,043.35 is to be paid to P&amp; Polar Australia Pty Ltd by the division for lay-up costs. This is the first time such a charge has been required to be paid by the Commonwealth. I believe that it is a disgrace that the Commonwealth is paying this. It indicates the sloppy way this contract was entered into and it confirms everything that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have said on this matter. It follows the extra $34,000 that, as I recall, you have pointed out is required to pay for the ice pilot that was not provided for in the original tendering. According to the back-up papers:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Division is liable for ``lay up'' costs should the P&amp; Polar Australia Pty Ltd not be able to charter the vessel in the winter season. As no work has been found for the RSV Aurora Australis during the 1990-91 winter season P&amp; Polar has requested payment of $74,043.35 in lay-up costs for the period up to 30 April 1991. This payment was due for payment on 14 May but was delayed because of negotiations concerning the amount to be charged. Payment, however, is now due. Lay-up costs were not included in the 1990-91 Budget as there was considerable uncertainty as to the amount that would be required should the RSV Aurora Australis not be not chartered.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, it is unacceptable for the Government to behave in this way if it does not know what it is doing when it enters into contracts like this. If it does not provide for appropriate losses in the Budget, it is pretty tawdry management to come along here and fang another $74,000 out of the taxpayers of Australia to cover up for incompetent contracting. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this document, the Supporting Applications from the Advances to the Minister for Finance, I want to elaborate a little more on the final issue that I was talking about in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, to which Senator Crane also referred-namely, the loan to Victoria of $890,000 to finance that State's payment of redundancy payments to 10 Victorian meat export inspectors. As Senator Crane said, it is due essentially to the fact that the industry in Victoria has been run down to an unbelievable extent, a run-down that has been caused almost entirely by the actions of one man, Mr Wally Curran, and his union, the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the extraordinary situation whereby the Commonwealth Government has decided to make a loan to the State Government of Victoria of $890,000 to enable it to meet some superannuation or redundancy payments. The fact that the State of Victoria is so broke that it has to go to the Commonwealth to find that amount of money for that purpose is, I believe, without precedent in Commonwealth history. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just say a couple of words about the meat industry. In doing so, I compliment my colleague Senator Winston Crane for the way in which he has been following this issue and pursuing it in the Parliament. I believe that the situation with the meat industry dispute in Victoria is the most extreme example of deliberate bloody-minded chaos caused by a union that we have had in Australia for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 18 months ago, Victoria had 27 operators servicing one of the Australia's biggest export markets-namely, the meat industry. At last count, that figure is down to six and there are some real doubts as to how long they will be able to continue. In the last 12 to 18 months, strikes in the industry have averaged one working day in every three. The cost to the country is more than $1m in lost exports from Victoria alone. The situation is such that, with bizarre working practices-which include a five-hour working day because of the tally system and a range of other activities which greatly inhibit the operations of the industry, once one of Australia's most thriving, vital industries and a vital industry for our future-that industry has been brought to its knees by the activities of that union in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much more one could say about that matter, including, in particular, the very close relationship that Mr Curran has with the Premier of Victoria, Mrs Kirner. Allegations have been made in the Victorian Parliament that have not been refuted. The Victorian Government's submission to the Harrison inquiry into meat industry reform was shown to the union before it was submitted to the inquiry. The union made 13 or 15 proposed amendments to the Victorian Government's draft submission, virtually all of which were accepted so that the industry would appear in a whitewash situation. They are very serious allegations and have never been denied. They are indicative of the clandestine nature of the relationship between people like Mr Curran and the Victorian Government, which are a major source of the problems confronting that State. </PARA>

I will also refer to what has been happening to the meat industry and its extension in a large way into Western Australia. This $890,000 is really just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the money that it has cost because of the continuing abuse of the legal processes which exist in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the abuse, I refer particularly to the Harrison inquiry into meat industry reform and will point out where we are now. I request the Government to come clean as to its position. It is all very well to slide an $890,000 loan under the back door to enable the Victorian Government to clean up some of its mess. Prior to leaving for overseas the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) wrote to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and requested that it adjourn the hearing to allow the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) to come back in. At the same time, Martin Ferguson, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), said that the Victorian Government and the Australian Government are supporting its position, which is to operate outside the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the ACTU requested this inquiry. It has been running over a period of 15 months or so-months and months of hearings costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Both the ACTU and the AMIEU have breached their agreement not to become involved in industrial action during the term of this inquiry. Union officials have been on an around the world junket-once again at the cost of taxpayers-to collect evidence about best world practices when that information is already well documented and available in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the ACTU and the AMIEU walked out of the inquiry with just three days to go. The Government is trying to intervene to have the inquiry adjourned when there is just a short time to go before the inquiry brings down its report. At the same time the ACTU, which requested the inquiry in the first place, is operating on the outside. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this advance is supplementing quite disgracefully the position of the Victorian Government. The point I make is that it is really the tip of the iceberg of costs that have been foisted upon Australian taxpayers. This dispute extended last week in a large way into my State of Western Australia. Lambs were yarded in Perth for five days, purely and simply because the people involved at Robb's Jetty decided to adopt the same tactics that have been consistently adopted in Victoria.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of Report No. 29. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall speak very briefly to this motion. It is important, even though we have a great deal of legislation on hand, to note that the Auditor-General has found considerable scope for criticism of this program on which, by the way, the Government has relied heavily in its propaganda about how it is allegedly resolving the problems of the unemployed in the recession we had to have and the unemployment we apparently also had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that these schemes are not meeting the demands that have been created by the Government's incompetent economic management. The Auditor, briefly, has made these findings as a result of his investigation of this scheme. While the Audit Office found that Jobtrain improves the employment prospects of disadvantaged job seekers, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the extent of Jobtrain's contribution to improved employment prospects is uncertain at present. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the much vaunted Government program that was going to fix everything: it is uncertain at present. There is considerable scope for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of program administration. One of the key findings of the audit states:</PARA>
<PARA>The decentralised administration of Jobtrain has not been supported adequately with guidelines and advice to the CES network. There is significant variation in practices between States and Areas, and scope to improve administration based on best practice principles. </PARA>
<PARA>Other findings state:</PARA>
<PARA>While the program design, which integrates Jobtrain with other labour market programs, is sound, limited flexibility of targets and budgets restricts performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Target setting for Jobtrain activities is not directly linked to desired outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Course acquisition processes, including forward planning, specification of requirements, tendering and selection procedures all need to be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . over half the Jobtrain participants were unemployed for less than six months prior to their selection for courses. Better targeting is needed. </PARA>
<PARA>This was supposed to fix up problems for the long term unemployed; yet we see that over half of the participants were unemployed for less than six months. The Auditor further found:</PARA>
<PARA>Linking of courses to meet the skills needs of individual jobseekers is rare, and post-course assistance is not provided in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the `dramatically successful' scheme the Government has trumpeted about so much. The Auditor does note:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations arising from Departmental reviews of Jobtrain have not been adequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>There is scope for better evaluation of program outcomes, including comparisons with other labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>I am particularly concerned about that last point. I think it was in 1987 or 1988 that the youth scheme was incorporated into this new scheme. According to the Auditor-General, this was apparently done without any detailed Government guidance at all. The Auditor-General makes the point that policy guidance for Jobtrain is incomplete. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is to have major unemployment in a major recession that we had to have and that was all engineered, could it not have engineered its job schemes a little better? Does it have to engineer such high levels of unemployment anyway? It seems to me that the findings of this Auditor-General's report are matters of major concern. I am glad to see that the Department of Employment, Education and Training agrees with the Auditor-General in many areas and that it will pursue these faults that have been pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention in passing that when we look at schemes such as this we very much need the Auditor-General's advice. He points out, for example, that the published running cost data of Jobtrain underestimates the cost of administering the scheme since resource expenditure by the CES network in support of Jobtrain is omitted. He establishes that the cost is several million dollars higher than outlined by the Government. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of Report No. 35. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address one particular aspect of the Auditor-General's Report No. 35-the potential erosion of accountability to the Parliament-presented to the Parliament today. I share the concerns of the Auditor-General about the removal of accountability and the weakening of Parliament's role in the scrutiny and reporting on activities of public sector enterprises. I agree with him that this removal of public scrutiny appears to be gaining strength under this Australian Labor Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the recommendation of a famous report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, report No. 296, which the Government accepted. It was endorsed not only by the Committee but also by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, by a subsequent review of the Auditor-General's office by Mr T.A. Sheridan and by the independent auditor appointed by the Government. In its report No. 296, the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Act 1901 be amended to require the Auditor-General to be appointed the external auditor of all Government companies. Private sector audit firms and partnerships which are the external auditors of Government companies would continue until their appointments expire, whereupon the Auditor-General would become the company's external auditor. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter at issue is significant. We are looking at the audit of a $2.7 billion debt involving a 4.7 million bale stockpile. We were led to believe that, where the Auditor-General is not the appointed auditor of such government business enterprises (GBEs) as the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Corporation, there would be special circumstances which would be explained, firstly, to the Auditor-General and, secondly, to this Parliament. None of those obligations was met by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to be very much a shady deal because we are told by the Auditor-General that in the early hours of 31 May 1991, without consultation with the Australian National Audit Office, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill and the Australian Wool Corporation Bill were introduced into the House of Representatives without an opportunity for the Auditor-General to comment or make an input. If we look at those Bills carefully we will note that a deliberate attempt has been made to circumvent the audit by the Australian National Audit Office of those particular authorities. That is just not good enough. We are interested as a Parliament and as a Senate in restoring the mandate of the Auditor-General. It is very important that where there are special circumstances they are communicated to the Parliament. This has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant concerning the accountability of all government business enterprises that this Parliament has a significant input in their reporting. The Auditor-General is an essential link between this Parliament and government business enterprises. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is seeking mechanisms to try to strengthen the relationship between the Parliament, the people and the GBEs. One of its current inquiries concerns the social responsibilities of government business enterprises and their community service obligations. It is a dereliction of the duty of the Government to go behind the back of the Auditor-General and seek to appoint private sector auditors. It could be construed, incorrectly in some quarters, that the Auditor-General does not have the skill to conduct such an audit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great confidence in the professionalism of the Australian National Audit Office and its officers. They have the skills, and this has been demonstrated in the various reports that the Auditor-General brings to parliament. Perhaps his comments are cutting too close to the bone and the Government is suffering. If that is the reason, it is a further condemnation of this Government's seeking avenues and methods to escape proper reporting and accountability to this Parliament. These issues will be raised again when the wool Bills come before the Parliament, but I should like to take this opportunity to endorse the statements and the action taken by the Australian National Audit Office in bringing this matter to our attention. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), whether today he can tell us those special circumstances, because this Parliament has a right to know why the Australian Audit Office was not appointed under these circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to comment on the Auditor-General's report No. 35 on the potential erosion of the accountability to the Parliament in relation to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill and the Australian Wool Corporation Bill. As Senator Watson has said, both these Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives on 31 May. They are important Bills. The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill establishes the Commission that will take over the $2.7 billion debt and the 4.7 million bale stockpile presently held by the Australian Wool Corporation. It will also be responsible for the discharge of the debt and the disposal of the stockpile and other assets. That is a major task facing the Wool Realisation Commission. Therefore, that Bill is a major Bill, as is the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, which establishes the new Corporation which will facilitate the adoption of appropriate strategies for the promotion of wool, the efficient marketing of Australian wool and proper measures to ensure a high quality for Australian wool. It is very significant, as the Auditor-General makes clear in his report, that these Bills were introduced into the Parliament without any consultation at all with the Auditor-General or his office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite obvious that the Bills are of such magnitude and significance that the audit function is of the utmost importance. I congratulate the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, on bringing this matter so quickly to the attention of the Parliament. It is obviously a report that he has had to prepare in considerable haste. It is a compliment to him that he has done it in the time available. I draw the attention of the Senate to the Auditor-General's covering letter to Mr President and Mr Speaker, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bills proposing the creation of the above Commission and Corporation have serious implications for accountability to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills are still to go through the Parliament-although they have gone through the House, they are to be debated in the Senate later this week. As the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA> I would be most grateful if this report could be tabled at the earliest opportunity, to allow Senators to consider their position with respect to my report before the Bills are debated, and so that members may be informed of my concern. </PARA>
<PARA>This has great topicality for this Senate because it relates to important issues in Bills that are to be debated and voted on later this week, the last week of the parliamentary session. As the Auditor-General says, from his point of view the major issue in both Bills is the potential for the erosion of accountability to the Parliament. That is an issue which I believe everyone in this chamber, from whatever side of politics, would endorse absolutely and heartily. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Auditor-General-and I agree with him-the Bills bias the audit function away from the Auditor-General. The Bills require that the Minister for Finance explain in writing his reasons for declining to approve the appointment of a recommended private sector auditor. But no such requirement exists if the Minister agrees to the appointment of a private sector auditor. The appointment of a private sector auditor thereby weakens parliamentary scrutiny because it excludes the Auditor-General's requirement that he has to report directly to the Parliament-and this is the great virtue of the Auditor-General's role. So, the appointment of a private sector auditor would automatically weaken parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bills, the Minister is not required to explain what `special circumstances dictate' the granting of an exemption. As has already been said, the Government, when it tabled its response to report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the reform of the Audit Office, recognised that the Auditor-General is a major vehicle for the accountability of government enterprises to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government indicated at that time that the Auditor-General is to be the sole auditor of all government owned or controlled entities. However, the Government also agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions in the case of statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises where special circumstances dictate. It foreshadowed, though, at that time that the legislative amendments to implement that change would be included in the new legislation to replace the existing Audit Act 1901-that is, the audit provisions would be in a simplified central Act and not in individual Acts with their potential for variation in approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General is concerned that under these Bills-and, indeed, in any situation-a private sector auditor will not have responsibility to the Parliament. To provide for a private sector auditor, unless there are very special circumstances, really would turn the Westminster system on its head. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be argued that, unless the Minister for Finance agrees to an exemption, the Auditor-General is automatically the auditor. The Government may well argue that point. But, if it is unlikely that other than the Auditor-General would be the auditor, why is the provision for exemption included, particularly in a Bill for which anyone would be hard pressed to explain away the direct taxpayers involvement and interest in it? We are talking about $2.7 billion of debt for which potentially the Australian taxpayer is at risk. It is just not comprehensible for anyone to say that the taxpayer does not have a very vested interest in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere inclusion of the potential exemption from the Auditor-General's mandate to audit is an open invitation for political pressures to be applied to the Minister for Finance to grant the exemption. There are no countervailing clauses in this Bill to require such an exemption to be justified. When we come to debate these Bills later in the week it will be obligatory for the Government to provide reasons for this. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand-and my colleagues Senator Bishop and Senator Watson, as members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, would know better than I-that the legislative provisions in the proposed new legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901 include a provision which reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General is to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth agencies and entities, except where the Minister for Finance has determined that an entity may make other audit arrangements. The Minister for Finance may not make a determination to grant an exemption unless he has first consulted the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a markedly different emphasis from the drafting in the current Bills, which completely changes the onus of responsibility and the onus of decision making as between the Auditor-General and a private auditor. The key to whether this provision in the new legislation to replace the Audit Act represents a real restoration of parliamentary accountability and of the mandate of the Auditor-General depends upon the exemptions allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool Bills before the Parliament do nothing at all-indeed, the contrary is the case-to reassure the Parliament in this regard. If the potential is seen by the Government for an exemption in a Bill dealing with $2.7 billion of debt and a 4.7 million bale stockpile shouldered by the taxpayer, where would the Auditor-General be accepted as having a clear mandate? If there is a doubt in this case, where on earth are we ever going to get a clearer example of where there should be an absolute and clear mandate for the Auditor-General? Is the Parliament prepared to leave matters such as this to ministerial discretion, which is really what the Bill involves? The answer to that surely must be, no. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Auditor-General's view-and it is one with which I totally concur-the only ground for cutting the Auditor-General out of the accountability loop and thereby eroding parliamentary scrutiny would be the complete privatisation of a government entity, in which case there would be no government involvement. If that is not the case, the Auditor-General must still have a mandate. If he is not to be given a mandate, there must be the very clearest reasons given as to why. </PARA>
<PARA> I again congratulate the Auditor-General on his strength of purpose in bringing this report forward to the Parliament. Two points must be cleared up before we debate the wool Bills on Thursday: first, the Government must spell out clearly the criteria of exemption from scrutiny by the Auditor-General; and, secondly, it must give us some examples of the sorts of special circumstances that could conceivably dictate the appointment of outside auditors. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, there is no doubt that the wool Bills, about which the Auditor-General has expressed such concern, do not fall-certainly not prima facie and I find it hard to believe in other circumstances either-in the special circumstances category. Large amounts of taxpayers' funds-up to almost $3 billion of taxpayers' funds-are potentially involved in this. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, if the Auditor-General does not have a total mandate in respect of a Bill like that, where on earth is he going to have such a mandate? If this Government will not give him such a mandate on an ongoing basis, then one can only have the gravest of doubts about the Government's bona fides and motivation in this matter. It does seem clear, on the face of it, that a deliberate attempt is being made to weaken the mandate, the role and the authority of the AuditorGeneral. If that is a matter of fact, then it is not only a matter of concern for the Parliament-and that is concern enough-but also it is also a matter of great concern for each and every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that very quickly, certainly before these wool Bills are debated later in the week, we will have a response from the Government on this matter. Even beyond that, the whole question of the role of the Auditor-General and the mandate which he should be given and to which he is entitled is something that must be debated much more thoroughly and much more satisfyingly in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion that the Senate take note of this document. It is for the very reasons that Senator Baume gave with regard to the previous report that we should take very careful note of this report by the Auditor-General. In the previous report, the Auditor-General examined the Department of Employment, Education and Training, made an efficiency audit and reported to the Parliament, thus enabling us to examine and comment upon a fundamental component of democracy, which is a fundamental role of elected members of this Parliament. For that reason, we should be most concerned about what the Auditor-General has written in this report with regard to the potential erosion of accountability to the Parliament in relation to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I emphasise the point which was made in the Auditor-General's covering letter, to which Senator Short referred, especially the paragraph which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bills proposing the creation of the above Commission and Corporation have serious implications for the accountability to Parliament. They are at present in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that point, not to increase the level of disinterest, but to try to point out that that covering letter was written with a direct concern about what was contained in these wool Bills that are soon to come before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of concern that the Auditor-General has is expressed on page 2 of his report where he states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the early hours of 31 May 1991, without consultation with the ANAO, the above Bills-</PARA>
<PARA>they are the Bills with regard to the Wool Realisation Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>were introduced into the House of Representatives which I believe could tilt the balance against Parliamentary scrutiny of public sector entities. </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote further from this report. I know that we can read it, but I think that it requires emphasis. Further, the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA> This action was despite the Government's decision that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities announced in a statement by the Government on 6 December 1990 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So the response that Senator Short has been asking for and hoping will come has already been made. The Government has already responded on 6 December 1990 that the Auditor-General shall be the sole external auditor. I think that we should emphasise that point. Perhaps we do need a restatement of that. Perhaps we need to remind the Government that that statement has already been made. We are reminded of it by the Auditor-General in his report. As he tells us, that statement was made in response to the examination by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the Audit Office and the Sheridan Review. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision was qualified, however, in respect of statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises in that it allowed the Minister for Finance to provide exemptions to the requirement that the Auditor-General be the sole external auditor where special circumstances dictate. Again, I agree with Senator Short; we have had no enumeration of those special circumstances in this case. If anything should be scrutinised by the Auditor-General, it is this very situation of the Wool Realisation Commission and its mandate to manage the wool debt and the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that listeners to this debate were able to distil from Senator Short's contribution the words `potential taxpayer debt'; it is not in fact a debt of close to $3 billion which is owed to the taxpayers at the moment. The word is `potential'. I acknowledge that that is the reason for his concern and our concern as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point from the Auditor-General's introduction to his report which I think it is necessary to emphasise is at paragraph 1.2.10 where he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that some States have found it necessary to tighten accountability by strengthening the roles of the Auditors-General in the light of recent history should be sufficient warning against the dilution of the Parliament's and the Auditor-General's role, e.g. the report of the Commission on Accountability (the Burt Commission) to the Western Australian Premier . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We can take it that that is a fairly good example of the very needs that we are talking about. I also turn to Appendix 5 on page 33 of this report which I think it is important to quote from. Appendix 5 relates to accountability, independence and objectivity. It is a response to Report No. 296 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts from September 1989. The appendix is headed `Audit Mandate'. It starts with a quote which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General has an important role in upholding the interests of Parliament and taxpayers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement made in Report No. 296 by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Following that, the appendix reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Necessarily, an accountability relationship exists between the Parliament and the Executive. This relationship is reinforced by the presence of a public sector auditor whose prime responsibility is to the Parliament, which has granted public funds to be used for specific purposes, and whose main task is to advise the Parliament whether such funds have been properly used.</PARA>
<PARA> A threshold question is why this accountability relationship requires a public sector auditor rather than a private sector auditor. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very question relating to this whole business. The appendix further reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee answered this question by indicating that:</PARA>
<PARA> * the Parliament can rely on the Auditor-General to identify or to filter the most important audit issues, and</PARA>
<PARA> * the Parliament would receive very large numbers of individual reports if the AAO was abolished and the tasks allocated to private sector audit firms, and would then have the complex task of identifying the most important issues.</PARA>
<PARA>There is more to the matter than that, but rather than stand here and highlight obvious points, I say that it was with a considerable degree of surprise that I came across this document. I thought that consultation would have taken place as was required, that consultation would have taken place before any of the wool Bills saw the light of day and that the Auditor-General would have been well informed of the ramifications of them. To have this sort of response come before us in this way is something which is most surprising to me. Having the document before us, I support the motion that we take note of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several things are quite significant about this debate and the motion that we take note of this Auditor-General's report. The first is that all the speakers are constant in their criticism of the action that the Government has taken to remove the mandate of the Auditor-General from the oversight of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Corporation. The second thing that is most significant is that the Auditor-General has seen fit to put out a media release highlighting his concern about this matter. On many occasions those of us who are concerned with public administration have gone on the record and said that the Auditor-General is the linchpin in the question of public administration; that, if the system of auditing by the Auditor-General breaks down, the system of accountability breaks down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Joint Committee of Public Accounts brought down its report No. 296, to which all honourable senators have referred, we deliberately gave it the title The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament to highlight the importance of the role of the Auditor-General and the recommendations that we made. One recommendation was:</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General should be reinstated as the external auditor of Statutory Marketing Authorities, considering their strategic importance in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Another recommendation was:</PARA>
<PARA>Where the services of a private audit firm are considered necessary by a Statutory Marketing Authority and the Auditor-General agrees, then the Auditor-General appoint a private audit firm as a contract auditor under section 11 of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly it was realised that there was a place for the private sector to act in the audit process but that the contractor auditor should only ever act as the agent for the Auditor-General so that the Auditor-General never lost his overriding mandate to perform that audit. Indeed, it was to be the Auditor-General's decision as to whether a private audit firm was engaged. Certainly, it was never contemplated that a Minister ought to have that very serious power to exercise at his discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> We waited for some considerable time for a suitable response from the Department of Finance to the recommendations that came down in report No. 296. We got that response, as others have said, on 6 December 1990. We have also had other committees consider this important function. The November 1989 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into government companies had some important things to say on the nature and function of audit. I quote from its report, where it makes the following statement under the heading `Audit is not a service to management':</PARA>
<PARA>Much of the fashion for a move away from audit by the Auditor-General appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the role of an auditor. The purpose of audit is to provide an independent report on management, not a service to it. Management freedom should apply to management functions but the appointment of the auditor is the prerogative of the owners, not managers. </PARA>
<PARA>The owners in the public arena are the taxpayers. The degree and the standard of scrutiny will remain and is constantly different between the private and the public sectors. In the public sector, there is no discretion on behalf of the taxpayer whether or not he pays taxation and then how the Executive chooses to use it. The Executive may choose through policy how money is expended; the Parliament appropriates it. The Auditor-General oversights the proper expenditure and reports directly to the Parliament. That is the method of scrutiny. We have various committees which assist the Parliament in that scrutiny. But at the end of the day all those committees report here in this chamber and to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) got around to replying to many of our responses, a significant supplementary response came down, as others have said, on 6 December. In that, we got a partial acceptance of the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. Others have quoted it, but it is worth quoting again:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Government's view that all public enterprises are ultimately accountable to Parliament, and that a major vehicle for this accountability is the Auditor-General. Consequently, the Government has decided that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. </PARA>
<PARA>This is where it made its exception, which was not acceptable in the original report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has also agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions in the case of statutory marketing authorities and Government business enterprises where special circumstances dictate. </PARA>
<PARA>I have two things to say about that. The original Public Accounts Committee report No. 296 said that it was important that the Auditor-General should always maintain his independence. We were keen to see that the resources which the Auditor-General had were not determined by the Minister for Finance but should be determined by a committee of members of the Parliament chaired by a presiding officer. Indeed, this is the system which the New Zealand Parliament has finally agreed to. We did that because we felt that the Minister for Finance could curtail the work of the Auditor-General by curtailing the amount of resources available to him. After we brought down the report it was significant that the Minister for Finance did find additional resources for the Auditor-General to increase his workload. </PARA>
<PARA> By giving the discretion to the Minister for Finance to determine exemptions, we are again curtailing the independence of the Auditor-General, and the requirement that there be special circumstances-special circumstances would have to be made out-of course has been totally overridden by the two Bills that will come before us later this week, namely, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill. In each case, the decision to appoint or not appoint a private firm, and therefore deprive the Auditor-General of his overriding mandate, is to be an arbitrary one; and it is simply not good enough. All senators who have spoken have said that the potential amount of money is somewhere near $3 billion of taxpayers' money, certainly never to be called an inconsequential sum. The principle remains resolute: it must be the Auditor-General who has the oversight of the appropriate and proper expenditure of that money. </PARA>
<PARA> As we come into the debate on those Bills, it will be most unfortunate if we find ourselves in the situation where a guillotine were to be applied simply to get the legislation through without these important points being resolved. I put it to the Government that it would be most sensible to reconsider the provisions in these two Bills in the two days that remain before we come to a full debate of these Bills and for the Government to move an amendment to each of those Bills to provide for the Auditor-General to hold the mandate to conduct the audit of these two corporations. Not to do so will make the debate more difficult and complicate the issues before us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also quite significant that support for the proposition that the Auditor-General must maintain his mandate came not only from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and from the Committee on Finance and Public Administration but also from the independent review conducted by Mr Sheridan, the then Auditor-General of South Australia-some of us thought the Government was trying to get another view which might have disagreed with the view of the Public Accounts Committee; in fact, it did not-and from the Waitangi statement of March 1988 from the Australian Area Auditors-General. The report of the independent auditor, Mr Michael Sharpe of Coopers and Lybrand, again supported our proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, we have not only moral authority but also pragmatic authority. There is, as I said, within the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, provision for private firms to be used, but the private firms would be used on a contractual basis and would be subject to the overriding mandate of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, it is most significant that honourable senators from all sides of the chamber-Senator Coates on the Government side; Senator Watson, who is the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, Senator Short, Senator Crane and I on behalf of the coalition, and Senator Bell speaking for the Australian Democrats-have come to the unanimous conclusion that the Government has erred in making these provisions to give a discretion to the Minister for Finance to avoid the Auditor-General. It is with a sense of unity that so many honourable senators who would disagree with each other on other issues can come together to plead with the Government to reconsider the clauses in these Bills so that when we come to debate the legislation we will not be diverted from other issues that must be debated to again fight this argument to keep the place of the Auditor-General in the whole scheme of scrutiny, which finally means that the taxpayers get proper accountability for the expenditure of their money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to the Auditor-General's report No. 35, I first congratulate the Auditor-General on the speed with which he has delivered this report to the Parliament and on its precision and clarity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one analyses the proposition that the Auditor-General has put before us, one can only conclude that it is a damning epitaph for the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in that portfolio. I will spend a couple of minutes discussing that aspect of the matter even though Minister Kerin has now left that portfolio. He is responsible not only for the Australian Wool Corporation Bill and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, but also for the 1987 legislation that removed section 41 from the principal Act and took away the role of the Australian Wool Corporation to report back to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Treasurer, and hence the Parliament of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition sees that in effect the emphasis of these two Bills, as outlined in appendices Nos 1 and 2, is on ensuring that the reporting process is not back to this Parliament and is not done by Auditor-General, but by a private auditing operation. I invite honourable senators to read carefully appendices Nos 1 and 2 in this report. I emphasise that this is not the first time, in relation to the wool industry and the mess it is in today, that we have had a slack or inconsistent approach adopted to the financial responsibilities and the reporting process. In respect of the debt and the present size of the wool stockpile, it ought never be forgotten that it is essential that the realisation from that stockpile be maximised because growers have also had $1.8 billion-worth of levies taken from them in a revolving levy fund. Not much mention is made of that, but we are not really talking about $2.6 billion or just under $3 billion, we are talking about something like $4.5 billion tied up in the stockpile. It is absolutely essential, as other speakers have outlined, that this legislation is amended before it comes back here to be debated on Wednesday night, otherwise we will be dealing with an issue that should never have been brought before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a couple of points in respect of paragraph 1.2.1 of the report, where the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>I am very concerned that a continuing effort to weaken the Parliament's role in the scrutiny and reporting on the activities of all public-sector entities appears to be gaining strength. </PARA>
<PARA>However, we have heard a number of speakers today, including Senator Coates from the Government side, say just the opposite. Where is that continuing effort coming from? One must question the commitment and credibility of the Government when we deal with various aspects of this report and the report delivered on 6 December 1990, to which other speakers have referred. The Auditor-General further says that there is no reassurance in terms of reporting back to parliament. The Auditor-General refers specifically to `special circumstances'. Those special circumstances should be spelled out clearly. I believe there should be no special circumstances when it comes to holding or operating public funds, and it should be the responsibility of the Auditor-General to report back to parliament. In paragraph 1.2.6, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills pay lip service to words to the principle that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. </PARA>
<PARA>Further he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The bias is against the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>As one works through the various points, one gets the same line of thought and the same statement of fact. In the last two paragraphs-paragraphs 1.2.11 and 1.2.12-the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>I hope this is an oversight which will be corrected, rather than a reflection of a change in Government attitude to the role of the Parliament and the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask that the Parliament consider the implications of these Bills for its future ability to scrutinise what has been done in its name. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer particularly to paragraphs 3.9 and 3.22, which refer to the Burt Commission on Accountability in Western Australia where the role of the Auditor-General in that Parliament has been enhanced, not decreased or undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by reiterating what I said at the start: one must come back to the mess we have in the wool industry, and it is in a mess. In relation to this report, Minister Kerin should not go unscathed at the end of the day because in 1987 he, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, had section 41 taken out of the Act; he was the Minister who appointed the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation and he appointed the Government representative on the board. As his epitaph as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he presented two Bills to the Parliament which will in effect bypass the Auditor-General. However, today he is the Treasurer of this country and I pose the question: is he going to adopt the same process and attitude and present us with a similar situation when carrying out his functions as Treasurer?</PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of an industry council for the wool industry. The Council will replace the interim wool industry policy council established in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill replaces the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill which had proposed a legislative framework under which industry councils could be established by regulation for particular primary industries. However, that Bill has been withdrawn due to Opposition concerns about legislation by regulation and the need for the legislation to be passed establishing a Wool Industry Council on 1 July 1991, which is the same date as the other new wool industry institutional arrangements are to come into force. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill follows closely on the provisions of the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill except that it has been made specific to the wool industry and spells out the membership of the Council in clause 14. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech for the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill outlined the functions, powers, meeting arrangements and establishment of committees and working parties. Those principles are the same for this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment introduces a condition on the licence which requires the carriers to enter into and agree to an ombudsman scheme. We know that the Australian Telecommunications Authority already has the power to investigate consumer complaints but the Australian Democrats believe that an industry ombudsman, although not necessarily of the banking industry type, will be of advantage to the industry in its attempts to monitor complaints, to investigate the carriers' own failings, and generally to ensure a higher standard of service to consumers. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, who currently handles most of the complaints against Telecom, will cease to exist after a transitional phase. </PARA>
<PARA> With their own ombudsman, we argue that the carrier services can bypass any cumbersome complaints reporting procedure and deal with minor complaints quickly and efficiently. We think the type of ombudsman should be determined by the carriers. At this stage it would be difficult to determine which scheme would be the most suitable, but the banking industry ombudsman is not really the sort of example that ought be emulated and that the carriers ought to follow. </PARA>

More detail in relation to the scheme will need to be developed in the future, and perhaps future amendments will be needed when the industry comes up with the details of how the scheme is to work. The amendment on its own is insufficient as there is no indication of what Austel is to do following receipt of a report, but it does signal the basis of an approach which as far as the Government is concerned can be followed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>12. Clause 63, page 28, after paragraph (4)(l), insert the following paragraph and subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``; and (n) a condition that the holder must wherever reasonably possible, make arrangements to obtain technical services, equipment, parts or products from an Australian owned supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> (4a) The reasonableness of supply arrangements for the purposes of a condition of a kind referred to in paragraph (4)(n) shall be determined by reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the comparative cost of supply by an Australian owned supplier;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the comparable quality of the services, equipment, parts or products;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the availability of the services, equipment, parts or products; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any declarations, licence conditions, technical standards or other directives made by AUSTEL or the Minister.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to insert a new licence condition (n). We want to protect Australia's embryonic telecommunications equipment capabilities and skills industry. Despite all the protestations and assurances to date by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), I still believe there is a very real danger that this industry, like the indigenous New Zealand telecommunications equipment manufacture, will disappear after deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving this amendment, I wish to redress some of the balance in the legislation, which asks what the industry can do for the carriers rather than what the carriers can do for the home-grown equipment industry. I acknowledge that most of Australia's equipment manufacturers have overseas parent companies and so in that stricter sense are not Australian-owned, but we have ample evidence of the commitment of these companies to research and development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment does not say that we cannot import; it simply says that, where there is an Australian product that is comparable in quality and availability, the carriers be required to show favour towards the Australian industry. I know that this amendment incorporates everything the free marketeers in both the Government and the Opposition do not like, but I believe in selective intervention and so do the Democrats. I believe that this industry requires some protection against the cheap foreign imports that will flood this country in response to deregulation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not, and of course we support that being done. I point out that, in the same kind of involved technology, considerable concern is being expressed about the involvement of Australian suppliers with air traffic control systems. I see Senator Kernot nodding her head and that is why I used it as an example; it is her area of portfolio responsibility as well. The difficulty is that, being a small aviation industry, we do not have the kinds of firms in Australia that are world leaders in the application of this kind of technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty is that clause 63(4c) in the Bill already covers what a licensee must do in connection with developing the telecommunications industry in Australia. The conditions that are laid down in this amendment are simply too prescriptive. They lock the industry arrangements into a prearranged structure before any kind of negotiations have actually taken place. If one goes to the subclauses in the amendment, who is to make the price and quality comparisons that are required by this amendment, especially where highly complex equipment is involved? It is not like buying produce on the open market. What price-quality differentials, as referred to here, are sufficient to force a carrier to then choose an Australian product over one that is available that might be better or cheaper or more efficient?</PARA>
<PARA> Does the amendment take into account the very significant matter-and I refer again to the air traffic control system-of the delivery times that are provided by various suppliers for this equipment? For example, a firm that is perhaps not up to the mark might want to write in 12 months for research and development on top of the delivery contract. It does not even take that into account. I just do not think this amendment has been sufficiently worked through, and for that reason the Government will not be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the Democrats simply proposing a condition that the holder must wherever possible make arrangements to obtain effectively Australian input. At least it would be on the table and we would know where people were coming from. But amendment No. 4A seems to me to make a nonsense of what precedes it because, by attempting to define reasonableness, it is in fact writing in the very sorts of things that people in a free market would want to take into account. They would probably, on the merits-as we would require them to do, in a sense-choose the foreign product if it was more than cost competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it makes any sense at all to take it together. Even if we were to take the hardline position, it would again be flying in the face of what is now I think almost orthodoxy-apart from the Democrats-that if one is to have a lower tariff regime, reduce protection and make industries more efficient, one cannot at the same time guarantee free kicks and free rides for what are often simply Australian subsidiaries of multinationals in any event. It is not as if the profits are staying here and it is not as if we are ensuring any more efficiencies. All we are doing is getting back to the bad old days of allowing people to have a guarantee of a source of income and a job, which is not a guarantee available to most other citizens in this country.

<PARA>This amendment would omit subclause (1) in clause 67, which requires the Minister to obtain the written consent of each carrier before declaring, varying or revoking licence conditions. It would give the carriers power of veto over the imposition of a condition and put a time limit on the duration of a licence. We therefore do not believe that this is appropriate. </PARA>

We do not want to make it easier to dismantle the duopoly. The duopoly will only exist in the contract or written agreement between the Minister and the carrier. It is almost a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea but where there is competition we prefer a duopoly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be opposing this amendment which would do precisely what Senator Alston says, and that is permit a Minister to vary the term of the licence for particular classes at that Minister's whim.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> 6.18 p.m.)-I should indicate that we regard this as a very important provision in this clause-it is sufficiently important to divide on. We certainly take the view that the carrier would be given a power of veto to maintain the duopoly in the marketplace to a point which would seem quite unsustainable. For a Minister acting properly, as he or she is required to do, it would seem a nonsense where everyone is in heated agreement except the carrier with an acute vested interest in perpetuating the duopoly, to allow that carrier in effect to say, `Well, I'm going to determine the shape of telecommunications policy in this country'. We do not believe that is appropriate and we, therefore, believe this clause must be opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I wonder whether I could ask a question. I am a little bit confused as to exactly what this clause means. Does it mean that the Minister must obtain written consent of each carrier to make a declaration in accordance with clause 64, or must the Minister obtain from each carrier an agreement to the actual terms of the conditions which will be written into that declaration? If the latter is the case, it seems that there may just be some substance in what the Opposition is actually saying. But if it is simply permission to make a declaration, of course we would have to agree with the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I am the bunny. The explanatory memorandum in respect of clause 67 says that the clause requires the Minister to obtain the consent of each carrier affected before imposing or varying a condition about the term the licence is in force. Therefore, I think the answer to Senator Coulter's question is that it is not in respect of each licence condition but only a subsequent attempt to vary a licence condition and, to the extent that it might want to cut short or vary the term of a licence, the carrier would have a power of veto. So, in that respect, it is simply saying that it is a matter for the carrier to decide whether the Government ought to be in a position to cut short the term of the licence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I confess that my confusion was also caused by the fact that I was not sure where the question was being directed. I can understand why the Opposition wants to divide on this amendment, but I wish to assure Senator Coulter that we will be dividing on it, hopefully with the Democrats support, in an equally trenchant manner because this applies in section 67 only to the time for which a licence is granted. If it is done without the written consent of each carrier it means that an agreement can be entered into to give someone a licence for 10 years, and then at the whim of a Minister it can be changed from 10 years to six months, or one week. For that reason, I hope that such an amendment will be totally insupportable.</PARA></TALK.START>

One would think that if ever there were litigants able to afford that, it would be carriers whose interests might be adversely affected. What we are talking about is whether the Government should be able, by entering into a long term agreement, to effectively freeze the shape of the industry for a much longer period than even the Government itself might want to do, on reflection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, Senator Collins in a fit of gusto may believe that five years of protection is fair and reasonable. But when his successor comes along he may say, `That is quite crazy. Everyone else in the industry takes a different view. So do we. Unfortunately, we are beholden to the other party to this agreement and nothing can be done'. That is a nonsense and one would have thought that we could ensure in all sorts of ways that the power is not exercised capriciously, but also, we should not become hostage to the whim of the Minister of the day determining policy for years into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the Government in opposing this amendment is nailing its flag to the mast of parliamentary scrutiny and the rights of Parliament rather than the Minister to determine matters of this nature. That really is a refreshing view for a government to adopt. I suppose what is also exercising the minds of the Opposition is that there may be a number of situations arising in the telecommunications networks and systems which have been developed by a carrier which might raise widespread concern among the community so that a Minister of the day is lobbied and urged by constituents and by the parties to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the answer to that would be to make sure that the penalties that applied to carriers were sufficient to bring them into line. As we are going through this Bill I will be having a look at the question of penalties and whether they are sufficient to require the carriers to be brought into line. At this juncture I am happy to support the principle that the Parliament itself should have responsibility in matters of this nature. I will be supporting the clause as it stands. </PARA>

<PARA> 14. Clause 69, page 30, lines 27 and 28, omit all words from ``Minister'' to ``proposes'' substitute the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Reports by AUSTEL on proposed instruments about licence conditions</PARA>
<PARA>  ``69(1) Where the Minister proposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to make an instrument under subsection 71(3); or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to make under section 64 or 65 an instrument that would have the effect of varying or removing a prescribed carrier obligation of a carrier;</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister must by writing request AUSTEL to give a written report about the question whether, having regard to such matters (if any) as are specified in the request, it is in the public interest to make the proposed instrument. </PARA>
<PARA>  ``(1A) Subject to subsection (1), where the Minister proposes:''. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the amendment, I need to make a few comments on the proposed Opposition amendment No. 10 which would go through if our amendment were not agreed to. Our amendment requires only that the Minister must seek a report from Austel where an instrument involves changing a prescribed carrier obligation. We support the intention of the Opposition's amendment in requiring Austel to make a report in the public interest in all licence conditions, but the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills assures us that the headline does not count as part of the legislation and changing the headline will have very little effect. </PARA>
<PARA> While we think it is necessary that Austel prepare a report, we do not think it is necessary that it do so on each and every licence condition, because many of these licence conditions are quite technical. If Austel were forced to investigate each and every licence condition, I believe there is a danger that it would become overloaded with technical conditions and other important areas, such as the prescribed carrier obligations, may not be investigated as thoroughly as we would like. We need to look at what is to happen with these prescribed carrier obligations-and I have made this point before-because, with deregulation, there is the very real danger that the least profitable segments will be neglected in the pursuit of competition for competition's sake. </PARA>

<PARA> 12. Clause 70, pages 31 and 32, subclause (7), line 39 (page 31) to line 5 (page 32), omit the subclause. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the infamous provision that empowers the Minister to make a written agreement with a carrier about the exercise of his power which provides that the Commonwealth can pay a specified amount to a carrier if it contravenes the agreement. The vice of this arrangement is that the government can effectively raise the stakes against an incoming government to the point where huge amounts of money could be required to be paid which have no connection with the damage that might have flowed from any change to the rules. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore take the view that this is an offensive clause. I refer by way of example to subclause 7, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>Where an agreement in force under this section provides as mentioned in subsection (3):</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an amount may become payable under the provision whether or not the amount represents a reasonable estimate of the loss or damage that the carrier is likely to suffer . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the law always regards as a penalty, which is not in any form an attempt to provide liquidated damages or make any sensible assessment of the loss, but simply to preclude any attempt at alteration. Therefore, we take the view that this is an offensive provision; it could allow for penalties about which no-one would know until they were sprung on a government that sought to vary the arrangements. There is no requirement for the agreement to be made public and we therefore vigorously oppose the subclause. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 12 would delete subclause 7; if that were the case, then people would at least know where they stood and would not be faced with this in terrorem arrangement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats see these amendments as just two more attempts to break the duopoly. Consistent with the reasons I have given previously, we prefer the duopoly as the fall back position which we are prepared to accept.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of clarification, I want to say for the benefit of Senator Kernot that this is precisely the point; the provision is not providing for compensation. Compensation is an assessment of the damage that flows from a breach. That is not what subclause 7 does; subclause 7 says that we can provide that in the event of any breach a carrier gets $50m, and gets that even if it has not suffered at all. In many respects it would be very difficult for either of the two carriers to demonstrate loss. We may well find, for example, that the market, if it were opened up, would expand quite significantly, and no carrier would suffer financially. But we would be giving a huge windfall gain which would be totally unrelated to any loss that a carrier might have suffered and therefore would be unrelated to any compensation it might deserve. That is the real vice of subclause 7. I invite Senator Kernot to re-read it and comment on it if she will. I understand that she will not support it, but she should at least acknowledge that it is as I have described.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Proposed amendment No. 12 is in line with earlier amendments the Opposition has wanted to move because of the philosophical direction it is coming from, which is not that of the Government. That is, the Opposition wants to open up the market to a much wider degree than the Government wants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite simply, the explanation is that it would be extremely difficult for the Government to proceed with its proposals-that is, to sell Aussat Pty Ltd and form this new arrangement. It would be very difficult to conclude that arrangement unless the buyer was able to gain some certainty about compensation by the Commonwealth if the competitive environment that that buyer was coming into was then changed. If that process is delayed, I would have thought, inasmuch as the Opposition does not like what is happening and wants to go further, that it would also delay the advent of competition in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make the point plain: I can understand the proposition that, in the event of a premature termination of the agreement or a breach of contract, one is entitled to damages-that is not a terribly exceptional proposition-but that is not what this subclause provides. I am interested to know on what basis the Government would proceed. If there is a provision that says that the Government can provide for an amount to be payable irrespective of any loss or damage, how does it determine the quantum of that amount? Does it simply make it so large that it will terrorise someone out of seeking to breach it? In that case, it is a penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a matter that the Government, for reasons that the Australian Democrats support, wants to retain in its hands rather than leave to the uncertainty of a situation where the carrier would have absolutely no idea what the end result at the end of the day might be. That will make this process much more difficult for the Government to then implement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No other litigants are entitled to know in advance how much they might be able to get from the other parties simply by demonstrating a breach. Every other litigant in the land has to show that he or she has suffered loss or damage. That is not what subclause 7 provides. It entitles the Government to nominate any figure it likes, which becomes payable upon breach, irrespective of whether there is any loss or damage. I therefore ask the Minister: on what basis does the Government set that sum? Does it set it so high that it dissuades anyone from attempting to change it? Is that the rationale? If not, what is the underlying principle? It clearly is not compensation, so let us put that to one side; it is a penalty.

When the Minister says that the matter will be `negotiated', does he mean that, whatever amount the carrier decides is a sum that it would like to get in the event of a breach, that amount will be regarded as payable by the Government or is there some element of reasonableness that will be the basis of the negotiation?

It will not be plucked out of the air; it will be negotiated between the parties. That provision appears, as Senator Alston says quite correctly, in subclause 3. If Senator Alston wants to describe it as a penalty, as I have done, for a change by the Government in the circumstances under which this is done, then I guess he can describe it as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, if Senator Alston thinks this is an unusual provision in relation to a breach of agreement, it is not nearly as unusual as one I witnessed, which was unparalleled to the best of my knowledge. His conservative colleagues in the Northern Territory Parliament introduced an Act for compulsory acquisition, and not for a public purpose, to take $50m of privately owned property from one company and give it to another private company the Government elected to favour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>15. Clause 116, page 51, after subclause (4), add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(5) Nothing in this section affects the liability of a carrier to comply with a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory relating to planning or concerning the protection of the environment, including the natural environment, the cultural heritage and Aboriginal laws.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 116 exempts, by way of regulation, carriers from State and Territory laws. The exemptions are drawn very broadly. The regulations may provide that specified carriers may engage in specified exempt activities despite specified laws of a State or Territory or despite any law of a State or Territory. The Australian Democrats are concerned that in the area of environmental protection, environment law, zoning, planning laws and so on those sorts of blanket exemptions simply should not obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that wide ranging exemption, the Democrats are attempting with this amendment to claw back, as it were, the provisions which cover the environment, including the natural environment, cultural heritage and Aboriginal law. While the Democrats are concerned in the general sense that the Federal Government should not attempt to exempt itself from the laws which it imposes on all other citizens-and we state that as a general principle-we find it particularly repugnant that in the area of environmental protection law the Government is seeking to impose laws on all other people, and the States do likewise, while specifically exempting the provision of those laws with respect to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> As it were, this amendment is a second best amendment that accepts the basic premise of clause 116-namely, that the Minister should be able to make certain carrier activities exempt from State and Territory laws. However, the Democrats accept that premise with reluctance. The sole purpose of this exemption clause is to fast track the development of the second carrier's network. Removing this clause completely would slow that process down, but that does not seem to the Democrats to be a very great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, accepting the premise of the law, the Democrats believe that in this day and age-particularly with widespread community concern about the environment-it should not be possible for environmental, cultural heritage and Aboriginal laws to be overridden under any circumstances. This amendment would ensure that such laws continue to apply to exempt activities. </PARA>
<PARA> In further support of this amendment, in my experience of many decades of work with the environment movement and also with a prominent planning body in South Australia from 1963 onwards, I have become aware of many instances where Federal and State bodies enjoying some exemptions were extremely arrogant in the way in which they dealt with the environment and created enormous problems which were not appealable by ordinary citizens living in an area; indeed I became quite convinced that governments should not use these blanket exemption provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, the amendment moved by the Democrats accepts reluctantly the general and wide ranging exemption of clause 116, which claws back the proposed sections dealing with the protection of the natural environment, cultural heritage and Aboriginal laws. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has canvassed this matter at some length in previous debate. I will go over it again. The Government will oppose this amendment. Apart from the tiny area of Telecom Australia's activities that involves Commonwealth property, Telecom is currently exempt from any requirements to comply with State or local government law in respect of its network. For the first time the Commonwealth is imposing upon the carriers obligations to comply with a strict national environmental code. Were this amendment to be carried, it would mean that notwithstanding the fact that a national code is to be negotiated between the Federal Government and each State and Territory government to impose these obligations on the carriers for the first time, those negotiations and that code of conduct will be totally negated. The carriers would still be subject to State and Territory planning and environmental law, and that would obviate the entire purpose of having a specific national code of practice specific to this industry to protect the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my briefing notes I am informed that this could mean that the Australian Capital Territory Government could pass a planning or environmental law requiring the dismantling of the Telecom tower on Black Mountain and the carrier would then have to comply. The Parliament can be assured that the national code will embody the most stringent environmental safeguards and that it will ensure that the telecommunications carriers are subject to uniform environmental requirements throughout Australia. I repeat: if this amendment were carried it would completely obviate the purpose of having a uniform national code of environmental protection specific to this industry across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point the Minister has made in relation to Telecom already being exempted is precisely the point I was making. There have been numerous instances in which that exemption has caused great anguish in the community. I am interested that the Minister himself mentioned the Black Mountain tower. He will recall the incredible turmoil that went on in the Australian Capital Territory over whether that tower should or should not be built on Black Mountain. Quite clearly, the Minister is anticipating a situation where those sorts of decisions will be imposed on the public again and again, without the public necessarily being able to object or to use the normal environmental protection laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given also that we are moving into an area where the Minister himself has said the technology is changing very rapidly-I may be misquoting him but I think he presaged a day not too far hence where we may move away from telephones connected by wires to essentially universal cellular telephones, with towers scattered all over the place-it is a problem one can see multiplying. The lack of a requirement on the part of Telecom to conform at the moment with safe laws simply confirms in my mind the necessity for bringing these carriers within the ambit of environmental protection laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if the Minister is saying that the code of conduct-which, I remind the Committee, we have not yet seen-is going to be more stringent than those laws that are already in place, then I cannot see that any harm is done. If the laws are going to be better environmental protection laws, then this fallback position we are attempting to put in here by way of amendment is simply a sort of bottom line protection that allows the code of conduct to achieve better environmental protection. For each of those reasons, I would urge the Committee to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand why Senator Coulter, with his long record of being a strong environmentalist, would propose such an amendment. However, if this amendment is carried the concept of having a national telecommunications system in Australia is going to go out the window. We are not just talking in this amendment about the environment; it also includes cultural heritage and Aboriginal laws. What Senator Coulter is outlining is that in each of the States and Territories anybody who puts a piece of legislation through and defines it as natural environment, cultural heritage or Aboriginal law can use that as a basis to argue against the implementation of a national telecommunications system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia in the 1990s we should be moving towards uniform arrangements and uniform laws that are effective across all States and Territories. The Minister has very clearly outlined that a national code will be established that will be negotiated with the States. It will be a national set of standards that everybody understands and can work with. What the Democrats are proposing is, in effect, eight different standards of legislation that can be used, in my view, to hamstring the introduction of a telecommunications system that is efficient and effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot think of anything worse for the delivery to the community, wherever it may be, of a decent telecommunications system-in one State we are arguing over one piece of legislation that can impose one set of standards and in another State or Territory we are arguing over a different set of standards. I can see that this clause would be a lawyer's dream in any State, with lawyers finding which part of an Act they could get hold of to stop the implementation of the telecommunications system. I think in the end the Australian public will go berserk with rage when they find they are not able to have delivered to them an efficient, effective telecommunications system because some people use a device of State and Territory legislation that is variable at best and chaotic at worst to stop that implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Democrats to reconsider. If they do not reconsider I urge the Senate to reject this amendment and leave it that. If we want an efficient and effective telecommunications system, we will have a national environmental code which will be negotiated and which will set a standard for all Australia. I think in the 1990s we should be thinking of Australia as a whole, rather than as six States and two Territories, which would ensure that we did not get a decent national telecommunications system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised to hear what Senator Schacht has just said because he is really arguing for one set of standards for Telecom Australia and the private competitor. I simply pose the question: will we have separate standards for every industry in this country? We have a law which might cover the Commonwealth or we have a law which might cover a State and it applies to every industry in that whole area; it applies uniformly. I agree with Senator Schacht that it is a great pity that we do not have uniform environmental protection laws for the whole of Australia, but we do at least have laws which apply uniformly across all industries. In many instances they provide mechanisms for public input and they have mechanisms for scrutiny of decisions, such as the decision to build a tower on Black Mountain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate that each one of the government bodies which seeks to do things in the environment should be bound by exactly the same laws that this Parliament has seen fit to impose on every other person and corporation that seeks to do things in the environment. I fail to see any reason why the Government should simply exempt itself and set up a special and unique set of circumstances for one particular industry or technology in the community. I wonder what will happen if this pattern proliferates and we have different codes of practice for every industry that the Government gets its hands on. It really will be a dog's breakfast then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond again briefly as to why the Government is fundamentally opposed to this amendment. It goes much further than Senator Coulter is suggesting. The amendment talks about planning laws as well as environmental laws being applied. I reiterate the point I made in terms of Telecom Australia being exempted or some special condition being set up. The fact is that Telecom, the existing carrier, has established a network in Australia that is currently connected to 96 per cent of all Australian households. It has done that with total immunity from any planning or environmental requirements except for that tiny part of its activities which involves Commonwealth land. That is precisely the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second carrier has to be expected to set up a network in competition with Telecom under a set of conditions that never applied to Telecom-that is, to be subject to State and Territory planning and environmental conditions. As I said before, at the time that the Telecom Tower on Black Mountain was erected, had I been a resident of the Australian Capital Territory and had I been here prior to its erection I may well have opposed it, not on the grounds of its aesthetic detriment but on the grounds of the absolutely blatantly rampant sexist, phallic symbolism of it-being the great feminist supporter that I am. </PARA>
<PARA> But the fact is that the example I gave was not a specious example. Again, without going into the merits of the case, we have had an ACT Government that determined to turn off the fluoride supply to the ACT water system. If this amendment is carried, there would be nothing to stop it-I agree with Senator Schacht that a nice old legal battle would ensue-passing legislation putting planning and environmental restrictions on Black Mountain that would require the dismantling of that Telecom facility. This is a very broad reaching amendment, indeed, covering a mass of unspecified planning and environmental legislation and providing, as Senator Schacht has said, for a whole range of different conditions to apply to the new carrier that never applied to Telecom in establishing a network that already reaches 96 per cent of Australian households. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand what the Minister is saying about the need for some equality in respect of the new carrier. Nevertheless, Senator Coulter has a point, and that is that various States and Territories have various environmental planning laws. This provision really will not necessarily take cognisance of what the carriers can do. In any event, when the instrument is made, it will be only a disallowable instrument. It will not come before this chamber, as has been the case with some other measures in respect of which amendments can be made in the same way as legislation is made. I think that is important. Here we have a situation where various State laws could be overruled by the new carrier and by the Government- at least by the Minister-in determining a national code and those State governments and those State parliaments will have no say in the matter at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I believe-although I have not focused on it as well as I might have-that the national code should be presented in a form which enables this Parliament, on behalf of the States, if one likes, to amend it as one would be able to amend a Bill. As honourable senators around the chamber know, the code could be presented to us in the form of `cop the lot or cop nothing'.

<PARA>This amendment seeks to delete what is otherwise an open-ended provision in the clause. It is one which I have great difficulty in comprehending if it remains in. It seems to me to render paragraph 1(a) quite superfluous. If one is simply able to provide that specified carriers can engage in specified exempt activities despite any law of a State or Territory, why would one need to have something that also says `despite specified laws'? To the extent that there is a choice, we would much prefer (a) because we think the regulations ought to identify those particular laws and regulations that might otherwise be contravened. In that way, carriers will be able to know in advance what it is they can and cannot do. But if we leave in (b) and effectively negate (a) then they are at risk and in the dark. We therefore take the view that it is much more desirable to narrow the field and specify in advance, so that the carriers know where they stand. </PARA>

Also, hopefully, the Government will reconsider leaving in place many laws which have been passed for very good reasons in the area of environmental protection.

<PARA>Of course, such regulations would be disallowable, which will ensure that the Parliament can be satisfied that there were necessary reasons to make such exemptions. In this case I think it is unlikely. Nevertheless, in any particular case, to provide for the establishment of a second network where such a requirement did occur, the Government deliberately left that reserve power in. I might say, as a territorian, although the power under the transfer of powers Act, which was enacted in this Parliament in 1977 or 1978, has never been exercised, all laws of the Northern Territory-which is effectively a self-governing Territory-are subject to the reserve power of the Commonwealth. The power has never been exercised by any Federal Government, but it was put there for the deliberate purpose of being a transitional arrangement. This was provided for exactly the same effect; that is why it is there. I am surprised that the Opposition is opposing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister, Mr Beazley, in his letter said that where Austel acts to limit tort liability it must specify the classes of tort action which it is limiting and the level of the limit. What is it about clause 121 that requires Austel to specify the classes of tort? It seems to me that all that Austel is required to do is determine a single amount in respect of torts in general. If that is not correct, then we ought to have it on the record that clause 121 will be used in such a way as to deal at different times with different torts and to set different amounts, because it seems on the face of it to empower the making of only one Act in relation to torts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clause is drafted in this way-determining maximum amounts recoverable, which is not unique in legislation for damages, particularly in workers' compensation areas-because it enables Austel to determine maximum amounts recoverable in tort. The Government will oppose the amendment to this that has been circulated by the Opposition. The Government considers that it is necessary for Austel to make such determinations because of the potential for enormous and totally disproportionate damages to be levied against carriers for economic loss. In the event that a business deal, for example-and I will give an example that could well apply-was lost because of the failure of a 21c phone call, it is hardly reasonable under those circumstances to enable a carrier then to be sued for millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Austel is ideally placed to make such determinations as it combines legal expertise, technical knowledge of the industry and knowledge of the economic viability of the carrier operations. The reason for this provision is that it is a routine administrative and commonsense judgment which frankly, does not require the scrutiny of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is not what I am saying at all. Senator Alston knows full well what I am saying. I will be more specific: this chamber is certainly not the appropriate place to have a board. The analogy with Telecom is a greatly flawed one, and in fact it makes my case for me. The Government established Telecom as an agency, autonomous of government, that runs its own organisation. The Opposition amendments are in fact designed to do precisely the reverse, that is, to bring the running of that business into this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Considering all of the standing orders, restrictions and provisions in terms of disallowable instruments in this Parliament, I think that if one were uncharitable, one would be inclined to say that the only real philosophical bent that the Opposition would be determined to achieve in these amendments would be to make this arrangement as impossible as it can in terms of its actually working. As Senator Schacht would realise, it would protect the interests of the legal profession by moving to disallow regulations where the tariff was not, in the view of the lawyers in the Opposition, sufficiently high enough to attract the high fliers in the legal profession such as Senator Alston and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult to find any other philosophical base for the amendment. We believe that it is entirely inappropriate. We have set up Austel, with that combination of legal expertise, industry knowledge and sound commonsense, deliberately for the purpose of making determinations such as this. We think that it is sensible to have it done that way. I stress again that it provides a form of redress that was not formerly available at all. We think that Austel is the sensible choice and the appropriate body to set a cap, not the Senate chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>18. Clause 255, page 114, lines 22 to 31, omit the clause, substitute the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``255. A person must not sell or supply, or offer to sell or supply, to another person customer equipment unless the person purchasing the equipment is authorised by AUSTEL to purchase customer equipment the connection of which to a telecommunications network would be contrary to section 254. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty: $12,000.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to remove the onus of proof for buying and selling non-permitted equipment from ordinary consumers and sales people to the individuals who wish to buy special non-permitted equipment. I acknowledge that only a small number of people, knowing that they cannot connect non-permitted equipment to the carrier network, will knowingly buy this non-permitted equipment. Those who do will be hobbyists who want to put intercom systems into their homes and private networks. This amendment will put the onus on such hobbyists to apply to Austel for an exemption letter, which can be presented in a shop as evidence that the person buying the equipment knows it is non-permitted equipment. I have a letter from the Australian Information Industry Association Ltd (AIIA), which states:</PARA>
<PARA>AIIA believes there should be more stringent controls on the sale of computer equipment which does not comply with the relevant technical standards. At present, non-compliant equipment can be sold providing the purchaser is ``advised'' that the equipment does not have a permit. This provision has proved to be both unenforceable and ineffective. Non-compliant equipment is readily available on the Australian market to the detriment of those companies which, at considerable costs in both time and money, obtain the necessary technical approvals. </PARA>
<PARA>In other jurisdictions, the US for example, there are prohibitions on the importation and sale of non-compliant equipment. These provisions are rigorously enforced as Australian companies which have exhibited equipment at US trade fairs prior to obtaining the necessary FCC approval will readily testify. </PARA>
<PARA>We accept DOTAC's advice that a ban on imports of non-compliant customer equipment is not achievable-although we note that such a ban is in place for radio communications equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>But a prohibition on the sale and the offering for sale of customer equipment which does not have the necessary AUSTEL permit is both practical and desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>The AIIA claims that this view is shared by Austel and is asking that clause 255 be amended to this effect. I think that the onus being taken off the shopkeeper to inform the consumer and the onus of proof taken away from the ordinary customer who may not be able to tell the difference between the approved and the non-approved equipment is a good thing. The hobbyist or the individual who wishes to buy non-approved equipment will know what it is for and will make a deliberate and conscious decision to purchase such equipment. In the opinion of the Australian Democrats this amendment leaves less room for consumer misunderstanding. The penalty of $12,000 is fairly stiff, but I think we want to ensure that no misunderstandings ensue from this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. This would be extremely cumbersome and unnecessary. If the equipment is not interconnected it does not pose a threat to the safety of other users or to the integrity of the network itself. There are many legitimate reasons why people may wish to use such equipment. To draw an analogy-it is not my analogy but I will draw it-the law does not prevent a farmer from purchasing an unregistered vehicle for his private use within the confines of his property. I use that analogy because it will get Senator Panizza right on board. I think it is a very legitimate objection to this proposed amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also received extensive representations from the broadcasters and computer companies claiming that their equipment, which as the Committee knows is customer equipment interconnected with the telephone network, should be exempted from the requirement for Austel approval where such equipment is located beyond a line isolating device. The Democrats, as I understand it, have indicated that they are strongly supportive of the broadcasters' desire for an exemption from Austel for their computer equipment. I do not know which of the Democrats are allegedly supporting that but I do know some computer enthusiasts among the Democrats and some fellow `Macophiles', so perhaps it is coming from them. Maybe Senator Coulter could stand up and identify himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed to give effect to exemptions for broadcasters in the computing industry through subordinate legislation. This amendment would appear to bring all such equipment back firmly under Austel regulation so that all users of broadcasting equipment and purchasers of computers would have to get an Austel permit. I am sure that this is not intended by the Democrats. The fact is that the legislation as drafted does strike an appropriate balance between hefty sanctions-I think they are hefty at $12,000-on the interconnection of unapproved customer equipment, thereby protecting the safety of the network and its users, while allowing suitable flexibility in the sale and use of equipment for private non-interconnected purposes. </PARA>

From personal experience, and being a computer enthusiast-as I know some others in here are-I know that the more responsible retailers already tell people that. In fact, I am very pleased to say that on a number of occasions when I have purchased equipment from Dick Smith and, indeed, from Tandy, I have been actually advised that the particular equipment did not carry a specific Telecom authorisation for its use in a connected network and that I would have to use it in an internal private network which was not connected to a Telecom network.

In other words, it is a relatively trivial breach and the penalty of $12,000 under those circumstances seems to me to be an excessive one. On the other hand, someone might connect a piece of equipment and cause extensive damage and $12,000 may be a trivial penalty under those circumstances.

<PARA>20.  Clause 331, page 145, at end of clause, add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Civil proceedings do not lie against a person in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because of the making in good faith of a statement, or the giving in good faith of a document or information, to AUSTEL in connection with a public inquiry under this Part, whether or not the statement is made, or the document or information is given, in connection with a written submission or a public hearing.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 19 simply seeks to make the clause heading consistent with our amendment No. 20. Amendment No. 20 seeks to grant immunity from defamation in respect of submissions and complaints arising out of a public hearing held by Austel. We think that immunity against such defamation is essential. We think that, without this clause, people who make complaints in public to Austel may find themselves being sued for defamation. That is a very big disincentive to consumers and others who may wish to make a complaint. As the Minister rightly points out, litigation will be commonplace in terms of some of the clauses that we have enacted this evening. But we wish to protect consumers who complain about the service from any disincentive or punishment. </PARA>

<PARA>21. Clause 333, page 146, after paragraph (g), add the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> ``; or (h) a contravention of a National Code in force under section 117; or</PARA>
<PARA>        (i) the amount of, or the manner in which telecommunications services have been charged.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats wish to add two paragraphs to clause 333. I do not know whether the correct version has been circulated but the word `and' should really be an `or'. So the amendment should read:</PARA>
<PARA> ``; or (h) a contravention of a National Code in force under section 117; or</PARA>
<PARA>        (i) the amount of, or the manner in which telecommunications services have been charged.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Every other paragraph is connected to the next one by an `or' but unfortunately that has been changed to an `and'. Paragraph (h) of this amendment gives Austel the power to investigate a breach of the national code. The fact that it cannot do so at present is an anomaly, given the significance of the code. It is a very significant anomaly in view of the remarks that I made earlier and the Minister's response to those remarks with respect to the importance of the code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> If, indeed, the code of conduct is going to be so instrumental in the area of environmental and other protections-in other words, to substitute totally for the application of State laws which have been excluded from application-surely Austel must be given the power to proceed to investigate breaches under this national code. One would have thought, following the Minister's remarks, that he would, without hesitation, accept this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we do not think this amendment is terrific at all. We oppose both parts of it because they are inappropriate and unnecessary. Firstly, it is certainly not clear to me that Austel would have the appropriate expertise to investigate environmental matters. Frankly, I think it will be doing very well to cover the ground that it has without being invested with these responsibilities. I do not think it is appropriately equipped to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is envisaged that the primary responsibility for investigating a contravention of the national code, that is, to protect the environment, should properly rest with the environment portfolio, although Austel may give effect to the results of such an investigation by exercising its power to give a carrier direction under clause 119 of the Bill. I would have thought the Democrats would have wanted the primary responsibility for these environmental matters to remain within the environment portfolio, as the Government intends it will. Secondly, besides being ungrammatical, paragraph (i) of the amendment is extremely regulatory and interventionist in its intent. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government has already established comprehensive price cap regulation, administered by Austel, governing the dominant carrier to ensure that consumer interests are safeguarded. The amendment goes much further than that; it allows Austel to investigate any price charged by any service provider in the private or public sector regardless of its competitive situation or market power. I think it is a very extreme form of regulation making. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pursue paragraph (h), which particularly concerns me in relation to environmental protection. It seems we have a situation here in which the Government at one stroke can allow these carriers to totally ignore all State planning, environmental protection, heritage, Aboriginal protection laws, and everything else. In pushing aside all that protective legislation, the Government has said it is going to put in place a code of practice. That will substitute for that whole paraphernalia of protection which the Government has swept aside-the law as it applies to environmental protection; its protective mechanisms; its sanctions; its investigatory mechanisms, and everything else. That is what the Minister has just said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are going to have a code of practice, and yet the organisation which will be responsible for the supervision of that code of practice apparently will not be able to have the sorts of investigative powers to see whether it is being observed or not. In reply to my earlier remarks in relation to environmental protection, the Minister said that will be carried out by the environment portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Where in the legislation before us is the environment Department given the standing to carry out these investigations? Which part of this Bill slots in the environment Department and confers on it the powers which will ensure that the code of practice will be written in a certain way, will be investigated in a certain way, will be prosecuted in a certain way, and will set sanctions in a certain way-in other words, will substitute totally for all those powers which, with a sweep of one clause of this Bill, have been put in the wastepaper basket?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I advised the Committee during previous debate on this matter-and I think it does bear repeating-the code of practice, which provides for the first time a requirement on telecommunications carriers to comply with environmental law and a national code, will be drawn up by the two Ministers responsible-that is, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). They will together draw up that code of practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The manner in which it will be enforced is to be contained within that code. That matter has not been determined finally, and very properly should not be determined finally until that code is-and which the Government, as it has stated again and again, intends to be-a rigid and proper environmental protection in regard to telecommunications. The provisions for the enforceability of it will be contained within that code. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the matter has not been finally determined, I do not think it is particularly appropriate that we should finally determine it. It is highly likely, and perhaps desirable, that the enforceability provisions of breaching the environmental code more properly lie with the environment Minister and the powers that she may exercise very independently of the telecommunications area rather than Austel, which I do not think, on the face of it-and the expertise that we intend to put on it-is particularly appropriate to investigate breaches of the environmental code. It may be that when the code is drawn up it is clearly in the best interests of the environment to have that responsibility rest principally with the Minister rather than with Austel. </PARA>

<PARA>23. Clause 347, page 150, after paragraph (d), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(da) a National Code under section 117;</PARA>
<PARA>The mechanism by which Austel Pty Ltd will enforce the code, as I understand it, is that it must become aware of a breach. The breach in itself is not a trigger for Austel to take action other than to call on the carrier to correct the breach. Austel can then invoke sanctions when and if the breach remains uncorrected. This is a rather unusual condition in that the code of practice will become part of the law. Simply breaking the law will not bring a sanction. In other words, breaking the code of practice will not bring a sanction against the carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Only when the carrier has been requested to correct the breach may a sanction be put in place. I say that by way of preamble to this amendment, which seeks to add on to the list in clause 347 a national code under section 117 and a direction under section 400. Proposed new paragraph (p) of this amendment renders the carriers liable for legal redress for breaching the national code. In other words, if the law is broken and it is broken sufficiently seriously, then it seems appropriate that the carrier should be liable to a sanction for the breaching of the code. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Bill now stands, such a breach does not automatically invoke its enforcement provisions. It is first necessary for Austel, having become aware of the breach, to issue a direction to comply with the code, and if the breach continues Austel can seek an injunction or a financial penalty to be imposed for contravention of its direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that this is an unjustifiably optional and indirect provision, particularly in the history of environmental law. This shows quite clearly that an optional enforcement leads to no enforcement at all. I repeat: if environmental protection, under all the existing laws of state, is to be excluded but simply written back in by way of a code of practice, and a national carrier-and at least one of them, it is argued, will be the largest industrial activity in this country very shortly-breaches that environmental code of practice, then surely that breach in itself should call forth a sanction. It should not be necessary for Austel to go through the process of warning, seeking correction of a breach, and then being able to seek a sanction. </PARA>
<PARA> It again raises the question of Austel's lack of expertise to prosecute environmental breaches. Having heard what the Minister said a moment ago in relation to the use of officers in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories who become aware of the breach and who order that the breach be corrected, will it be the Department of the environment in this case and, if so, what is the interlinking at this level between the Department and Austel? Will the Department be able to invoke the code of practice directly or will it have to go through Austel, through this rather cumbersome procedure? In moving the amendment I ask those further questions of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some little difficulty in following the Australian Democrats' arguments on this one. The Government will be opposing the Democrats' amendment because it believes that the enforceability provisions are, quite properly and reasonably, laid out in the legislation already. The procedure Senator Coulter finds objectionable we simply find to be reasonable. We think that is the appropriate way for Austel to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The code of practice will be drawn up by consultation with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Minister for Transport and Communications. They will draw up the policy that will constrain and bind the telecommunications people, but it will be Austel that actually carries out the enforcement of that code of practice under clause 119 and, of course, the enforceability provisions under clause 347 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I find it a little inconsistent of the Democrats. One minute ago they were arguing for the far more difficult job, in terms of expertise, of investigating environmental breaches. Their amendment asserted by implication that Austel did have that expertise; we did not think it did. They then say, as Senator Coulter did one minute ago, that Austel is not the appropriate organisation to enforce action on breaches of the code because, and I quote him, `they would lack expertise in prosecuting environmental breaches'. With respect, it would take considerably more expertise to investigate and establish whether there was a case for an environmental breach than it would simply to invoke the mechanism that can be readily invoked under section 347 to prosecute the breach. I do find those arguments inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is satisfied that the provisions already laid down in clause 119, which provide for Austel to give a direction to carriers as to how to comply with their obligations under this code, and the subsequent enforceability provisions contained in 347 are appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA>25. Clause 348, page 151, subclause (4), line 11, omit ``or AUSTEL'', substitute ``, AUSTEL or an interested person''. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the first amendment, if a person other than Austel becomes aware of a breach it would be possible for that person to apply to the Federal Court for the application of the code of practice. As this thing goes on I find that the code of practice is becoming a weaker and less readily imposed set of sanctions. At least this would allow a private citizen or any other interested party to keep an over brief of the code of practice. Similarly, in the case of the second amendment, the words `or an interested person' are inserted. These amendments allow individuals and organisations to seek injunctions or financial penalties for breaches of the national code, and this allows direct legal action to be taken in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The law is indeed moving ever so slowly in the direction of giving public interest groups a right of standing before the courts, to appear in defence of environmental protection-in this case to defend the code of practice, whatever that may contain when we finally see it. It would also stiffen the hand of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories because we are yet to see how that Department will become involved in this code of practice and the investigation and the sanctions setting, even though finally that will be in the hands of Austel. We have the Minister's assurance that it will be, and I certainly hope that that is the case. This would at least allow the public to have an overview of that whole situation and to institute proceedings under this section. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment will effectively double the pecuniary penalty that could be ordered to be paid by the Federal Court in respect of contraventions of Austel directions. I think it is worth noting that amongst the matters that the Court can take into account is whether there have been previous offences. The maximum penalty would really, in practice, only be invoked against a carrier with prior convictions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, given that carriers potentially probably have the deepest pockets in the country, they ought to be at risk for substantial sums of money-not that they would necessarily be ordered to pay those amounts. Parliament has an obligation to make it clear that it does want to impose a pecuniary penalty that will act as a deterrent. When we are dealing with corporations the size of some of the international carriers we have to be talking in very large sums of money. We therefore think that $10m is quite appropriate in the circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed Democrat amendment to clause 46 would have made Austel directions to carriers subject to parliamentary disallowance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you proceeding with the other amendment as well?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht has asked me whether I am proceeding with the other amendment circulated in my name. I am not. I will explain the reason for that. Honourable senators will note that this amendment is not as rigid as my previous amendment. There has been discussion with my Senate colleagues about this question and it is frankly considered that the whole issue of content and standards for broadcasting, telecommunications services, pay television and so on should be the subject of an inquiry by a select committee. It is also considered that in the meantime the current problem of child access, about which there is considerable concern in the community, should be dealt with in this Bill, and that the Bill should also be amended to ensure that a precedent in respect of pay television is not set which would pre-empt the outcome of an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that is the view the Opposition holds, and I have discussed this with representatives of both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. The Telecommunications Bill and associated Bills are designed to give effect to the reforms announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which would, inter alia, promote competition and dynamism in the telecommunications industry, maintain quality and services, and remove constraints that limit competition and do not serve the broader national interests. The provisions of the package appear to assume that the public interest is served merely by market forces, technical quality and integrity but not by the observance of standards of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous amount of public interest and concern over the content and advertising of Telecom's 0055 and Discovery services. As indicated previously, last Thursday week I proposed an amendment that would have required Austel to adopt a code of conduct as a schedule to the Telecommunications Act and for carriers and suppliers to comply with that code of conduct. In fact, the schedule was couched in terms similar to those found in Telecom's contract with existing service providers for 0055. The provision also proposed that Austel be permitted to conduct a public inquiry into this question. However, since then, as I indicated, discussions have taken place and Austel has made it clear that it considers that it is not the appropriate body to establish or develop that code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators would know, Telecom has become concerned about the public outcry relating to its 0055 and Discovery services and has expressed legal doubts about its powers to set, administer and enforce content and advertising standards of the types that now form part of Telecom's service providers agreement. It was Telecom that first urged Austel, as the regulatory authority, to take responsibility in the area but, as I indicated, Austel considered that it was not the appropriate authority. I understand that there is also a view in this chamber that maybe Austel is not the appropriate authority. What has emerged from the discussions is that there ought to be a select committee of inquiry of the Parliament into this whole question of content standards in relation to broadcasts, telecommunications services, pay television, et cetera. No doubt there will be a number of other matters that honourable senators will want to have included in the terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I would have preferred to go along the lines that I proposed last Thursday week, but I understand the legitimacy of the view that has been expressed to me and I go along with it. I also go along with the very strong view that an amendment should be made to this Bill in the interim not only to cover the situation of child access to material that is considered harmful but also to allow for other material, provided that that material would not attract a classification of R or X or be refused classification. When I say `provided that that material', I mean that if it were contained in an item for classification under the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations it would, under the guidelines applied for the time being under those regulations, attract a classification of R or X or be refused classification. If it contained an item for which classification may be applied for under the Australian Capital Territory Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983 it would, under the guidelines applied for the time being under that ordinance, be classified under category 1 or 2 or be refused classification. That would apply to the existing and future Telecom 0055 services and the Discovery services or like services. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is-and I make it very clear to the Committee-that in the arena of the video and audio entertainment and information services the Government's own guidelines provide that VAEIS providers will not program AO material unless arrangements have been made to ensure that the programs are not accessible to persons under the age of 18. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Films or other material that is classified ``R'' or ``X'' will not be carried under the authority of a VAEIS licence or contract. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, that is a clear precedent and a clear indication that what is contained in my amendments is consistent with that particular view. Unless this amendment is carried, the lawyers will have an absolute field day with Telecom. Also, the new carrier will not be under any legislative constraints to adopt a reasonable code of conduct. Finally, I also believe that this amendment is essential-I do not suppose it is absolutely vital, but it will prevent a precedent being established-in order to prevent a precedent being established for pay television to include R and X material. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some reason, although it is not at all related to Austel, I have a funny feeling that we seem to have been debating this matter for ever. It has very little to do with the proposition put by Senator Harradine, the subject that he is concerned about. My particular reaction to this has to do with the ramifications of moving in the way that Senator Harradine wants to move. Indeed, that specifically is laid out in very clear terms in the schedule which was attached to Senator Harradine's original amendment which indicates the things which he wants to prevent being sent down telephone lines. At one stage-and I recall this as the then Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances-we had a regulation in force that made it an offence to tell a lie over the telephone. That regulation was done away with; it would have been interesting to have seen it policed and implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have sympathy and support for the proposition which further restricts access to 0055 numbers and I have taken that matter up with the Minister for Transport and Communications. But this legislation is not an appropriate vehicle for enacting what are essentially censorship arrangements governing the content of information and entertainment services that are provided over the network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that Austel is considering proposals to restrict and place limitations on access to this service. The 0055 numbers available now contain stories that I have accessed purely for the purpose of knowing what I am talking about and that are the dullest, most boring and most unexciting pieces of nonsense that I have ever heard, although I concede that the question of excitement is a very subjective one. </PARA>

But what is exciting is subjective. It is a very subjective matter, and that is one of my concerns about this amendment and its far reaching effects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of my own personal life, having an engine failure in a single-engine aircraft at 10,000 feet over the Arafura Sea rates a perfect 10; a leadership challenge in the Australian Labor Party would probably come in at about six. Nothing I have heard over the 0055 number causes the needle on my excitement meter even to tremble, let alone register a response. I do concede that it is a subjective matter, and that is contained in clause 405A (1) (a), which says:</PARA>

<PARA>Tonight I will not again get into the tortuous debate as to what a reasonable parent is considered to be, because we have been into it in committees on which I have served and here in this Parliament on endless occasions. We have already established here in this chamber on more than one occasion that the subjective test of reason that would be applied by Senator Harradine is not the test that would be applied by me or, I dare to say, by a great many other senators, all of whom would have different views about what a reasonable parent is and what material should or should not be heard by children.

However, I have considerable difficulties in censoring the content of what goes over telephone lines. In having a look at the original attachment to Senator Harradine's original amendment, I have to say that it deserves some air time in terms of the all embracing nature of what is prevented from being sent down a telephone line in the form of titillating or sexually provocative conversations. It would make the life of a senator very dreary indeed if that small avenue of comfort were removed as well as any physical contact with one's family.

I ask honourable senators to leave aside the views they may have on the matter of censorship. Senator Harradine complained about material being sprung on him from left field by the Government. I pointed out what a hollow criticism that was because an exposure draft of this telecommunications legislation has been around since February. I saw this amendment 10 minutes ago. It is not the same amendment as Senator Harradine confirmed he was going to move the last time we had this debate, and which I was familiar with. It is a new one which replaces that amendment, and I have just seen it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a matter of principle, and I say this having spent 15 years as a parliamentarian, I have a loathing of what the Standing Orders that I am more familiar with from another place refer to as `hasty and ill-considered legislation'. I hate making legislation on the run, particularly legislation which has such far reaching implications. I understand that Senator Harradine wants this referred to a committee. That proposition may or may not get up in the Senate, but it is interesting that before the matter is even referred to a committee-and we would expect this from Senator Harradine because we know what his views are-that reference is totally prejudged --</PARA>

I have had only half an hour to consider it. I have read it as carefully as I could in the less than 30 minutes I had before I had to get up to speak to it. I would be loath to see enacted in a vehicle which is totally inappropriate, as this telecommunications package is, for the introduction of censorship regulation that has been so carelessly considered-at least by this Senate. I know it has been well considered by Senator Harradine, but this chamber has not had the chance to have a look at it yet. That is a point on which I have to take issue with him considering the criticisms he made of the Government during the last committee stage debate in foisting this telecommunications package on him, he alleged, at five minutes notice. I do not think any other piece of legislation that has reached this Senate has had more exposure to the public and had more submissions made on it than this telecommunications legislation. But I hesitate to put my stamp on an amendment to an Act of parliament which talks about reasonable people and what such people would feel confident that minors could view or hear without suffering harm or distress and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know where it comes from. Senator Harradine knows full well the arguments. I think it is very inappropriate to apply the argument to what goes down telephone lines. I think the two matters are considerably different. Senator Harradine obviously thinks it is reasonable and appropriate to introduce censorship on what is going down a phone line. I do not think it is. What I think is absolutely appropriate is the question of access to that information. I know that Austel is considering that. I, along with others, have made representations on the subject directly and at length to the Minister for telecommunications following a commitment that I gave to Senator Harradine the last time this was debated in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of all that, Austel is actively considering restrictions on access to this information-although, making a subjective judgment, I think the content of those current services is laughable rather than titillating. One wonders who in the hell these services are designed for.

I know that Austel is looking at the possibility of pin numbers to get access to these services or an opt-in service-that is, one has to apply for the service rather than have it available on any service-or a recorded message stating at the beginning what type of service is involved, the cost per minute, the fact that the number has been called, and that the number called will appear on a telephone bill, as these numbers do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a reasonable and responsible parent, I have canvassed my concerns about the original 0055 service generally in this Parliament before. I was probably one of the first cabs off the rank. My office is located in the Telecom building in Darwin and I remember taking the lift down to the Telecom Manager's office on the same day that the 0055 service started. I related in the House how I found out that very badly reproduced pop music, for example, could be accessed at whatever the cost is per minute; people could dial in for the top 40 numbers. That service was not then separately identified on a telephone account. Telecom responded very quickly to that. I am not saying that I was the only person who made representations. I asked Telecom to consider giving customers an opportunity to opt out, which they did not at that stage have-everyone had access to 0055 whether they wanted it or not-that that opt-out service should be free and that, in the case of people who opted to remain in, the actual numbers accessed would appear as separate accountable items on the telephone account. I did that purely because of the concern I had about access to this service by minors. This was not just in respect of `Ena does Iceland' and `Debbie does' something or other--</PARA>

We now have an opt-out service where one can telephone Telecom and request over the phone that access to 0055 numbers be barred from the telephone, which I have done. Telecom then moved to ensure that access to these numbers is itemised as separate items on a telephone account. It would be a strange parent indeed, and an unreasonable parent, who did not have concerns about what their children were doing over the phone. I, along with most parents, share a concern about telephone accounts, even though the taxpayers pay for mine, and I think that is reflected in how much of that service I use. It would be, as Senator Tambling has acknowledged, a reasonable amount. Most parents are very concerned about their telephone bills and the precise numbers that were being accessed from the phone would be very quickly obvious to any parent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to speak briefly to Senator Harradine's amendment. In many ways my remarks will reflect the tenor of Senator Collins's remarks. First of all, as I said in the previous part of this debate, I do not believe that these sorts of amendments should be debated within this package of Bills, which deal with the restructuring of Australia's telecommunications industry. These amendments deal with other issues rather than the structure and operation of an efficient telecommunications system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine has the right-and he has used it-to put forward his amendments. He has already withdrawn one circulated amendment which, as Senator Collins said, has the schedule of what Senator Harradine would consider should be banned from 0055. It is an extraordinarily wide definition. I just do not know how, in any modern society, Senator Harradine could carry out that definition without it being used to censor, in a pluralistic society, people's right to know and do what they like amongst themselves. It is about time we understood that consenting adults should be able to do and share certain things amongst themselves in a modern society without having busy-bodies imposing their moral values on what should or should not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine has withdrawn that amendment and left the amendment before us, which does not contain the schedule. The schedule tips us off as to what he is really on about. In the amendment before us, Senator Harradine has in paragraph (a) a definition which he says he has taken-and I accept his explanation-from the definition used by the film censor. But we are not talking about films, we are talking about telecommunications-what goes down a copper wire or an optic fibre cable between two people. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Collins said, Senator Harradine's main concern, if it is genuine, should be who has access to 0055 numbers. I agree that there is a case that minors should not have access or be encouraged to have easy access to those numbers. I do not believe that Senator Harradine should take an attitude that everything should be banned because it is possible that one child sometime somewhere, even accidentally, may have access to the 0055 services that he is so offended by. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins has intimated that the question of access may be referred to a select committee of the Senate. I think that may be useful. I hope it does not go through the torture of the previous select committee of the Senate, which dealt with R-rated and X-rated videos. It went on and on and became an absolute saga which nobody could agree with. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw Senator Harradine's attention to paragraph (a) of the amendment which deals with telecommunications. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . material other than material that reasonable parents would feel confident that minors could view or hear without suffering harm or distress . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, how will Austel Pty Ltd determine who is a reasonable parent? Senator Harradine is not talking about an individual's minors; in this amendment he is talking about all minors. As I read it, parents could complain about any minor-not just their own but anyone's-having access to 0055. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what people will claim. I find it an intolerable situation that Senator Harradine would put forward such a sweeping clause that is open to wide interpretation. In fact, in some ways this clause and the one he has already withdrawn-thank goodness-are the sorts of things a totalitarian state would bring in to scare people off doing anything. It is the old technique: write a wide clause that can be interpreted by the police or the authorities in any way they like to catch somebody. In that way everybody is stopped from doing anything. It is a totalitarian method, and I know that Senator Harradine has spoken out against totalitarian communism in this chamber on many occasions. I give as an example what Senator Harradine has said in this chamber and elsewhere about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Quite rightly, this chamber and this Parliament condemned that invasion, that suppression of human rights and civil liberties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently there was shown in Australia a movie called The Unbearable Lightness Of Being. It was a fantastic movie about the Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1968. It showed every aspect of a totalitarian system trying to crush the individual spirit. Yet in that same movie there were scenes that, under Senator Harradine's definition in that schedule, would be inappropriate and would be banned from being shown on pay television. There is nudity and there is sexual activity, but it is not prurient; it is there in the context of the story. Under Senator Harradine's definition this movie would be banned. The movie does more to explain why totalitarian communism is evil than any number of speeches Senator Harradine or I could make in this chamber in 100 years. Yet he would ban it under the definitions he has put in this amendment and in the amendment he withdrew. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no wonder Senator Schacht could not get the numbers for Mr Keating if that is the sort of specious nonsense that he was trotting around by way of argumentation. Virtually the bulk of Senator Schacht's contribution consisted of reference to a withdrawn amendment. I cannot believe that he could seriously stand up here and try to persuade people on the basis of a document that is no longer in existence. I should have thought that intelligent human beings having a discussion on the issue could at least confine themselves to the amendment before the Chair. Yet Senator Schacht was so preoccupied with his own prejudices that at one stage he thought that Austel was going to be the arbiter of this sort of conduct, when that is precisely what it is not about. The original amendment, from which he seems never to have moved, did involve a reference to Austel, and that is precisely why we were not in favour of it. I commend Senator Harradine for accepting the proposition--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator did. He may not have meant to but he did. I think it is because he was preoccupied with that document and its schedule, which he seems to think is somehow the real agenda in this debate-a tragic way of dismissing the merits of an argument. I commend Senator Harradine on having accepted the proposition that it is not appropriate for a body such as Austel, which is concerned with the economics of the industry and the technology that has to be applied, in its spare time to accept the role of moral arbiter. Therefore, it was quite proper that we did not proceed down that track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what is now proposed, and what we ought to face up to, is that there are genuine concerns in the community about the 0055 service. Senator Collins in his more forthcoming moments uses terms such as, `I have a great sympathy and support for restricting access'. If the truth be known, he is really saying that he believes that there is very little going for these sorts of services. He does not believe that any healthy human being derives any great benefit from listening to them. We ought to think very seriously before we simply allow these sorts of things to be churned out. </PARA>
<PARA> All that is proposed in this amendment, given that we are all accepting that a select committee be proposed-and I believe that it will be supported and therefore established-is an interim arrangement that puts the onus on those who come later to revert to the open slather situation that we have at the moment. There is nothing wrong with that, in my view. If we want to maintain the status quo, we essentially have a hands-off arrangement and condone what is currently going down the lines. That is the very sort of thing to which Senator Collins and others say access ought to be restricted.</PARA>
<PARA> All that would be happening is that over the next period of months one would be in effect calling a halt to what is going on at the present time, pending the outcome of that committee assessment. That seems an appropriate way of approaching it. I am not persuaded, for example, that the various means suggested of restricting access will have that desired effect, particularly the opt in and opt out arrangement. It is very easy to envisage a situation in which one will simply be asked whether one wants to opt in or opt out without even knowing what one is being asked to opt for. In most instances people will be asked to make a black and white decision and there will be no genuine assessment of what they are opting for. At the moment one would be opting out of cricket and a whole range of other facilities. Presumably, there has to at least be a dividing line drawn between those sorts of services and the ones that concern this chamber and, I suspect, the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are significant difficulties in the way of ensuring that minors are unable to access the network. It is therefore even more appropriate that we have a mature consideration by a select committee of the sorts of difficulties that will arise down the track-concerns not just about content but also about the appropriate regulatory authority and whether it ought to be the successor to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, a standards body or some other organisation. They are all very legitimate questions. They are not pre-empted by calling a stop to what is going on at the moment. That is simply a holding arrangement to enable the whole matter to be properly assessed. We should not for a moment be sidetracked by grotesque analogies with a totalitarian Czechoslovakia. Senator Schacht is re-running all those old arguments that somehow were never prepared to confront the reality of what people were concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one for a moment argues in favour of totalitarianism, but it is a disgraceful distortion of concern about moral issues or about the sorts of values that we all adopt in a society to accuse anyone who wants to restrict the sorts of outpourings to which others seem to be quite happy to be subjected as somehow totalitarian and therefore not worthy of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality, I would have thought, is that nearly everyone in this society does have genuine concerns about the sort of mush that comes out and there are very few redeeming features in favour of it. Therefore, to talk in the same breath about it being censorship to restrict the sort of coverage that we are talking about is simply hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would argue very strongly that it is desirable that assessments be made of what ought to be available in the public domain to see whether such material does have any redeeming features-not to prejudge the issue, and certainly not to dismiss anyone who has the temerity to express concern and be prepared to consider limitations as somehow thoughtless, heartless, non-liberal and in all sorts of ways, as Senator Schacht would have it, totalitarian. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that there are quite a lot of people who I do not think benefit at all and who, in many ways, do not even know what they are opting for when they do call. Quite often, they might not even be getting their money's worth and they might want their money back. Someone at some stage has to make a judgment about what is available on those systems. For Senator Collins to pretend that somehow the standard that is proposed in 405A(1) (a) is entirely subjective simply shows a comprehensive misunderstanding of the concept of subjective and objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Simply because either we allow something to run on or we decide not to let it run on, pending a hearing. Senator Collins knows full well that Telecom has been making a very big fat quid by turning a blind eye to this sort of thing. It is now slowly succumbing to community pressure and it is devising a range of defence mechanisms by way of contracting in and by way of recorded warnings. It is preposterous nonsense to suggest that if we put a recorded message on it saying, `Beware. You are about to listen to a very prurient message', it would act as a deterrent. One can just imagine what deterrent effect that would have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has to be a decision made either to let it run or to stop it, pending a proper investigation. That is all this amendment is doing. I would have thought that that was a perfectly responsible position. It does not constitute for a moment the closing down of a service. It simply says, `Let's stop and decide. We will have a presumption in favour of innocence. We will make it conform to a standard where no-one can seriously complain about it in the meantime'. Senator Collins may well be the expert on these matters and he may be able to pontificate at great length about the relative merits of the various services, but I do not even want to start doing that, because it does not particularly interest me. I am more concerned about having an objective inquiry and putting in place an objective standard in the interim. If we go down that track, as Senator Harradine proposes, then we will be acknowledging the seriousness of community concern. We will not be prejudging the issue, but taking a responsible approach to it. I very much regret that Senator Collins does not seem to be prepared to do any of those things. </PARA>

I am simply pointing out the obvious-that Senator Harradine's judgment on this matter is best expressed by Senator Harradine. However, I would assume from copious debates in the Senate that Senator Harradine is as concerned-as he himself would state-with content as he is with access. From listening to Senator Harradine's contributions, I do not think that he would be satisfied until the content itself was removed from the services.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer Senator Kernot's question, rather than Senator Alston's interjections, the pin numbers would operate in precisely the same way as they do with credit cards now-if that were the option that Austel decided to adopt. In other words, it is a service for which one would have to apply. My own view is that the number of people who would actually apply for what is currently available would be very small. In response to Senator Alston's comments about that, I must say that I did suspect some time ago that the coalition had chased the last of the Liberals out of its ranks and I am now convinced that it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston made the extraordinary assertion, and it is a very common one, that because I have tried to become informed about what I am discussing and have actually accessed a service-and the Hansard will indicate what Senator Alston said-this indicates that I am some low character. In other words, he suggests that I am an expert on these matters, unlike Senator Alston, who said that he has no interest in this matter. I think that if people want to talk about being objective, and in the same breath suggest banning something that they admit they have not even listened to, before the Committee even has a chance to examine it, they should look rather to their own bona fides than cast smears and slurs, as Senator Alston tried to do. And, to be precise about it, Senator Alston, in the company of departmental officers, accessed these services to find out what material was in fact going to unsuspecting people down the phone line. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza should refer to the Hansard. It indicates an attitude, on behalf of what are so-called Liberals these days, that I find extraordinary. Pin numbers was only one of three options which I canvassed that I knew Austel was currently looking at. One was the opt-in service. The other option that I mentioned that Senator Alston took particular exception to-clearly, he did not listen to the last part of it-was a pre-recorded message that would advise people of what they were listening to. It was the last of the options that are being looked at. Senator Alston is now saying that it is a bad thing for people investigating things to even look at the whole range of options that are available. I did mention three, the first two of which Senator Alston did not even touch on. Fortunately, Senator Kernot has raised what I think is fundamentally what is likely to be, in my personal view, the most effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of my sweet reason, I have done what is available to other people around the place and not accessed the service. I have no need for any of the services provided, including advice on how to kill cockroaches, which is made available, the top 40 songs, cricket commentaries, or whatever. I do not have any need for any 0055 services. In any case, that was not in response to what Senator Alston said. The most effective measure I asked to have applied, which Telecom did apply, for responsible parents is that, as well as having the option to opt out of the system completely-Senator Alston was clearly not listening-a separate itemised account appear on every person's telephone account listing each 0055 number that is accessed in that service. So a person is immediately able to find out precisely what services are being accessed from their telephones in their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I raise that is that I consider that to be a reasonable interim measure introduced by Telecom since the beginning of this service, pending a more exhaustive examination. I stand on that: I think that is a reasonable measure to provide some degree of protection to parents who want to know how their telephone is being used to access this service. They know precisely just by examining the telephone account. Every single individual number is laid out on that telephone account as being a 0055 service that is accessed. I think that is reasonable in the interim. In the interim, Austel is examining the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has indicated-I did not know this until Senator Alston spoke-that it will be supporting the reference being sent to a committee, and it will go to a committee. Clearly, the numbers are here to do that. There is no doubt that the matters contained in this proposed legislation will be far more responsibly dealt with if a committee has an opportunity to examine it rather than its simply being done off the tops of our heads tonight in the Committee, it being part of a Bill which is clearly not designed to act as a conduit for censorship but is designed to operate for the operations of these new carriers. I do not want to unnecessarily delay the Committee any more. I think I have said as much as I can usefully say on the subject and I will leave it at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that explanation. We have heard a lot about legitimate concerns being raised by these amendments and about genuine concerns in the community about 0055 numbers. These amendments give us a choice of two possibilities: either we accept the amendment's proposed interim arrangements pending an inquiry or we accept the status quo pending an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To say that one would support the interim arrangements makes a lot of assumptions that I do not believe have really been formally canvassed at this stage in the way an inquiry would achieve. I think an inquiry would hear a very wide range of views and the extent and precise nature of the concern about 0055 numbers as distinct from all the evidence some of us have already heard on X-rated videos. That distinct evidence has not yet been canvassed, and I agree with Senator Alston that someone has to make a judgment at some stage. However, it is the view of the Australian Democrats that this judgment ought to be made after the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that, to avoid pre-empting the inquiry's findings, it might be suitable to proceed by ensuring that these amendments are actually referred to that committee in total, that this is a speedy reference and that the committee reports back at a date which ensures that the inquiry is not unnecessarily protracted in the way that some other inquiries have been. I think it would be quite helpful for us to have the opportunity to examine, for example, how pay television will be caught up in all of this and I would welcome that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, given a choice between an interim arrangement and the status quo, the Democrats would opt for the status quo in the knowledge that we were going to have this inquiry, and we would certainly be prepared to make sure that Senator Harradine's amendments were made part of the terms of reference of that inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate by briefly taking up a point made earlier by Senator Schacht: that is, that this concern is not electorally driven. I find that an astonishing statement because of the number of petitions I have been asked to present to the Parliament, and the number of other communications sent to my office, including communications from the bishops around Australia. I believe the bishops are speaking for their congregations on this issue. If they are not, I am sure their congregations would have told us the opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister should not worry about that because that depends on where one's belief lies. A few congregations in Australia can sack their bishops; one main congregation cannot, and I belong to that one. So some bishops can be sacked. However, I presume that the bishops are talking for their congregations. Certainly the petitions and letters I have been receiving are genuine, as are the petitions and letters other members of parliament who represent Western Australia have been getting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe we have to take notice of this sort of electorally-driven concern. I believe that following the interim line by coming back to the standard type of classifications presently in force for television and video would not be a bad thing to do until we have a report from the select committee. In the case of minors, we have to draw the line somewhere. It is all very well to say that parents must bring their own children up, but I believe one has to draw the line in respect of access. I know it has been said in this place that one can cut access by opting out. I opted out of one telephone service last week when I saw that my Telecom bill contained some 0055 numbers. I wondered what was going on and found out that the kids were using the 0055 number to find where the rostered fuel stations were. I believe there is a cheaper way to do that than by ringing the 0055 number, such as by reading the Sunday Times or whatever, so I opted to have that facility removed. Unfortunately, by doing that I opted out from other sources of information available through the 0055 number, such as stock exchange information and so on. Those are important things to which one must have access. I do not believe that opting out is an option at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that as a nation we have to draw the line somewhere with minors. I go along with consenting adults in private being able to view, hear or do what they want to because that is their entitlement, but we have to draw the line somewhere with minors. In the meantime, there are ways of going about it, such as establishing the sorts of standard classifications we have. Senator Kernot said that we should leave it as it stands until we have a report. I disagree with that. I believe that technology will take over, as it does in most cases, and that this material will not be able to be accessed by a child without the help of an adult. This could be through using a pin number or some other device. That could be the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Until that comes, and the technology is probably available now, we should go down the line of having an inquiry by this committee, which I believe is going to be a quick inquiry. We can then deal with access through the use of a pin number or other device, and there are other ways. Pin numbers can be inserted not only by voice but also by ringing certain numbers, as happens with some telecards overseas. We know from reading our mail that the electoral pressure in relation to this matter is not minimal. In view of that pressure, I believe that this is a good compromise until we can resolve the matter. </PARA>

There is a major problem at the moment which is twofold. It is being experienced by a wide range of people and also by Telecom itself. Telecom gets a large number of complaints.

All I am trying to do with this amendment is ensure that a precedent is not established. All of the nonsense, all of the straw men-or, as Senator Coulter said, the straw women-that have been put up are appalling. Senator Collins said that my proposal would have far-reaching effects.

<PARA>1. Clause 2, page 1, subclause (1), lines 7 and 8, omit ``a day to be fixed by proclamation'', substitute ``1 January 1992''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to insert a commencement date in the Bill, that date being 1 January 1992. We have many reasons for doing this. To begin with, we want to ensure that the staff of the merged entity do not suffer from the low morale and problems that ensue from the long period of uncertainty that attends these Acts waiting for a set date for the merger. We think that putting in a date in this way will break the nexus between the interconnect agreement and the merger. We want to make sure that the Government keeps its promise to go ahead with the merger. </PARA>
<PARA> In the explanatory notes to this Bill, the Minister for Transport and Communications deliberately left out a commencement date. I believe his reason was that this would act as a spur to ensure that the merged body and the new carrier reached agreement on interconnect price and capabilities as soon as possible. In fact, I understand that Austel's report on the interconnect fee may have reached the Minister either on Friday or today. I wonder whether the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support might care to respond. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my advice that the Minister will probably have a copy of it later this day, and it is proposed that the Government will deal with the matter expeditiously. It is proposed that the document will be available some time in the next few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The interconnect and transmission charges and service access charges, including charges for billing and other ancillary services, will cover all the Australian and Overseas Telecommunication Corporation's related costs in providing the service and underpin its community service obligations on a pro rata basis. Because of the vital importance of interconnection, we did not think it right to see the merger hanging on the interconnect fee and capability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that the matter of the merger has become a political football between some factions of the Australian Labor Party. I would think that, in not having a date on this legislation, the Government may be risking going against some of the special conference resolutions that called for this merger to go ahead as quickly as possible. I believe that the Government, in not having a date, is not adhering to the spirit of those resolutions. I am surprised that the Government may not support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is the Opposition's intention to secure a healthy, viable, merged entity-a reason it gives for denying the Government the merger fee-I wonder whether it might not also be in the Opposition's interest to remove the uncertainty facing the staff of the merged body. I cannot see why it would not be consistent for the Opposition to support this amendment as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government strongly opposes this amendment, for reasons which I must say are not in the least bit conspiratorial or faction-based or anything else.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I say in response to that, Mr Chairman, that I appreciate the Democrats' fundamental position. We are all starting from our own fundamental positions. I understand the Democrats' fundamental position that the very introduction of competition is a disadvantage to Telecom. But this amendment totally destroys the basis of the Government's careful and deliberate strategy in bringing this about. Telecom will have every incentive and, indeed, the obligation to implement equal access interconnect arrangements for the second carrier at the earliest possible date to allow the start-up of competition on a fair, competitive basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government has determined that the merger of Telecom and OTC for the benefit-make no bones about it-of that competitor and thereby the consumer will not proceed until Austel has certified that satisfactory interconnect arrangements are in place. There will be an incentive and we are hopeful that it will happen before that date. We have said very deliberately-and this is the sole reason why the Government has not set a predetermined start-up date-that the merger will not go ahead until the interconnect arrangements are satisfactory, as far as the Government is concerned, for the benefit of the competitor and thereby the consumer. If this amendment were carried it would negate the safeguards that the Government has deliberately designed to accompany the merger and it could fundamentally undermine the Government's strategy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no difficulty in saying that the whole purpose of this exercise is to provide Telecom with competition. I understand and accept the Democrats' position-that it does not want competition for Telecom-but we do. The amendment would negate the safeguards that we have built in to accompany the merger. It would fundamentally undermine the Government's strategy to ensure that the competition between the carriers is fair and that the maximum benefits of competition are derived for all consumers. Therefore, we will not set a date until Austel determines that those interconnect arrangements are fair, and I freely confess that they may not necessarily be particularly to the advantage of Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will oppose this Opposition amendment. We note that the amendment commences by saying that a succession day shall not be fixed unless the Minister satisfies certain requirements on financial papers and figures to be presented. The Australian Democrats believe that that is a fairly transparent device to delay the merger. We want the merger of OTC and Telecom to go ahead, and we do not want it to be delayed unnecessarily by subjecting the Minister to satisfying certain criteria, which we know will take considerable time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we feel that in part the purpose of this amendment is justified, and our amendments Nos 3 to 7-particularly amendment No. 7-are specifically directed to the matters raised by the Opposition and will sufficiently cover the doubts that the Opposition may have about AOTC's future capital structure and its initial capital base. I conclude by saying that the words to the effect that a succession day shall not be fixed unless the Minister satisfies certain requirements are an obvious ploy to delay the merger as long as possible, and the Democrats oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>3. Clause 8, page 5, after subclause (3), add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) AOTC may not issue shares, either voting or non-voting, to any person other than the Commonwealth.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment seeks to strengthen the Government's purported anti-privatisation clause, clause 8. The Government's proposal successfully prohibits the transfer of any shares to be held in AOTC by the Commonwealth. In addition, the clause ensures that 100 per cent control must remain with the Commonwealth until this Parliament otherwise provides. However, the prohibition on the issuing of new shares by AOTC to anyone other than the Commonwealth is deliberately limited to voting shares. That is, the option of AOTC issuing non-voting shares which would still be eligible for dividends and the owners of which would therefore have an influence and certainly an interest in decisions affecting the company is left open to AOTC. In addition, there is no limitation on the power of the Minister to direct that AOTC issues such non-voting shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet again, the Government is claiming that retaining 100 per cent control is sufficient to guarantee non-privatisation. The Australian Democrats support retaining the merged telecommunications carrier in full public ownership. Unfortunately, this Bill does not guarantee full public ownership, and I do emphasise ownership. Non-voting shares are obviously contemplated as a future financing option, thereby guaranteeing that the Commonwealth's 100 per cent ownership of the carrier will be diluted. Accordingly, our amendment seeks to remove the power of AOTC to issue shares, whether voting or non-voting, to any person other than the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members should be aware that voting against this amendment means they are voting against the concept of AOTC remaining in 100 per cent public ownership. It should be noted that the same model was used in the Commonwealth Bank privatisation and also in the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited. We managed to convince the Government to tighten the anti-privatisation provisions for the Commonwealth Funds Management company and we urge a similar decision in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this Australian Democrat amendment. It is an extraordinary proposition, considering the wording of the existing clause, to suggest that by not supporting the Democrat amendment, we are contributing to the non-continuation of public ownership in AOTC. Clause 8 as drafted in fact provides more than adequate arrangements to ensure that AOTC remains in full public ownership. The clause is drafted in terms of both ownership and control. Subclause 8(3) (a) is very specific about what gives rise to breaches of the previous subclause, that is, the Commonwealth not holding all of the voting shares in AOTC, and it specifies this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The following are examples of things that could give rise to a breach of subsection (2):</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the issue by AOTC of voting shares in AOTC to a person other than the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA>It is more than adequate in terms of protecting what the Government strongly wishes to do-that is, retain it in public ownership.

<PARA>Page 5, after the heading ``PART 3-OPERATION OF ATOC'', insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>``AOTC not to be bound by Loan Council</PARA>
<PARA> 9A. Borrowings by AOTC shall not be restricted to total borrowing limits for Commonwealth authorities agreed between the Commonwealth and the States from time to time.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment proposes to allow the new carrier to operate in a truly commercial sense. Currently, Telecom's borrowings are limited to that amount which complies with the Loan Council global borrowing limits applicable to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities. There is no question that this artificial limitation impacts upon the activities of Telecom, and clearly the same problem will apply to the new AOTC. </PARA>
<PARA> In its present position Telecom can to some extent cope with such capital starvation and it is not as serious as when the carrier will be in a competitive market, both internally and internationally. Indeed, capital starvation of Telecom appears to have been an integral part of the Government's philosophy of assisting any new competitor well beyond the level of fair competition. Accordingly, this amendment proposes to give AOTC the right to determine its own level of borrowings without the interference of either the Loan Council or the relevant Minister. It is also necessary to specifically disallow the Minister the right to intervene, as if this were not done. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Government will not support this amendment. I wish to refer to a report released by the Government after this amendment was prepared. This is a report by the joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into the treatment of government trading enterprises by the Loan Council. The report, entitled Coverage of the Global Approach, establishes some criteria for exemption from the global limits imposed by the Loan Council. The two categories which are to be free of such global limits are, firstly, those entities that operate in a commercial manner, with a demonstrated track record of meeting certain commerciality criteria; and secondly, those that are owned privately to 40 per cent or more-clearly, that is not applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> However, other criteria do apply to the new entity. The appropriate commercial framework would involve operating in competition with the private sector; appropriate monitoring arrangements by the owner government; being subject to ordinary government taxes and charges; operating as a public company; and having minimal community service obligations. I would appreciate the Minister's comments on whether these provisions will apply to AOTC and whether the fact that the community service obligations of AOTC are substantial will negate such freedom from the global limits of the Loan Council. </PARA>

<PARA> (3) A determination made under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to compel the Minister, after consultation with the board, to reveal the amount of AOTC's initial capital under this Act. This amendment will also make such a determination by the Minister a disallowable instrument which will enable the Parliament to review AOTC's capital structure. We think this is an important issue. We have the example of Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines which have been starved of cash by this Government, and the type of telephone service that domestic telephone users receive will be very much dependent on Telecom's liquidity and cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are being asked to vote for a merged company that we know very little about. I think a parliamentary review of AOTC's capital structure to the extent that we are talking about the initial capital is a very little thing to ask as shareholders in the Commonwealth.

<PARA>The Government will give full and proper consideration to the advice it receives from the interim board on the financial aspects of the merger.

He said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Telecom is in good shape; it will be in better shape, and it will be an effective competitor in the communications regime that will kick off towards the end of this year. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposition, simply put, is this: it is an entirely artificial concept to suggest that one publicly owned body ought to take money from another. It is about as specious as the attempt by the Victorian Government to have a transfer from the State Government Insurance Office to the Transport Accident Commission and somehow to pretend that was a sale of assets for which money ought to change hands. This is nothing more or less than a means of taking a very substantial sum of money out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has already let the cat out of the bag. The Government thinks it can raise up to $1 billion by way of a merger fee. It is entirely artificial. It is up-front, off the top, unrelated to performance, and unrelated to the amount of dividend that may be payable. It is a very effective means of crippling an organisation if the Government simply is in the business of wanting to add to its coffers. It gives the Government carte blanche in this respect. It is a thoroughly bad proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were fair dinkum it would be looking at the bottom line to see what amount could be responsibly paid out by way of dividends to the shareholders. But to somehow pretend that one arm of government can charge another arm of government up to $1 billion is an absolute nonsense.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will be supporting this Opposition amendment. We think we could give 50 good reasons why the merger fee should not go ahead, but because of the hour I will give just a few.

We see no reason why the Government should use Telecom to fund railways, as Senator Schacht suggested at the last sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I took the trouble to look up the allocation by this Government to the railways. In its whole history this Government has spent less than the Fraser Government spent in its last year. It is preposterous to think that, as well as putting in all the telecommunications infrastructure, Telecom should now provide all the rail infrastructure for this country. </PARA>

We also oppose this merger fee because AOTC is a company which will need Government financial support to become the global competitor that the Minister claims is the whole basis for this legislation. Another reason is that AOTC will be the universal service provider to most Australian households and this merger fee should not be used as some kind of bargaining chip with our money. This merger fee represents a second tax on consumers, who have already paid $3,500 per household to establish both Telecom and OTC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We want the Government to be open about the ruinous financial losses of Aussat instead of using the merger fee as a cover-up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My name was mentioned in the debate because of my contribution to the second reading debate. If anyone listened to the publicity of the special conference of the Australian Labor Party in September last year, they would know that it was a matter of considerable public debate that there would be a merger fee, that there would be money raised from asset sales-it was fully fledged in the debate-and that it would be used for infrastructure investment, including rail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it astonishing that the Australian Democrats have fallen for the three-card trick with the Opposition. The reason the Opposition is opposed to the merger fee is very simple: it wants to keep Telecom, or the new merged entity, as cashed up as possible because it will get a better price for it when it tries to privatise it. That is exactly why it wants the money kept. Whatever the amount of money is, it wants it kept in so that it can flog it off at a higher price. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary for Senator Alston to say that there is something unusual about asking for a fee for a merger of two government entities when the Opposition will be more than happy to get every possible cent out of it when it tries to flog it off privately, when it tries to sell it; it will not give it away. </PARA>

It would be quite reasonable. Senator Alston, as a supporter of the private sector, would be arguing very strongly for it. It is transparent why the Opposition is opposed to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am only too well aware of the lateness of the hour but, given that we are in the last week of sitting, I would like to say a few words about a few things. I could not allow this session to pass without impressing on the Senate the works of a very active group of people dedicated to saving an old house for the future of our children and for the benefit of childhood dreams.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I doubt that there would be many, if any, in this place who are not familiar with the delightful works of May Gibbs. Gumnut Babies and Snugglepot and Cuddlepie brought to life the seeds of the Australian bush. Who could look at a gumnut or a mountain devil seed after reading or having had May Gibbs stories read to them and not see gumnut babies and the dancing lucky devil?</PARA>
<PARA> In order to preserve that very special part of Australian children's literature and its history, some years ago the May Gibbs Foundation established a fund to save Nutcote-May Gibbs' home-from the hands of developers and the dozers. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years small, and not so small, donations have helped to raise nearly one-third of the $2.8m needed to ensure that Nutcote remains part of Australia's history. North Sydney Council has given $600,000. In a period of our history when government has given billions of dollars to build football fields, when million-dollar bribes and kickbacks seem rife, when fund-raisers for certain political parties can collect $1m from a luncheon for a few close friends, it ought not to be so difficult to find a kindly benefactor to help save such a worthy cause. </PARA>
<PARA> When one painting can be bought for $78m, what is $1m for an entire house full of history? One does not have to be a millionaire to be part of this wonderful project. The Nutcote trust has done its homework and subscriptions can be bought for $20. Donations over $2 are tax deductible. It seems somehow misplaced that people can pay sizeable amounts of money to visit places such as Dream World and Movie World to see imitations of the real thing when here we have a part of Australian childhood history begging to be saved. Members of the May Gibbs Foundation are to be commended for the work they do. They are not dreamers; they realise that once having saved Nutcote it must earn its keep, and they plan that Nutcote will play host to a wide range of educational and creative activities for children. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an opportunity for all Australians to invest in their children's future and to ensure that the memories of their childhood are protected. One of the things Australia misses is its link with history and the people of repute who have made contributions in the past and to have their memories kept forever. Other parts of the world remember their past so that they can prepare for their future. Why do we not support worthy causes such as the May Gibbs Foundation? I believe we should. I commend the Nutcote project and implore all honourable senators to support it. </PARA>

<TITLE>Mr Martin Vinnicombe</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="4756" SPEAKER="Crichton-Browne Sen N.A." NAMEID="XF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.36 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to raise the issue of the recent positive test of Australian cyclist Martin Vinnicombe. He was tested on 25 May by the Canadian anti-doping authority at the request of the Australian Sports Drug Agency while he was in Pennsylvania, United States of America. It was no accident that the request was made that he be tested and no great shock, I suspect, to informed bodies that he tested positive to stenolozol, a form of anabolic steroid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was able to be tested because of a reciprocal arrangement between Great Britain, Australia and Canada that does not prevail in respect of a number of countries, including the United States. We could not have got him tested by the United States. It is also of material consequence to observe that Great Britain, Australia and Canada all have independent sports drug testing agencies that are not creatures and captives of sporting officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Amateur Cycling Federation has banned Martin Vinnicombe for a period of two years. He tested positive at an International Olympic Committee accredited laboratory in Montreal and has been suspended for two years by the amateur cycling body in Australia. To my knowledge, the professional cycling association of Australia has not yet imposed a penalty. One would hope that it will also impose a reciprocal penalty. What is somewhat disturbing is that the penalty of the international body in such cases is a three-months suspension or a fine. One can have one's suspended period at any time one wishes during the 12 months. Presumably a professional athlete will take his suspension in the lay-off period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Christmas Day.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. That shows the absolute absurdity of the situation. I believe there was a time-it may still be the case-when most of the professional cycling bodies would add a second or two to athletes' times; in other words, there was a handicap. I suppose that was an incentive to take a few more anabolic steroids in order to make up the difference so that athletes could make themselves competitive again, but that is how it worked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two things flow from this test. First, it shows that, in countries with which Australia has reciprocal agreements, no Australian athlete is safe to cheat or is immune to testing either during training or during competition. Of course, that raises the question which both Senator Baume and I have raised before: the United States, for instance, does not have such a testing system because it cannot yet test all of its own athletes. As members of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts predicted in its excellent report-which I recommend to honourable senators-when it drew this material fact to the attention of the public, as long as Australia has an effective testing authority and until there is equally diligent testing in other parts of the world, Australian athletes will be disadvantaged. They will be disadvantaged to the extent that they do not cheat while athletes from other countries still can. Therefore it is imperative that other sporting nations bring themselves into line with the giant steps forward made by Australian sport to ensure that their athletes compete on an even playing field with each other under all circumstances. As I said, they do not presently do so with all other athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, this test shows the gulf in integrity between a number of professional sports and a number of amateur sports. Martin Vinnicombe can now turn professional and pedal and compete for a more obvious material reward without suffering a penalty for cheating, as he was proven to have done very recently. I should also say that full credit should go to the Canadians. They had Martin Vinnicombe's urine sample within five hours of the demand for his sample being made. I heard Martin Vinnicombe say in an interview that he thought there had been a gap of eight days; I do not know where he got that time from. If I remember correctly, he also said that there was a gap of 28 days from the time he took the anabolic steroid to the time he was tested, and he could not understand how he had tested positive. For somebody who is as well informed about taking drugs and not getting caught as Martin Vinnicombe is, I am surprised that he did not know that an injected oil-based substance would remain in his body not for 28 days but for a great deal longer. I suspect that he did not imagine he would be competing again in Australia in the near future and would therefore be subject to testing. </PARA>
<PARA> Having drawn the distinction between the professional conduct and the diligent penalties applied by amateur sporting bodies generally, I refer to the fact that Martin Vinnicombe, for example, was used to advertise the virtues of a brand of glucose drink. That advertisement sought to demonstrate that, because Martin Vinnicombe took that glucose drink, he was a champion. Clearly, when champion athletes such as Martin Vinnicombe are used as role models for young people it shows the impression such champions can have on the attitude and the outlook of young people. I urge the Government therefore to raise significantly the global amount spent by Australian taxpayers on sport. Something like $64m of Australian taxpayers' money presently goes on sport, and that is why some of us suspect that we have thoroughly socialised sport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the budget of $64m, something like 10 per cent of the Australian Sports Drug Agency's budget, or $200,000, is spent on education. In other words, of the $64m that we spend for gold-Senator Baume had something to say about that in his notice of motion this afternoon-only $200,000 goes towards educating young people that it is wrong to cheat. I hope that the Government does something about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Australian Sports Drug Agency, which is an independent body set up under legislation-very much thanks to the efforts of the Senate Committee and the barracking of the Opposition-demonstrates the effectiveness of an independent body. It also demonstrates its capacity to sort out the cheats from the genuine athletes and to be able to clearly draw that distinction for the benefit of the public and all athletes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 18 February 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Why is the Oestrogen Patch, which has been proven to prevent acute symptoms of menopause and also decrease the risk of heart disease and of fractures as a result of osteoporosis, not yet available to the women of Australia, even though it is available in 31 countries including the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did the company manufacturing `Estraderm' apply in March 1987 for evaluation and registration for the patch.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Was the prototype altered to stop the patch wrinkling, and did this involve a medical change.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Was the company advised in September 1989 by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee that although it accepted that the performance of `Estraderm' in the body is the same for the improved product, the company must apply again for the modified product.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Was a further appeal by the company rejected, and although the company submitted new data in March 1990 for the modified product, has no decision been made.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Was the evaluation time before the product was released in the United Kingdom 21 months, in the USA 25 months and in New Zealand 7 months; if so why is this product, essential for the quality of life for so many Australian women, being denied to them.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4759" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The `Estraderm' oestrogen patch, that is designed to be applied to the skin and deliver a predetermined dose of oestradiol, has recently been provisionally recommended for approval by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC), provided all outstanding quality and product information issues are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> ADEC, as an independent committee of experts, advises the Minister as to whether a product should be marketed in Australia. In reaching its decision the Committee considers the quality, safety and efficacy of the product and makes a risk benefit decision.</PARA>
<PARA> ADEC has not previously recommended approval for this oestrogen patch, despite having considered the matter on eight occasions since December 1988, as the Committee was not satisfied with the data on quality, safety and efficacy that were submitted by the company.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The prototype was altered, apparently to try to stop wrinkling, and this did involve a change significant enough to cause concern at the possibility of a different clinical effect from that seen in trials presented using the other patch systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No, ADEC did not, as such, accept that `the performance of `Estraderm' in the body is the same for the improved product'. The company was requested to supply data on the patch intended for use in Australia or to identify, if possible, use of this patch in any trials submitted.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The product `Estraderm' has been reviewed by ADEC on eight occasions since December 1988. On each occasion a decision was made, whether it be to recommend denying the marketing application, rejecting on appeal or, at the last meeting, provisionally recommending approval. In each case these decisions were based on the data and arguments submitted by the company.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I cannot comment on overseas evaluation times without any evidence to support the information supplied. Nor do I believe it is necessarily appropriate to compare evaluation times for what were different products and different data packages, depending on the company's decisions at the time. The `Estraderm' patch was first considered by ADEC 21 months after receipt of the application in the Department of Community Services and Health.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise that no Australian woman who has medically needed the oestrogen patch has been denied access to it. The patch has been available under the Individual Patient Usage Scheme for some years. I should also like to emphasise that there are other forms of oestrogen available on the market, that have previously been assessed and found satisfactory as regards quality, safety and efficacy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (5) In its Report on Higher Education Funding for the 1991-93 Triennium released in November 1990, the Commonwealth Government announced that a joint Commonwealth/State/JCUNQ Working Party was being formed to oversee longer term planning for higher education provision in Cairns in the light of a detailed study of the nature and level of demand.</PARA>
<PARA> The Working Party had its first meeting in December 1990. It decided that JCUNQ should document its planning projections for the Cairns site and a memorandum of agreement relating to the joint usage by the University and TAFE of facilities in Cairns, should be prepared.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Office of Higher Education agreed to oversee the development of the memorandum of agreement and sought the views of the two institutions on matters to be addressed in such an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Higher Education also asked JCUNQ to provide data on the size and nature of the demand for places in Cairns and the surrounding region, the array of offerings presently available and planned in future, student load projections in the light of likely growth scenarios for the University in the next four years and the funding available to support them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Working Party met in Cairns on 10 May 1991. It received and considered submissions provided by JCUNQ (which included the data requested by the Office of Higher Education); the local students and a Cairns community group (Far North Queensland Higher Education and Training Working Group).</PARA>
<PARA> The three principal parties, i.e. the Commonwealth, the State and James Cook University agreed on the planning basis for a new campus for Cairns. The proposed development is consistent with the community's submission.</PARA>
<PARA> Decisions on Commonwealth funding to support this development will be announced in November 1991, along with other decisions on funding for the 1992-94 triennium.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Estraderm patch has been provisionally recommended for approval as hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women provided outstanding chemistry and quality control issues are resolved. Due to lack of any evidence of efficacy, the Estraderm patch is not approved for the prevention of osteoporosis.</PARA>
<PARA> Caution is advised with the use of all oestrogens in women who have had breast cancer or who are considered in the high risk category.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The area of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is receiving a great deal of ongoing research attention around the world. It is, therefore, not possible to recommend any particular therapy as a definitive treatment at the present time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Standards of behaviour of service personnel are largely governed by the Defence Force Discipline Act (DFDA). Developing good standards of behaviour commences with initial training, where the standards laid down in the DFDA are rigorously imposed. Ongoing training emphasises expected social standards and includes drug and alcohol awareness and character guidance. When visiting a foreign port, the civil law of the country being visited also applies to all service personnel.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Prior to a ship's arrival in a foreign port, sailors will be lectured on the social and religious customs of the country being visited, and will be briefed on expected standards of behaviour and responsible sexual practices accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Condoms are available to all personnel aboard a ship visiting a foreign port.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department of Defence does not inquire into the practices of foreign warships visiting Australian ports, although it is expected that similar standards apply to foreign vessels as would apply to Australian naval vessels visiting ports overseas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The accident was subject to a detailed examination by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI). While no positive reasons for the accident were determined, it was considered that aircraft icing and/or pilot training and experience were possible factors. A series of recommendations aimed at reducing the likelihood of similar accidents was forwarded to the Civil Aviation Authority. Unfortunately, these recommendations had not been put in place before the accident to another MU2 at Meekatharra in January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) BASI is currently producing a report which will incorporate details of its investigations into both accidents. This report will also document the results of an extensive research study undertaken by the Bureau into the high altitude flying characteristics and performance capability of the MU2. The report is expected to be available for public distribution before the end of August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Civil Aviation Authority has been kept fully informed during the progress of the investigations, and has instituted a range of procedures for operators and pilots of the MU2 aircraft type. These included increasing the minimum experience and training requirements before a pilot is permitted to operate the aircraft. Restrictions were also placed on operations in icing conditions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The introduction of the Falcon 900 resulted in a reduction of No 34 Squadron's establishment from 184 to 128 positions, a saving of 56 positions. Apart from ten depot level maintenance positions associated with the BACl-ll, no firm projection of manpower savings was made. This was due to several factors encountered during tender evaluation including the large number of fleet composition options proposed and the difficulties in adapting RAAF maintenance practices and requirements to civil aircraft types. However, savings in the order of those actually achieved were anticipated and these were confirmed through an On-Site Establishment Review conducted in May 1990, shortly after the phase-out of the old fleet.</PARA>

<PARA> The total sum expended on the mailout project was around $179,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Reark Research Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Department to investigate the attitudes of veterans, war widows, carers of veterans and Local Medical Officers to health care services provided by the Department. In late January 1991 Reark Research presented their report which indicated that very few veterans and war widows fully understood issues relating to integration and most had not heard of the proposed Repatriation Private Patient Scheme. The report also indicated that there was a clear need for LMOs to be provided with information about the process of integration and its impact upon their patients. The use of direct mail campaigns was a specific recommendation of this study. As a result planning and work on producing the brochure commenced in February 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Embassy Staff have made repeated enquiries through independent non-government sources in Dili and Jakarta.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Such enquiries have not revealed any information relating to the apparent disappearances which Senator Spindler has raised.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Parliamentary delegation which visited East Timor as part of a wider visit to Indonesia from 3-11 February this year was thoroughly briefed on the human rights situation in that province though not on a case by case basis. However the answer to the fourth part of Senator Spindler's question is relevant to this point.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Embassy officers accompanying the Parliamentary delegation did make enquiries through independent sources in East Timor. These enquiries were later followed up by Embassy officers with Timor-based sources visiting Jakarta. None of these enquiries have revealed any record of the alleged disappearances.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I would not propose raising this matter with the Indonesian authorities. In my letter to Senator Spindler in February this year, I explained that the Australian Government's long term credibility as an advocate for human rights in Indonesia is best maintained by restricting ourselves to those cases where we have reasonably specific details of what occurred and where there has been some confirmation of the allegations by independent sources. As indicated by the responses to the first, second and fourth parts of Senator Spindler's question, repeated enquiries have not provided any confirmation of the alleged disappearances.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in East Timor, as in other parts of Indonesia, and make representations where appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The wing separated from the aircraft as a result of structural failure induced by metal fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The remaining Macchi aircraft were grounded until the aircraft wreckage was recovered from the sea and the cause of the structural failure conclusively established. Inspections were then conducted on the remaining aircraft. Those aircraft with no cracking were returned to service.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) During the inspection, four other Macchi wings were found to have cracking in the same general area as that on the crashed aircraft. The configuration and location of these cracks required that two of these wings be withdrawn from service. The cracking in the remaining two wings does not constitute a threat to aircraft airworthiness and will be routinely monitored in service.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No operational restrictions have been placed on the remaining Macchi aircraft.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 June 1991 (Hansard, page 4152), Senator Walters asked a question concerning the reduction in the spouse income threshold under Austudy. She also noted that the Austudy parental income threshold had increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Until this year the income threshold under AUSTUDY for both parental income and spouse's income was fixed at the same level, rising in accordance with indexation on an annual basis. In 1990 the threshold was $18,150.</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1991 the parental income threshold was increased to $19,300 in accordance with the indexing principle. The spouse income test threshold, however, was lowered from $18,150 to $12,150.</PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in the spouse income test threshold was made to bring AUSTUDY conditions closer to those available to the unemployed and to ensure that assistance is directed to students most in need. It is reasonable to assume that a student would have more access to a spouse's income for their personal needs than to parents' income.</PARA>
<PARA> Even after the reduction of the spouse income threshold to $12,150, the income test for married AUSTUDY recipients continues to be more liberal than the income test for married unemployment benefit recipients. A student loses $1 of AUSTUDY for every $2 earned by the spouse above the threshold of $12,150, which means a spouse can earn up to $24,733 in the previous year before the student's assistance cuts out. In addition the student can earn up to $4,000 in the calendar year of study before the student's AUSTUDY entitlement is reduced.</PARA>
