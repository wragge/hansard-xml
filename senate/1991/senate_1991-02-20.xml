<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to suspend the operation of the Wool Reserve Price Scheme. Suspension of the Scheme will take effect as from the resumption of wool auction sales, expected to be 25 February. The suspension of the Scheme will apply for at least the remainder of the 1990-91 wool selling season. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will provide for the Australian Wool Corporation to repay borrowed funds under a debt reduction program and dispose of its wool stocks in an orderly manner in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister. It will also make provision for the Corporation to make supplementary payments to wool growers in respect of wool sold before the end of 1990-91 wool selling season, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will further provide for Ministerial power to appoint an administrator or interim Board for the Wool Corporation, should this be required. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation is necessary to give effect to the Government's decisions last week on the future of wool marketing arrangements in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Those decisions were very difficult, and were taken only after very lengthy consultations by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy over a period of months with industry leaders, the Board of the Wool Corporation, and other members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision to suspend the operation of the Reserve Price Scheme was, however, in the end, inevitable. It was no longer possible to permit the Australian Wool Corporation, on behalf of Australian wool growers, to go on purchasing greater and greater quantities of wool, levying higher and higher taxes, and incurring more and more debt to do so. The hope that consumer demand would recover and that the Corporation's stockpile and debt would be stabilised has not been realised. </PARA>
<PARA>At a fixed Minimum Reserve Price of 700c/kg, buyers of Australian wool have stayed out of the market. Against that, the efforts of both the Wool Corporation and the Government to maintain the Minimum Reserve Price at 700c were simply not enough. </PARA>
<PARA>The Historical Background</PARA>
<PARA>The situation in which the Australian wool industry now finds itself has been brought about by an unprecedented combination of factors. While some of these factors have been at work over a number of years, some of the most significant have had an impact only during the last year or so-and, as it turned out, were very difficult to predict. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Price Scheme appeared to work well for a long period. Even so, it is possible, in retrospect, to see the genesis of present difficulties in events which occurred as long ago as the mid-1980's. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of floating exchange rates after 1983 put the Reserve Price Scheme under pressure. It was no longer possible to provide price stability simultaneously to both growers and buyers. Stability of prices to growers was seen as a primary objective. The sharp decline in the value of the $A which occurred in 1984-85 and 1985-86 therefore meant that wool became much cheaper in terms of buyer currencies. </PARA>
<PARA>China became a much more important force in the market, and there was strong growth in demand in other Asian countries. At the same time there were falls in wool production in major competitor producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of these factors the demand for Australian wool was stimulated strongly. </PARA>
<PARA>These events in the market caused a degree of euphoria and over-optimism to develop in the Australian industry, which led ultimately to unsound decisions in the setting of the Minimum Reserve Price. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minimum Reserve Price for wool was increased by the AWC between 1986-87 and 1988-89 from 508c to 870c-or by more than 70%. The rate of increase over this two year period was nearly twice as large as that over the previous six years. The 1989-90 floor price was, as a result, set far above the long term trend price-for the first time since the introduction of the Reserve Price Scheme in the mid-1970's. Effectively, the Minimum Reserve Price had ceased to be a ``safety net'' to deal with sudden unexpected declines in price, but had become an instrument for chasing the market. </PARA>
<PARA>This began to seriously affect the competitiveness of the Australian industry. The high price of wool relative to competing fibres had the result that synthetics and cotton became more attractive to processors. It also allowed other wool exporting countries to begin undercutting Australian producers. The much higher Minimum Reserve Price, after a time lag, strongly discouraged demand, and strongly encouraged supply. </PARA>
<PARA>The factors which had previously worked in the market in a positive way to Australia's benefit now went into reverse. The value of the $A rose, and wool production in competitor countries increased. By the beginning of 1989-90, the market had become very vulnerable to the impact of unpredictable episodic events. </PARA>
<PARA>A series of such events then delivered a series of further hard blows to the market in 1990. No-one could have predicted the changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union withdrew from the market in mid-1990, as a result of internal political difficulties and foreign exchange problems. China further reduced its purchases, on top of the severe reduction which had already occurred in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a slackening of demand in Japan, and in Western Europe as a result of a warm northern winter. 1989-90 turned out to be an excellent wool growing season in Australia. With low wheat prices there was little incentive for Australian farmers to turn to alternative forms of production. Finally, the invasion of Kuwait resulted in a further blow to the economic prospects in Western Europe, Japan, and the USA, and hence to market confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Steps taken by the Government and industry over the recent period</PARA>
<PARA>It became clear to the Minister and other members of the Government by late 1989 that the Reserve Price Scheme was in trouble, and that steps would need to be taken to place it on a sounder financial footing-by some combination of measures, including a possible reduction in the Minimum Reserve Price, an increase in the rate of wool tax, an increase in the Wool Corporation's borrowing limit, and other supplementary measures to restrain supply and encourage demand. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government then took a series of steps, in consultation with the Corporation and the Wool Council, over the next twelve months designed to bring the situation under control. It will be useful to recapitulate those steps. </PARA>
<PARA>During April and May 1990 the Minister made persistent and strenuous efforts to persuade industry leaders to re-examine their assessment that the Minimum Reserve Price should continue at its existing level, and to persuade the Wool Corporation Board to take the necessary commercial decision to allow the Reserve Price Scheme to continue on a sound basis into the future. As the Senate knows, the Minister was unsuccessful in these endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA>In early May 1990 the Government had to take a decision in the context of its legislative program on the maximum rate of wool tax for the 1990-91 season. the Minister announced in the Parliament that the Government would increase the maximum rate of tax to 20%, but that the actual rate to apply would depend upon a suitable package of measures coming forward from industry to manage the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>In late May 1990, after intense public debate in the industry about the merits of maintaining or lowering the Minimum Reserve Price, the Government decided, with the greatest reluctance, that the Minister should direct the Corporation to lower the floor price for the current season to 700c/kg. He did so to preserve the long term interests of the Australian wool industry and of the Australian community, given the significance and impact of that industry on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In giving this direction, the Minister was acutely conscious that, with the Minimum Reserve Price at 870c/kg, the price relativity between wool and other competing fibres would have been locked in at historically unsustainable levels, thereby preventing wool from regaining competitiveness with these other fibres. He was also conscious that lowering the Minimum Reserve Price would limit the cost of further purchases into the stockpile, and provide additional funds to meet storage costs. The reduced price was designed to send a price signal to growers to at least limit production. It was not expected that demand for wool would pick up immediately, but that demand would react positively after a time lag. </PARA>
<PARA>In June 1990, in the face of continuing speculation against the Minimum Reserve Price, the Government announced it would guarantee the borrowings of the AWC to $2.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, the Government decided that it was necessary to look at the longer term issues facing the wool industry. A Committee of Inquiry into wool marketing was accordingly established, headed by Sir William Vines, to report back to the Government by July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>After the blow to market confidence which resulted from the invasion of Kuwait in August, purchase rates at auction by the Wool Corporation increased sharply from about 40% to about 70%. In the light of this further development, the Wool Corporation recommended and the Government agreed to remove the ceiling on Wool Corporation's borrowings, to head off further continuing speculation about the viability of the Reserve Price Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In the context of that decision, the Minister called for the Wool Corporation to submit a Business Plan outlining how the Corporation intended to manage its financial exposure for the remainder of 1990-91, and a three year Strategic Plan on how the Corporation intended to trade its way out of its difficulties over the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>In the interests of widening the involvement of industry beyond the Australian wool producing sector, the Minister established an Interim Wool Industry Policy Council which brought in representatives of the downstream parts of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In October 1990 the industry presented its Business Plan to the Government. The Government subsequently took and announced decisions the objectives of which were to contain Wool Corporation borrowing requirements, to hold grower equity in the Market Support Fund at reasonably sustainable levels and to reduce wool production and increase trade clearances. These decisions essentially involved further increases in wool tax (the actual rate being increased from 18% to 25%), the flexibility to further increase or introduce a surcharge on such taxes next season, marketing quotas, and a flock reduction scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>After the Wool Corporation sought approval to commit to further borrowings, the Government decided in November that the Wool Corporation should be given a further opportunity to demonstrate that it could trade its way out of its difficulties at the current floor price. At that time the Corporation saw a prospect of a return to the auctions by buyers in December and early 1991-which are traditionally the peak buying months. The Government indicated that, while it had significant reservations about wool marketing quotas, it was not opposed in principle to the development of the necessary legislation, subject to being satisfied as to the detailed mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government made every effort to leave no grounds for speculation as to its support for the 700c floor, and the Minister led an industry mission to talk to major overseas buying countries to reinforce the position. Trade purchases at auction continued, however, to be well below the Wool Corporation's expectations. They improved in early January, but then they fell away again. The Soviet Union did not immediately take up our $400 million credit. </PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation developed its longer term Strategic Plan, as requested. However, virtually from the day the draft Strategic Plan was first formulated the situation deteriorated rapidly, to a point where ultimately the Corporation found itself in a position where it could not bring forward a Plan which it unequivocally endorsed. The Plan was eventually put to the Minister, as a basis for discussion, on 1 February. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day, faced with having to continue to borrow to meet its statutory obligation to buy wool not taken up at auction, and with its total debt approaching $3bn, the Corporation suspended auction sales. </PARA>
<PARA>Options considered by the Government</PARA>
<PARA>In its Plan, the Corporation put forward proposals that the 700c floor price be maintained for at least the next season, the wool tax be set at 35%, marketing quotas be introduced at 700kt, backed by export controls, and the flock reduction scheme be further expanded, together with additional measures to enhance demand. </PARA>
<PARA>As it was put to the Minister, tax and quota parameters in the Plan represented the extent of the sacrifice which the industry itself could tolerate-and in some quarters even this was seen as going too far. The industry, not unreasonably, had done its arithmetic and identified a breaking point. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally, however, the same principle applied from the Government's point of view. There had to be a turning point where we would be compelled to cut off exposure to the inexorable build-up in the Corporation's debt, guaranteed by the Government. the view put to us was that any downside risk of increased borrowings would have to be accommodated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, confronted with that prospect, the best advice available to the Government-and the Corporation did not disagree with this assessment-was that stocks overall could reach some 8m bales in 1991-92, peaking at over 8.6m bales in 1992-93, with a Market Support Fund balance of some minus $4 billion in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not a commitment, in effect a blank cheque, which the Government could with any sense of responsibility contemplate or accept. In essence, it was not possible to see how the Government, in an open-ended way, could agree that the Corporation continue to borrow money to keep buying wool at 700 cents. Moreover, the Government continued to have serious reservations about the acceptability of marketing quotas, not least to increasing numbers of woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA>It became clear that the Wool Corporation proposal was not viable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government examined a wide range of options in addition to the option of suspending the Reserve Price Scheme. Many individuals and industry groups came forward with proposals. While many of these proposals had elements to address part of the problem, none in the opinion of the Government provided a feasible, comprehensive response. Approaches which phased in the lower floor price over the balance of a season, either in pre-announced steps or by a progressive lowering of the Corporation's buying rate, would not have brought the problem of speculation against the scheme under control. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if these approaches could have been made to work, the Corporation's debt and stockpile would have continued to climb. Picking a new floor price, perhaps 500 or even 350 cents, would have involved a very strong risk of continued speculation against the floor. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision</PARA>
<PARA>It was clear that whichever course the Government chose would involve a long period of difficulty for the industry, with severe effects on grower incomes. The 4.8 million bales stockpile of wool held by the Corporation-more than a whole clip in some seasons-will take years to run down and will depress the market. The Corporation's current debt of $2.8 billion will also take years to reduce. </PARA>
<PARA>After having considered all the options, the Government decided that there was no choice but to allow the market to set the price for wool. </PARA>
<PARA>It was clear that there was a much better prospect of bringing both the Wool Corporation debt and wool stocks under control in the absence of a floor price and without the Wool Corporation buying in the market. </PARA>
<PARA>However, we have no illusions about the impact of the Government's decision. Direct grower incomes from the sale of wool will fall sharply in the short term. Some will be hit harder than others and, in particular, the market price of the middle micron will probably be lower than those of other categories of wool. China and the USSR have been key markets for these wools, which now comprise a high proportion of the stockpile. It is in this middle range that the Reserve Price Scheme therefore most notably masked demand. </PARA>
<PARA>To give effect to the Government's decisions, a new Part X, dealing with ``Temporary Provisions'', will be added to the Wool Marketing Act which will, in effect, suspend the RPS provisions of the Act until a date fixed by proclamation (see section 143). </PARA>
<PARA>During the period of suspension, the Corporation will not be permitted to buy wool (section 143). To all intents and purposes, the Wool Corporation stockpile will be frozen, although the precise details remain to be worked out between the Minister and the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>The AWC's flock reduction scheme will be reviewed, and, if it continues, will be scaled down and focus on animal welfare requirements. The AWC's proposed wool marketing quota scheme will not now proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision has also been made for the Minister to appoint for a limited period an interim administrator or Interim Board of the AWC (section 147). These powers have been included to allow the Minister to ensure the ongoing operation of the Board ad interim and in exceptional circumstances. The Minister will have the discretion as to appointments. However, it is the intention that the Minister would consult with the industry in making such appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>Wool selling arrangements to apply after 30 June will be finalised in April after the Government considers the recommendation of the Vines Committee of Inquiry into wool marketing, which will now report to the Minister by 31 March. If there is to be any form of Reserve Price Scheme from 1 July, it will be self funding and the floor price will be set conservatively against the then prevailing market prices. The Government has taken this course to enable the market to find its own level, thereby permitting the long term future of wool marketing to be decided in the light of market realities. </PARA>
<PARA>Debt and stocks reduction program</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided that responsibility for the Corporation's debt and stockpile should remain with the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is highly desirable that arrangements be put in place which will allow the industry to recover from its present situation in the shortest possible time, and develop an industry structure which will maximise benefits to growers over the longer term. To this end it will be necessary not only that prices be set by the market but also that the Wool Corporation's stockpile and debt be reduced in a way and at a rate which will maximise grower incomes over the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the proper management of the reduction in the Corporation's stockpile and debt will be as important to recovery in grower incomes as the pricing policy decisions will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will issue guidelines in relation to the debt reduction program and the disposal of the stockpile (sections 144 to 146). </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and the Corporation will develop a management plan by early April, soon after the Vines report is received, to deal with debt management, stockpile disposal, and Wool Corporation finances. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will lift the ceiling on its guarantee of AWC borrowings to $3.5 billion and extend its guarantee on all borrowings beyond 1992 for the period required to manage the run down of the industry's debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Payments Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>The suspension of the Reserve Price Scheme in mid season leaves us with a potential equity problem. There will be two groups of sellers, namely, those who have already sold their wool at 700c, much of which has gone into the stockpile, and those who will be offering wool for sale between now and July. Those yet to sell would, in the absence of supplementary measures, bear the brunt of the initial market adjustment caused by accumulated events and industry decisions over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the problem for some groups of growers in the middle micron ranges will be even more severe, since this wool is already in excess supply and could be passed in at auction or sell at very low prices. </PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons, the Government has agreed to a supplementary payments scheme for the remainder of the season. The scheme will be administered by the Wool Corporation. The administration of the Scheme will be in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister (section 140). The cost of the scheme will be shared between the Government and the industry. The Government will contribute $300m (see section 142). The balance will be financed through the AWC by a combination of tax receipts and further borrowings, which the Government will guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA>The wool tax rate will remain at its current rate of 25% for the remainder of the current season. </PARA>
<PARA>Underpinning the short term assistance provided under the Supplementary Payments Scheme will be the Rural Adjustment Scheme and the Rural Counselling Program, under which the Government will provide assistance to those most affected in the wool industry and elsewhere in the rural sector. The Government will provide additional substantial funds for these purposes. The details of this will be worked out in the context of the Government's consideration in April of a submission by the Minister on rural incomes, which will include the question of the Rural Adjustment Scheme and the Rural Counselling Program. </PARA>

<PARA>Research and development is critical for the long term future of the wool industry. The Government will be prepared to consider increased assistance for R and D to supplement industry levies particularly in 1991-92. To ensure that R&amp; is not compromised by Wool Corporation funding difficulties, a Wool R&amp; Corporation will be established separate from the Wool Corporation. However, it may be expected that the R&amp; Corporation will share accommodation and administrative services with the Corporation, unless its own Board determines that these services can be provided more efficiently by other means. </PARA>
<PARA>Further improvements will also need to be made in Australia's wool promotion and marketing efforts and improvement in the operating structure and capacity of the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA>If I may sum up. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been required to take some very tough decisions in order to secure the future viability and prosperity of the Australian wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>All the parties involved, namely, industry leaders, the Australian Wool Corporation, individual woolgrowers, people involved in downstream activities, and the Government, must now work harmoniously together if the industry is to reap the full benefits of these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no point in looking backwards, or in engaging in a search for scapegoats. We have to press ahead, together, to see the industry through one of the worst phases of its long and proud history. </PARA>
<PARA>A managed operation will now be put in place which will enable the industry to pull through in reasonable shape over the next five years and beyond. The industry will retain primary responsibility for its affairs while the Government provides the support necessary to manage the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>The decisions which the legislation before the Senate will permit us to implement are the correct ones for the industry, individual woolgrowers, end users, and the Australian tax payer. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 3), the fact that we have a third Appropriation Bill gives rise to canvass more broadly the manner in which the Government conducts its business, including forecasting the Budget, use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and, indeed, the accuracy of predictions of expenditure which it predicates along the process. This Bill seeks to appropriate expenditure in addition to the normal appropriations process, and the usual practice for unseen or urgent payments being accommodated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance I think needs some closer scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last several days we have had before the Senate the statement of approvals that were sought to be made for payments from that Advance both by way of additional payment and payments in advance of the passage of this Bill. There are a couple of payments included in those figures which are worthy of closer scrutiny. Firstly, there is the sum of some $3.3m, which has been necessary for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for payment to various United Nations organisations of which Australia is a member. We got the sums wrong to the tune of $3.3m because of a variation in the exchange rate. In the explanatory notes supporting the application for the payment from that source, the case is made out that, as we are required to make timely payment, we had to take the exchange rate as it existed at the appropriate date, and therefore suffer the loss. I think a better effort can be made so that we do not incur losses of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, and more seriously, $22m was claimed by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to promote Australia abroad-again a total lack of forethought and planning. In January the total claims for the Federal bureaucracy were over $70m. A large proportion of that figure obviously could have been considered earlier. In all honesty, perhaps the description that is relied upon that the payments were required because they were urgent or unforeseen could be said to be stretching the truth somewhat. There is considerable ministerial discretion in determining what classes of expenditure are either urgent or unforeseen. Perhaps the Minister representing the Minister for Finance (Senator Button) should exercise his discretion to put greater pressure on the public service and fellow Ministers to get it right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us will allow for an additional sum of money to be appropriated above and beyond those figures which were contained in the Budget. Specifically the Bill seeks to appropriate $234.1m for the current financial year. Of this, $52.7m is for the Department of Defence for equipment and stores expenditures associated with the deployment of our forces in the Gulf. An additional $16.2m for this financial year is to be sought through the additional Estimates process. A further $181.4m is for payments by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet the Australian Wheat Board claims associated with the Iraq defaults on credit sales. This figure constitutes Australia's contribution to the insurance policy under the Export Finance Insurance Corporation and the national interest export insurance scheme. Of that sum, some $43m was sought through the Advance to the Minister for Finance in anticipation of this Bill being passed. </PARA>
<PARA> To put that into context, it is important to realise that Iraq has been an important export market for our wheat in recent years. It was our largest wheat market in 1989-90, representing 10 per cent of our total wheat exports. In the 1988-89 financial year Australia exported $293m worth of wheat to Iraq. That figure was increased in 1989-90 to $392m. In fact, we supplied Iraq with 50 per cent of its total wheat imports prior to the Kuwait invasion. The loss of that market amounts to a body blow for the Australian wheat industry at the worst possible time of economic recession and gives particular hardship to the man on the land. The timing for the wheat industry could not be worse. There has been world overproduction in wheat, with a bumper harvest in the Northern Hemisphere. When this is combined with the results of the farm subsidies of both the United States and the European Community and the increase of farm costs under this Government in Australia, profits have been very badly squeezed. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to our wheat sales to Iraq, until 1987-88 Australia was the sole supplier of wheat to Kuwait, which earned us $13m in that year. That supply evaporated when the United States began selling to Kuwait at subsidised prices. There is a similar problem with regard to Egypt. The point is that the Budget was brought down after Iraq invaded Kuwait. It is important to note that the Budget made absolutely no provision for expenditure of this kind. It made no allowance for the fact that there would be serious payments to be made out of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation and that there would be a shortfall in our export sales. Had the Government had a modicum of foresight, there would be no need to rush this Bill through to allow for this particular expenditure. The Opposition has agreed to limit its speakers to 10 minutes to allow more senators to speak and to allow the Bill to be passed as speedily as the Government would hope, despite the fact that if there had been proper planning there would have been no need to introduce this Bill in this form in this hurry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may answer that it is all very well to say with hindsight that there should have been provision made. The fact is that the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations (Mr Downer) predicted at the time of the Budget that the Government would be in exactly this position. In a press release that he put out on 24 August, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . although the Opposition totally supported the application of sanctions against Iraq, it was concerned that provision for compensation to the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) had not been made in last Tuesday's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>No provision was made in the Budget under the National Interest Export Insurance scheme, which is totally underwritten by the Commonwealth, to cover this considerable debt which could be claimed by the AWB if Iraq fails to meet its payments on time. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words fell on deaf ears. The Government made no planning and now we are rushing an important Bill through this House. The fact that there was, as I mentioned, nearly $44m already paid out by the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which was tabled last week, pending the passage of this Bill is of concern given that this action has pre-empted the authority of the Parliament in the passage of this legislation. In addition to the $181.4m, a further $29.7m may be required to June and this will be included in the additional Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take a moment to point out the importance of the whole process of the Estimates committees. The Government tends to try to disparage the work that is done in the Estimates committees by saying that they are a lengthy process, that too many questions are asked or something else. The fact is that it is one of the most important links of scrutiny between the Government--</PARA>

If it does take a lengthy period to get through some of the information, it is usually because there was obfuscation somewhere along the line in getting the information out into the open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last couple of minutes that I have left this morning, it would be remiss of me if I did not mention the question of Austrade. We have just lost export markets with regard to wheat, so the question of increasing our exports has become even more important. I think it is important to note that the McKinsey report relating to Austrade-the Australian Trade Commission-which has been given to the Minister and placed in the hands of the Board was not available to members of the Parliament; but it was made available to members of the journalistic profession. Some of us have managed to get hold of a couple of that report. It is exceedingly critical of Austrade. I think it is important when finally we come to debate the report to note for instance that it draws our attention to statistics such as 45 per cent of the resources of Austrade being used for back-up facilities, and that for every one person on the line who is in fact having client contact and actually helping with our exports, there is an average of 1 1/2 people to back him up. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there is a very serious question to be asked of the Minister responsible, who has fought so assiduously to keep control of Austrade when quite clearly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was very keen to have it as well. I think it is most important that we ask questions of the Minister as to why, since the interception of Austrade, oversight and scrutiny have been lacking, so that we can get this very damning report that says very simply that everything from the leadership of Austrade to the deployment of resources to the philosophical implementation of policy has been lacking and poor. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, when we come to look at a Bill such as a third Bill to appropriate further funds for expenditure that the Government properly ought to have taken into account at the time of the Budget, it allows us to speak on a more wide ranging series of subjects. I know that some of my colleagues will also be taking that opportunity to criticise the Government in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that the Bill, urgent though it is, and needing to go through, does not take away from the fact that it is poor planning on the part of the Government that has left us in this mess. The Government has time and again relied on the Advance to the Minister for Finance to overcome deficiencies of planning simply through negligence of duty in some cases. This has given us an opportunity to highlight that deficiency in Government planning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 seeks appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for two different purposes. Today I will address only the question of funding to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on its payments for wheat sales. It seems highly unlikely that Iraq will indeed make payments in the foreseeable future. There will be a considerable time of rebuilding and reconstructing that country once this war is over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress that this payment is one the Government cannot avoid. It therefore cannot be seen as additional support or extra assistance for the rural community at this time as the Government has an obligation under the national insurance provisions to find this money. It is on the issue of assistance for the rural community at this time that I wish to concentrate this morning. It would be very difficult to overstate the plight of rural people in 1991, in particular farmers and small business people. Nearly 75 per cent of Australian wheat farmers are likely to have a negative income this year; that is, they will be losing money despite the fact that their crop might be one of the best they have grown in recent times. The Grains Council of Australia has indicated that there is every likelihood that farmers will be unable to plant between one-third and half the nation's wheat growing area in the coming year. This has dramatic implications for their future livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to note that the Government is at least going to write to the United States (US) to protest that its trade practices are destroying the viability of Australian farmers. We learned yesterday that it is possible that a trade delegation might be sent to the US. Far more must be done. Farmers and their families need practical assistance. They must be able to tap into at least the existing support services available for low income city families. Hopefully, these support payments will be required only for a short time, but they must be available. </PARA>
<PARA> As of yesterday the National Farmers Federation has new figures which show that there will be a drop in farm income of around 67 per cent this year. This is even worse than the income figures forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, which estimated a fall of 57 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the wheat farmers and many of the sheep farmers who are facing financial ruin. Many commodities right across the board are worth less than the cost of production. There is a wide variety of reasons for this crisis now being faced by Australian farmers. I suggest that the problems are related to government action or inaction. I note also that solutions to the specific problems are within the control of the Government, at least to some extent.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give honourable senators some examples of other farmers who are facing real difficulties. To do this I will read from a document prepared by the Riverland Fight for Survival Committee late last year. It is titled `Crisis in Australian Horticulture' and asks:</PARA>
<PARA>DID YOU KNOW?</PARA>
<PARA> Australian family growers of crops like dried fruit, canning fruit, citrus, apples, pears, potatoes, peanuts, pineapples, beans, bananas, sugar . . . are being forced off their land by a flood of cheap imported foods;</PARA>
<PARA> State and Federal Government FREE TRADE and DEREGULATION policies are actively encouraging these imports, to supposedly ``make Australia more efficient. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Liberal and National parties, instead of opposing these policies, think the government should move faster to abolish protection for Australian industries;</PARA>
<PARA> Last year, Australia added $2.1 billion to its national debt (which we and our children will eventually have to repay!), by importing foodstuffs that COULD have been bought from Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>THESE IMPORTS COME FROM COUNTRIES WHICH:</PARA>
<PARA> Protect their own industries if Australia tries to export to THEIR country . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It gives an example of Turkish dried apricots which can come in here duty free, but if we want to send fruit to Turkey, we would face a 40 per cent import duty. It continues that these imports come from countries which:</PARA>
<PARA> Subsidise their growers, and land goods in Australia at prices so low, that Australian growers can't even grow their crops for these prices, let alone make themselves anything extra to live on! (e.g. Greek peaches sell for half the Australian price, and Greek growers get $200 per tonne subsidy; oranges cost an average of $150/tonne to grow in the Riverland, but growers here are expected at present to sell them for around $70/tonne to compete with Brazilian juice!)</PARA>
<PARA> Have wages levels and a standard of living which are clearly unacceptable to Australians (e.g. compare the $7/tonne Brazilian orange pickers get to the $40/tonne for Australians; or our apple-picking wages, compared to the $3.50/day earned by Chilean pickers!)</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the plight of farmers we ask the Government: when will it make the family allowance supplement available for farming families? The Australian Democrats argue that this is preferable to special crisis payments. Why should farm families not be treated as other Australians are when they are in genuine need? Families in urban Australia can access support benefits readily if their income drops. Many farming families will have negative incomes this year, yet because of high valuations put on their properties-I emphasis these are often very high and unrealistic valuations-these families are denied any support. I stress that the family farm is not a readily saleable asset. Many farmers are already in debt and cannot go on borrowing. Indeed the banks would be very reluctant to lend for the purpose of simply providing a farming family with food and clothing. We strongly argue that the family farm is a tool of trade and should be treated as such. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government suggesting farmers should do at this stage? Perhaps the Government is still not convinced that farmers and small business people are in real need. I would like to now quote from a draft statement on wealth distribution from the Catholic Bishops of Australia. It is titled `Common wealth and common good'. The conclusion of chapter 1 on page 25 of the statement reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We conclude this chapter by drawing attention to disturbing reports that small businesses and farming enterprises have been collapsing at an increasing rate in this country. Undoubtedly a number of factors, including the availability of easy credit in the 1980s, followed by a downturn in the economy, have contributed to this. It may not be helpful to look for culprits, but it is necessary to state that true national wellbeing will not exist unless the health of the small farming and business sector is assured. </PARA>
<PARA>Looking specifically at child poverty, on page 31 the statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is generally agreed that family support initiatives like the Family Allowance Supplement have reduced child poverty substantially over the past year or so. Commonly quoted figures suggest that the number of children in poor families fell from around 750 000 or 800 000 to perhaps 400 000 or 500 000 after these measures were implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent studies make it clear, however, that child poverty in Australia remains a desperate and in many ways a scandalous problem. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally the statement looks specifically at poverty in farming communities. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>As noted in Chapter 1 . . . serious financial problems affected the rural area during the 1980s. The inquiry received a number of submissions on the plight of farmers created by reducing commodity prices, high interest rates and the resultant high exchange rate of the Australian dollar; the decreasing population in many rural areas; the lack of educational and employment opportunities; and the high cost of services and fuel in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA>It was pointed out that better times for agriculture did not automatically mean an end of farm adjustment problems or relief for the small businesses relying on the farming economy. </PARA>
<PARA>After studying the situation in 78 Victorian rural communities, Bruce McKenzie, of the Warrnambool Institute of Adult Education said that `Australia is developing an increasing peasant underclass and previously middle-class people are now in the depth of poverty'. McKenzie found that the level of child poverty in the areas was double the national rate of one in eight. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties faced by rural families are further compounded by the assets test on Austudy. Yes, it is more relaxed but it is still far too high for most farm families to access and the very unrealistic valuations placed on farm families by the Australian Valuation Office (AVO) lead to further problems. Not only do young rural people want to study agricultural practices and attend specialist horticultural colleges and other courses that would enhance their general education, but also many rural parents are actively encouraging their young people to think about leaving the farm. They want their sons and daughters to gain other qualifications as they see little, if any, future for them on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to go through a number of case histories from South Australia. These are gradually building up as we talk to people who are having major problems with Austudy. I stress that I have summarised these-indeed a number of other honourable senators have copies of these, because they were presented to the committee when it looked into the assets test on the family allowance and the family allowance supplement-in such a way that the identity of the people involved is unable to be ascertained. </PARA>
<PARA> The family in case A lives in Balaklava in South Australia. It relied on the Department of Lands valuation, which was accepted, of $315,000 for the farm. The AVO retrospectively revalued the property from 1 January 1989 up to $421,000 and now it has to pay back $14,500, as it had already been obtaining Austudy for several children. This family suggests that the AVO looks at the highest price per hectare in the entire district-even though a neighbour may only be adding a prized piece of land to his own holding-and then extrapolates that for all other properties. The modern four bedroom home was valued down to only $68,000. For the benefit of honourable senators here, I will stress that by valuing the property up and the house down-making a larger and larger gap-it means there is even less likelihood that the family will qualify for Austudy. A local land agent looked at the AVO valuation and he believed that it was totally unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA> Case B from the mid-north in South Australia is about a family with three children; all of whom are attending tertiary study. It has been asked to repay the 1989 and 1990 Austudy allowances amounting to $16,063.13. It also used the Valuer General's capital valuation which, in 1989, was $516,000; and in 1990, $578,000-although that was reduced by $21,000 due to a mistake. However, the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) did not accept the Valuer General's figures and the AVO revalued the farm upward to $735,000. After review it went down to $675,000 but this still means that it has to repay the money. </PARA>
<PARA> Case D is another one from the mid-north where the family has two teenage children and, in this case, was forced to pay back the family allowance supplement (FAS) because of a very large wool cheque that arrived late in the year. Despite the fact that income this year is down 55 per cent the family is now ineligible and it desperately needs both FAS and Austudy. The family says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is frightening to think of the future. Where will the money come from? I think having to put up with all the hardship is enough without the Government trying to squeeze us any more. We haven't got any more.</PARA>
<PARA> Case F is a family from near Port Lincoln which has three sons; the eldest of whom wants to go to Roseworthy Agricultural College. The family already does not qualify under the assets test, despite the taxable income last year being $21,000. It cannot afford for him to work on the farm and there are no local jobs. The family asks: what do we do?</PARA>
<PARA> Case G comes from Crystal Brook in South Australia. This family has eight children and, with the eldest son in tertiary education, was accepted for Austudy. But the family also had its farm revalued upwards and was found to be $32,098 over the limit. It has to pay back $1,985 and it has, I understand, appealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Case H is again from the mid-north of South Australia. It involves two children. On the advice of DEET, the farm assets were valued as per council rates notice less the replacement or insurance value of the house plus curtilage, and therefore they qualified. However, the Australian Valuation Office revalued the property over the limit and all payments had to be repaid. That was asked to be done within 14 days. The Commonwealth valuation was 22 per cent higher than the State Valuer General's one, and the value of the house was deemed to be 50 per cent less than its insurance value. In 1991, the family will have three children wanting to go to tertiary studies and, despite selling 600 acres, will still not have access to borrowings and will not be able to afford to send them to study. </PARA>
<PARA> Case I comes from Port Lincoln in South Australia. Two sons qualified for Austudy. The family was also reassessed retrospectively by AVO and has to pay back all 1989 and 1990 payments for both sons; a total of $10,512.10. I will go quickly through these last few cases. Case J is from near Kimba in South Australia. The land was valued by Elders at $68 per acre, but it was revalued upwards by AVO to $120 per acre. The children have to go away as the local school only goes to year 10. Forced sales in the area are now getting no bid, no offer. The latest sale that was made realised $25 per acre, although there was one $40 per acre sale very close to the town on excellent land when a neighbour particularly wanted a block of land. For the valuation, wool on the sheep's back was also valued, although the family argued that it should have been only the carcass valuation because effectively 18 months of wool was included. A very small value was put on the family home. The family also notes that Austudy should be available in year 11 because major problems in South Australia are caused as many 15-year-olds go into year 11 there and also that five-year averaging should be available on income. </PARA>
<PARA> Case K is from Cockaleechie in South Australia. The family assets were valued, less the mortgage, already over the limit, and therefore it was not even able to apply for Austudy. However, the gross income last year was $127,800, but their operating costs were $184,204; in other words, the family made a loss. It is still ineligible. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>I hope and pray that the Government would move to have the assets tests removed for Austudy as this is the only hope for country children to have an equal chance with city children.</PARA>
<PARA> Case L is from the mid-north in South Australia where the family has two children in Adelaide at tertiary studies. The family applied for Austudy on 30 June 1989 based on that year's income and the Valuer General's valuation. The property was revalued-depending on which section one looks at and I have all the details here for anyone who wants to spend some time going through them-between 31 per cent and 79 per cent upwards section by section. The family appealed but is still ineligible for Austudy. It had the Valuer General come out and do another set of valuations which put it still within the limit, but the AVO would not accept those figures. The family now has to pay back $3,202. They say:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the valuer sent here by Austudy had a figure of $322,751-</PARA>
<PARA>which is the limit-</PARA>
<PARA>in front of him and was easily able to exceed this value by either valuing our land upwards or our home downwards or a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA>Case M is from Mallala in South Australia. The family has two sons. It believes that the council rate valuation is totally unrealistic even for good times. The neighbouring farm has been on the market for over 12 months with absolutely no interest. Land was sold 15 miles away for two-thirds of the asking price. The family was getting only $1.70 at the end of last year for sheep sold in Adelaide. It states that it is imperative that it retain eligibility for family allowance. This letter was written at a time when there was possibly going to be an assets test put on that as well. The family goes on to say at the end of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm hoping Canberra will listen to the hurting farm families and do something to help. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators note, most of these cases have come from the mid-north in South Australia. Recently foreclosures have begun in this area and I have seen one of those notices. I visited Jamestown on the seventh of this month and attended a meeting there, at which it was explained that some 66 bank branches in the upper north, mid-north and Yorke Peninsula had been surveyed as to the viability of farmers in their areas and 51 branches replied. In the upper north, it was disclosed that 31 farmers are now declared by their bank to be unviable; in the mid-north, 94; and in the Yorke Peninsula, 38. That is about 5 per cent of the farmers in that region of South Australia. If the valuations were genuinely on market value, all farmers would immediately be able to access Austudy as their properties are not saleable. As I mentioned previously, they are already coming under the hammer and there is no bid, no offer. They are effectively worth nothing if the Commonwealth's valuer is to follow the instructions given to him and value them at market value. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should the family farm, a tool of trade, be valued at all for the purpose of assessing a family's ability to access education services or basic family support services? It should not be included in the assets test. The family farm and small business are not a luxury or liquid asset that can readily be swapped for cash to meet living and education expenses. The Democrats call for urgent action. We must move immediately to exempt the family farm and small business from the assets test for Austudy, isolated children's assistance payments and family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to close with a quote from an article by Geoff Kitney in the Australian Financial Review late last year. It highlights the difference in attitude to farmers between people in Europe-in this case specifically the French-and we Australians. In fact, there is a very stark difference between this view and the way our farming community is perceived and, indeed, treated. Writing from Paris, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Farming in Europe, they say, is not just an economic activity-it has cultural, environmental and strategic values on which it is impossible to put an economic price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is to make additional appropriations of $234m to give effect to the Government's commitment both to the defence efforts in the Gulf conflict and the trade consequences of that commitment. To that end, the Bill provides $181m for payment by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board, which were insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act. Iraq, as we all know, stopped payments on its wheat debt after the imposition of the United Nations trade sanctions and it is now considered unlikely that any payments will be made in the foreseeable future. I understand that there will be more funds payable in June this year of $29.7m, and further claims, totalling $247m in 1991-92 and $34m in 1992-93, are expected. There is more aid, but that is the extent to which the Government will reimburse the wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I venture further into this debate, and in the event that anyone might regard these expenditures as some sort of handout from the Australian taxpayers to the wheat farmers, let me indicate that these payments are an insurance payment. That is exactly what they are, just as any insurance company has claims on it or submitted to it from people who have problems with a house or anything else. For years the Government has collected premiums to insure against such an event as this and now it is having to pay out. I repeat: it is no handout. It is no gift; it is merely a business transaction for an insurance that was held by the wheat industry. Certainly, for the wheat industry and for the Australian Wheat Board, the collapse and possible disappearance of this market through Iraq could not have come at a worse time.</PARA>
<PARA> The condition of the Australian domestic wheat market is, to quote the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, `extremely depressed'. I say that it is very depressed. This is largely because of a record world wheat crop. Of the world's seven largest wheat producers, six have had record or near record production and for the first time in four years production has exceeded consumption. This condition has basically prevailed through most of the 1980s. To put the Australian wheat industry into perspective, Australia produces around 16 million tonnes of wheat a year and our anticipated wheat crop for 1991 is 15.7 million tonnes. By comparison, world wheat production this year is anticipated to be somewhere in the order of 600 million tonnes. Australia's production actually just about equals the annual variation in the United States (US) wheat crop, so we are very small fry in a very large market. That must make us price takers and not price makers. That is one of the problems we have in Australia, isolated as we are. </PARA>
<PARA> Our wheat industry is an export industry. We grow wheat to sell overseas and last year we exported 10 million tonnes of the 14 million tonnes we produced, of which Iraq took 1.37 million tonnes, Iran took 1.68 million tonnes and Egypt took 1.83 million tonnes. To lose these markets leaves a sizeable hole in our marketing strategies. I believe the Iraq market represented 10 per cent of our total export sales. For the year 1990-91 we had already sold $600m worth of wheat on credit to that nation. To lose these markets, as I said, at a time when the world has record wheat tonnages to dispose of, increases the depressing situation for our domestic situation in Australia. Of course, the situation for wheat sales has become increasingly more difficult over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the escalation in the subsidy war between the US and the European Community. The United States has made sales of subsidised wheat into many markets with export bonuses as high as $55 a tonne. Similarly, the European Community has continued its restrictive import levies and offered export refunds on sales in some markets of between $100 a tonne and $150 a tonne. These actions have forced the world market price down to levels which, in real terms, have been unprecedented, with subsidised sales as low as $US75 a tonne. There has also been an increase in such activities as credit sales. In the Middle East, for example, Australia was, until 1987-88, the sole exporter of wheat to Kuwait. The US entered the market taking sales from us by offering wheat to Kuwait at heavily discounted and subsidised prices. As recently as January this year, America sold 400,000 tonnes of wheat to Egypt at a subsidised price of $64 a tonne. Compare that to the Australian price of $120 a tonne or down as low as $60 a tonne on farm to the Australian wheat grower and we begin to understand the desperate situation that that puts Australian wheat farmers into. </PARA>
<PARA> For Australian wheat growers, the news in the last little while has been more and more depressing. The Wheat Board announced some while ago an anticipated return to growers of $135 per tonne. This was down from $180 per tonne in 1989. That figure has since been revised, again downwards, to $115 a tonne, which will be the lowest price for 60 years. Remember that the Australian farmers are receiving this at a time when US and European farmers are offering wheat on export markets at $US64 a tonne. What can the Australian wheat grower do about it? It is not a case of Australian farmers becoming more cost efficient or more productive. We are already at the forefront of technology and efficiency. We simply cannot grow wheat any cheaper than we do. Most wheat farmers are using old tractors that they may have had for 10 years as they cannot afford to buy new tractors. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we have the frightening prospect of 75 per cent of Australia's 45,000 wheat growers receiving a negative income-in other words, getting less for their crop than it cost them to produce it as a result of subsidies on export markets around the world. As much as half of those 45,000 farmers are thinking seriously of not planting any wheat at all. They cannot turn to wool because of the problems in the wool industry. That market is having great problems. So what do those 23,000 wheat farmers do? Of course, this has ramifications for Australia's future trade because, if we do not grow enough wheat this year to supply even our traditional markets, we are going to lose those traditional markets to the highly subsidised wheat industries of America and the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian wheat growers have tried to trade in this increasingly corrupt market and, basically, we are looking at real breakthroughs in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to do something about it. We have got to get the government of the day to remove the imposts of high interest rates and all the other problems. We have to have a decent taxation reform, so that when we produce a profit we do not to have pay it all away in tax. We have to have, as the Opposition suggests, something like a goods and services tax. We have to have a decent labour market reform. We have to have an abandonment of the accord, in my belief, to get back to a fair day's work for a fair day's pay so that we do not prop up inflation by giving wage rises just because of indexed consumer price increases. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to get rid of inefficiencies in telecommunications, transport, shipping and the waterfront and in power generation. We have to get disadvantages to Australian industry taken off the back of Australia. We have to have reform of government operations by contracting out of government services to the private sector, which could save in the order of 20 per cent. We have to have privatisation of some of the sleepy, inefficient government owned monopolies. They have to be shaken up and exposed to the competition of privatisation. We have got to have industry reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also got to have a decent environmental and development program, setting out clear and consistent guidelines to achieve an appropriate balance between development and conservation of the environment. That has to be done. It cannot just be talked about. We have to have an effective policy on resource security. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to trade reform, it was interesting recently, while I was at the United Nations with Senator Jones representing this Parliament, to speak with people from the European Community. We were told-and this is what concerns me about big breakthroughs in trade reform around the world-by European parliamentarians that in no way could they see their farmers having to battle with elements, currency exchange fluctuations, high interest rates or corrupt world markets. The latter statement, coming from people in the European Community, makes one laugh a little, but they intend to look after their farmers. The Americans are looking, as is the Cairns Group, for big breakthroughs in the Uruguay Round. We are looking for a substantial drop in protection in other countries and getting to a fair free trade situation around the world. Basically the United States of America supports that view, but it is a bit of a catch-as-catch-can because the Americans will not be fair dinkum about this until the Europeans are. That scares the hell out of me as an Australian farmer and as a person representing Australian farmers in this Parliament. Where will Australia sit in the next few years when we may move towards fairer trade, and when we may get the Americans and Europeans to come to some realisation that they cannot keep on propping up their industries?</PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that we in Australia must do in the meantime is to make sure that we get the imposts off the backs of Australian farmers-many of which have been imposed upon us by the Hawke-Keating Labor Government. Mr Acting Deputy President, we have all decided to speak for 10 minutes and I notice that my 10 minutes is up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are today debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91, which covers the costs incurred by Australia's participation in both international sanctions and military operations against Iraq in the Middle East. I open my contribution in this debate by noting with deep regret that war is popular. Maggie Thatcher, after all, going back a little, won an unwinnable election because she led the United Kingdom into the Falklands war. We have noted how Prime Minister Hawke's popularity rating has shot up since he led Australia into the Gulf war. John Major is now the most popular British Prime Minister for 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who protest that sanctions applied swiftly, strongly and unanimously by the United Nations immediately after the brutal invasion of Kuwait by Iraq-which in its turn had been earlier condemned by the UN and with which condemnation I agree-would not have worked and would have taken too long have never been backed, and are not now backed, by any reputable expert opinion. The view is expressed that the virtual unanimity of support for sanctions would not have been able to be sustained for much longer than the five months that was given before the outbreak of war. After thinking and reading about this matter all this time, I have concluded that that opinion must be based on the view that the individual nations involved in the sanctions regime-nations such as Australia, which is losing a great deal of export income as a result of the sanctions; and this Bill is designed to make up that loss-with their individual self-interest at stake, would quickly have overcome their sense of international responsibility, and hence the war option was necessary so that trade could be resumed as soon as possible. I refer to trade both ways because many other nations are more interested in imports of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what this says about the so-called moral basis put in this chamber on Monday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in answer to a question that I put to him. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we do not make decisions about war and peace, with all that that implies, on the basis of dollar and cents considerations; we make it on the basis of considerations of morality, considerations of justice and considerations of an intelligent appreciation of the consequences of not acting. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder about that basis for decision making in the light of the lack of alternative opinion about why sanctions were considered not to be able to work or why further time could not be given, and that death and destruction should be seen as a more desirable option simply because the participating nations all have internal budgetary pressures, as we do in this country as a result of our support for sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> What, I wonder, of the Third World nations, the children dying in poverty and starvation, those poorest and most disadvantaged people in the world who will now never see the billions of dollars which are being expended this very day on the conduct of the war and which will have to be spent in time to come as a result of the aftermath of that war. What of the casualties in the conflict-military personnel, young conscripts largely, in the case of the Iraqis, with no choice in the matter; and, in the case of the United States of America (USA), with a disproportionate representation among them of the poor, blacks, hispanics and other minorities from that nation? What also of the innocent civilians in Iraq, Kuwait and Israel, sufferers of so-called collateral damage and potential victims of the now highly likely outbreak of dreadful epidemics of cholera, typhoid and other diseases in the wake of the destruction wreaked by the massive air attacks thus far, which are continuing?</PARA>
<PARA> So far war appears to be popular, a fact that seems to have excited Senator Kemp so much that he has come into the chamber. I remind the Senate that Senator Kemp has pointed out how many people seem to be indicating their support for this war through public opinion polls. I am certain that, once the real story becomes clear-and if there is one thing that is clear at the moment it is that the real story is not clear-once the reality of the casualty figures, which is starting to come to the fore now, is known; and once the evidence, which again is coming to the fore increasingly this very day, that the United States is determined to wipe Iraq off the map, contrary to the United Nations position, is clearer, especially if the ground war begins; the popularity will not last. </PARA>
<PARA> But, given the present figures and the continual bleating by Senator Kemp and the figures so beloved of Senator Kemp, one thing that should be said at this point is that I am also confident that I shall never again hear from the Opposition benches or from anywhere else in criticism of the Australian Democrats that we are a populist political party. I have challenged the moral basis for the decision to go to war, put here in this chamber on Monday by Senator Evans on behalf of the Government, and I stand here to counter any claims of populism ever portrayed against the Party which I lead. </PARA>
<PARA> In my contribution to this debate, I want to focus largely on the United Nations and its role in this issue in the past and into the future. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has portrayed the war against Iraq as a demonstration of the fact that the United Nations is finally acting with the unity expected of it when it was first established. If we are to make a realistic assessment of the UN's potential to realise Mr Hawke's vision of a new world order of peace, security and freedom, it is important to examine the role of the United Nations in the crisis which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality of the UN's action is actually very different to that claimed by Mr Hawke and obviously believed by Senator Kemp at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After a very sound start, with the Security Council demanding that the invasion be reversed in resolution 660 and applying mandatory and comprehensive trade sanctions in resolution 661, the UN's role has steadily regressed. It has become seriously compromised and marginalised and the Secretary-General, Perez de Cuellar, has been left on the sidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The decline was triggered by the United States decision, in response to Iraq's aggression, to launch a huge build-up of naval forces in the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea and land and air forces in Saudi Arabia, and then to persuade Western allies and Iraq's regional adversaries to lend support. It appeared increasingly that the US was trying to wrest the initiative from the United Nations which did put up some resistance, particularly by challenging the moves of the United States to unilaterally blockade Iraq and Kuwait to enforce the sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> Perez de Cuellar declared that only the United Nations, under article 42 of its Charter, could impose a blockade. The United States initially responded to Perez de Cuellar's declaration by claiming that the blockade was legitimised by Kuwait's right to self-defence under article 51 of the Charter. The Prime Minister parroted this view and was subsequently caught out by the revelation that he had committed our warships several days before receiving a request from Kuwait to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community was not convinced by the US argument using article 51, so we saw a diplomatic campaign waged to secure UN endorsement of the blockade. After two weeks of that campaign and wrangling, resolution 665 was passed. It authorised countries deploying naval forces in the Gulf to board ships suspected of violating sanctions. The Security Council had been reduced to endorsing a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the United Nations been in charge, the blockade would have come under the command of its military staff committee, which comprises the military heads of the Security Council's five permanent members. Instead, the naval force remained essentially under United States control because international support for the blockade was ambiguous and also because the Bush Administration did not want any future offensive military action to be constrained in any way by United Nations control. Indeed, the official reasons given for the allied naval deployment to enforce the sanctions and the ground and air deployments which were to deter, we were told, a further Iraqi advance, were quickly revealed as smokescreens by the offensive size of a virtual invasion force and the structure of that force as it was deployed in the region and in Saudi Arabia in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Resolution 665 left the UN being dragged along in the wake of the United States. The prospect of war began to be talked up. Here in Australia we had pages of war every day in our newspapers and items on the Cable News Network to see us through the night. The prospects for a resolution based on diplomacy and the most effective sanctions in world history were steadily played down, and those who advocated the sanctions strategy were branded appeasers. Inflammatory statements by Saddam Hussein and George Bush turned the conflict into a personalised macho stand-off. Iraq responded to the US-led build-up by boosting its force in Kuwait to defend the territory that it had wrongly seized, and the march to war gathered momentum. </PARA>
<PARA> United States dominance was firmly established by resolution 678 of 29 November last year which authorised nations to use `all necessary means' to drive Iraq from Kuwait after 15 January this year. Resolution 678 clearly demonstrated the UN's impotence. It left decisions on the timing of the war, its objectives and its strategies to the US and its allies. Its wording was ambiguous. There is no reference to the use of force and the term `all necessary means' allowed each UN member country to choose its own interpretation from continued reliance on sanctions, which is the interpretation that the Australian Democrats have called for all along the way, to an all-out military assault, which is the interpretation chosen by the United States and followed by our Government and others. But it is only an interpretation. Resolution 678 is not an exhortation to the use of military force and never has been. </PARA>
<PARA> The marginalisation of the Secretary-General's role is evident from leaked UN reports of his meeting with Saddam Hussein just before the war broke out. At that meeting Hussein stated his willingness to withdraw from Kuwait, but to do so in the face of the Bush Administration's war threat would involve a loss of face for him. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that the Security Council has not been hijacked because it freely endorsed the United States moves against Iraq on the grounds that they were principled and necessary. While it is true that world opinion was freely expressed against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and in favour of sanctions, support for war rests on much more shaky foundations. </PARA>
<PARA> To begin with, China and the Soviet Union-two members of the Security Council which were under some pressure to veto the war push-had compelling self-interested reasons for not doing so. The Soviet Union's economic and political crisis has left it in dire need of Western aid. China is trying hard to restore its credentials with the West following the Tiananmen Square massacre. </PARA>
<PARA> Pressure was also applied to bring other nations into line. Yemen, a Security Council member and a critic of the Western military role, had its aid budget slashed by the United States. Jordan's aid allocation is, even now, under review following statements by its king sympathetic to Iraq. The Palestine Liberation Organisation has been excommunicated by Western nations for similar reasons. Egypt and Syria have received substantial political and economic favours for committing troops to the allied force. </PARA>
<PARA> The fragility of the UN `consensus' is evident from the divisions which are opening up now as the carnage and destruction mount. Some countries are now under serious domestic pressure to reverse their stance and oppose the war-the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Pakistan and Egypt being the obvious examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bush Administration also attempted to stifle opposition by a strategy of pre-emption. United Nations support for the naval blockade and the war was sought only after-not before-the necessary military forces were in place. This ensured that the rejection of any proposals in the UN would have handed a major psychological victory to Iraq. The Secretary-General, Perez de Cuellar, according to those leaked reports of his meeting with Saddam Hussein, agreed with Hussein's opinion that the UN resolutions leading to war were virtually US resolutions. The evidence supports that view. </PARA>
<PARA> The credibility of the United Nations in this crisis has been further undermined by the yawning gulf between the massive international response to the invasion of Kuwait and the continuing inaction against acts of aggression and repression elsewhere. The Senate will recall a range of resolutions recently moved by me and my colleagues seeking concerted action supporting the UN in Tibet, East Timor, Eritrea, Cyprus, the Kurdish homeland, the Occupied Territories and on China's support for the Khmer Rouge. Each of these is as equally deserving of the UN's urgent attention as is Kuwait, yet there are few signs that the rhetoric of a new world order of peace, security and freedom will be applied in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with colleagues in the Rainbow Alliance I have put forward a proposed peace plan in order to look beyond the war and into the future. The proposal assumes a central role for the United Nations. As well as an immediate cease-fire, it calls for humanitarian aid to restore basic services in Iraq and Kuwait; the maintenance of sanctions on non-humanitarian trade; the negotiation of essential trust-building measures to prevent further accidental break-out; a UN peacekeeping force, which is obviously necessary, between the two sides; a phased withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and allied forces from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East waters; and an ongoing UN task force which would be required to establish an embargo on arms transfers throughout the Middle East, initiate a Middle East peace conference to deal with all the outstanding regional security questions, supervise a referendum in Kuwait on its political future and status, and set up what would need to be a large UN fund for post-war reconstruction and environmental rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a peace plan is on the international agenda right now-the so-called Soviet peace plan. I believe that peace plan has been too readily dismissed by President Bush and I call on Prime Minister Hawke to urge the United States to reconsider its position and, along with that, to respect the United Nations will and authority. As yet the United Nations has not spoken on the Soviet peace plan. I suggest that the Bush Administration's approach to the rejection of the peace plan at this point is further evidence of its aim to cripple Iraq economically, by destroying its industrial base, to wipe out its armed forces and to remove President Saddam Hussein from power. </PARA>
<PARA> This goes well beyond the United Nations' authorisation for the war which, even if we interpret that resolution as permitting war, has been complied with. The authorisation is merely to remove Iraq from Kuwait. Perez de Cuellar has previously said that the removal of Hussein is `not justified from the United Nations philosophical point of view'. To go beyond the UN objective is a disproportionate response to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, particularly when there is clear evidence that a negotiated outcome could be achieved. It is also in violation of humanitarian norms, compounding the suffering already caused by Iraq's brutal occupation of Kuwait. It is isolating the United States internationally, and this in time will rebound on Australia unless we take action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union has now parted company with the United States on this question. China, which abstained on Security Council resolution 678 authorising war, is likely to be considering to do so now. India has just ended its token support for the US war operations after a political row which threatened to unseat its government. The UN Secretary-General and several European nations have expressed the hope that the Soviet plan will help resolve the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community, including the Australian Government, must prevail upon the United States to show respect for the will and authority of the United Nations, rather than using it selectively in the pursuit of purely national objectives. All of this is not to ignore the fact that there is an urgent need for the debate about the future operations of the United Nations to be under way. Reforming that body, democratising the Security Council and the General Assembly, are issues which should be on the table. Perhaps, without such changes, we are bound to repeat the tragedy which continues to deepen in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Bourne has already said in this debate, the Democrats will not oppose the Appropriation Bill, or even those parts of it related to the military aspects of the conflict in the Middle East, on the basis that throughout the debate we have always sought to separate our opposition to the political decision that has been made by this Government to take the war option in the Middle East, a decision with which we disagree on the basis of a different interpretation of the Security Council resolution 678. We have distinguished that political decision from the consequent military decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have never moved away from understanding that those people, who are sent to the Gulf in the course of their duty, must never be saddled with the responsibility of their political masters. Therefore, we understand the need for these appropriations in the interests of those people and, of course, we strongly support that aspect of these appropriations which support the sanctions. Hence, we will not be opposing this legislation while at the same time we continue to oppose strongly the political decision that has made necessary that part of it relating to the military. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I never cease to be amazed by the convoluted thinking of the Australian Democrats when it comes to this particular issue. Not only am I amazed, but I might say that two-thirds of the Democrats own supporters are amazed by their thinking on this matter. I had quite a number of things to say on this particular matter but, as has been mentioned, we are restricting our speaking time to 10 minutes, so my speech will be very much curtailed as to the things that I wanted to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, I want to highlight some of the inconsistencies and absolute hypocrisy of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and its mates in the Australian Democrats on this particular issue. I listened with some amazement to Senator Powell talking about the United Nations (UN) and how it has been hijacked by the United States. From what I have heard about the present Democrats and the previous Democrats under Senator Chipp, who were quite different from this lot, I understood that they supported the UN organisation and they were very concerned to make sure that the United Nations' business and resolutions were supported. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the support for the United Nations is very selective. It is okay when the United Nations has issues on other matters but when those issues have an American influence, the Democrats become totally opposed to them. I simply cannot understand that. It seems that the Democrats say, `It is okay to support the United Nations resolutions on other things but when it comes to Kuwait, that is an entirely different thing. We no longer support the UN; we no longer support the UN's resolutions on Kuwait, but we want to support it on everything else'. What absolute hypocrisy. It is that type of convoluted jumping around on the issues that leads the Democrats further down from the days when they were a respectable Party under Senator Chipp. </PARA>
<PARA> When their leader, Senator Powell, makes a major speech on the Gulf war, it is interesting to see the number of Democrats' supporters in the gallery. This is where all of the Democrats supporters are; in this gallery. Not one bothers to come to hear the revered leader pontificate on the Gulf war. That is to be understood because two-thirds of the Democrats' supporters agree with the United Nations' action. The number of Democrats' supporters is falling every day-it is down to about 9 per cent-and will continue to decline while they follow the convoluted issues of the Democrats' regime. This used to be a respectable party under Senator Chipp. </PARA>
<PARA> From what Senator Powell said it seems to me that she is arguing that Hussein should be kept there after the war finishes. As I understood Senator Powell, she was saying that the United States should keep out of it. It is doing the wrong thing in trying to destroy Hussein and, after the war, he should be kept there to continue the genocide, to continue the absolute havoc that he has wreaked not only on his own country but on the Middle East generally. That is the type of proposition being put to us by the leader of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also surprised to listen to Senator Coulter giving a list of problems in various countries throughout the world which he said had resulted from the Gulf war. I agree with him. It is very saddening. It is something that the world will seriously have to look at later. I ask Senator Coulter and his colleagues: can they not realise that their support for Hussein is the only thing that makes him continue? He cannot win this war. He knows that; everybody knows that. It is the peace groups around the world, the loony Left of the ALP, the fourth wing of the ALP and the Democrats, who are even loonier in their left wing stance, who are encouraging him to keep going. If the Democrats only had a solidified approach with the rest of the world, Hussein would realise that there is nothing to be gained by continuing the war. If the world took the unified approach, Hussein would realise that he cannot grandstand, that his grandstanding will count for nought and that he should end the war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only people such as the Democrats who continue this war and they should be ashamed of that. I ask Senator Coulter, when he thinks about all the problems in the rest of the world, in the Third World countries, to consider that if there were a unified approach this war may well have been finished many weeks ago. Senator Coulter says that the reason for the war is oil. He says that it is not about freedom, invasion, democracy or human rights; it is about oil. I do not agree with him. Let us see the absolute hypocrisy of Senator Coulter and his mate. If we say: `Okay, let's forget about oil; in Australia we have many other forms of energy available, such as uranium and electricity, say from the Tully-Millstream dam', the Democrats will say, `You can't have that. It's clean, cheap energy, but you can't have electricity out of the Tully-Millstream dam'. Are you going to support that? I challenge you to support cheap hydroelectricity from the Tully-Millstream dam. Are you going to support this cheap, clean energy?</PARA>

They keep on about the oil, yet when we ask about uranium, which is a clean, efficient fuel, where do they go?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bourne gave us a very interesting exposition on the Cypriot problem and the Turks. I ask Senator Bourne whether she is saying that we should get the United Nations to get a force led by the United States and invade Turkey. Is that what she is calling upon us to do? She was making these comparisons with Kuwait, asking why it did not happen in Turkey and Cyprus when it happened in Kuwait. Do I understand her to want us to get a US-led force to invade Cyprus? The sheer hypocrisy and convoluted thinking of the Democrats' proposals are absolutely amazing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bell gave us a lecture on the Democrats' perverse view on the environment. He wanted to tell everybody of the scientific matters and kept using what must be the new Democrats' buzz words for this month-`pedestrian thinking'. Those seem to be the new buzz words: we are all pedestrian thinkers. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Lees also said that the war was all about protecting oil and it was critical. She went on to give us a lecture about the rural crisis, which is very important. I agree with many of the things she said, but the hypocrisy of this, again, is just too much to be contemplated. Senator Lees criticised this as being a war over oil. I do not agree with her. But, if she is right, she goes on to say that the Democrats are the farmers' friends. I ask Senator Lees to tell me who is hurting most from the price of oil when it goes up. It is the farmers that these people are supposed to be befriending. The Democrats criticise this war because they say it is about oil-I repeat that I do not agree with that-but then they try to protect the very people that increases in oil prices would hurt. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees went on to criticise all and sundry about deregulation, how the rural industry was suffering because of free markets. But any time we want to deregulate the labour market and reform the waterfront industries, what do the Democrats do? They run over and support the left wing of the Labor Party and stop the real things that will help farmers. </PARA>

<PARA> Recently, I was privileged to be able to travel to South East Asia on a parliamentary delegation and, by coincidence, we were in Singapore when HMAS Success was there on its return from the Gulf. Captain Graham Sloper and his crew were very gratified by the support that this Parliament, with the exception of the Democrats, had given to him and his crew overseas. They did note this and it gave an enormous boost to their morale to know that the people of Australia generally were behind them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was terribly impressed with Captain Sloper and his crew and the efficiency on their ship and the attitude that they had to the duties they were called upon to perform. I might say in passing-this has not come to me from people from the Success-that I have heard that the ship that replaced the Success may not be as suitable for the role that it is being asked to perform as it could be. That disturbs me somewhat. I ask the Government to very seriously consider sending any ships, troops or military units into a war zone when they are not properly equipped to deal with it. Morale on the Success was excellent. I was told that the morale of the crew's colleagues on the other ships was very good and that they are grateful for the support given to them by the Australian people. I was very pleased to have had the opportunity of meeting that very professional group. </PARA>
<PARA> My time has almost run out and I can see the ire of our Whip. But I wish to add, briefly, a lighter note to the debate. When I visited the Success I was able to meet many of the lower deck crew as well. I had the opportunity of meeting a very special member of the crew by the name of Oscar. I had been corresponding with Oscar because, as many honourable senators will remember, before Christmas a note was pushed through our door asking us to write to sailors on the various ships and send them Christmas greetings. I wrote to two people and got replies from them. One was from Oscar. Oscar is a dummy. I suppose many of my colleagues would say that at last I have found my level in terms of parliamentary representation. I might say that Oscar had far more sensibility and seriousness about things than many Democrats do, even though he is a dummy. </PARA>
<PARA> Oscar leads a very exciting and very full life. Oscar is a sort of ship mascot. He is the dummy who is thrown overboard in rescue exercises. Indeed, Oscar is very well regarded because if he was not thrown overboard to be rescued, one of the sailors would have to perform that role. As a result, all of the sailors like Oscar a lot and they certainly support him. </PARA>
<PARA> Oscar often corresponds with the Captain on the ship. He writes the Captain lots of letters and he has become a sort of a folk hero on the boat. He is the sort of person whom I will enjoy continuing to correspond with in the years ahead. It certainly will be a relief to be able to write to a dummy rather than having to listen to the dummies on my left as they pontificate so hypocritically about the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate those in the Navy who initiated the program of asking parliamentarians and other people around Australia to write to the sailors in the Gulf fleet. It certainly is good for morale. It is the sort of thing that does help and which makes the Australian Navy the professional force that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by indicating my support for the Bill, regrettable though the legislation is. I understand that the Bill will receive unanimous support. I congratulate all of the military people from Australia who are participating so well in Australia's efforts to get this madman Hussein back to reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I used the expression `parties'. In turning to some of the issues of substance which are raised in this Bill, I wish to address basically three topics-sanctions, casualties and, specifically, the recent bunker bombing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the dismissal of the sanctions strategy was an essential part of the justification for going to war against Iraq. However, the world's premier authorities on sanctions-three analysts from Georgetown University and the Institute for International Economics in the United States, namely Mr Kimberly Elliott, Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott- have made a convincing case that sanctions had a high probability of forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Their analysis was published first in the Washington Post and then in the International Herald Tribune of 11 December. I propose to quote extensively from their assessment. They say:</PARA>
<PARA> But sanctions can work, and in circumstances far less favourable than those present in the confrontation with Iraq. A review of 115 cases since 1914 shows that success was achieved 40 times when economic sanctions were threatened or imposed against individual countries. The current United Nations sanctions are among the strongest and most complete ever imposed against any country. </PARA>
<PARA> These comparisons strongly suggest that, given time, the UN economic boycott can achieve by peaceful means what President Bush and his advisers say can only be won by force. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . The current boycott covers virtually all of Iraq's trade; this is three to four times greater coverage than the average in all previous successful sanctions cases. Beyond that, Iraq, geographically isolated and dependent on oil for 90 per cent of its export revenue, is far more vulnerable to economic coercion than target states in other sanctions actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of all these factors, it is likely that if the embargo persists, Iraqi output will shrink by about half from its 1988 total of $45 billion. This is a decline of GNP 20 times greater than the average impact in other successful sanction episodes. Meanwhile, the economic costs to the sanctioning countries of suspended trade with Iraq are being addressed in unusual ways and substantially mitigated. These efforts give the current sanctions a cohesion and possible longevity never seen outside the setting of global conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Economic sanctions have been used in this century in pursuit of a wide variety of goals. They range from the relatively modest, such as Britain's 1933 sanctions against the Soviet Union to gain the release of British citizens accused of spying, to the difficult, such as the US sanctions against Poland from 1981 to 1987 to force the Communist regime to lift martial law and loosen political restraints. </PARA>
<PARA> In judging whether the imposition of sanctions was a `success' we looked for evidence of two things: that the boycotters substantially met their goals, and that sanctions contributed at least modestly to the outcome. Successful actions include, for example, the trade embargoes and financial sanctions to weaken the enemy's fighting capability used by the allies in World Wars I and II and by Britain and its allies during the Falklands conflict in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> On two occasions in the 1920s, the mere threat of sanctions by the League of Nations was sufficient to settle border conflicts: Yugoslavia withdrew troops from disputed territory in Albania; Greece renounced territorial claims in Bulgaria. In the postwar era, the UN embargo of Rhodesia, much less stringently enforced than the present sanctions against Iraq, helped bring about the demise of the breakaway regime of Ian Smith. </PARA>
<PARA> Such examples argue strongly for the likely success of the sanctions against Iraq. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has said that the embargo `clearly' has been effective `in closing off the flow of spare parts and military supplies.' And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, conceded that sanctions would have `a debilitating effect' on Iraq's military capability. Last Thursday, the CIA director, William Webster, told the House Armed Services Committee that by next spring `Probably only energy-related and some military industries will be fully functioning.'</PARA>
<PARA> The sanctions against Iraq are unique in the history of such economic weapons in the 20th century. There is inevitably some leakage, but the embargo affects virtually all of Iraq's trade and financial relations. Historically, when the sanctioning country or group accounted for half or more of the targets trade, the sanctioners had a 50 percent chance of achieving their goals. In the average successful sanctions case, the boycotters accounted for 28 percent of the targets trade, far below the Iraqi situation. </PARA>
<PARA>This quotation clearly shows that the United States, and by implication our own government, should have considered much more carefully than they did the effectiveness of sanctions in this particular case rather than proceed to violent conflict, in which we are involved now, and which is showing casualties much higher than apparently expected by those who favoured the war-although why they thought that casualties of this magnitude would not happen is beyond me, bearing in mind the extensive ambit of the actions contemplated and the intensity of the attack mounted. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard extensive reports of the level of Kuwaiti casualties resulting from Iraq's brutal occupation of Kuwait, and that must be on the table. Just recently, there have been more horrific descriptions given in testimony to a British parliamentary committee. These acts of torture and violence by Iraq in Kuwait have been taken as one of the major reasons for our sanctioning the military action taken by the United States and its allies. The level of casualties resulting from Iraq's occupation is difficult to estimate. Amnesty claims that hundreds of civilians were killed between 2 August 1990 and the end of the year. The Association for Free Kuwait estimates 7,000 dead and 17,000 missing or in detention. The Association has an obvious incentive to overstate its case, but there is no doubt that, whatever the number, unacceptable atrocities have occurred and are occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other side. According to an Iranian report, Iraq now claims that 20,000 Iraqis have been killed, with up to 7,000 of these being civilians, and a further 60,000 have been injured. This seems a credible estimate, given today's allied claims to have destroyed 1,800 tanks, each with two or three personnel inside. Whatever the figure, it must be pointed out that civilians and young conscripts are by any definition innocent victims, and they comprise the bulk of the dead and injured. It seems reasonable to conclude that many more innocent Iraqis have died than Kuwaitis. This raises the obvious question: is this war a proportionate response to Iraq's initial crime of invading and occupying Kuwait? Should we not now take every opportunity to assess whether it can be stopped on the basis of Iraq's statements that it is ready to leave Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to advert briefly to the bunker bombing. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has questioned the accuracy of Iraqi casualty figures and appears to base his opinion on the notion that allied bombing has been so accurate as to largely spare civilians. But we have this example of the quite horrific bombing of the Baghdad air raid shelter last week which casts serious doubts on the Prime Minister's position. It is becoming quite clear that the United States has made an appalling error. Having initially claimed that it was a fortified, camouflaged command and control bunker with military personnel coming and going, its claims have been thoroughly rebutted by journalists on the ground. I quote Jacques-Marie Bourget, a correspondent for the magazine Paris-Match, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>Of all the journalists here, many with war experience, I haven't found one who can cast doubt on the fact that it was a civilian shelter . . . and that this was a mistake, a big mistake. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Bourget said local people he had questioned never had seen the military around the shelter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Iraqi civil defence was in charge of the facility and, ``for quite a long time, there have been arrows in streets pointing to the shelter'' . .``They didn't drive people into it with truncheons at night,'' he said. ``They went because they felt safe. It had 1,400 places. There were videos, and they showed films. </PARA>
<PARA>It had a convivial atmosphere. So it was normal that locals, particularly women and children . . . should have gone there (during raids). </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not one of the bodies had a uniform. If there had been military people, I would think they'd have been killed like the rest. </PARA>
<PARA>These accounts cast serious doubts on the claims by the United States military that its activities have pinpoint accuracy and are directed at purely military targets. I am not suggesting it is intentionally putting civilian populations at risk. However, particularly now, this week, this House passed the Geneva Conventions legislation, drawing attention to the need to extend the protection to civilians. It was-to its shame-not supported by the Opposition, and I believe it behoves us to ask people with whom we are associated in this conflict what measures are being taken to protect the civilian population and reduce civilian casualties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I now go to the two main points I want to speak to on this portion of the Bill. First, there is the provision for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) insurance payments following the non-payment for wheat as a result of the sanctions applied and now because of the war with Iraq. I note in this Bill there is an amount of $181.4m for payment now and $29.7m for payment in June. There are further claims for $247m in 1991-92 and $34m in 1992-93. These are just and fair payments, but one must remember they are not a government handout; they are a legitimate insurance claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The grain industry has been paying insurance premiums for years and this is the first payment under this EFIC arrangement. I put to Senator Button that he should acknowledge this point both to his colleagues and the general public because there is a perception out there that this is a handout to the grain industry, which it is not. If we look at the figures, we see that the wheat industry since 1983-84 has paid some $94m in insurance premiums--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not arguing about that. I am making the point that it is not a handout. My next point is the $123m that is not insured, which leads to a number of questions: does the Government believe the cost of the Iraq problems are to be borne by all Australians or, in this case, by the wheat industry? I believe this question in terms of that $123m is about justice and fair play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will quote from a Grains Council of Australia press release that was put out at the time by its President, Mr Inglis. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> `Australia's wheat growers back the Government's decision to support the UN sanctions,' said Mr Inglis. </PARA>
<PARA> `However, this is a decision taken by the Government in the national interest as a responsible member of the international community. It is therefore incumbent upon the Government to ensure that the nation as a whole shares responsibility for any consequences of the decision for Australia,' Mr Inglis continued. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has identified the total outstanding wheat debt to Iraq at approximately $US485m ($A613m), comprising $US388m ($A490m) insured with the Government under export credit arrangements and $US97m ($A123m) uninsured, or in other words to the account of growers. </PARA>
<PARA>Wheat growers, as Australian taxpayers, are of course prepared to shoulder their fair share of the burden of any sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>But, our concern is threefold. Firstly, that if the debt if repudiated the Government will impose on wheat growers the full cost of the $123m uninsured loss. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the opportunity cost of re-selling the 350,000 tonnes remaining against this year's contract . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the potential for the Government to increase the premiums or reduce the level of cover on credit sales in response to its decision would amount to the industry's impeccable no-claim record being tarnished by a decision of the insurer. </PARA>
<PARA>We will not accept this approach. </PARA>
<PARA>I say: why should they? I have previously in this chamber asked questions of Senator Cook on this matter, and I have not received a satisfactory answer. I think it is incumbent upon the Government to give us an answer now. Is the Government going to pick this up or, because the decision was made in the national interest, will it be the taxpayers of this country? Alternatively, are the individual grain growers going to be left to carry the can? I think it is very important that that decision be made in terms of fair play in the sharing of costs. Of course, it does not end with the wheat industry; it goes into the chickpea and other industries. I particularly mention the chickpea industry here because it is a small and growing industry with a very bright future in the markets of the Middle East. But it would be unfortunate if it was inhibited in its development now because this cost was handed down to individual growers and they were forced into a situation where they could not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I raise coming out of this Appropriation Bill looks to the future. We have to look at the mechanisms by which Australia is going to rebuild its trade with the Middle East. It is worth noting that, prior to the Iraq crisis, Australia's trade with the Middle East was in excess of $1.5 billion in exports and $1.4 billion in imports. So the Middle East was a very important trading partner of Australia. Kuwait and Iraq have been important components of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall quote some figures to put a perspective on the importance of the Middle East to Australia. Ninety-three per cent of the total imports from the Middle East comes from the countries of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. On the exports side, 80 per cent of the total goes to those countries. In breaking these figures down a little, we find that 8 per cent of the total imports to Australia from the Middle East comes from Iraq and Kuwait and that 22 per cent of our exports to the region go to those two countries. If we add the figures for Saudi Arabia to those for Iraq and Kuwait we find that the import figure for those three countries jumps to 53 per cent of the total imports from the Middle East to Australia and 36 per cent of our total exports to the Middle East go to those three countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take these figures a little further to emphasise the importance of the region to Australia. In terms of the export of wheat, 54 per cent of Australia's total export trade goes to the Middle East. In live animals it is 99 per cent of Australia's total export trade. Thirty-seven per cent of the total of our exported unmilled barley goes there. Looking at the other side of the equation, the import figure for petroleum and crude oils amounts to $0.7 billion and the figure for refined petroleum products amounts to half a billion dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I make in addressing this matter is that the Middle East is a very important part of Australia's trading spectrum. I seek leave to have these figures incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I throw down to the Government a challenge in relation to these figures. I ask: what strategy or plan does the Government have in terms of rebuilding this trade when the conflict is over? Will the Government convene a senior strategy group or some mechanism to coordinate Australia's trade position in the Middle East after the Gulf war? I put this to Senator Button in all seriousness because I believe that it is absolutely imperative that we start planning now for the rebuilding of this trade. It is very important not only to the individuals involved in the industry but also in terms of addressing our current account problems. It is quite clear to me, following the McKinsey report, that Austrade does not have this capacity, certainly not unless changes are made in that particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, in the time remaining to me, I re-emphasise the two questions that I have asked. The first relates to the shortfall that is not covered by the insurance cover. I do not believe that it is the responsibility of those affected individuals to pick up that cost when the Government's position was supported by the grain industry and by the Opposition. Steps should be taken to overcome that particular injustice. The second point which I have just finished outlining is: do we have a strategy to rebuild our trade in the region when the Gulf conflict is finished?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks to appropriate $234.1m from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to meet costs arising from Australia's response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year. Of that amount, $52.7m is to be allocated to the Department of Defence to meet additional equipment and stores expenditure arising from the deployment of Australian warships and personnel to the Middle East. A further $29.7m will be appropriated in Additional Estimates, which will bring the total extra expenditure to $82.4m. As has already been stated by other speakers from the Australian Democrats, we will be supporting this expenditure to make it clear that we distinguish between our opposition to the political decision to deploy Australian military forces to the Gulf on one hand and the need to support our forces now in the war zone on the other. It should be restated that the only circumstances under which we would support a decision to send warships to the Middle East is to enforce trade sanctions as part of a naval force under United Nations (UN) command. Those conditions have yet to be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the real growth in the Defence budget from the last financial year to the present one was reduced from the one per cent allowed in the Forward Estimates to none in the actual Budget-a saving of $161m. The extra expenditure associated with the Gulf deployment will wipe out half of that saving. This Bill, once passed, will raise the total amount appropriated to Defence in 1990-91 to over $9 billion. That is about $530 for every woman, man and child in the country. It is the Democrats' contention that this Budget is both excessive and inadequate. It is excessive in that it throws huge quantities of money at weapons and operations which are of little relevance to the defence of Australia. It is inadequate in that our real defence needs are grossly underfunded. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Hawke Government came to power, and particularly after the previous Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, took over the Defence portfolio, it became fashionable to assume that Australia's defence policy was undergoing a profound change. Gone were the days of forward defence, we were told, under which Australian forces were structured for an expeditionary role in support of a great and powerful friend. The era of defence self-reliance had arrived, where Australia would provide first and foremost for its own defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The deployment of Australian forces in the Middle East makes it blindingly clear that nothing really has changed. Once again, our major ally has launched a massive military assault in response to a dispute best settled by non-military means. Once again Australia has leapt into the fray, with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) offering our warships to serve as an arm of the United States (US) Navy, before being asked. The analogy with Vietnam, the costs of which are still being counted here, in the United States and particularly in Vietnam itself, is clear. So, too, are the differences, as this Government has been an pains to point out, but these differences may not be cause for comfort. There is no doubt that from the allied viewpoint desert warfare makes a far more likely military victory than did jungle warfare in Indo China. However, on the other hand, the political quagmire into which we are now sinking is much deeper and more dangerous. Vietnam did not rebound against the West across the Arab and Muslim worlds, as this war is now doing, and from which the thin veneer of United Nations respectability will not protect us. </PARA>
<PARA> How is it that, when the day of reckoning arrived, the Hawke Government blindly repeated the patterns of the past? Why is it that, after the 1986 Dibb report advocating defence self-reliance, the 1987 Defence White Paper announcing the policy of defence self-reliance, several parliamentary statements by Mr Beazley reporting on the progress of defence self-reliance and the publicity blitz which accompanied the Kangaroo `89 exercise-supposedly the first major test of defence self-reliance-all the rhetoric and action appear to have been thrown out of the window in our haste to out-Menzies the conservative governments of yesteryear?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer is that in reality defence self-reliance has always run a poor second to the strengthening and deepening of integrated operations with United States forces. The decision to trumpet self-reliance while playing down allied operations was politically motivated. The Hawke Government in the early 1980s was under pressure from a huge anti-nuclear movement, which found political expression through the Australian Democrats and briefly through the Nuclear Disarmament Party. That movement demanded an independent and nuclear-free defence posture. What it got was the veneer of defence self-reliance, while all along the defence of Australia has been neglected.</PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of attention was focused on the Prime Minister's decision to deploy naval forces to the Middle East, following the Bush administration's decision to send its forces to the region. However, by the time Mr Hawke had made his decision, Australia was already providing crucial support to US military operations automatically and without any decision taken by the Prime Minister. The United States-Australian bases at Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape had supplied vital intelligence, surveillance and communications to the Pentagon from the outset. Furthermore, the deployment of Australian frigates to the Gulf was virtually a foregone conclusion when one considers that our major warships regularly practise protecting United States aircraft carriers conducting offensive operations and are fitted out with equipment designed to maximise their ability to operate in that role. </PARA>
<PARA> Every two years some of our warships take part in the mid-Pacific RIMPAC naval exercises with the United States, Britain, Canada and Japan. In 1986 HMAS Darwin, one of our guided-missile frigates, took part. I have obtained a report of its activities, which describes in detail how the Darwin formed part of a US carrier battle group and performed various defensive and offensive tasks in that capacity. This is the reality of our defence policy. A large proportion of our military budget is spent not on defending the nation but on our traditional role as an arm of the forward projection forces of our allies. The vast majority of funds now being spent on big-ticket items such as submarines and frigates is dedicated to that outdated strategy. In the wake of the Gulf deployment, the Opposition and defence analysts are calling for an even greater emphasis on forward defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile the defence of Australia against low-level threats is suffering from a lack of interest and resources. We lack the sort of medium-tech civil and military force which could provide protection against low-level threats and also perform useful peacetime tasks such as maritime zone protection, remote area firefighting and search and rescue. This current deployment to the Gulf makes it even less likely that these important priorities will be adequately resourced in the future. That is to the detriment of our national defence. </PARA>
<PARA> In this place previously, I have drawn the analogy between what is occurring in the funding of Australian defence forces by citing the fact that on the one hand we spend $9 billion on a relatively impotent, demoralised defence force in the roles that I have just outlined, yet at the same time our volunteer coastal patrols, our bushfire brigades and our volunteer State emergency services are funded by selling lamingtons on street corners. The realities of our defence expenditure must be drawn to the attention of the nation. Let us look at some of the realities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have purchased 75 F18 fighters at a cost of $45m each. I find it difficult to do that mathematics-75 times $45m each. I am told it will be nine years before those F18 fighters are all piloted and then it will be with inexperienced pilots. That is assuming there is no attrition of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilots. Of course attrition of RAAF pilots is one of the major problems that that service faces. </PARA>
<PARA> I have it on good advice that our high-tech and superb over-the-horizon Jindalee radar system-our eyes to the north; our surveillance of what is approaching us-will cost us an estimated $750m. I believe that, by the time it is commissioned five years from now, it will probably be nearer $1,000m or possibly $1,200m. Who knows? I am also advised that those eyes-the best eyes in the world-will be open only during office hours. In other words, personnel will be on duty eight hours a day. We have created the best eyes in the world and we choose to keep them open only during office hours because we cannot, out of our Defence budget, meet the inherent costs associated with using that surveillance to its maximum effect. </PARA>
<PARA> These are inherent contradictions present circumstances in our Defence budget under even normal circumstances. However, to commit ourselves to a military option that will not be a solution to the Gulf crisis when other options were in place and were in fact proving to be effective, is simply to commit our military resources to an exercise which is inhuman, inappropriate and without logic and which will probably have a totally negative outcome for decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are simply attempting to draw to the attention of the Australian people that these contradictions simply fly in the face of logic and contravene any rational policy to truly defend Australia. We advocate that Australia should pursue a vigorous, viable, well-equipped, appropriately roled and tasked defence force and that the developments of the past month are simply clear evidence of the fact that the Hawke Government is enunciating one defence policy and pursuing another and that these inherent contradictions and stupidities of the way in which we are expending our defence dollars must be drawn to the attention of the Australian people. This Appropriation Bill which, as I said, directs $234.1m from the Consolidated Revenue of the Australian people is peanuts alongside the tens of billions of dollars that the American Congress is now appropriating to this war which, in military terms alone -who knows what it is in reality-is often estimated to be $1 billion or $1,000m a day. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we can consider ourselves blessed to be appropriating only $234.1m from our Consolidated Revenue. The Australian Democrats will support this appropriation, not because we support a military solution or believe that in any way it will resolve the crises of this part of the world, but because we accept the fact that once Australian troops are committed to any role they have to be supported financially. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 and would like to make a few remarks about the manner in which Australia's participation in the Gulf has been handled by elements of the media and some media personalities. I was disappointed initially by the selective indignation that some people were expressing in the media, people such as Peter Smark in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. This selective indignation drew everyone's attention to the fact that war was terrible and that we were nonetheless participating in it, but without, of course, being equally indignant about what Saddam Hussein was doing in Kuwait, had done in the past in Iran, and showed every indication of wishing to continue in the future in terms of expansionism in the Gulf area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That selective indignation was, I believe, bad enough and dishonourable enough. But what I now find to be absolutely intolerable is the selective compassion that we are hearing in this chamber from the left hand corner-and I use the word left in every sense, coming from the Democrats-for the civilians in Iraq who unfortunately have been killed in this confrontation. This selective compassion comes from many elements of the media for the people in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote as an example the otherwise marvellously successful concert in the park in Sydney where the Sydney Symphony Orchestra performed in the Domain. The compere was Mr Andrew Denton, a television `personality' on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. As a compere he did a very good job and was most entertaining, except that at the end he drew to the audience's attention the fact that while we were having a great time innocent civilians in Iraq were being bombed by the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA> He did not find it possible to say that at the same time innocent civilians in Israel were being targeted by Saddam Hussein, or that innocent civilians in Saudi Arabia were being targeted by Saddam Hussein. But, of course, he did draw to everyone's attention the fact that innocent civilians were being killed-the inference being as targets-in Iraq when, in fact, any killing of civilians in Iraq has not been because they were targeted. On the contrary, despite the fact that the Americans and allied forces have been targeting what they firmly believe to be military targets, any civilian deaths are incidental to and unfortunate consequences of that targeting of military installations. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I am sick and tired of this selective compassion; I am sick and tired of the nonsense we keep hearing. We have just heard it from Senator Spindler-once again, selective compassion. I believe it is disgraceful that people like Senator Spindler come into this chamber, with their one-eyed, closed mind approach. It is quite proper that people like Senator Macdonald are not only irritated but also angered by this disgraceful and, intellectually, totally dishonest behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of intellectually dishonest behaviour, this Bill, being a wide ranging finance Bill, gives me the opportunity to talk about some other monumentally intellectually dishonest behaviour on another major, but far less significant, issue; that is, the question of sporting links with and other sanctions against South Africa. I draw the Senate's attention to an incredibly dishonest political stunt which is being pulled at the moment by this Government on the question of whether or not there should be an early lifting of the South African sports boycott. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since the weekend conference in London we have been hearing a whole host of prime ministerial statements indicating how quickly we will be resuming sporting links with South Africa. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in a doorstop on Sunday-he received some publicity for it-said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as a result of that meeting in London . . . where there is an integration of sport within South Africa . . . then there will be no reason why sporting contacts cannot be initiated . . . these processes can proceed straight away. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that that is 100 per cent bunkum and the Prime Minister, if he did not know it was bunkum at the time, should have known. It is a disgrace that the Prime Minister should make statements like that when the reality is exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) eventually stopped misleading this place on this matter. He admitted, in reply to a question I asked, that the communique from the Foreign Ministers meeting in London at the weekend called only for unified sports to be recognised by the international community, not for their boycotts to be lifted. There is not one sentence in that communique which indicates, let alone states, that the boycotts are to be lifted in any kind of early time frame; in fact, exactly the opposite is indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans admitted that the working out of the principles for the lifting of the boycotts `will take some time'. He also admitted that the communique said that Commonwealth countries would continue to be guided in this respect by the views of the non-racial sporting bodies which, of course-I am not putting any value judgment on this-just happen to be African National Congress (ANC) dominated. Senator Gareth Evans eventually admitted that the process of moving from `recognition' of unified sporting bodies to the point of actually having sporting contacts is `something else again'. It certainly is something else again and so is his and the Prime Minister's performance on this matter. It certainly bears no relation to the truth; their behaviour is something else again. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans conceded that there is to be consultation with the ANC and other bodies before there is any actual implementation of international sporting contact and that the London decision is such that the ANC agrees with it. I remind the Senate that the ANC still totally opposes ending the sports boycott. Here we have a situation where the ANC totally agrees with the London decision and, on the other hand, it totally opposes the early removal of sporting boycotts until its political agenda is met. We were told that only last week by Mr George, the President of the National Olympic and Sports Congress of South Africa, which is ANC controlled. Of course, Mr George is an executive of the ANC. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying whether it is right or wrong that the ANC should control this, or whether that should be the ANC's view. The ANC obviously has strong arguments as to why that is its view. What concerns me is that if the ANC is committed to the view that it is far too soon to remove the sporting boycott, if the ANC is determined that it will not be removed until various political agendas are met-to quote Mr George `it will be a long process'-and if the ANC has agreed, as Senator Evans admitted yesterday, with the London decision, how is it possible that that London decision can also allow Mr Hawke to say that there is no reason why sporting contacts cannot be initiated simply after sports become integrated, like cricket, which is on the way now? It should be only a matter of months before cricket is an integrated sport. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, someone is telling fibs; someone is simply not telling the truth. Who is that someone? Is it Mr Hawke, who says that there is no reason why sporting contacts cannot be initiated and the process proceed straight away, following the London meeting? Is the official communique false? Is it Mr Joe Clark, the Canadian Foreign Minister, who has a totally different view to that of Senator Evans of what the decision really was. There is no doubt in my mind that the London decision leaves the matter of resuming sporting links with South Africa basically up to the ANC because it requires the ANC to be consulted. In other words, the unified sports body is to be consulted in any further developments on removing sporting links. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remind the Senate that the sporting boycott has been distinguished, totally taken out of the general question of sanctions. The lifting of sanctions is to be discussed at a meeting in New Delhi after the end of April, presumably in May. If that is the case, it is clear that the sporting boycott is not to be discussed in May, despite the misleading attempts by Senator Evans to suggest that it will. It is not to be discussed in May-that is purely the sanctions element. In fact, the next Heads of Government Meeting will be held in Harare in November of this year. On the face of the communique, that will be the first opportunity for there to be a further meeting on the question of removing the sporting boycotts. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I am sick and tired of this stunt being run by the Government where we have two possible scenarios: either Mr Hawke is being the good cop and Senator Evans the bad cop all the time or Senator Evans, as Foreign Minister, is simply not doing what Mr Hawke wants him to do. In other words, Mr Hawke is being continually rolled by his Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I say this is simple. Mr Hawke keeps on trying to attract the support of those people who want to see sporting links resumed. After all, the Gleneagles Agreement requirements will have been met by the time the present legislative changes announced by President De Klerk are completed in this session of the South African Parliament. Mr Hawke is appealing to those Australians-and I believe it is the great majority of Australians-who believe that it is now time to provide an incentive to the South African Government, a reward if you like, by resuming sporting links. After all, there is no better way of revealing the benefits of removal of apartheid at the grassroots than seeing how well people can combine on a sporting field so that their race, religion or anything else is ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, a senior member of the ANC executive strongly promotes the view that it would be wonderful for sport to be a part of this move towards getting rid of apartheid so that South Africans could shout together for their united teams and we could see people of all colours and creeds on sporting fields playing sport together. Apart from that, it is vital politically that the far right, the ultraconservatives, in South Africa who still resist the trend away from apartheid should be shown that there are rewards for decency, that there are rewards for pressing on with the removal of apartheid, and that those rewards are not simply all talk, but are reality. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we keep changing the goal posts. The South Africans achieve something and we keep saying, `No, no, you have got to achieve something else before we'll recognise South African sport as being capable of participating in world competition'. We keep saying, `No, no, you have got to do something else'. It concerns me that the ANC, quite sensibly, keeps saying that there are a lot of other objectives, including political objectives, other than the Gleneagles Agreement to be met before sport should be resumed. The Government has locked itself into that pro-ANC position and I believe that it is wrong to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There are plenty of other organisations in South Africa who are anti-apartheid. There are plenty of coloured people who do not support the ANC. There are seven million Zulus who, overwhelmingly, do not support the ANC. The Inkatha movement is much more rational, in my view, in its approach. We have the Prime Minister seeking to appeal to that large section of the Australian society that wants to resume sporting links-on very sound grounds, I believe-while the Foreign Minister keeps on saying, `We are close to and will be guided by what the ANC says'. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Hawke made all those whacko, you-beaut statements last Sunday night, which were reported in Australia, about how quickly we should be playing sport with South Africa, the journalists reporting them did not have access to the communique from London. They did not have the actual document which showed that what Mr Hawke was saying was bunkum. I guess one of the problems in the media is that once someone sets off down one track saying, `It is going to be soon. Isn't everything wonderful?' it is a bit hard to change course. It has intrigued me that the bulk of the Australian media-having now seen the communique and having heard Senator Evans's response yesterday-still will not in fact reveal the truth. I am appalled at the level of journalistic response. Now that the facts are there the media are still leaving on the record, unchallenged, the hoax over sporting ties that the Prime Minister has perpetrated on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it may be that this Government intends to dump the ANC, to ignore the instructions which were given to it only last week by Mr George. Maybe this Government is going to say, `No, we will not be bound by the ANC's opposition to sporting links. We will, in fact, resume them'. If that is so that is a major change of policy and I am unaware of it. I believe that if that is the basis on which the Prime Minister is making these statements-after all it seems to be the only basis on which he could be making them-then I think the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has got to say that, that we will in fact not necessarily be bound or guided by the ANC's statements. It has got to be one or the other. Either we are going to have an early resumption of sporting links despite the ANC or we are not because of the ANC. They cannot have it both ways. Of course, this is simply a replay of the same stunt that took place last October. Once again, I do not know whether last October's stunt was because the Prime Minister was playing the good cop to Senator Evans's bad cop or whether Senator Evans was simply rolling the Prime Minister once again on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember last October, the week before Mr Mandela came to Australia, Mr Hawke in Darwin said on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio, I think it was, that he would look forward to a resumption of sporting links with South Africa as soon as was reasonable and gave a clear indication that `reasonable' meant pretty soon. Then Mr Mandela came and gave a lunchtime speech in the Great Hall-Madam Acting Deputy President, I think you remember it-in which he said, `No, no, there should be no early resumption of sporting links. There are a whole lot of political objectives to be reached before that can take place'. Lo and behold later that week what did Senator Evans say? Exactly the same thing: `No, there will be no early resumption of sporting links'. Good cop, bad cop, political stunt-Mr Hawke is trying to appear as the champion of sporting links while his Government continues with its policy of total subservience to the ANC and its policy of no early resumption of sporting links. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that Mr Hawke has been allowed to get away with this by the media. Only a few talkback radio stations-and thank heavens that talkback radio exists in Australia-have been prepared to question Mr Hawke's and Senator Evans's statements on this matter. I single out in particular John Tingle on 2GB in Sydney, to whom of course, with many other members of the media, I faxed the details of Senator Evans's responses. I faxed the details of the communique and they have been prepared to say, `Yes, what is going on?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Government has a responsibility to do something serious, not to engage in the sort of petulant nonsense that Senator Evans tried yesterday when he even put on the Notice Paper an objection to my having challenged what is clearly an indefensible set of statements by the Prime Minister and by Senator Evans. That was of course withdrawn this morning, but it is a measure of the sort of web, if you like, of deception being drawn by this Government over this issue that Senator Evans thought it was clever or smart to propose a motion that I be criticised for having raised this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that unless the Government comes clean pretty shortly on this issue the Australian public has as much right now to be as cynical as it was last October when the Government pulled the same stunt. I want, and I think the people of Australia want, Mr Hawke either to apologise for the nonsense he has spread around about early resumption of sporting links or else to say how the lifting of this boycott will be achieved. How does the Government intend doing so? Does it intend doing so unilaterally without the support of the Commonwealth and, if so, how is that going to happen-if it is going to require the support of the Commonwealth-before November? That is when the next meeting of the Commonwealth at which this can be dealt with is scheduled for. Alternatively, is the Government going to do it despite the ANC's opposition or does it have some other trick up its sleeve?</PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it at the moment, the Government's policy, its commitment, to the ANC position and its continued rhetoric indicate that it is locked into a situation where there cannot be an early resumption of sporting links with South Africa no matter how sensible or rational it may be, and no matter how often the Prime Minister says, in the face of all the facts, that it is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> This kind of government by deception is not unusual. It has been happening continually on a whole range of issues. What annoys me is the way the media in Australia, by and large, keep allowing the Government to get away with it, and when we in the Opposition point out this deception and this dishonesty we are totally ignored. I beg your pardon: the Age newspaper did the other day run a couple of paragraphs relating to my objection. But, by and large, the media have sat idle in the face of the facts and reported absolute nonsense with headings such as `PM Tips Early Move For Sanctions'. The image creation process is going on unrestrained by an alert media and that image creation process is a phoney-just like this Government. </PARA>

There is no doubt that at some time in the future we will be called upon to allocate more funds to support our presence in the Gulf and, if one can take notice of the media, we are now approaching a new phase of the war which will be not only expensive in financial terms, but also expensive in human lives. It is a great pity that the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein-who we know has no respect for human life, including his own people-has failed to see the writing on the wall. His contempt for humanity is well documented and we all know of his human rights abuses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's commitment to the Gulf war, while it may seem significant to us, is only a token compared to a lot of countries participating. Madam Acting Deputy President, you can be assured, of course, that it is not a token representation for the families of our personnel serving there, who of course would find this event most traumatic. For our service men and women, separation from their loved ones must also be heart-rending to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is not the first time that our service men and women have fought in the Middle East and surrounding areas. Two world wars where Australians have fought with honour alongside their allies remind us of the tremendous tradition that our armed forces have earned. Our forces in the Gulf now are no different from those that have gone before them. They too are a credit to our nation. What a pity it was that only last week or so the Government tried to charge admission to our magnificent War Memorial-a memorial for all Australians to remind themselves of those Australians who over the decades made a supreme sacrifice to ensure that this nation remained free from tyranny similar to the sort of tyranny that Saddam Hussein is inflicting upon the people of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, the most fascinating part of the Gulf war is the space-age technology being used. The highly sophisticated nature of weaponry is mind-boggling: smart bombs, Scud missiles, Patriot missiles and cruise missiles, just to name a few. What hope would we as a nation have if that type of weaponry were used against us? Sure, we have some sophistication, as much as we can afford, but for our defence we rely on our allies and our friends, just as Kuwait is relying on the United Nations coalition to help it. </PARA>
<PARA> The new world order that is much talked about by President Bush and Mr Hawke is now a fact of life. The last time our troops were in the Middle East they fought against Germans, Syrians and Vichy French. Today, of course, those particular nations are on our side along with some 24 others. Not only do we have a moral commitment to defeat the aggression of Saddam Hussein, but we would expect the United Nations to come to our defence if it were ever needed-and let us hope it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator MacGibbon said earlier in the debate, we cannot just rely on our Jindalee radar system or our F111s or our F18s. We certainly are not overburdened with sophisticated weaponry and, as I said before, we are relying on regular army troops to man RBS70 surface to air missile systems aboard supply ships HMAS Success and HMAS Westralia to provide for their anti-air defence. This just shows how under-resourced our armed forces are. </PARA>
<PARA> The armed forces are not the only ones in financial difficulties at this point in time. As my colleague Senator Panizza said yesterday, the wheat issue is fast approaching a crisis. The appropriation in this legislation for defaulted payments is only a grain in the silos, so to speak, compared with what our grain growers will need to survive in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we have a crisis in the Gulf, a crisis in the wheat industry and a crisis in the wool industry, we have the ongoing crisis of the Federal Government's economic mismanagement of this country. The economic mess this country is in has been swept aside to some extent by the events in the Gulf. The war has also shored up the personal approval rating of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I suspect it saved him from being unseated as leader by Mr Keating. I guess all this will change when Australians come to realise where our economy is heading. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we on this side of House have no doubt about where the economy is heading, the Government seems to have lost direction and also lost touch with the community. In March of 1990, and again in December of 1990, Mr Hawke repeated his claims that there was no need for people to fear the consequences of a recession. Now his story has changed. On Tuesday of last week in answer to a question from Dr Hewson, he acknowledged `that many people around this country have suffered pain'. Unfortunately, what Mr Hawke was not prepared to acknowledge was the level of pain which his Government has inflicted upon our country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has sought to diffuse the issue by blaming our dire economic situation upon external circumstances beyond its control, and no doubt further down the track when we have more and more serious balance of payments problems it will be blaming the expenditure on the Gulf war. However, the fact remains that it is the Government and, as a consequence, it is responsible. On 11 March 1990, Mr Keating told the Sunday Age:</PARA>
<PARA>Before 1985 Australia was run by the bureaucracy. This Government runs the whole outfit. I run economic policy and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>What a mess he has made of it. If Mr Keating is so keen to acknowledge his responsibility for economic policy, then he should be strong enough to accept the consequences of his actions. Despite the repeated assurances by Mr Keating that there would not be a recession, he has ultimately been forced to accept the obvious and now both he and Mr Hawke attempt to delude us all into believing that they have the answers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate for many, especially those associated with small business, that any answers at all will be coming too late. The dramatic increase in small business bankruptcies indicated by the December 1990 quarter figures clearly shows that the recession inducing policies instigated by the Labor Government have brought about an unprecedented decline in the small business sector. It is a decline from which Mr Hawke is not even prepared to admit we have bottomed out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to reports of the Gorbachev peace initiative and ask: was the Australian Government consulted about this initiative? Is the Government aware of the contents of the Gorbachev proposal and does the Government support the rejection of this proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="898" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has received a letter from President Bush concerning the Soviet proposal which was put to the Iraqi Foreign Minister on Monday. That letter outlined both the content of the proposal and the United States view of it. I do not propose to go into the details of the proposal. The Soviet has asked that details not be made public. The United States has respected that and so will we. Clearly, at this very delicate stage, it would not be helpful to canvass the issues in detail. President Bush has not said that he has rejected the proposal; rather, he has said publicly that the Soviet proposal falls well short of what would be required to bring the war to an end and he communicates that view also in the letter to Prime Minister Hawke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having looked carefully at the Soviet proposal, the Prime Minister and I certainly understand President Bush's concerns. It is clear that as the proposal stands-and it may be that it is amenable to modification-there are some elements of it which do pose real and practical problems for ending the conflict in accordance with United Nations (UN) resolutions. Equally, it is very clear from President Bush's letter that the United States, like Australia, does continue to seek a peaceful end to the crisis in accordance with UN resolutions, if that is at all possible. Obviously, no cease-fire proposals could be accepted which did not include specific and concrete steps for their implementation. That, I guess, is the crucial element that is necessary in any viable proposal that may now emerge.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say that there has been a great deal of speculation, particularly in this morning's media, that there is a gap between the United States' publicly stated war aims, which are in accordance with the UN resolutions and involve the liberation of Kuwait and the so-called actual war aims, which are said to extend to the removal of Saddam Hussein and the further destruction of the Iraqi military.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to say very clearly on behalf of the Australian Government that, in our judgment, it is very clear that the United States war aims continue to be as publicly spelt out and articulated by President Bush throughout the crisis, namely those specifically mandated by the UN resolutions to ensure the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and, of course, the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait. I believe that there is no doubt whatever that the coalition, the United States and its other partners, would respond to an immediate and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal. The Iraqis unwillingness to undertake such a withdrawal remains the single obstacle to peace in the Gulf. We can only, again, urge Iraq to fulfil the demands of the UN resolutions. The ball remains at Iraq's feet, as it has been ever since it embarked on its current course of destruction and self-destruction.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will handle this, Senator Macdonald. I would have thought that if Alderman Sallyanne Atkinson wants to be so miserable as to pinch pensioners' money just because of deeming, she will suffer an enormous electoral backlash. What happens in the Brisbane City Council area is that a 40 per cent rate concession is offered to maximum rate pensioners. This occurs in a number of Queensland councils. It is pretty well isolated to Queensland because councils around Australia when offering pensioners concessions offer them on the basis of the production of a pensioner health benefit card, which does not mean that a pensioner is on a maximum rate pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Far from any pensioner having to be bled dry, as she put it in that article, the Commonwealth protected the position of each and every pensioner who had fringe benefits and said that if they were to be affected by deeming they would not lose those fringe benefits. It would not cost the Brisbane City Council one penny to protect those pensioners who live within its boundaries from this action. The ones there are already on a concession. All that needs to be done is for that concession to be continued.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that not just in the Brisbane City Council area but in any council area in Queensland councillors, especially those who are facing election, would want to have a long, hard think about how clever it was of them to rob pensioners. The reality is that quite a number of councils in Queensland have reconsidered the matter and are looking at the production of a pensioner health benefit card just for the purpose of looking at those concessions. If the Brisbane City Council does not do that, if it is miserable enough to put its hands into pensioners' pockets in that way, one wonders how goes the Liberal philosophy of self-reliance. If Opposition senators do believe in self-reliance, maybe they should have a word with Sallyanne Atkinson because I, too, am absolutely outraged that anyone could accuse the Commonwealth which deliberately built into the deeming laws-and those opposite voted for them-that same protection for pensioners. Why cannot they do that now? It is another example of Liberals picking on the poor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I saw the article and it is a welcome reminder that if we work more smartly we can enjoy a growth economy while at the same time ensuring that ordinary working men and women enjoy the advantages of that economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to the second part of Senator Crowley's question, the article said that workers in Germany enjoy six weeks annual leave and work on average a 38-hour week, which includes their lunch breaks; that metalwork tradesmen, at a minimum, are on a salary of $32,000 but most get much more; and that if workers lose their jobs in that country they are entitled to two-thirds of their annual salary for a year and go through compulsory retraining. It also says that, comparing Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures from 1985 to 1990, prices rose by only 7.1 per cent in that country while real wages rose by 16.7 per cent.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the interjection, `Tell us about their output'. Their output shows a dramatic growth in export production and output per head. The point is that they work more smartly in that country than some managers in this country are prepared to enable their work forces to work. It also means that high levels of worker remuneration and working conditions are not inconsistent with a highly productive economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the third question that Senator Crowley asked. I think it ought to be said that we cannot automatically transfer from one country a set of conditions that apply there to another country because, obviously, there is a different cultural milieu, a different economic setting and so on. What we can do is look at what applies in one country, distinguish the principles that make its application in that country effective, and see whether we can transfer those principles to give effect to them in Australia in an Australian way. I also should say that we cannot isolate industrial relations from the whole because, clearly, in Germany there is a big commitment to education and training, a huge investment in research and development, and a very tight monetary policy, and the role of government there is quite important.</PARA>
<PARA> The article identified that worker participation and codetermination are two critical factors in leading to a more harmonious working environment and a very low, if not infinitesimal, level of disputes in Germany. There is a sense of shared objectives between workers and management because of that. That is not something that applies in Australia. The article also identifies that in a country with a high union membership-43 per cent of German workers are members of unions-there are only 17 unions, and that executive remuneration in that country travelled at the same increase levels as worker remuneration, unlike some other western countries, and unlike Australia I might say.</PARA>
<PARA> What are we doing about it? Through award restructuring and workplace reform, we are trying to engineer, with the assistance of some enlightened employers and many unions, the same type of internal enterprise-based harmony and codetermination that applies in Germany--</PARA>

Senator Kemp should read it for a change, rather than criticise it. Last year we put through legislation to encourage the amalgamation of unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On executive salaries-I have maintained a continual criticism of Australian executives who take wage rises well above those of ordinary workers. I will continue to do so.

Given that the Minister has claimed that the subject of waterfront reform has been a priority of the Federal Government, why has there been no action on the issue of the Seamen's Compensation Act since March 1988? Does the Minister believe that the action by the Federation of Australian Maritime Unions and the tug operators in conducting this strike was reasonable given that a date for a meeting between the unions, the Australian Maritime National Association and the Government is currently being finalised?

<PARA> Senator Calvert's assertion that nothing has been done is not true. The Government-I think it was the Minister for Social Security at the time-commissioned Professor Luntz to conduct a report and make recommendations to the Government as to how the Act could be overhauled and brought up to date. He brought this report down in 1988. Frankly, I think that most of the recommendations are very sensible and hardly radical. This matter went to the industry. It was decided, sensibly I think, by all parties that it would be better to achieve the introduction of this very far-reaching matter because it is both complex and substantial in terms of the issues involved. It would be better to reach an agreement on that between the shipping companies and their employees first before any solution had to be imposed on the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> That process was undertaken. It did not succeed. It has been an ongoing process. In fact, a great deal has been done. I am quite happy to brief Senator Calvert on this, if he wants me to do so. In 1989 the responsibility was transferred to this portfolio from Social Security. Halfway through last year we decided that it was about time to take a hand. The Department has since actually taken charge of the convening of the meetings. Senator Calvert is quite right-a tripartite meeting was set up this month. The unions were in fact advised of that.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the particular matter that Senator Calvert raised, I think the action was regrettable. I do not think it was a particularly helpful response to a matter that is being resolved. Having said that, I can understand the union's frustration with this matter not having been resolved. Last week I wrote to all the parties as a result of concern raised, again, with me. All of the parties are well aware that the Government does intend to resolve and finalise this issue in the first half of this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to a report in today's Australian newspaper detailing the aerial overspraying on 7 February of electricity lineworkers on Tasmanian's north-west coast and the possible link between this incident and the death of one of the people involved. In the light of this further example of problems with aerial spraying of agricultural chemicals, can the Minister say what has been done to implement recommendations by the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia that there be a uniform, national approach to the regulation of aerial spraying of agricultural chemicals or, in the absence of that, the banning or phasing out of aerial spraying of agricultural chemicals? Will the Minister now give consideration to the phasing out of this method of chemical application? Will he also acknowledge that the use of these `cocktails' of chemicals makes virtually impossible the task of rural communities concerned about the toxicity of sprays, as information exists only for specific chemicals used in isolation? Will the Minister please take steps to ensure that the use of these `cocktails' is discontinued?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article in the Australian newspaper refers to the death of Victor James Connelly, aged 53, a Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission linesman who died eight days after he was oversprayed by a crop duster in Tasmania, and who was buried yesterday without post-mortem or inquest. The report in the paper also said that he died on Friday of an apparent heart attack while picking potatoes with his wife. The doctor, apparently, was not aware of the overspraying and that is the reason, I presume, that there was no inquest to determine whether there was any other cause of death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assume from the question that the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia is the July 1990 report and that the relevant recommendations are 16.48 and 16.49. I had some notice of this question. I have obtained an answer from Mr Kerin. On his behalf I can say: Firstly, the Government response to the Senate Committee report is being prepared now and should be completed by early March. The Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council has had an input into the Government's response. The Government recognises the importance of the issue of aerial spraying and is aware of the submissions made to the Senate inquiry on this matter. Aerial spraying is, of course, critical to the maintenance of certain crops. However, the Government is looking very closely at the whole issue because of the concerns raised.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as to the question of chemical `cocktails' used in aerial spraying, it is not unusual for chemicals to be mixed and this does not necessarily make them more toxic. However, of course, the necessary safeguards need to be instituted to ensure the appropriate handling of chemicals. Thirdly, as to the incidence in Tasmania, this is more appropriately a matter for the relevant State and Commonwealth departments of health.</PARA>

The fact is that business has never been better. At the moment we are doing more business in the aviation sector than we have ever done before. In fact, we have record levels.

<PARA> Senator Hill interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a matter of fact, I did not. The importance of it is that the Kelly article asserted that Australians were staying away from aircraft because of fears they had-that they were frightened passengers because of the Gulf crisis and they were not flying. It is not correct. The article was based entirely on a drop in the load factors of the aircraft. The load factors did fall over the week ending 1 February from 71.5 per cent to 62.5 per cent. But the load factors are of course the percentage of passengers that are being carried as a percentage of the total seats available. The reason for the decline has nothing to do with nervous passengers; it is to do with the dramatic increase in the additional capacity that is currently being provided by the airlines as a result of deregulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The correct measure for business being done is revenue passenger kilometres (RPK). It is self-explanatory: the number of fare paying passengers divided by the kilometres travelled. Passenger numbers were slightly down on the weekly average for February, but they were well above the figures for February 1987 and 1990, which includes recovery from the effects of the pilots dispute. Airline performance, measured by RPKs, which is the accurate measure of actual business that is being done at the moment, was in fact a record 251.3 million revenue-passenger-kilometres for a February week. In fact, this is 8 per cent above the previous record for February of the weekly average level recorded in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> A record level of capacity for February was provided by the airlines, with 402.1 million available seat kilometres being provided. That is 25 per cent above the previous record level of airline capacity provided by the airlines for February, and that was in 1987. The latest load factor is 62.5 per cent, which is the lowest in recent years. Again it is a direct result of the record level of capacity currently being offered by airlines, with capacity currently growing at a greater rate than the numbers of passengers. I refer to the figure I have just given: that the amount of business being conducted in the passengers carried on domestic travel in Australia is currently running at record levels.</PARA>

In view of the serious plight of farming families throughout Australia and the fact that numbers of rural families and students are being forced to repay Austudy payments because of retrospective assessment of their assets by the Australian Valuation Office (AVO), is the Minister aware that valuations conducted by the Australian Valuation Office on behalf of the Department of Employment, Education and Training under regulation 20 of the student assistance regulations are consistently well above valuations on the same assets from local councils for rate purposes, rural land agents-usually for purposes of sale-and State government valuers? How does the Minister explain such inconsistency, which in some documented cases has resulted in the Australian Valuation Office valuation being 70 per cent higher than other valuations on the same property? Finally, what action will the Minister take to ensure that the AVO's valuations reflect local market reality and also reflect the fact that the family farm is a tool of trade and not a readily realisable asset, particularly at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To pick up the last point of Senator Powell's question first, which is how will we ensure that local market reality is reflected by AVO valuations-the point to make at the outset and through the answer is that, in fact, that is what is done at the moment. The valuations for Austudy are conducted by the Australian Valuation Office and they do reflect the market value of property. They reflect the market value at a specific time, which has been determined by the Department of Employment, Education and Training under Statutory Rules 1990 No. 443, and Regulation 20 of the Austudy regulations is the applicable one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic point is that the market value is the one that is assessed by AVO under those regulations. Secondly, it is at market rate at the specific date which has been determined under those Regulations. It differs in two specific ways from other valuations that apply: firstly, it differs in terms of a differing date of application; and, secondly, and most importantly, it differs in terms of the statutory requirements that apply to local councils and State government valuers, for instance. In those instances both with the local government and also with the State governments for land tax purposes, what is assessed by valuers is the unimproved or site value of the property without taking into account any improvements thereon. That is, as I say, a statutory requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Under Austudy we have a regulation requirement that we look at the market value. So what is reflected in the AVO valuations is the local market reality, and it is assessed by AVO assessors who are conversant with the local market. I also indicate to Senator Powell, and to those who may be interested in the answer to her question, that there is within Regulation 20 a mechanism for appeal for those who are dissatisfied with the valuation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an important question because the CAA not only is a large organisation of, currently, 7,000 employees but also performs, as all senators would know, an extremely important task. The reason for the concern being expressed in the press-I have noticed some more press reports today-about the proposed redundancies in the CAA stems from a letter that the Chairperson of the CAA, Dick Smith, sent to all employees of the organisation. The letter provided an explanation of what the CAA was currently doing in terms of its efficiency review. It is a comprehensive efficiency review being conducted under the direction of Frank Baldwin, the new Chief Executive Officer of the CAA, who was appointed on 14 January this year. The matter that caused the concern was the statement in the letter that the board's initial policy of no involuntary redundancies had been changed and the board was simply opening the opportunity up for this to be negotiated, if it was necessary. It is important to point out that the provision for involuntary redundancies already exists within the awards that cover the employees of the CAA. The provision has always been there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason the letter was sent out-I commend Dick Smith for doing this-was that, despite the fact that the award provision already existed, the board had taken a decision as a board that there would be no involuntary redundancies. The Chairperson of CAA took the first opportunity he had to tell all employees of the organisation directly that the board had changed its position. It is an efficiency review. There has been no target set in terms of targets for the number of employees that may have to leave. Numbers will not be examined until after the review is completed, and that will take three months. It will be finished in May. All staff and all staff organisations will have an opportunity to contribute to that review.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by providing a further piece of information-bad news as Senator Calvert would see it. I see that he is coming back into this chamber. He is entitled to have this information because of his previous question: another three enterprise agreements have been concluded between the union and its employers; that is, between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Union Stevedoring Co.; and those agreements are for the ports of Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart. The agreements were delivered to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority on Monday morning for its assessment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. According to recent press reports, instead of raising the $100m promised, the luxury car tax will in fact see a revenue fall by at least $350m. Given that the $100m was promised to fund provincial cities and rural highways, can he confirm whether it is true that the tax will see revenue fall? How will the shortfall on road funding in those areas be made up?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the precise figures in front of me, but I think it is probably correct to say that the luxury car tax will not meet the anticipated revenue levels which were claimed for it. The reason for that is that there has been a considerable downturn in the motor vehicle market generally. That is compounded, in the case of luxury imported vehicles, by the application of the luxury tax. It would be better if I got a more precise estimate for Senator Panizza because the estimates provided to me by the industry are sometimes queried. I think they are reasonably accurate, but they are sometimes queried. I will try to get an accurate assessment of those figures for Senator Panizza. As far as the implications for road funding are concerned-that is the second part of the question-I will first have to get the answer to the first part.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>If we were to become aware of a problem in a State bank, we would press the management board to clarify the nature and extent of the difficulty and to put in place strategies to maintain the viability of the bank, and if it was particularly serious the Reserve Bank would seek to ensure that the owner was fully aware of the problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to what Mr Fraser said took place in relation to the State Bank of South Australia, let me say that that bank provided the Reserve Bank of Australia on a voluntary basis with a range of information. Some of this was published in the Reserve Bank's monthly bulletin. The bulk of the information is supplied, however, on a strictly confidential basis which the Reserve Bank is committed to respect. It is worth reiterating that this regularly provided information does not include details of individual loans. The Reserve Bank, I am advised, had a number of discussions with the State Bank of South Australia management during 1990, particularly in the light of its results for 1989-90 which showed an operating loss. These discussions covered many issues, including its policy on provisions for potential loan losses. The questions raised in these discussions would have been one factor behind the State Bank's decision to engage J.P. Morgan as consultants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To come to the nub of the question, if I can identify it, the magnitude of the State Bank's problems began to emerge progressively as its end December 1990 accounts were being prepared. The Reserve Bank was informed of this during January 1991 and immediately engaged in discussions with the bank and its owner on measures to restore its capital and to maintain its viability. That answer is in part an answer to the question asked by Senator Olsen today and in part an answer to the question he asked the day before yesterday in respect to which I had a prepared answer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that it depends on the definition of `blitz'. In the last Budget the Government announced that there would be additional review teams appointed because of the success of review teams in the past. In large part the purpose of having extra review teams was to make sure that we could get visits to more country areas and remote areas from review teams which were tending not to be visited while the concentration was on the cities. This has meant that the new teams have been deployed in doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have five teams working in and around Cairns, Rockhampton, Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg, Maryborough and Toowoomba in Queensland, but also in Broome, Kununurra and Port Hedland in Western Australia. If one includes those teams, there are now 60 teams working throughout Australia-working not just on dole recipients but on recipients of all benefits and pensions. They are better able to target those in higher risk areas. It is worth remembering that in the 1989-90 financial year 50 teams undertook 84,000 reviews, and that resulted in the cancellation of 14,652 payments. That gives an idea of the breadth of success.</PARA>
<PARA> Of those 60 teams, 20 are on unemployment benefits, 10 are on long term unemployment benefits and eight are on sole parents; there are nine public information teams, three follow-up teams, five sickness benefit teams and five smaller local teams reviewing payments of all types. So, yes, there are teams in Queensland and, yes, they certainly are looking, at the moment in particular, at unemployment benefits in those towns, but they are part of a much wider effort and I would not define it as a blitz.</PARA>

The Minister will appreciate that the failure of the Pyramid Building Society in Victoria, the disastrous affairs of the State banks of Victoria and South Australia and the financial problems of the major banks in Australia have caused much community concern about the security of deposits, especially investment accounts. In particular, that concern deeply affects the pensioner community. These people do not want to risk their hard earned savings, especially when their working lives have finished. No doubt the Minister is also aware of the limitations of the obligations on the Reserve Bank of Australia to guarantee deposit investment accounts, especially as Mr Fraser is trying to bring that to the attention of the public of Australia at the present moment. I ask the Minister whether the Government, in the light of all those facts, would be prepared to guarantee the investment accounts which pensioners, in effect, are required to make under the Minister's deeming provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I am sure Senator Lewis is aware, I have never made any attempt to disguise the fact that pensioners all over Australia have concerns about the security of deposits. That is why, in literature to them and in any public statements that I have made, I have emphasised what is available through the four major banks rather than other financial institutions. I say I have emphasised the four major banks, but I have not excluded the other financial institutions. We have made an effort to communicate to pensioners all accounts where they can get 10 per cent, whether they are with the major banks or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While it is certainly true to say that the large banks, such as the Westpac Banking Corporation, have fairly public financial problems, I think it is also true to say that no-one in Australia would regard any of the major banks as under threat of falling down at the moment. Therefore, I certainly have not experienced amongst the pensioner community, either in terms of correspondence that has been received directly or from representations from those groups which represent them, any reluctance about investments in the major banks. I might say that that probably carries over to some of the major building societies as well.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not really believe that there is this problem of confidence in investments accounts, especially in the major financial institutions. We will continue to emphasise, as a department, that that is where our efforts are concentrated, and I hope that that satisfies pensioners over time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator Crichton-Browne asked me whether Radio Australia had moved to fill the position of executive producer of Radio Australia's Vietnam program by seeking applicants from the Hanoi Ministry of Culture, Information, Tourism and Sports. Senator Crichton-Browne also asked me whether I was aware of a communique from the Australian Ambassador that seemed to indicate that that had been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, has provided me with the following information: the answer to the first part of the question is no. The position of executive producer of Radio Australia's Vietnamese service has been filled by one of Radio Australia's own broadcast officers. In accordance with normal practice, Radio Australia advertises positions in Australia and overseas when it is considered necessary to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, effective non-English language services require that broadcast officers are highly proficient in English and that their skills in the relevant language enable them to communicate effectively in the current idiom. Radio Australia management had identified some weaknesses in this regard in the Vietnamese service and, in the interests of attracting a wider field of applicants, decided to explore recruitment opportunities in Vietnam as well as in Australia which, I must say, seems an eminently reasonable thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the second part of the question, as part of a visit he made to Hanoi to sign an agreement of cooperation between the Voice of Vietnam and Radio Australia in July 1990, Radio Australia's General Manager, Richard Broinowski, interviewed several candidates as possible broadcast officers for the Vietnamese service. The Australian Ambassador, Mr Alliband, who sent the communique referred to, had been asked to use his contacts to help locate suitable applicants. Three persons were considered: one nominated by the Voice of Vietnam, one employed in the Australian Embassy and a journalist working privately in Ho Chi Minh City. Recruiting for the position was also carried out among Australian Vietnamese, with standard advertisements in Australian newspapers. An Australian Broadcasting Corporation selection panel was established to consider all applicants. The successful applicant was appointed on merit and, as it turned out, was one of the applicants from within Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the Senate Senator Lees asked me a question about the cancellation of unemployment benefits paid to some Queensland prisoners. I am now in a position to answer her question. Section 167 of the Social Security Act provides that a benefit is not payable in respect of any period during which a person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for an offence. For the purpose of that section, imprisonment includes detention in an institution other than an actual prison, for example, custodial hostels, youth training centres and the like, and detention on remand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under early release, home detention and community service order programs, prisoners may be released into the community to serve their remaining sentence outside formal detention centres such as prisons and youth training centres. Such persons are not considered to be imprisoned and benefit may be granted if the usual conditions are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA> The program to which Senator Lees refers is not an early release program; it is a work release program and the participants are in custodial hostels. This work release program was introduced some years ago, initially for prisoners whose former employers would re-employ them on final release, and was extended in 1988 to prisoners who did not have fixed future employment. However, payments were not made to prisoners in this program.</PARA>
<PARA> About 18 months ago, payments were made to prisoners in this category, based on information from the Prisons Department of the previous Government in Queensland. The Prisons Department made inquiries about the availability of payment for prisoners on home detention programs and was advised that such people could be paid. It then placed prisoners who did not have homes to go to into work release centres but led the Department of Social Security to believe that they were home detention cases. This meant that payments were made to people still imprisoned.</PARA>
<PARA> Following a review of these cases and the clarification of their status with the Queensland Department of Justice and Corrective Services, it was clear that these people were still imprisoned for the purposes of the Social Security Act and were ineligible for payment. Consequently a decision has been made that no further claims from this group of prisoners will be approved and that the 22 current payments have ceased.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Justice and Corrective Services was consulted informally over the period October 1990 to January 1991 and, when details of the prisoners involved were finally received in January, was advised of the decision to cancel payments and the reasons for it. A formal meeting was held with that Department on 29 January, when the decision and its reasons were once again explained, and the decision confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not, as Senator Lees referred to it yesterday, a savings exercise; rather, it is a clarification of the law relating to prisoners. Because of the number of cases involved, the savings are minimal and no overpayment will be raised against those affected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I wish to raise a matter of privilege that you have already dealt with in this Senate. It relates to the matters that Senator McLean raised last week in trying to table some documents relating to the Westpac Banking Corporation and legal action. On 12 February in the Senate you ruled that the matter was sub judice and that therefore the material could not be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, I understand, Senator McLean has circulated the same documents through the mailing system within the Senate to all honourable senators. They arrived in my office at about lunchtime. After reading the documents I can understand why they are sensitive to the particular legal case. Senator McLean advised me that under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 he is able to circulate such material to senators and to have some sort of privileged protection but is not able to table it or incorporate it in Hansard. If that is correct, I would like that made clear to all senators so that, if in the future any of us run into the same problems of wanting to table material that is sub judice, we know our rights about circulating such material to other senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to raise another matter with you, Mr President. When I read the documents, I found there was material in there that, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presently conducting an inquiry into the cost of justice in Australia, would consider very germane to our inquiry. I would very much like to be able, as a member of that Senate Committee, to use this material and, if necessary, subpoena the people responsible and ask them questions. I believe that would be very helpful in reaching a conclusion that the Committee is looking at in that inquiry. I want to get some understanding from you, Mr President, about the rights of the Senate's Standing Committee conducting the inquiry at the moment, which was going on long before this Westpac matter arose, and how we can deal with this.</PARA>

After reading the documents, it is my view that, in fact, justice may well be denied to many other Australian citizens if they are unaware of the material that is in the documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators can argue that the present case could be affected by this document being tabled and incorporated in Hansard. I would say, after reading it, that there are many other citizens who, if they were aware of this information, would have their legal rights enhanced by being able to take action, or consider taking action, and therefore have their rights protected. Unaware that this material is available, they would not know of those rights. I know that this is a very vexed question. I do not in any way attempt to proclaim that I have any knowledge, or technical knowledge, about this very difficult matter. However, I do make the point that, after a preliminary reading, we may well be prejudging and precluding the rights of many other citizens who do not have access to this material. But that is just a comment. </PARA>
<PARA> The real questions I want to ask are: firstly, what are the rights of other senators about circulating material, such as Senator McLean has done today, that has already been excluded from being tabled; and, secondly, what are the rights of the Senate Standing Committee conducting the inquiry in this area now that we have had access to the information that apparently has been quite appropriately circulated to us all?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time yesterday and again in the course of a personal explanation last night, Senator Bishop asked a number of questions relating to the anti-war protests at Parliament House. I am now able to provide the following information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the beginning of the autumn sittings on 21 January, one person has been arrested in the vicinity of Parliament House. I understand the arrest was in connection with outstanding warrants and not related to the anti-war protest at Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not true that the Presiding Officers have declined to have charges laid against the protesters. Neither the Australian Federal Police nor the Australian Protective Service officers operating in the precincts have considered it necessary to charge any person in relation to the anti-war protests.</PARA>
<PARA> Following Senator Bishop's question, I have been advised that on Sunday, 17 February a brief scuffle broke out involving two, or possibly three, people attending an anti-war rally within the parliamentary precincts. There were a total of eight people in the protest area at the time. An Australian Protective Service officer attended the scene of the incident. However, the cause of the scuffle had been resolved before the officer arrived and neither the participants nor bystanders wished further action to be taken.</PARA>
<PARA> As with any large public building, minor incidents occur from time to time which are attended to by the security authorities. The Speaker and I receive regular reports from the Security Controller on such security matters. Any serious incidents are immediately reported to us.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the existence of holding cells in the building, I advise that, consistent with the architects' brief for the new Parliament House, two small cells were constructed in the basement of the building. The cells are currently used to provide secure storage for equipment and documents. There are no plans to vary their current use.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop also referred to the fact that a member of her staff had been required to move her vehicle, which had been parked at the Senate entrance. As part of the security measures currently in place, the Speaker and I accepted advice that vehicles should not be permitted to remain unattended in the immediate vicinity of the entrances to the building. The reasons justifying the advice, I believe, would be clear to all honourable senators. Inquiries relating to the specific matter raised by Senator Bishop have not yet been completed. I will advise the honourable senator of the results of these investigations as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I advise Senator Bishop that, while the protesters are maintaining their vigil in the usual demonstration area at the front of Parliament House, their camp is outside the parliamentary precincts. Under guidelines issued by the Speaker and me for the control of the precincts, camping is not permitted within the precincts.</PARA>
<PARA> I might add that close contact has been maintained between security authorities at Parliament House and the anti-war protesters. Throughout the vigil at the front of the building, the protesters have at all times complied with the directions of the Australian Protective Service officers on duty.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked my question yesterday in the light of tightened security arrangements. I thank you, Mr President, for the answer that you have given today. I also note that you, the Black Rod and I had the opportunity to discuss this matter before lunch. I am somewhat concerned that perhaps the statement in its final form does not reflect some of the discussions we had. I refer, for instance, to the fact that the scuffle which took place on the seventeenth of this month was not reported to you, as I believe it ought to have been reported to you as the Presiding Officer. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two things that I think ought to be included in the investigation. There are no restrictions to entry to the public car park, unlike the three other underground car parks. Protesters were seen sleeping in the car park on the night of 21 January, which was the day the Parliament resumed to discuss the war. On occasions since that date they have, on a continuing basis, left their chattels in that public car park. These items are not subject to being checked for security purposes. This comes at a time when security at the entrances to other Parliament House car parks have undergone considerable tightening. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Protective Service is apparently part of the Department of Administrative Services and, therefore, is not directly reportable to you, Mr President, but merely to the security services and then by them to you. Protective Service officers are analogous to police officers without strict evidence training and are presumably the people who would be better able to report to you. </PARA>
<PARA> It would also appear that there is not one group of cells but indeed two groups of cells, the other being located in the security area in the basement under the Executive Wing and subject to the jurisdiction of the Protective Service as distinct from the Security Service, which controls the cells at the front of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, the skirmish that occurred on Sunday amongst the protesters raises the question of just how long these people are entitled to camp under or near the building; what sort of security risks are maintained by these people not being checked; and, quite frankly, just how long does a protest go on?</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the question I raised with regard to my staff-the way in which it was reported in your answer, Mr President, as I pointed out to you earlier, was incorrect. My concern was not that she was asked to move her car, which was quite proper, but that it had been simply a fortuitous announcement to her to move her car because other people were about to rip its doors off, remove its engine and otherwise destroy it without giving her any notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Under standing order 191, I claim to have been misquoted and misrepresented. It has been brought to my attention that on three occasions yesterday I was rather seriously misrepresented. The first occasion was by Senator Vallentine in a speech on the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill when she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Perhaps it comes down to Senator MacGibbon's expressed concern that such guidelines might prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction-chemical, biological and nuclear. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be further from the truth. In my speech on the Geneva Conventions Bill, the exact sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no argument that we would want to see nuclear, chemical and biological weapons banned. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the direct converse of what Senator Vallentine said. The second incident relates to Senator Coulter where, in his speech on the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator MacGibbon almost proudly pointed out in the debate yesterday, war has been part of human history, in his view, for 500 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I made no reference at all to the history of war in any part of my speech. I cannot think where Senator Coulter got that from except in a passage where I said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has respected not only the Geneva Conventions as they exist but the whole body of international law which, as the ALP and the Australia Democrats do not understand, goes back not 50 years or 100 years, but hundreds, if not thousands, of years. </PARA>
<PARA>The third case deals with Senator Bell, who turned up for once in the chamber. In his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a preamble to his speech-</PARA>
<PARA>talking about me-</PARA>
<PARA>he expressed the attitude that the theory of greenhouse could not be proven through mathematical modelling. </PARA>
<PARA>What I actually said in my speech was:</PARA>
<PARA>Had Senator Coulter any knowledge of physics and had he any knowledge of current research practices, he would know that the mathematical computer modelling for the greenhouse effect, in the same way as with Carl Sagan's nuclear winter scenario, has never been done. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a world of difference between saying that something has not been done and saying that it could not be proven. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) report is for the period from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990. The report begins with the usual letter to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and concludes with the signature of the Chairman, Nancy Millis, who is a very well known microbiologist. I note that GMAC is still an advisory committee. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although GMAC's recommendations are advisory, sanctions exist for noncompliance. These include the withdrawal of government funding for research and development . . .</PARA>
<PARA>These sanctions are effective only in relation to research which is carried on with government grants; that is, mainly research which is going on in universities and government-funded institutes. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and the possible withdrawal of any tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA>That relates to research in the area of genetic manipulation which is going on in private companies and which may or may not attract tax concessions. If the research work which is being done does not attract a government grant or a tax concession, there are no sanctions whatsoever which the Advisory Committee can recommend be brought against those who are manipulating genetic material, perhaps to the detriment of either the environment or the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee comprises people who are all scientists. I have no objection to that at all in relation to the biological nature of many of the hazards which arise from genetic manipulation. Perhaps it is worth reminding the Senate that what we are talking about here is the deliberate cutting of genetic material into pieces and the incorporation of some of that genetic material into other species where it would not normally come to reside through the normal biological processes of breeding. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent this work involves the creation of completely novel species that the evolutionary system currently does not provide. In that connection, I draw the Senate's attention again to the debate which we had in this place in relation to the patenting of these new life forms. This Advisory Committee has no capability of taking into account the commercial pressures under which people will come because of the ability to patent those life forms. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to talk about the establishment of institutional biosafety committees which exist in most institutes and universities and says that they are expected to abide by the relevant GMAC guidelines. Further on it states:</PARA>
<PARA> A scientist working with full length HIV DNA incorporated into a plasmid-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a piece of genetic material that occurs in a bacterium-</PARA>
<PARA>and using appropriate conditions of containment and safety precautions pricked a finger. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the scientist was found not to be infected with HIV, nonetheless a risk existed. The report goes on to talk about cases in which there has been an unwillingness by institutional committees to refer a matter to GMAC. One of those cases involves precisely the use of the HIV virus. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, given the ability to patent these life forms and given the fact that, in this case, the Fairfield Hospital did not think it necessary to report to GMAC, we are indeed in a dangerous situation if these types of experiments can be carried on under a more commercial aegis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) says in its report to the Parliament, it is funded by appropriation. It does not receive any funding from other sources and it does not have a granting function. No revenue is generated. In fact the total appropriation for running costs for 1989-90 was $243,000. Of that amount, $162,000 was allocated to salaries and related expenditure and $81,000 to administrative expenses. The Committee has a staff of only five, comprising one scientist, who is the secretary, and four administrative staff, including the director.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The work of the Committee is very important indeed. I know the Chairman of the Committee, Nancy Millis, has expressed her view on a number of occasions about the importance of proper surveillance taking place in this area. I think the point Senator Coulter made is quite valid. Clearly there are fast bucks-ultimately-to be made in the area of genetic manipulation. However, a good deal of research has yet to be undertaken, but because there could be a substantial amount of economic pressure applied it is important that the Parliament keeps a continued overview on what is happening. Up to this stage we have not really done so. I know there is a House of Representatives committee inquiry into this matter. Indeed, somewhere in the report it indicates that GMAC had a hand in the suggested terms of that inquiry. I hope the inquiry by the House of Representatives is conducted in such a way that the scientific aspect is not the major consideration but rather that it is the human aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on that subject, it is of note that in appendix A the membership of the Committee is outlined. I note also that all members of the Committee are scientists. Frankly, I have some quibble about that. That is not to question the sincerity of the scientists at all, but I feel that there is more at stake in this whole area of research than simply scientific endeavour, whether it be for the purpose of economic exportation or of development as perceived by the scientists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to commend the Tiwi Land Council for the sort of report it is producing. Its eleventh annual report is an ideal one for others to follow. It clearly shows that the Tiwi Land Council is adopting a very responsible approach. Perhaps some other land councils could examine the sort of sensible entrepreneurial activity, aimed at advancing the benefits available to the Tiwi people, that is taking place under this Council, which is not preoccupied with the political battles that seem to have been uppermost in the minds of some other land councils. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to mention-I am not singling out this or any other land council-in keeping with my general complaints about the delays involved in producing many governmental bodies' reports to this Parliament, that this has taken a long time to get here. It is now 20 February 1991. The audit, as I understand it, was not signed until late in November. I cannot see why because, as the auditor says:</PARA>
<PARA> As an audit procedure it has not been practicable to vouch all individual transactions of the Council during the year under review. However, on the basis of tasks and procedures undertaken, I am of the opinion that the receipt, expenditure and investment of monies, and the acquisition and disposal of assets by the Council during the year ended 30 June 1990 have been in accordance with the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly broad audit statement and I would not have thought it would take from the end of the financial year until 16 November to come out with it. I guess that it has spent the rest of the time in the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner). We have sat for a fair while since then, and I would encourage the Minister not to add to any delays. Once again, I commend the Tiwi Land Council for its eleventh annual report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Northern Land Council is an important document and one that we should read carefully. There is a great deal to differentiate it from the other two reports that have been tabled today-those of the Tiwi Land Council and the Central Land Council-both of which I would commend in general terms as excellent documents which adequately report the activities of those land councils, put the information before us very fairly, and comment on the activities that they are charged to do under their charter and the job that they carry out. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the quality and the tenor of the report of the Northern Land Council reflects its poor leadership. The Chairman, the Director and, of course, the senior staff have a radical political leaning which is very deliberately reflected in the report. One has only to look at the photography of the demonstrations and the protests, the style of the caricatures and cartoons, and the preoccupation with issues such as the treaty, demonstrations and the approaches to major resource projects from an activist point of view. The Northern Land Council report would do well to copy the style and details that are presented by the Tiwi and Central land councils. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to highlight for the Senate's attention some specific issues such as the redundancy of staff. It is noted in the report that some 31 staff are to be made redundant. This obviously has a very high cost factor. I believe that that information should be shown in more detail, particularly where any of those officers are now being redeployed to other Aboriginal activist organisations that are also on the Government nipple for funding. That area of expenditure has to be closely scrutinised. There are audit qualifications that expenditure has exceeded the budget and, again, probably the most appropriate place to examine those matters will be in the Senate Estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The funds allocated to the land councils from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account always require careful scrutiny. The funding made available at the discretion of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs under section 67 of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account legislation is important. The Northern Land Council has not got on with the job of adequately processing mining exploration applications to proper development projects in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the large amounts of money allocated to the Northern Land Council under this special ministerial top up fund, which was put up in considerable detail by the former Minister, Mr Hand, unfortunately now seems to be still pervading the ongoing budget, rather than operating within appropriate budget limits and allowing the funding to be made more generally available for Aborigines in the Northern Territory as direct grants. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am critical, as I have been for the past couple of years, of the administration of the Land Council. I note that in recent days the Director named in this report, Mr John Ah Kit, has left the employ of the Northern Land Council. As I mentioned in my comments on redundancy, I believe he has recently been appointed to another Aboriginal organisation in the Northern Territory. We will certainly have to look carefully at the extent of his financial redundancy when he retired from the Northern Land Council and the terms and conditions under which he is now being employed in another government funded organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I draw the Senate's attention to the quality of the report, and highlight the ongoing issues that, obviously, have to be kept under review with regard to the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to start off by saying that my colleague in the other place the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Michael Wooldridge, has spoken to me about how grateful he has been to the Central Land Council for the very cooperative way it has been dealing with him, and on his behalf I would like to thank it for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that my obsession about timing of annual reports is equally applicable here. This annual report was signed on 19 December 1990, which is late, and is only coming to us today, 20 February. I would like to commend on my own behalf the Central Land Council for the direction that it is now showing as revealed in its annual report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Land Council is now focusing more of its attention on questions of economic development. Last year's report on Aboriginal Economic Development in Central Australia found that while Aboriginal money remains the mainstay of the Central Australian economy, Aboriginal people share few of the benefits of economic activity. Aboriginal people remain trapped in a cycle of dependency and poverty with little real access to meaningful employment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important recommendations of the Report was that more emphasis be placed on the economic development of Aboriginal land. As a result, the Central Land Council has undertaken further research into the provision of basic infrastructure to Aboriginal communities, existing economic activity on Aboriginal land, and the possibility of further development of land use within the Central Land Council region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Land Council is now concentrating more effort into land management and community development as the land claims process begins to require less of our resources. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many people who would be saying that this is a welcome change in emphasis and direction. However, with that change I hope that the temptation to have cracks of a very political nature at various governments will be diminished as well. For example, I notice what the report says about the Territory Government:</PARA>
<PARA>The Territory Government kept up its attacks against Aboriginal organisations and their leadership as a political tactic during this election campaign year. Often this has involved attempts to misrepresent the policies of organisations and divide the Aboriginal community for the sake of some short term party political gain. </PARA>
<PARA>The Territory Government can defend itself on that matter, but my view is that, whatever the merits of the case, it does not do the Land Council much good to canvass it in this way in this kind of report, which is otherwise so useful. Also, I suggest to the Central Land Council that it encourage the Minister's office to be a little more efficient. I note on page 38 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>During 1989-90 negotiations were held with staff of the Minister's Office to proceed with minor amendments to allow for anticipated overexpenditure in the Recruitment/Relocation, Temporary Accommodation Allowance and Legal Costs allocations. Savings to cover such amounts were rationalised in economies in other areas across the organisation. Due to delays in the processing of the amendments by the Minister's staff and officers in ATSIC, the Minister was unable to consider the amendments prior to 30 June. Accordingly the Council exceeded the 20 per cent allowed under Section 34 of the Act in these three allocations. </PARA>
<PARA>The result is that the Auditor-General has been required to qualify the accounts. I notice on page 49 of the notes that it is said that a formal request to the Minister to approve the revised estimates in respect of the above matters only arrived in a letter dated 25 June 1990. Once again, I do not know the rights and wrongs of this; but if it is, as indicated earlier by the Land Council, that it is the office of the Minister and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission that were dilatory and causing this sort of qualification, I hope that the Minister and his office and ATSIC will smarten their act up. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) was established to receive and distribute mining royalty equivalent moneys derived from mining operations on Aboriginal land. It is very interesting to note that during the year ended 30 June 1990 aggregate royalty equivalents of $34,302,336 were credited to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. There is a predetermined formula for the distribution of those funds. It is acknowledged that, under section 64(1), 40 per cent of this funding is automatically applied to the three Northern Territory land councils to meet administrative expenditure. That is a fixed; it is determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 64(3), 30 per cent is required to be distributed through the land councils for various purposes and then the residual of 30 per cent can be distributed either for the benefit of Aborigines or for additional administrative costs as approved by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. As I said earlier in my comments on the Northern Land Council report, I note that this year the funds under section 64(7)-that is, the ministerial discretion top-up administrative moneys-amounted to some $3,694,827. When that is added to the section 64(1) funds of over $11m, it means that automatically $15m is being applied to the administration of the land councils. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I am concerned that this continual ministerial top-up for administrative purposes is at the expense of Aborigines in the Northern Territory, who ought to be receiving these funds for grants in their respective communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the report there is discussion of the various consultancies undertaken for the review of the ABTA during the year by Mr Crough and others in a number of areas. It seems that the various results of working parties, et cetera, have been dragged out and not settled as at 30 June to enable the funds that have been built up in this account to be properly distributed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note on pages 5, 6 and 7 of the report that the ABTA has canvassed and sought from Aboriginal people an identification of their various needs, whether for traditional and cultural activities, for social and recreational activities or for enterprise and economic activities. When it sought applications, it is interesting to note, some 661 applications were received from across the Northern Territory with requests for over $43m. I imagine that the great majority of those applications were deliberately and carefully constructed and would be meaningful in the results that they could achieve for Aborigines. But the ABTA has been constrained by its policy decisions and investment criteria as to how much can be allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that, as is shown in table 4 on page 7, only $768,715 was allocated to meeting needs. Therefore, there is a wide disparity between the applications that have been put forward on behalf of or by Aboriginal people and the actual allocation of funds. This report always needs the close scrutiny of this Senate. This issue is bound up with the whole future of the Northern Territory. It is important to the economy of the Aboriginal people and to the Northern Territory generally. I hope that, as the Northern Territory proceeds down the constitutional track towards full statehood, we will see a deliberate way in which this account can be transferred to the Northern Territory Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to point out to the Senate the enormous impact of mining royalties on revenues available to the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and to point out the significance to the Aboriginal community of the activities of those people who perhaps seek to encourage many Aboriginal people to resist mining activity, no matter what, in the Northern Territory. I note in this report, as Senator Tambling pointed out, that total mining royalty benefits paid to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) equal $34.3m in the year ended June. The Australian Democrats would probably be appalled to note that uranium royalties totalled $9.2m. That amount could be significantly increased were approval given for further uranium mine developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As it is, the amount available to the Aboriginal community is falling. It is falling because of a mixture of reasons, but the main one is that other developments which could proceed are not being allowed to proceed by present Government policy. Bauxite royalties totalled $2.7m; manganese royalties, $14.4m, a very substantial increase; oil royalties, $335,000; gas royalties, $1.9m; gold royalties, $750,000; and on top of that there are additional determinations for manganese and gold royalties of just under $5m, giving a total royalty equivalent of $34.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of mining royalties is well known to ABTA because, following concerns regarding the apparently declining level of funds in the previous year, as Senator Tambling said, the then Department appointed a working party to examine it. That working party completed its report in December 1989. Subsequently the annual report notes that there was a significant increase in estimated royalty or equivalent income for the year owing primarily to a substantial rise in forecast royalty equivalent receipts by the Northern Territory relating to mining operations of the Groote Island Mining Company Pty Ltd, Gemco. As a result the Minister asked the working party to review its findings. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Tambling said, these mining royalties are a very significant benefit to the Aboriginal community and I hope that this annual report will be a constant reminder to those people seeking to diminish and restrain mining activity in the Northern Territory, perhaps to extreme levels of restraint, that there is major benefit to the Aboriginal communities emerging from mining in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA>It will give effect to the personal tax cuts announced on 20 November 1990, and make a consequential amendment to the rebate allowable for medical expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital gains tax amendments to be made by the Bill will ease restrictions on the availability of capital gains tax rollover relief, and also ensure capital losses are not brought forward artificially as a consequence of asset transfers between companies under common ownership. Some technical amendments to the capital gains tax provisions as they apply to disposals of partnership assets are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>A Budget announcement to be given effect by this Bill will limit the franking credits available to life assurance companies under the imputation system. </PARA>
<PARA>It will also provide for the taxation treatment of various bereavement payments that have replaced the special temporary allowance and funeral benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments contained in this Bill will modify the foreign income legislation presently before the Parliament to remove some potential double taxation, to correct technical deficiencies and overcome tax avoidance avenues, and to implement the Budget announcement to extend the deductions for certain capital expenditures on particular activities in Australia to similar offshore activities that generate income to be taxed here. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also ensure that a deduction is not allowable for bad debts of a foreign branch of a money-lender who has not derived assessable income from those debts. Finally, the Bill will amend certain provisions of the Taxation Administration Act that deal with the protection of taxation information. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal tax cuts</PARA>
<PARA>The Government announced on 20 November 1990 that it had reached agreement with the ACTU to replace the first wage adjustment under Accord Mark VI with personal tax cuts to cement in place Australia's decelerating inflation rate which is now lower than the average for OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the lowest marginal rate of tax, applying in the income range $5,401 to $20,700, from 21 per cent to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This reduction will only apply for resident individuals and trustees. </PARA>
<PARA>As the change applies from 1 January 1991 a composite rate scale will apply for the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>That scale will comprise a weighted average of one half of the rate scale applying from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990, and one half of the new rate scale that is to apply from 1 January to 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The lower rate of tax will be reflected in pay-as-you-earn deductions from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>It will not be used in the calculation or recalculation of 1990-91 provisional tax, but will be available to provisional taxpayers on assessment in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts is estimated at $430 million in 1990-91, and $1 billion in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Rebate for medical expenses</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the reduction in the lowest marginal rate of tax from 21 to 20 per cent, which I have just mentioned, the level of the rebate of tax for net medical expenses exceeding $1,000 will be reduced to 20 per cent for 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue savings from this measure are estimated at $2 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA>Capital gains tax rollover relief will be made more accessible for asset transfers in a company group. Existing anti-avoidance rules require the issue of shares or securities equal in value to the transferred asset as consideration for the transfer. Taxpayers and professional groups have made a number of representations over difficulties that company groups experience in reorganising their business affairs to meet these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has considered the arguments put to it and has decided to replace the existing requirements with a new anti-avoidance provision-to be inserted by this Bill-that will deem a transferred asset to have been disposed of at market value if the group subsequently ceases to have effective control of the asset. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that this change will make it easier for company groups to reorganise without suffering any adverse capital gains tax consequences, while still maintaining the Government's anti-avoidance objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes a number of technical measures to ensure that no artificial timing advantages are obtained by shareholders in a company as a result of the transfer of an asset to another group company for reduced consideration. At present, such asset transfers between 100 per cent commonly owned company groups can result in the early realisation of capital losses or reduced capital gains on the disposal of shares in the transferor company. Advantages can also arise in some cases in respect of loans made to the transferor company. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that no taxpayer should obtain tax advantages by reason of an internal reorganisation of a company group's affairs, as a result of which assets are transferred within the group. To prevent this, the Bill proposes a series of cost base adjustments to shares or loans held, directly and indirectly, in the respective companies, that is, the transferor and transferee of the asset. The adjustments are intended to reflect changes in the value of shares or loans held within the group following the transfer of assets from one group company to another. </PARA>
<PARA>These provisions will generally apply only where actual consideration paid for the transfer of an asset is less than its indexed cost base or, if less, its market value. In other words, companies will be able to avoid the need to make any cost base adjustments by ensuring that consideration equal to the indexed cost base of an asset is paid for its transfer. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Bill will make a number of technical amendments to make it clear that the capital gains tax consequences on the disposal of a partnership asset will be accounted for by the individual partners, and not by the partnership. </PARA>
<PARA>The capital gains tax rollover and partnership amendments will not substantially change the operation of the existing law and should have no revenue impact. The amendments to deny timing advantages for asset transfers between commonly owned companies will prevent significant but unquantifiable revenue losses. </PARA>
<PARA>Dividend imputation arrangements for life assurance companies</PARA>
<PARA>Under present law, tax paid by a company gives rise to a franking credit which may be used to frank dividends paid to shareholders. This is also the case for mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices which have no shareholders to whom dividends can be paid. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments contained in the Bill will give effect to the Budget announcement to deny mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices the right to maintain a franking account, and cancel any surplus of franking credits held by them at 21 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>As also announced in the Budget, franking credits arising to non-mutual life assurance companies from the beginning of their next franking year on account of tax paid on the income from statutory fund business will be reduced by 80%.</PARA>
<PARA>These measures will stop double dipping of imputation credits and prevent the potential loss of significant but unquantifiable amounts of revenue. New shareholders of companies that were previously mutuals, or of privatised government insurance offices, will not have access to franking credits that arose before such companies changed their status. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also give effect to the Government's decision that franking credits should arise to non-mutual life assurance companies for 20% of franked dividends paid on assets included in their insurance funds. This will apply to franked dividends received by the companies from the beginning of their next franking year. </PARA>
<PARA>Bereavement Payments</PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No.4) 1989 gave effect to a number of measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget, including a scheme of bereavement payments to either replace the tax exempt special temporary allowance and funeral benefit, or to make such payments in a number of situations not previously covered by the special temporary allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will ensure that the taxation treatment of bereavement payments is broadly the same as the treatment which applied to the benefits they replaced.</PARA>
<PARA>Specifically, the Bill will exempt from tax the additional pension payment that is made following the death of a pensioner without a pensioner spouse, and the payment made to a third party in the situation where the death of the first deceased pensioner is not notified until after the spouse has also died. Further, the bereavement payment made following the death of a child to a person who was in receipt of a child related payment will also be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>Sole parent's pension is now continued for 14 weeks after the death of the only qualifying child. These payments will continue to be included in assessable income. The continuation of carer's pension for 14 weeks after the death of the person being cared for (not being the carer's spouse), will be exempt in certain circumstances where the recipient is under age pension age. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also exempt from tax the bereavement payment made to a widow or widower of a veteran or mariner who was in receipt of a disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA>The estimated cost to revenue of these proposals is less than $500,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Source Income Measures</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget to extend the scope of certain special deduction provisions of the income tax law relating to capital expenditures incurred in particular activities or investments which take place in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Those provisions are to be broadened to allow these deductions for relevant capital expenditures incurred after 7.30 pm Eastern Standard Time on 21 August 1990 in the derivation of income that will be assessable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the Bill will extend, in relation to foreign activities that generate assessable income-</PARA>
<PARA> * the deductions relating to mining and petroleum activities in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> * the deductions for industrial property granted, registered or subsisting in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the deductions for capital expenditure on buildings in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated that the cost to revenue of extending these deductions will be less than $15 million in 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>It was also announced in the Budget that, because of the way the income tax law dealing with bad debts is couched, it is arguable that a financial institution is entitled to an income tax deduction for bad debts of its foreign branch that are written off even though, under the proposed new foreign income measures, the income of the branch will generally be exempt from Australian income tax. Measures in this Bill will ensure that a deduction will not be allowable for bad debts in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>An appropriate apportionment arrangement will apply where a relevant loan has been created or acquired after 7.30 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 21 August 1990, and some of the income derived from the loan debt will be assessable to Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA>While there is no revenue gain or loss from this measure, it could be significant in protecting the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments contained in this Bill are directed at removing some potential for double taxation and correcting technical deficiencies in legislation now before the Parliament (the ``Foreign Income Bill''), and at removing tax avoidance avenues. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of these amendments are aimed at ensuring continuity in the capital gains tax treatment of assets when an entity either ceases to be or becomes an Australian resident. For the purpose of calculating the attributable income, the assets will be treated as having been disposed of and reacquired on the change of residence. This will ensure that no part of any capital gain is taxed twice. </PARA>
<PARA>Also to eliminate double taxation, income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) will not be attributed to Australian taxpayers where they hold interests in the CFC through another entity resident in a country that taxes the income under its accruals tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Other measures in the Bill will extend foreign tax credit and exemption arrangements to certain deemed dividends subject to appropriate notification within one year of the end of the relevant financial year. These credits and exemptions would then be available in much the same way as where an actual dividend is paid. </PARA>
<PARA>The definitions of ``exempting receipt'' and ``notional exempt income'' in the Foreign Income Bill are to be amended to ensure that premiums paid for insurance or reinsurance with non-residents are not categorised with income that has been subject to full rates of Australian tax. The cases covered are those where, under special provisions of our domestic law, only 10 per cent of the premium income is subject to Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes being made to the foreign branch exemption provisions will create greater certainty about the time at which the tests for exemption are to be met, and close off tax avoidance opportunities. They will also align the treatment of foreign source capital gains and losses of an overseas branch of a resident company. This will be done by ensuring that a foreign capital loss is not available for offset against capital gains where, had that loss been a gain, it would have been exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Other measures in the Bill will close potential avoidance avenues by the use of interposed partnerships and trusts to prevent Australian residents being assessed on income from a CFC, and will allow a deduction for interest payable on certain convertible notes in calculating the attributable income of a CFC. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will also amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, to effect minor technical changes consequential upon the proposed introduction-in the Foreign Income Bill-of a new system for the quarantining of foreign losses. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue impact of the amendments to the foreign income measures is not quantifiable. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of Information</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the provisions in the Taxation Administration Act in two respects. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing law makes it an offence for a person knowingly to take action to obtain information held under or for the purposes of a Commonwealth taxation law, unless the person does so in the course of exercising powers or performing functions under the law. </PARA>
<PARA>This is having the unintended effect of hindering enforcement activities by State and Territory taxation authorities who, for purposes of their own revenue laws, are seeking access to information collected by businesses and used for the purposes of a Commonwealth taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA>The law will be changed so that an offence is committed if a person takes action other than in authorised circumstances to obtain access to records containing information about a person's affairs, but only if those records are in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation and are held by the Commissioner for the purposes of a Commonwealth taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA>The relevant provision will no longer operate to prohibit access to records that are in the possession of someone other than the Commissioner. The amendment will not adversely affect the confidentiality of tax file number or other personal information as the taxation and criminal laws contain safeguards which ensure that any unauthorised conduct in these areas is an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the law will be strengthened to create an additional offence if a person uses information in respect of another person's affairs held by the Commissioner, where the information was obtained by breach of a taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the luncheon adjournment I was speaking on the Appropriation Bill which, as we all know, was to source extra funds for the commitment we have in the Gulf and also to cover the shortfall of credit payments or insurance payments for wheat. I was making the point that not only do we have on our hands a crisis in the Gulf and a crisis in the wool industry and in the wheat industry, but we certainly have a crisis and a battle on our hands in Australia with our economy. Indeed, before the luncheon adjournment I was talking about the decline in the small business sector and the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was not prepared to say when the decline would bottom out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that falling consumer spending, rapidly escalating unemployment and crippling interest rates have resulted in over 11,000 small businesses being forced into bankruptcy in the 1990 calendar year. This figure is up some 32 per cent on 1989 and, as I have indicated on previous occasions in this chamber, the actual figures do not reflect the true situation because they do not indicate the countless number of people who have simply just closed up shop and walked away while they are still able. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Australian Industry has recently released its barometer of economic activity for January 1991. The aim of the barometer is to provide an objective test by which Australia's overall performance against other industrialised economies can be gauged. It is a means by which Australia's relative performance can be assessed. Not surprisingly, Australia's current ranking on that barometer is 10 out of 10. I seek leave to incorporate this table in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The data in the accompanying table shows that the Australian economy is the worst performing economy amongst the ten major economies surveyed. When the same analysis was conducted in October, Australia's ranking was seventh. As at January, Australia is dead last. </PARA>
<PARA>The report accompanying the barometer makes it clear that Australia has a huge potential which is not being tapped. I think my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne referred to that just a few moments ago. We are now in the bottom place, trailing New Zealand in those 10 economies. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the Mercury of 5 February 1991, the National Director of the Australian Small Business Association, Mr Peter Boyle, makes no bones about the disastrous consequences which the members of his Association are experiencing because of the drastic slump in the economy. Employment in manufacturing fell by 2.9 per cent between August 1989 and August last year. On an individual basis, it fell by a further 42,500 in the month of October. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Director of the Chamber of Manufacturers, Mr Graham Chalker, reflects the views of many in the manufacturing sector when he says that his industry is unlikely to pick up in the first half of this year. Similarly, the Chief Executive of the Metal Trades Industry Association, Mr Bert Evans, has indicated that there are no signs this year of anything to make him optimistic about a quick recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of Tasmania, during the period 1989-90 there were some 440 bankruptcies, of which approximately one-third related to small business with the rest being individual bankruptcies. For the September and December quarters of last year that figure was already 212, indicating that a future rise is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have a crisis and it is not just in the Middle East, it is here at home. The whole nation has a fight on its hands. While the Australian Democrats may be speaking, as they did this morning, about rehabilitating Iraq after the war, I would ask the question: who is going to rehabilitate this country?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 I think it is very important to note that there are certain sections of it which are worthy of support and others which are not worthy of support. For example, the roughly $6m which is allocated to this special support for the forces in the Gulf, I would support. These people are taking great risks, not of their own choosing but of the choosing of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Because those people are there, doing the bidding of the Prime Minister-obeying the Prime Minister's order to go to war-I support that part of the allocation. I do not believe that they should be penalised or suffer in any way for their contribution although, of course, I totally oppose the fact that we are having to spend any extra money whatsoever because the Prime Minister has decided that this country should go to war. That is the only exception that I would make to this funding. I think the rest of the defence expenditure should not be an extra allocation, but should come out of the defence budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rest of the money which is to be allocated for compensation for lost trade, particularly for our farmers, is worthy of support because, as I have said so often, I believe sanctions were the appropriate way to make sure that Iraq withdrew from Kuwait. The use of force was not necessary. Our farmers, who are under great attack and at great risk from the policies of the United States, I might add, should be compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that the defence part of the budget-with the exception of that $6m or so that I referred to-should be coming out of Consolidated Revenue. It should be coming off the existing defence budget. I know some people will say that the defence budget is already strapped and we do not have enough money to defend Australia. I maintain that if we spend our money wisely and cut back on some of the unnecessary expenditure items-such as the submarine project which is $5.6 billion-that kind of cut would more than adequately provide for this war game with very serious consequences that the Prime Minister has engaged in. No money whatsoever should be going out of Consolidated Revenue for this special defence expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the cost to the defence forces, the other negative side of the expenditure is that there will not be moneys available for social programs and for other rescue operations that are needed to ensure that the rural sector does not go completely down the gurgler. Other elements in Australian society will suffer because of this expenditure out of Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect that has to be taken into account is the situation with the nations which are recipients of Australian aid, many of which are suffering indirectly because of the Gulf war. They are suffering because they are not getting the remissions that the workers who were previously engaged in Kuwait and Iraq-the people who have had to leave in their hundreds and thousands-were sending back to their families. </PARA>
<PARA> I would submit that any extra money that the Government is requesting to come out of Consolidated Revenue for this war exercise at the Prime Minister's bidding, should not be going to defence, but that an equal amount should be going to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because there will be so many costs and consequences of this war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pathetic to note that so far the Foreign Minister has allocated a miserable $2m to the refugee program. Let us put that against the total amount that is being requested here today in the special appropriations. While we are paying roughly $56m for the killing operation, $2m has so far been allocated for the refugees, who will be an ongoing problem for a very long time. The direct costs that we can see now are not the only problems of this dangerous and totally immoral engagement in war in the Middle East. The others will be longstanding and will come back over time into the future. We will have further requests for the casualties. </PARA>
<PARA> We are creating another generation of veterans when we have not dealt with the last ones adequately. It is very significant that the Vietnam veterans in the United States are amongst the most vocal critics of the United States Government's policy in sending the United States forces to war. They are making a plea-a very heartfelt plea-not to create another generation of veterans when the last generation has not been dealt with. It is important for the Senate to know that more veterans-leftovers from the Vietnam war-have committed suicide than were killed in action in that war. That is a huge total. Over 50,000 people, mostly men, who served in Vietnam were shattered emotionally, physically and psychologically by that experience. More of them have taken their own lives since that war than died in the war. We are likely to create another generation of veterans in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> Once this ground war starts, which the United States seems absolutely intent upon, there will be massive casualties on both sides. As has already been demonstrated in this war, atrocities have been committed by both sides; the Iraqi atrocities in the first place going into Kuwait and, of course, the bombing of the civilians in the bomb shelter in Baghdad last week-just to mention one, and I am sure there have been others that have not come to light-resulting in the killing of several hundred civilians, mostly women and children. There is no doubt that we are creating enormous social, psychological and physical problems amongst the people who will be the ongoing suffering victims of this war-that is, quite apart from the dead ones who will never come home except in body bags. </PARA>
<PARA> This will not be the last time when extra appropriations will be called for to pay for this folly, if we could use such a mild word to describe a war. It will be the first of many times that extra appropriations will be called for to pay for this disastrous policy of the Prime Minister of Australia to blindly follow the United States Administration into a war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note that, on the 7.30 Report on Monday night in relation to the United States, the President of the National Farmers Federation quite clearly stated that, with friends like these, who needs enemies. He said that the United States pricing program was cutting Australia out of the market and that it was having a disastrous effect on the wheat farmers in particular. This is not the first time that the agricultural policy of the United States has worked to the detriment of Australian farmers. It is not the first time that the National Farmers Federation has spoken out against it. It is not the first time that it has suggested that we should not follow so blindly the United States foreign policy which gets us into this enormous difficulty. The National Farmers Federation understands that the livelihood of its members is at risk. It is very likely now that the Government will not even accede to the requests from the rural lobby to get it out of this trouble, other than to pay compensation, which is part of the Appropriations Bill, which I support. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting that the Prime Minister is considering sending an all-party delegation to the United States on a trade mission to see what can be done to talk to the United States about its rural policy. I can imagine how much notice will be taken of that delegation: absolutely no notice whatsoever, because the Prime Minister has already committed us to join with the United States-led forces in the Gulf. He is quite happy to do that and yet he is quite careless about the plight of Australian farmers on the other hand, and he is quite prepared to pay lip service to a trade mission which he knows very well will get nowhere whatsoever because the United States Administration knows that it has Australia exactly where it wants it. The United States has never taken much notice of the Australian rural lobby. Why should it begin to do that now when it has the full support of the Prime Minister in this war machine that is raging so outrageously in the Middle East?</PARA>
<PARA> I now want to look at the military implications of these extra costs. Firstly, this represents an addition to the defence budget which, as I said earlier, I do not think should be counted for a moment. I only wish real social needs in the Australian community along with the overseas aid budget could have these extras tacked on in response to the economic recession. For some reason the military always gets the positive nod while other departments come under the intense scrutiny of the cost cutters. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very expensive war. The types of weapons involved cost millions of dollars or more apiece. If any of these weapons are used by Australian warships, we shall face an additional appropriations request to pay for replacing them at a future date. It also means greater dependence on the United States military, which supplies us with these expensive, high-tech weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I must question the way in which the Prime Minister got us into this war last August by volunteering our ships for service with the United States Navy, without even being asked and with minimal consultation with his Ministers. In fact, the truth of the embarrassing matter is that in conversation mark I with George Bush-I do not know who rang whom; it does not matter much any more-he offered five Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ships to the United States and the Navy had to say to him, `Prime Minister we do not have five ships to send'. So his great enthusiasm had to be curbed. It was quite an outrageous situation for the Prime Minister to jump in with both feet without even having consulted his Ministers, without even having consulted the Department of Defence in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Even then it was obvious that the costs would escalate and the longer the war drags on, the more it will cost, especially if weapons are fired by Royal Australian Navy warships. Of course, some have been but I fear that there is more to come. As I said, despite the Soviet initiative, despite the attempts to get an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait by Iraq-which I believe Iraq wants because it sees that it has been almost decimated-we should be working towards a negotiated settlement so that the human and financial costs of this war do not drag on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to remind the Senate that this is not a United Nations-led war, in the correct sense of the word, as the Secretary-General himself has said. If that were so, the United Nations command force structure would have been put in place. In the first place, when Bob Hawke so generously made the original offer of the five Australian warships, no United Nations resolutions had been passed on the subject, so it was not to support the United Nations resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the militarists have suffered quite a setback in the past 18 months or so, before this war became imminent. With the demise of the Cold War, militarists and arms manufacturers were probably beginning to panic about what they would do with all of their expertise and high-tech weapons, and all of their men and women in uniform. They have certainly found a use now for all of their expensive equipment and for their person power as well. It is a great shame that this is happening when the world was on the brink of finding another way to solve important international disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to note that one of the major differences between this war and the Vietnam war-the last one in which Australia was engaged on the coat-tails of the United States-was that the United States military machine has sanitised the viewing so totally that we see only the high-tech weaponry and the maps on the screens as though this is a big game to be played out in a video shop. We are not seeing the real casualties of this war. The amount of saturation bombing of Iraq that has been done by this time must mean that the country is completely potholed, particularly in Baghdad. Why are the allies continuing to bomb Baghdad? It is totally irresponsible and totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf war has not only meant extra cash for the militarists but also it has helped to trigger off a new debate about the relevance of the 1986 report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and the 1987 Defence White Paper in this country. The warrior class, who proclaim the virtues of peace through strength within the framework of the new world order-what a great euphemism that is; it sounds like the old order revisited, when the only way to solve a problem is to fight-seek to go back to the good old days of forward defence. Australia's defence requirements will be tailored to the needs of the United States military as it extends its role of the world's policeman with or without the endorsement of the United Nations Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the United States manipulation and bullying of the United Nations, it is important to remind people that for so many years it was the United States that refused to pay its dues to United Nations organisations. It deliberately set out to undermine this international organisation because it did not like smaller countries having their say. It wanted to maintain its power, which it has now demonstrated through manipulation of the Security Council. So the United States deserves the strongest of criticism for manipulating that international body-first of all, for ignoring it for years and now using it to its own end. It is urgently in need of reform. The United Nations was not set up to go to war. The last time it went to war was in Korea and the Korean people are still suffering for that gross error of the United Nations. We thought that it would never happen again, but it has because of this bullying on behalf of the United States and that has to stop. In future one of the postwar reconstruction measures surely has to be a reform of the United Nations and particularly of the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> This all has grave implications for our force structure. Clearly we would need to invest in more expensive and heavy warships to serve with the United States Navy a long way from our shores. I contend that we do not need to do this. If the defence of Australia is about the defence of Australia, we do not need to be building submarines, for example. It could also mean extra costs for new kinds of aircraft and all manner of other military requirements for all three branches of the armed services. There are no foreseeable direct threats to Australia and it is hard to imagine any. What we must do is ensure that no threats emerge. That is why we need greater attention paid to foreign affairs budgeting. We need adequate funding to ensure that we remain on very good terms with all our neighbours. It is a much better way of dealing with our international neighbourhood than preparing for war. </PARA>
<PARA> Most wars at the moment are civil wars or wars of liberation, many having their origin in disputes over arbitrary colonial boundaries. If Australia's defence needs for the future are going to be tailored primarily to the requirements of the United States version of the new world order, we are likely to be sending ships, planes and personnel to all corners of the world where United States interests are at stake-that is, if it manages to bully and manipulate the United Nations in the future. It is not appropriate for the United Nations to be seen as a warmongering force. A peacekeeping force is a different thing altogether and I would support that. But wherever resource disputes emerge, if what has happened recently in the United Nations is played out again, the United Nations will be almost constantly on a war footing. That would be a grave injustice to the many people in the world who are malnourished, ill-housed and undereducated, and particularly to the world's children. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain conflicts that will not figure as a concern for this kind of intervention. We shall not be called upon to assist in the liberation of East Timor or West Papua. That is because the United States is not particularly interested in those areas. Nor shall we be called upon to liberate Tibet or the north of Cyprus. But these are all countries which could argue, in the same way that Kuwait did, that they were invaded by a larger neighbour. The hypocrisy of this whole exercise is absolutely staggering. I doubt too whether our Services would be required to evict the Israelis from the occupied territories or southern Lebanon. This is an issue which is going to pain the world for decades to come and it will be exacerbated by the war that has erupted in the Gulf at the moment. If the Palestine question had been put on the agenda in August when it was first suggested we may never have resorted to war. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the conflicts, they will not pose a direct threat to Australia, but some conflicts will be justified in the same terms as the Government justifies Australia's military presence in the Gulf. But it will be very selective, as it has been in the past, depending on orders from Washington. That for me, as an Australian, is a very sad admission to have to make-that we have no independence, we have no sovereignty, when it comes to deciding these really important issues. We follow blindly. Maybe with another leader we would not, but with our current leader I am afraid that is what we are committed to doing. I think that is a great tragedy and a great shame for this nation and it is time we learnt to be independent. We have the capacity to be independent and to be a peacemaking nation in this region of the world instead of following along on the coat-tails of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> This is why I have argued for an alternative strategy of coastal defence within the framework of regional common security and support for non-military forms of conflict resolution. A genuine United Nations force is very different from the current cashbox coalition in the Gulf and Australia's contribution to a United Nations force would be very different from the token RAN deployment in the Gulf. I say `token' because the major contribution that Australia is making to this war is via the United States bases on Australian soil-Pine Gap and Nurrungar-which are feeding satellite pictures, intercepting military messages, and feeding information to the cashbox coalition so that it can sometimes accurately get its targeting right. I think it is a great shame, again, that we are involved in the process of directly being responsible for the killing of innocent Iraqi citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be misinterpreted. I have said this in every speech and I must say it again, so I am not misinterpreted as being an appeaser: I do believe that Saddam Hussein should be moved out of Kuwait, but not by force. I do not accept the notion that there is any reward for Saddam Hussein's aggression in sanctions being given more time to work. They would have worked. When I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) whether he could guarantee that war would work any quicker than sanctions, he gave a very confused reply indeed. There is no guarantee that war will work any quicker than sanctions. There is no guarantee that war will solve any of these problems. Certainly there is no guarantee that we will get a better peace or stability in the Middle East having resorted to violence in this way. It is going to deepen the enmities and that is the tragedy of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would much rather increase funding for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the expense of the military budget so that we could upgrade our diplomatic role in the world and assist in the building of a genuine new world order based on non-military forms of conflict resolution, equitable trading relationships and a just payment for resources. As I said at the beginning, I am not opposed to extra funds for the military personnel serving in the Gulf, but I do question the extra funding to the Department of Defence, apart from that which is going to the service men and women. I am very concerned about any future contingencies along these lines. As I have said, I do not think that this will be the first call for extra cash. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, AIDAB, in terms of some of the countries that are going to be suffering within our direct area of influence-some of the countries that we traditionally give aid to-and which are suffering right now because of the consequences of this war. For example, in the Philippines the loss of remittances and reduced rice production due to losses of up to 70 per cent of urea fertiliser imports are major effects. A Philippines assistance plan donor conference is to be held at the end of February and requests for additional assistance in light of the Gulf war are expected. I wonder whether Australia will cough up there. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in Bangladesh, the Finance Minister estimates losses to total $400m to $500m, comprising $200m for increased oil prices, $160m lost as remittances, $36m as cost of repatriation and $120m in lost trade and commerce. Thirdly, in Vietnam-a country which we should have been paying reparations money to for a long time but have been particularly stingy about-the main loss has been through loss of remittances but it has also been affected by costs of repatriation and oil price rises. The estimated loss is $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, Sri Lanka has had a loss of remittances and tea exports. Remittances totalled 47 per cent of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka. Fifty-five per cent of tea exports normally go to the Middle East, but sanctions have caused loss of those markets which are the other major source of foreign exchange. The Australian Council for Overseas Aid, ACFOA, requests that the Australian Government make an additional allocation of $15m to cover these costs. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of international responsibilities which we should be meeting instead of paying extra into the defence budget. We should be aware of the fact that this war is costing our near neighbours, who are in dire straits already, dearly. That is what our extra allocation of funding should be going towards if we have any streak of humanitarianism in us whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf war has imposed additional hardships on certain Third World countries, apart from those I have mentioned. The World Bank estimates that the Gulf war has already cost developing countries a loss equal to 60 per cent of all the aid they receive. African countries facing tragic famines, whose problems are overshadowed and given low priority by the world community, are also victims of the Gulf war. While the causes are deep rooted, the case for immediate assistance to threatened people is incontestable on any humanitarian grounds. But I hear a deafening silence from the Government about extra moneys to help pay for our less fortunate neighbours and countries to which we give some aid, but not nearly enough. </PARA>
<PARA> As a participant in the Gulf war, Australia has a particular responsibility to ensure that developing countries seriously affected by the conflict are given additional assistance. This is particularly the case because many of those countries are in the Asian region. Australia's relationships with these countries need special attention at this very difficult time. If supplementary funding for Gulf war related expenses is to be provided to the Department of Defence, equivalent funding should be provided to the aid bureau to deal with related economic and social costs of the war to the underdeveloped world. </PARA>
<PARA> The major powers in the coalition have in common an indecent thirst for oil and the United States Government in particular has resisted for many years initiatives aimed at introducing measures to conserve oil. If the United States had invested the money it actually spent on Operation Desert Shield in the last five months of 1990 into saving oil, it could eliminate all of its oil imports from the Persian Gulf. That would have eliminated one of the reasons for having got into this war. It is by no means the only one, of course. The main reason is power, which is associated with the thirst for oil, the greed for oil and dependence on oil. With 5 per cent of the world's population, the United States consumes 25 per cent of the world's oil. It is greed and gluttony in the extreme. Underdeveloped countries are now paying for this obsession. </PARA>
<PARA> So, there are many social reasons as well as defence related reasons why this war should be stopped. It should also be stopped for environment reasons, which I have only a couple of minutes to address. On environmental grounds alone this war ought to be stopped right now. There is going to be a huge cost in environmental terms for the clean-up operation, for the environmental vandalism that has been committed already with the release of oil into the Persian Gulf--</PARA>

An enormous amount of pollution is pumped into the atmosphere every time a plane takes off. If Senator Newman knew anything about greenhouse emissions, she would know that it is extraordinarily expensive to the global atmosphere to have all of those planes taking off and dropping their bombs in the Middle East.

<PARA> For these reasons I intend to conscientiously abstain from voting on this legislation. I will not vote against the Bill because I am not opposed to extra payments being made to personnel in the Gulf. I think I have made clear that I am opposed to the principle, along with my concern for the way in which the decision to send the ships was originally made without reference to the Parliament or the Australian community. It is because of this decision that these extra costs have been incurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 is about spending money. It is about spending money now on what I believe are the short term tangible military costs of war-costs that can be neatly ruled off in a ledger; costs which have been incurred by the decision of our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to commit our country to war. This is a decision with which I disagree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In January in my speech in this place I questioned the morality of priorities which allow the spending of $500m a day by the allied countries on Operation Desert Storm. To this point, an estimated $50 billion has been spent, which is equal to the total annual flow of aid from all sources to the developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus on that aspect again today. But before doing so, let me place on record my support for the appropriation of compensation for discontinued payments by Iraq on its wheat debt. I have always maintained that it is unfair for any one section of our society to bear the brunt of the policy of imposing sanctions-a policy I support. Bearing the brunt of sanctions has been a significant contributing factor in the rural crisis which is crippling farming families throughout this nation, and this did need to be acknowledged and action taken. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have the opportunity to debate the appropriateness of particular expenditure, I would like to question the Government's commitment to pay for the less tangible long term costs of war-the ones that we will not find under `Defence' in the ledger. The human cost of the Gulf war is immense and growing. Untold lives are lost, up to two million refugees are expected and the livelihoods of millions of people in developing countries are affected as a result of guest workers being forced to flee. The Gulf war is making a cruel contribution to increasing global poverty and environmental destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Bank estimates that the Gulf war has already cost developing countries $US30 billion. Third World trade with the Gulf countries has also been affected. For example, Sri Lanka's major overseas markets were Kuwait and Iraq, accounting for annual trade worth more than $A50m. </PARA>
<PARA> Innocent civilians, as always, are the victims of war. Humanitarian needs are escalating in countries neighbouring Iraq as thousands continue to flee the fighting. The international community, of which we are a part, should and must respond. But the depressed state of the world's economy means that funds are not available to assist people in need. Aid for victims of this war is being taken from programs to assist other needy people around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's announced $4m worth of aid to the victims of war is, of course, welcome. But the tragedy is that it will be taken from programs to assist the victims of famines and emergencies in Africa and elsewhere. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that between 300,000 and two million refugees will flee the Gulf war. It is anticipated that the cost of providing food, shelter and clothing for these refugees will top $US175m. Funding the refugee aid program in Iran, Jordan, Syria and Turkey will drain much needed funds for refugee assistance in Africa, Asia and Central America. </PARA>
<PARA> The world food program estimates that 27 million people in 25 African countries are now threatened by famine and that these people need 3.9 million tonnes of food aid. Global poverty and environmental degradation are two sides of the same coin. Failed rains, denuded hillsides and loss of soil compound human suffering. Because of this war, these issues are not gaining the international attention that they urgently require. </PARA>
<PARA> Janet Hunt of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid has said that the only proper response is for additional bilateral and multilateral aid to be made available. She also said that speeding up loans and disbursements may help in the short term but, for deeply indebted countries, this merely piles debt on debt. She pointed out that the long term consequences-and these are the ones that we really must take into account-will be devastating for the poorest, who will be squeezed most when governments cut funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Western donors and Gulf allies have pledged $13 billion in assistance to be paid by 1992. However, $10.5 billion of that will be restricted to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. So this obviously has political strings attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have to ask: what is to happen to meet the needs of the innocent victims of war? Do we have to have a lottery to determine who is the most needy? These are the long term costs of war which are rarely factored into the real equation. I look forward to a Bill appropriating a similar $57m urgently required by the victims of this war, victims as both a direct and an indirect consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. That is the same reason the Government has given for our need to appropriate that same amount of money at this time. When we see this Bill we will know that our priorities have shifted somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, let me restate the Democrats' position: we will be supporting this Bill because we see a clear distinction between the political decision to send troops to war-a decision with which we disagree-and the reality of supporting those troops in their own defence while they are in a war zone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not planned to take part in this debate until I heard Senator Vallentine giving us the anti-American diatribe that she did a few minutes ago. I was so incensed that I felt obliged to make some comments, although they will be pretty brief. Unlike Senator Vallentine's contribution, it is not a written speech prepared ahead of time. It might be somewhat incoherent, but it is also very annoyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I heard Senator Vallentine say something to the effect that this is a war at the bidding of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Although I am a member of the Opposition, I take grave exception to that. This Parliament has voted on the question of this war and both chambers of this Parliament have decided that this war is something which we support. Seventyfour per cent of the Australian population are now considered to support Western involvement in this war. In fact, 66 per cent of the Australian Democrats' supporters support this war. If Senator Vallentine considers herself to be described as `others', 59 per cent of her `others' support Western involvement in this war. So let there be no doubt about it; this is not a war at the Prime Minister's bidding; this is a war that the people of Australia and the Parliament of Australia support. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also mentioned that the United States Vietnam veterans are opposing this war. I interjected, but I am afraid I did not seem to get the point across to her that some certainly are opposing this war but that does not mean the Vietnam veterans of America are opposing it, and the same can be said in Australia. While some people oppose it, others do not. We heard a lot of concern for the civil victims of this war. I am concerned for those too, of course, as any thinking person must be. I am also concerned about those young men and women that we and the free nations of the Western world are sending to do our bidding on behalf of the peace and security of the people in Kuwait, who seem to have been sadly neglected in Senator Vallentine's speech. It is only very near to the end that I can remember her mentioning the people of Kuwait at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I was roused to speak because Senator Vallentine touched on the words `Vietnam veteran'. I am sick and tired of having the Vietnam veterans used in this emotive sort of debate. I am the wife of a Vietnam veteran. I spent a year with, if you like, a real bleeding heart, but I am sick and tired of having Senator Vallentine parade her bleeding heart on behalf of Vietnam veterans. I know better than she could ever know what it is to send somebody one loves away to war and worry about that person for the whole time he or she is away. My heart goes out to those families that are now in that position in this country and in the countries of the free world, but I still say it is right and proper that this country should have service men and women on duty in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine talked also about suicides. This is part of why I was talking about the bleeding heart of Senator Vallentine. Let it be quite clearly understood that that high incidence of suicides from the men who returned from Vietnam is largely due to the treatment they were given by this country-and by America-when they returned home. The rejection and the inhumanity that they suffered, and the fact that we had to have a welcome home march 20 years after they came back, was quite disgraceful. No wonder people have found it very hard to adjust to a life of peace in a peaceful society such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA> So Senator Vallentine and her supporters are treading on dangerous ground when they use the Vietnam veterans for their own purposes. Those of them who harass and attack our service personnel who are serving in the Gulf and/or their families are on dangerous ground. It is a misguided attempt to criticise the Government by getting stuck into the defence forces. They should have learned by what happened to the Vietnam veterans and contain their criticism of our engagement to the political process and not to the people whose duty it is to serve the will of their duly elected government. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate we are debating, amongst other things, the money being appropriated for our defence commitment. When we are considering putting more money into the expenditure on defence-and properly so on this occasion-there is a need not to forget the veterans of the previous wars who are still needing attention and are being treated quite abominably in some cases. We are seeing a steady whittling away of some of the care and concern and entitlements of veterans from previous wars. It is an appropriate moment to remember them and to take it upon ourselves to see that they are looked after better. There is this indecent haste to integrate the repatriation hospitals into the State hospitals of Australia when those State hospitals are already overburdened with large queues, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, with people having long waiting times. We are talking about elderly people who are being asked to join very long queues when they too in their time fought for this country. We have a history of having sent people away with flags flying and prime ministerial speeches and, as the years go by, tending to expect them to be treated as welfare recipients and not compensate them for the damage which their war service has done to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Only late last year we were involved in having to disallow the third Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, or GARP 3-generally accepted accounting principles-in this chamber when the Federal Government was trying to change the lifestyle calculations for veterans. It was a cruel hoax that was being pulled on the veterans community through that so-called efficiency move. We should all be alert in this place to these gradual changes to the entitlements of those who fought in previous wars. Only last week we had yet another reminder that we must be vigilant when it comes to things that are precious to veterans. I am thinking now of the Australian War Memorial and the attempt to charge to enter a memorial to our dead. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that also continues to concern me is the apparent change of focus which is occurring at the War Memorial away from a memorial to our dead to other purposes such as social history. This is not the opportunity now, I think, to get into that area, but it is something which we in the Parliament must be alert to. They are all very relevant to what we do when we send men and women away to war. We have a responsibility to them, to their interests and to their care that goes on forever, and we must not, in having them away there now, think that by voting some extra money to make sure they have their supplies we have done all we need for them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have people serving on those ships who, for the first time in Australia's history, will not be entitled to a war service loan. That is just incredible. It is the first time in Australia's history that such people will not automatically be entitled to a war service loan. I say `automatically' because there are some older people on the ships or on exchange with foreign units who may be entitled under the old defence service home loan scheme. But the youngsters will not have a war service loan entitlement. It is quite incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reservists who have not been called up, so the Government hides behind the fact that they are volunteers. They have been in the reserves for years. They have gone away as senior surgeons and anaesthetists. They are subsidising their own war effort by up to $30,000 to look after our personnel and to give them medical care if they are seriously injured. Those people are financing their own contribution to the war because the Government refuses to reimburse them for the costs incurred in their practices while they are away. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also talked about the video game aspect of this war. It has become a fashionable cliche to talk about that. But every time I hear somebody talking about precision bombing and how it all looks a bit like a video game, I think of the years that have gone into training those people, because those weapon systems do not operate themselves. Behind every bomb that gets away, a human being has to have his place. There is no weapon of war that can operate without some human input. In peacetime we should not begrudge the money that is spent on training our personnel because it is only in times like now that we suddenly find out how vital that training is. If our people were up in the air doing the bombing in Iraq, we would be wanting to make sure that they were precision bombers, that they did protect the lives of as many Iraqi citizens as possible, and that they did hit the military targets that they were given. That cannot be done in the last minute when war is suddenly upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, Senator Vallentine talked about the warrior class. I was not too sure whether she was referring to the military-as she so often does, as if they are some lesser level of mortals-or whether she meant those of us in here who talk about peace through strength and who are concerned to see that the money needed for defence is spent consistently year in year out so that we are not caught unprepared and so that Australia will not be in the position that Kuwait has found itself in. I think the people of Kuwait could answer Senator Vallentine in her criticism of those of us who believe in peace through strength. It is only through strength that there is any chance of winning Kuwait back. It is only through the strength of friends such as Australia that there is any chance of those people winning back their homeland from the aggressor. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that she does not seem to have much concern for the people of Kuwait, and there was very little mention of them, but she was suggesting that we could somehow get the Iraqis and Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait by non-military means. Talking seems to have done little or no good and sanctions seem to have done little or no good. I am wondering whether she wants to sing them out or point the bone at them so they fade away. Whatever it is, she has not given us any real option as to how we can get Saddam Hussein and his military people out of Kuwait. After all, that is the crux of the matter. We are there to do our bit in helping to get them out of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Our defence needs are to do whatever we possibly can in our country to protect ourselves. Senator Vallentine spoke of our defence needs. I think the lesson of the sudden conflagration in the Middle East is one that we should take to heart. If we are going to be able to defend our country effectively, we must be able to protect ourselves. It costs money. We cannot be self-reliant just by wishing; it needs resources. Senator Vallentine's alternative is totally, utterly naive and she will not listen to reason. Unfortunately, she has some disciples who can subvert, if they are allowed to, our will to defend ourselves and our ability to defend ourselves. We seem so often to ignore the lessons of those who have gone before us-the generations before us-who could have told Senator Vallentine and her followers what happens when we wish for peace but do not prepare for peace in order to defend it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would love to think that we could change Senator Vallentine's attitude and that of her supporters. Sadly, when I listened to that long speech-the anti-American attitude and the disgraceful suggestion that we in Australia owe reparations to Vietnam-I thought that there is little chance that those of us who see another way for Australia's future could ever change her attitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate on the second reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91. This Bill has been brought forward by the Government to provide an extra $234.1m of funds in the Budget year 1990-91. The motive giving rise to the Bill is, of course, expenditures that the Government could not foresee at Budget time when it framed its last Budget. One is, notably, the rise of conflict in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf, and the commitment that Australia has made to that theatre of operations and, as a consequence of that commitment, this Bill contains an appropriation of $181.4m for payment by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board which were insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also contains an appropriation of $52.7m for the Department of Defence to meet equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Force in the Middle East. In total, the supplementation for defence costs associated with the Gulf deployment, being a matter of some conjecture and speculation in the press, amounts, we can now say authoritatively, to $68.9m in 1990-91. The balance of $16.2m will be included in the Additional Estimates. A further $27.5m will be provided in subsequent years-$23.6m in 1991-92 and $3.9m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, of course, as the proposer of this Bill, in support of it. The Liberal Party-National Party coalition has supported the Bill as well. The Australian Democrats support the Bill. The only opposition to it is in the form of a conscientious abstention from voting by the independent Senator from Western Australia, Senator Vallentine. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the speakers in this debate have used the occasion of this legislation to speak not to the point of the legislation but about the general issue of the war in the Gulf. They have chosen to do so because, clearly, this is a matter of great public interest, of firm national resolve by this country, and because it is a matter that engenders continual passions in some sectors of the community about whether our commitment should have been made or whether it should have been made in a different form. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to answer the debates about the war, but I acknowledge that the honourable senators who have joined in that debate hold those views conscientiously. I do not criticise them for that. Where they conflict with Government policy, of course, I think that they are wrong. Where they support us, clearly they are right. It is not for me, as Minister, to now redebate the issues that Parliament was reconvened for on two days in January to debate it in total then. </PARA>
<PARA> In summing up, having thanked the contributors to the debate, I would like to take up a couple of points raised earlier by speakers in the debate when they focused on this Bill and the contents of it. Firstly, it is important to stress that the amount of money that the Government has sought in this Bill for payment to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board results from Australia's observation of the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate the Government has also been criticised for failing to take account of that invasion in the 1990-91 Budget. I think that most honourable senators would acknowledge that the Commonwealth Budget is a very complex set of documents requiring significant effort by both Ministers and their Departments for its compilation. It would be a major task now, in view of the hostilities in the Gulf, to recast the Budget in its entirety, as seemed to be the point of the criticism of some of the speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a major task to do; to do it before the normal bringing down of a Budget in August is a task of almost unbelievable complexity. I think it is also fair to point out that the Government could not have been expected to foresee the events of last month back in the first week of August last year. Had Iraq withdrawn from Kuwait shortly after its invasion, as the United Nations enjoined it to do, there would not have been a requirement for this present Bill. The Government chose to assess the situation as it unfolded and developed rather than change its Budget, having declared its Budget precipitately and at the time perhaps needlessly, given that it was always possible during the period of the sanctions that the Iraqi dictatorship would have seen the error of its ways and made what I think would have been the most humane decision and withdrawn to avoid the conflict that has ensued. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I draw to the attention of honourable senators the `urgent and unforeseen criterion' for the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which specifies that the expenditure is to be urgently required and `unforeseen until the last day on which it was practicable to include appropriation for that expenditure in the Bill for this Act' before the introduction of the Bill into the House of Representatives. In other words, there is an emergency pool that can be called upon if unforeseen circumstances arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the time needed to finalise and print Appropriation Bills, this effectively means a week or two prior to the date of introduction. It would take at least that length of time to ready a Bill in unforeseen circumstances. It seems prudent to me to make a provision such as this so that in the event of circumstances that are not predictable the Government can respond immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills obviously cannot include provision for items in advance of the Government reaching considered decisions on them and hence there will be a need to have recourse to the advance to cover urgent expenditure, the need for which was not apparent when the Appropriation Bills were drafted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, during Question Time in the House of Representatives. The Minister in the other place chose to attack a press release I issued yesterday relating to the question of external consultants employed by the Department of Defence. I have here an unofficial transcript of Question Time in the House of Representatives and I would like to read a couple of paragraphs which explain my concerns. Mr Bilney said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Senator Newman's claim that we have increased consultancy expenditure in the Department of Defence over the last four years reminds me of the old adage: there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Her calculations are based on a false figure for the base year that she uses, which is the financial year 1986-87, and she quotes a figure for external consultancies of that year of $2.559m. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bilney went on to criticise the figures in some detail and ended by referring to a survey questionnaire being done by external consultants on attitudes to ethics among Defence staff. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Were she herself to undergo that questionnaire I suspect she would fail it. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the figures in my press release were based on an answer provided to Mr Prosser on 30 May 1989 by the then Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley. The question on notice asked:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) What sum did the Minister's Department spend on consultants in (a) 1986-87, (b) 1987-88 and (c) 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>He then asked for details of those consultants which are irrelevant to my point. Mr Beazley answered as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (a) During 1986-87 the Department of Defence spent a total of $2.559m on the engagement of external consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) During 1987-88 the Department of Defence spent the sum of $12.597m on the engagement of external consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) During 1988-89 the Department of Defence spent in total $18.915m on the engagement of external consultants.</PARA>
<PARA>The figure for 1989-90 of approximately $23m for external consultants was taken by me from the annual report. I can only imagine that Mr Bilney is trying to repudiate Mr Beazley's answer, in that the growth from 1986-87 to 1989-90 was 801 per cent, as I said in my press release. That is obviously embarrassing to the Minister, but it is no justification for the Minister's reflection on my ethics, which were based on Mr Beazley's response and the annual report for the previous year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991. The Government announced that the amendments to the Wool Marketing Act 1987 have the principal purposes-for the Government of course-of extending the period of Commonwealth guarantee on approved Australian Wool Corporation borrowings beyond 1 July 1991; of implementing the wool industry supplementary payments scheme and appropriate funds for the scheme; of suspending the operations of the reserve price scheme; of enabling the Minister to issue to the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) guidelines in relation to reducing its indebtedness and/or wool stockpile, with the AWC being required to adhere to those guidelines; and enabling the appointment by the Minister of an administrator of the AWC, or an interim AWC, in the event that, in the Minister's opinion, the AWC is unable to form a quorum at meetings or is not effectively exercising its powers or performing its functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to reflect that throughout the last couple of years the debate on wool has been very contentious. I reflected on the debate in this place on 15 November 1990 on a series of wool tax amendment Bills when I said:</PARA>
<PARA>As everyone in Australia knows, the wool debate has very historical, economic and major development consequences for our country. Certainly, anyone who traces the history of wool throughout Australia will know that it is intricately linked to the economics, politics and community development in many areas. We need to recognise that our national economy is in dire straits and that to a large extent the contribution made by wool to our economy is a most important factor. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that many members of the House of Representatives and many honourable senators in this place have, in the last few days, drawn extensively from information with regard to wool marketing going back to the original introduction of this scheme in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> They have probably also taken cognisance of the amendments made by the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, in 1987 when he considerably amended and changed that scheme at that time. I would point out that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) adopted a new platform in 1988 and it is worth reflecting on that particular platform. I refer in particular to page 167 which is under section 19, primary industries and energy, and the part of the platform which relates to economic issues:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor believes that economic issues such as interest rates, access to finance, the exchange rate, taxation, the level of inflation and differential levels of protection are of more significance to the primary industry and resources sector's profitability than the implementation of commodity-specific policies.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, we need to be reminded that just prior to the March 1990 election last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy gave a major speech in an address to the Victorian Rural Press club in Melbourne on Tuesday, 13 March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> His press release was headed `Concepts, Umbrellas, Directions, Frameworks and Integration' and it detailed the Hawke Labor Government's rural policies for its next term. Rather ironically, in the press release the Minister quotes from his own speech at the Press Club when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not flinch in supporting the wool industry's reserve price decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>And probably more ironically I quote from the detailed part of the Minister's release:</PARA>
<PARA>Our policies-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Labor Party's policies-</PARA>
<PARA>have resulted in strong economic growth. As well as being a good thing in itself, this has allowed us to get away from the colonial thinking in our primary and resource industries, to get away from the Branch Office mentality of our secondary industries, to enhance the capacity of our service industries, and to fundamentally restructure our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure those words will come back to haunt Mr Kerin time and again. It is interesting to note the participation of ALP members of parliament in the debates on this important piece of legislation, both in this place and in the House of Representatives. Yesterday in the House of Representatives there were 21 speakers on this legislation: 16 from the Opposition parties, and five from the Labor Party. If one cares to glance at the distributed speakers list for today's contribution, honourable senators will note that there are to be 15 contributions to this debate: one from the Australian Democrats; one from the Australian Labor Party-and I pay credit to Senator West because she has obviously got the guts to come in; and 13 from the Opposition--</PARA>

<PARA> We have seen a sad and sorry saga throughout 1990. What are the wool industry needs? They are certainly confidence and a certainty about the future. Recent comments from the Agricultural Outlook conference, from numerous economic writers and agricultural correspondents throughout Australia, and from major work done by the National Farmers Federation all highlight the pessimistic and very dismal prophetic views that have to be brought to this particular issue. There are tragedies facing the wool growers of Australia. At the Agricultural Outlook conference it was highlighted that the income of this sector would drop some 68 per cent this financial year following a 27 per cent drop on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Many honourable members and honourable senators, and particularly members of the Cabinet, will be aware that the National Farmers Federation has recently conducted a very comprehensive and extensive poll entitled, `Country Crisis Financial Survey'. This was conducted, of course, by Mr Cameron who is well-known to the Labor Party through his organisation ANOP Research Services Pty Ltd. It is obviously a very professional document, but it is also very worrying in the issues that arise from it. For example, the average farmer gross income in the wool commodities sector was $228,399 for the financial year 1989-90, for the financial year 1990-91 it will be down to $161,923, and for the financial year 1991-92 it is forecast at $137,549. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also highlights the average farm net income pre-tax in the wool commodities sector. For the financial year 1989-90 it was $72,665, and for the financial year 1990-91-the current year-it will be $24,357, which is a drop of 66.5 per cent. As I said, that is at a time when there was a significant drop in the previous financial year, anyway. The average farm production cost as a proportion of income for the financial year 1989-90 was 68.2 per cent and for the financial year 1990-91 it was 85 per cent. Those stark statistics stand on their own and certainly highlight many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, we are in a time where change is inevitable in Australia and internationally, in economics and in trade arrangements. We must always recognise that world events have had a very significant impact both on our economy and on the wool sector. Most recently we have seen the impact of the Gulf war, but we have also had what one could call `the political cannons' that have been fired at us through China, through Russia and through east Europe. There are also the consequences of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the trading policies of both the United States of America and the European Commission. Of course, these are caught up right across the agricultural sector, but they impact very significantly on the part that relates to the wool community. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the rural community and its needs throughout Australia, we have to recognise the interdependence of a very fragile-and Labor Party recession induced-economy throughout rural Australia. As I said, the National Farmers Federation surveys have highlighted significantly the country financial crisis in areas such as interest rates, the impact of banking, taxation policies, fuel taxation costs, the inadequate rural adjustment and, of course, a failure in industrial relations. The impact of the banking sector-whether it is on real estate or property values, on mortgages, or on how people have to adapt and change to their banking policies and their finances-gives major problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many associated small businesses-hundreds of thousands of them-throughout remote and rural Australia and many other industries which have an interdependency on the rural sector, and the wool sector in particular. Jobs stand out for major attention. Regional unemployment is running at three times the level of the already high urban levels. It is impacting in every small town throughout remote and rural Australia. The consequences on family security and lifestyle for hundreds of thousands of Australian families are going to be highlighted in so many ways. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to carefully address the issues of rural adjustment and rural counselling. There is a demand for rural adjustment by farmers following the massive reduction in wheat grower and horticultural incomes. This will increase dramatically next financial year with thousands of wool and wheat farmers receiving negative incomes. Farmers are generally excluded from unemployment and sickness benefits, and rural adjustment provides an equivalent means tested assistance/household support for a limited period, as well as helping restructure debt for the more viable but still at risk farm businesses. The Government has to address this issue very significantly in the forthcoming Budget considerations. It cannot walk away from those very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We are well aware that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, induced a recession for Australia. Other members of the Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions for the last few years have had a preoccupation with perestroika for Australia-restructuring, operating and marching to the tune of the socialist left of the ACTU. I argue that the Federal Labor Hawke Government is not governing in the interests of the nation. It relies totally on rhetoric and no action, and the results and consequences do not match the words and the media hype that are constantly paid for and touted through the Government machine. </PARA>
<PARA> When addressing the legislation before us today, it is most important to recognise that it is, firstly, irresponsible and, secondly, inadequate. The Minister, Mr Kerin, has to accept his personal responsibility for the failure to provide leadership. This has been so transparent since his famous speech of 13 March 1990. His actions have been undermined by many other people, both within the Government and within various agencies that he has responsibility for. Whilst he has continually attempted to pass the buck and, on several occasions, to panic, his solutions can be described only as piecemeal and inadequate. We need to question very seriously the relationships that Minister Kerin has with the various industry organisations and leaders that he translates to. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that there is a very proud record of support on this side of the Parliament from the Liberal and National parties. We have demonstrated an ability to face the reality of often very difficult decisions. We have declined to adopt palliative measures just for sectional interests. That is not in the interests of the industry under any circumstances. Certainly, the Liberal and National parties have always stood for protecting the interests of country people and rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, it is very interesting to look at the debates in the House of Representatives yesterday. Sixteen members of the Liberal and National parties spoke, many of them woolgrowers who can declare an interest but who can understand and identify with the particular problems as they are arising. I refer anyone to yesterday's House of Representatives Hansard and, in particular, to speeches from important people-woolgrowers-such as Mr Tuckey, Mr Sinclair, Mr Cobb, Mr Connolly, Mr McLachlan, and Mr Anderson. Of course, there were others, but what they said was, in effect, a very sound summary of the issues that needed to be addressed. As I said, I am pleased to be supported in the Senate today in this debate by 13 of my colleagues compared with one member of the Labor Party. I am pleased that some of my colleagues are going to cover a very wide range of issues related to this industry. Senators Brownhill, Crane and Panizza are woolgrowers in their own right and they will cover issues such as the history, the administration, the role of the private buyers, the past problems and the marketing opportunities that face us all. Senator Walters and Senator Calvert, from Tasmania, are also woolgrowers and they will be looking at the responsibility of the regulations and covering issues of uncertainty that affect them, many of our constituents and all of Australia across this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Other senators, such as Senator Chapman, Senator Archer, Senator Vanstone, Senator Macdonald and Senator Knowles, will be looking in particular at the industry information and recommendations and, very importantly, the process of government decision making and the legislative scrutiny that is so important to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are flaws right through this legislation. The Opposition will be moving a number of amendments. At the conclusion of my speech, I will move a second reading amendment in general terms and at the committee stage I will be covering a number of other amendments. In particular, let me refer to amendments that we will be moving to cover the reserve price scheme, limiting woolgrowers' debt, the necessary attention that we must give to the stockpile and the Government's excessive regulatory provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reserve price scheme, which I am addressing in general terms, will be covered with a second reading amendment. But we all know that the debate has been about the termination-the future-of the reserve price scheme versus the suspension of it. As I said earlier, change is inevitable in today's economic and international trading community. We must make correct future decisions and our process of decision making must be soundly based on strong principles that reflect the reality of economics today and our major trading issues. We believe that in the medium and long term the scheme is not sustainable and that woolgrowers will be better off with the removal of the floor price. In the House of Representatives yesterday, the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Lloyd, referred to an important table of wool facts that was taken from the Australian Wool Corporation's strategy plan of February 1991. Like Mr Lloyd, I seek leave of the Senate to have that table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table indicates the severity of the debt crisis facing woolgrowers and indicates that the length of that crisis would be greater if the scheme continued. That has been confirmed by individual members of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia, who do not particularly want to be named but who, nevertheless, have said it-as have people who are involved in providing credit for woolgrowers and are aware of the financial situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another of our committee stage amendments refers to the limitations that must be accepted and the disciplines that must be accepted on woolgrowers' debt. It is important to ensure that the blow-out in Corporation borrowings does not occur. Woolgrowers already face massive industry debt in excess of $2.8 billion and will incur substantial individual debt over the coming years as their incomes are halved. Interest payments will be over $400m annually. To increase the Wool Corporation's borrowing to $3.5 billion, as was indicated by the Minister, plus paying for an open-ended supplementary payments scheme, would have critically threatened the viability of the AWC and increased the interest bill to potentially $600m a year. The Government's proposal to introduce a supplementary payments scheme to the end of June to provide equity for the 35 to 40 per cent of growers still to sell their wool will cost a guesstimated $600m to $1 billion. It will be financed by a government grant of $300m and an extension of the AWC borrowing limit from $3 billion to $3.5 billion, therefore putting pressures on growers to place individual reserves on their wool rather than to allow it to potentially be given away in an open-ended scheme. I note that yesterday in the House of Representatives Mr McLachlan said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no incentive-or there has not been up until now-for a grower to do other than to throw his wool on the market, knowing that the difference between what it makes and 700c will be made up by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the coalition will endeavour to limit the scheme to $500m, the $300m government subsidy and the remaining $200m, which is the point of our amendment, from the industry. This would take the current AWC borrowing from $2.8 billion-odd to just over $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of the stockpile we have put forward an amendment to the effect that, except in limited or exceptional circumstances, it is a necessity to apply a freeze to the stockpile for 12 months to allow the market to settle and growers to sell the large amounts of wool still being produced. The subsequent release of that would then be on a well-publicised and predictable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point of our committee amendments relates to the excessive regulatory provisions in clause 148(2) (b) of the Bill. This would give the Minister unnecessary regulatory power, including a power to override any section of the legislation. We find this not just bad drafting but totally unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The final issue that I would like to address is a challenge. The problems that need to be looked at most critically and importantly are related to marketing. The Government has not given the wool industry any confidence that the marketing policies or marketing provisions will in any way help them. In fact, it can be argued that the actions of the Minister, Mr Kerin, as he went off on a caravan trip around the world last year, have created a lack of certainty and undermined much of the marketing potential for Australia. I notice that the honourable member for Maranoa, Mr Bruce Scott, in the House of Representatives yesterday was also addressing this issue. He raised what I think is an important and exciting challenge. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I would like to see a former member of this House-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the House of Representatives-</PARA>
<PARA>Doug Anthony, called on to travel to the Middle East to see if he can re-establish a viable live sheep trade with the Middle East. It is crazy to put sheep into pits when in 1983 we were able to sell seven million sheep to the Middle East. What a tragic waste of resources it would be if we did not pursue every effort to get the live sheep trade operational again. </PARA>
<PARA>That issue is complementary to this legislation. It is important to the whole industry and how it is dealt with, whether in regard to live sheep or wool marketing. Marketing is the key to where we should be going. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but, because of the urgent need to restore the confidence of wool producers and buyers in the long-term future of the industry and in order to end the confusion caused by the Government's vacillating wool pricing policies, the reserve price scheme must be abolished immediately''. </PARA>

If we now have so many coalition senators willing to take part in this debate, perhaps that is a clue that if there had been more willing dialogue and constructive conversations earlier we may have been able to find a solution. This lack of commitment until this time has been one of my frustrations-a lack of ability to find out exactly what was being proposed. Senator Tambling gave some of the credentials of those who will contribute to this debate later. My credentials for speaking in this debate are simply that my very first paid employment was within the wool industry. I was employed in a large wool store in Tasmania to shift bales of wool. I did not particularly like it; it was not a very pleasant job. In the days when a wool hook was required to move 400 pounds of wool, a 17-year-old boy soon found out what hard work was.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was a considerable amount of money in those days. Geoffrey Chaucer had levied that fine on an unlicensed exporter of wool. I share that information with the Senate to demonstrate the fact that for centuries attempts have been made to regulate the trade in wool. There have been many systems, some less satisfactory than others, but to try to re-establish a so-called free market is to try for something which has probably been non-existent for hundreds if not thousands of years. It denies the lessons of the history of commerce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that hundreds of years ago it was common for rulers to dispense privileged licences to trade. Even thousands of years ago when Hammurabi ruled what is now Iraq, there were rules governing commerce. These are often referred to as the code of Hammurabi. Systems without regulation have been very few and far between. The experiment of what has been known as the laissez-faire system, where anything goes, occupied only a brief chaotic moment in our commercial history. That system is still looked upon wistfully by some entrepreneurs who see total de- regulation as their chance to rush in for a quick buck. Privileged bullies do make that quick buck, but inexperienced sellers, small producers, isolated producers and single product sellers are always exploited in so-called `free' markets. </PARA>
<PARA> We are enticed-seduced, perhaps-by this term `free'. Perhaps that is because in the last few decades a plethora of letterbox junk has convinced us that `free' always means something for nothing and that anything free must be good. I am sure honourable senators will know that nobody gets nothing for nothing in a free wool market. It is simply a market without regulation, untrammelled, unfettered, free, without control, chaotic. I did not need a thesaurus to remind me of those terms. Those words actually describe what the Australian wool market was in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> That statement justifies the bemusement felt by Mr Ken Wriedt last weekend when he was reported in the Sunday Tasmanian. Part of the report about Mr Ken Wriedt, who is an ex-senator and an ex-Labor Minister, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the late 1960s and early 1970s Australia had been selling wool under its value to overseas markets. ``The position was that wool prices had fallen down to 30c a pound . . . which was literally giving our wool away'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>The article dealt with the establishment of the reserve price scheme, for which Senator Wriedt was responsible at the time, and he continued:</PARA>
<PARA> `Everyone knew it would be the greatest single thing you could do for the wool industry and for rural Australia. We did it and there was no question it was a great success. It gave the industry the stability it never had before'. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that Mr Wriedt now joins a growing list of formerly staunch, proud, Labor achievers who must wonder what this Administration is doing for the best thing this country has ever had going for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should look at what has brought about this unbelievably bad situation. It is a truism that our wool industry was doing very nicely just a couple of years ago. Prices were buoyant enough to suggest that the 870c a kilogram would be exceeded for some time to come. When the floor price was moved upwards to 870c, it is my contention that that figure became a market speculation price rather than a guaranteed minimum price for producers, and there is a big difference in the concept. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than being related to and underpinning the costs of production, that price had become a gamble related to what it was thought the market might bear. Rather than being a floor offering stability, that price had become a hammock. It was slung between, and held up by, the twin posts of buyer confidence and buyer demand. The hammock offered bliss for a brief moment but, of course, an unpleasant dumping when demand began to shake. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a closer look at demand and confidence. As far as I am concerned, consumer wants only become demands when they are matched with a capacity to pay. At present, the lack of the capacity to buy at anything like a reasonable price is the reason for our wool marketing problems. The want is there and the need is there, but it cannot be translated into a predictable demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that even at 700c-perhaps even at 500c-the Soviet Union is, at present, unable to buy. I must say in passing that the priorities of that country's Administration are somewhat disturbing, because it seems that there is plenty of money that can be found to maintain an armed presence in the Baltic States, and Soviet forces are fuelled and armoured sufficiently well to trample the citizens of Lithuania, so perhaps it is not a case of lack of money at all but rather a case of misdirected priorities. That is something that we really cannot do much about while considering this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling quite rightly said that wool marketing is the key and Sir William Gunn agrees with him, and I would like to put myself alongside those authorities. It seems patently obvious that our problem is related to the fact that we have not sold the stuff. I have asked questions in this place relating to what alternative marketing strategies are being conducted, suggested, forwarded, implemented or even thought about by this Government and the list of answers is very short. The list of answers should be long and imaginative, and it is only with a long and imaginative list of alternative marketing strategies that we will ever be able to sell materials of any description to people who want them, but who do not necessarily have the cash to turn that want into a consumer demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to consider what caused the lack of confidence. The very first rumours that the floor price would be lowered removed confidence. It is just like the old days of the fixed dollar exchange rate when a well-placed leak about devaluation was a self-fulfilling prophecy. When that floor price was lowered the die was cast. If it could be lowered once it could be lowered again. All the protestations on earth were not going to change that perception. Minister Kerin issued many such protestations, and some buyers might think that he protesteth too much. The protestations were:</PARA>
<PARA>My clear message to the market is the 700c is immutable. The next time the floor price is changed will be upward. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin on the Australian Associated Press wire service on 31 May. The next was:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's commitment to the 700c kg floor is rock solid. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement in Melbourne on 31 May. I quote again as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that this inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Vines committee of inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>is about looking ahead. It is not about a fundamental re-examination of the Minimum Reserve Price for wool. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 23 July 1990. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Government has made four important decisions: 1. to reaffirm its rock solid support for the floor price of 700 cents. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 12 September 1990. The next:</PARA>
<PARA>I have said before, the Government backs the MRP at 700 cents for this year and it goes without saying that we back it at 700 cents for next year. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 12 October responding to the announcement by the Australian Wool Corporation that the wool floor price for 1991-92 would also be 700c. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>There is now more understanding by buyer countries of the Reserve Price Scheme and its security in law, especially the fact that the Minimum Reserve Price is fixed at 700 cents for at least the next 19 months. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 2 December. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me state here and now that the Government will stand unequivocally behind the 700c floor and give it every support. The Government has given tangible expression to that commitment . . . So let there be no doubt about the Government's resolve to back the AWC in this area. My clear message to the market is that 700c is immutable. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement in Melbourne, again on 31 May 1990. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>I have given a cast-iron guarantee, which I repeat here, that the Australian Government will not contemplate, under any circumstances, any further downward movement in the wool floor price . . . Any speculation on a further price drop is doomed to disappointment and would only be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 7 June 1990. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it quite clear that the inquiry (into wool pricing policy) will not affect the reserve price. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 7 June. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>I stressed to the conference . . . in Dubrovnik, to country delegations, and many individuals, that the 700c/kg floor had the backing of the Australian Government and the Australian industry. They know we will guarantee it now that a once-and-for-all correction has been made. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 10 June 1990. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>Following the meeting-</PARA>
<PARA>of the Interim Wool Policy Council-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin said that no consideration was, or would be given by the Council to any reduction in the 700c/kg wool reserve price. The Government and the industry are united in their commitment to 700c/kg. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Kerin's press statement on 20 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 November a response was made in Question Time by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) who represents the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA>As far as the Australian Government is concerned, the current situation is that the Wool Corporation, in consultation with the Wool Council of Australia, has already announced the reserve price for wool next year will be 700c per kilo. The Minister would have the power to intervene to alter that arrangement only if there were disagreement between the Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation. As a measure of the Government's respect for the industry, there is no intention to intervene where there is an agreement. We support the current situation. We have no intention of changing it. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the litany of protestations, the position was all too evident to the Australian Financial Review. An article written by Cathy Bolt on 12 February most perceptively pointed out what this meant, and contains some things which are most telling. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin has now put Australia in an invidious position, having travelled to all major buying countries just two months ago and issued assurances everywhere that the floor would not be dropped again. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> But one now has to wonder what the consequences will be for Australia's credibility as a business party when a senior minister can sit across the table from major customers and give guarantees which are patently unsustainable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is certainly right; they should not have been in the first place. The situation should have been addressed in an entirely different manner. To contribute to this loss of confidence, some other processes were put in train and are described in this article, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Soon after Mr Kerin's mission returned, the Government's Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics released a report highly critical of the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, in January, the government-appointed Vines inquiry went to Europe at a crucial point in reviving confidence in the reserve price scheme and was so insensitive as to ask processors how they would feel about a 500c floor. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, a Labor MP, Mr Graeme Campbell sent a letter to a newspaper in one of Italy's major textiles towns warning that the floor price was doomed. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in a response in Question Time on 6 December, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I adhere to the statements on the wool floor price of my Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA>But what did all this lead to? It led to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy being in an invidious position as described in the article I have quoted from. As I said earlier, all this was almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. The chain of events was not necessary; other schemes were possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that rather than declaring a total shift from 870c to 700c, and then to zero, there could have been a closer definition of the classes of wool for which the minimum price would apply. For example, for certain categories of wool, if Corporation purchase was necessary, returns to growers could have been delayed, staggered or penalised in such a way that unpopular categories would be less likely to be overproduced. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what we really need from a market-market signals being able to be taken back to the producers. There are many ways of applying limiting criteria to the minimum price scheme. These criteria would have limited the supply of wools which are not readily saleable but would not have meant compromising the wool market's confidence. That is the important point. In attempting to manipulate the market, to alter the market to suit the needs of our entire industry, it would be very important not to compromise that market's future in whatever criteria are applied to give those signals back to the buyers and to the producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in passing that there are many such propositions, many such refinements, which could have been brought to our minimum price scheme. In fact, the Government attacked it with a very blunt instrument: a cut of 870c across the board to 700c, and now an across the board cut to zero. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than going on with that argument, we should look at what is proposed here today. At this point it is also appropriate to say that what I have said will give a clue to what I think will be necessary in the future and what could be done now; that is, the limited application of some criteria to restrict what is offered or to encourage what could be produced. They are the sorts of measures that will have to be introduced at some stage anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason which necessitated the formation of the floor price scheme still exists; namely, that it is not a free market internationally. It is nothing like it and never will be. It is subject to seasonal fluctuations, to geographical variations, to the manipulations of stock exchanges and financial exchange rates, futures trading and so on. It is not a free market, it is not a level playing field and it never will be. Even this abomination which the Government now wants to foist upon the industry is nothing like a free market. It is a market in limbo. It is a market in anticipation. It is a market that is conditioned by the expectation of the grower that 700c, or something like it, will be received; the knowledge of the buyer that the grower cares little about what is paid in the market because that is not the final return; and the expectation of the buyer that a different system will be proposed on 1 July. That is hardly a free market system. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the many letters I have received on this subject, one person, Mr Vandervaere, seems to understand the situation very well. I have appreciated his advice and he contacts me regularly. His statement, with which I agree, adds to the vagaries of this so-called free market that is supposed to exist; that is, the question of the stockpile and the psychological influence that its existence will have on market conditions when, if ever, this legislation is passed. Mr Vandervaere said:</PARA>
<PARA>The vague but repeated mention of stockpile disposal will ensure that the market will be even lower than it ought to be through the psychological impact even if no sales are actually made. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who know anything about marketing will understand the penalties that are imposed on a system by such an overhanging threat. We have a distorted market. Why describe it as free? At the moment it is distorted out of our control by influences over which we do not have complete authority. This is from a Government whose Treasurer (Mr Keating) often refers to needing levers to pull and switches to turn on and turn off. To abrogate all opportunity for manipulation-manipulation to our advantage-is an abrogation which is entirely misguided. It is my suggestion that we should be trying to bring orderly marketing and control of this industry to such a point that we can distort the market to suit our needs; in other words, to do what we want to do in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we want the market to do? We want to sell all saleable wool. We want to provide the grower with market signals which will guide the future production of that grower so that we do not form a stockpile of wool which is not in demand. Yet we would still be able to sell the wool-particularly the superfine wool, but the coarser grades as well. We would be able to sell almost 100 per cent of the clip. That is a signal which was unable to be fed back to producers. Of course, they are waking up now. But it is not their fault that it has taken such a long time to make that point to them. Modifications to the reserve price scheme could have achieved such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow an amendment which I will move at the committee stage to try to make the best out of what is offered here-to attempt to shift the financial consequences of these decisions of the Government from the growers back to the Government, where those financial consequences belong. If the Government chooses to make a decision such as this, I believe it should not have the capacity to direct that a section of the community should suffer unduly for that decision having been made. In other words, the amendment which I propose would make the Government wear its own decision. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had thought, in making this decision, that it would have to carry the full cost of it, it might have looked more carefully at other options. My main problem in this regard is that it seems that the other options which were looked at were not imaginative enough. They were stuck in a schedule and were unable to be removed from a very narrow perspective. The decisions were not made with regard to the overall costs that would have to be borne by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems strange that legislation which is so momentous and of such huge importance had to be introduced without due regard for drafting. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills was able to find an anomaly very early. I have been advised that proposed new section 148 (1) (b) at page 4 of the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill can be described as a classic Henry VIII clause which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee always, and quite rightly, objects to. I understand that the coalition has been able to observe that with the little time that has been available. I foreshadow that if an amendment comes forward in regard to that the Australian Democrats will support it. It is annoying that this proposition comes before us in such momentous legislation and that we have to amend it to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when one objects to the general direction and purport of the Bill, it has to be the responsibility of those who are not in government to do the Government's work for it and to correct its legislation to make it work equitably. The amendment which the Democrats will move at the committee stage will attempt to make the best of it for the growers. I only hope that the coalition will join us in that amendment and at least make the Government wear the cost of its own decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991. The effect of this Bill is to suspend the market reserve price that has worked effectively and well for 17 years, providing both the grower and the wool processing industry with a stable base on which to plan and develop. The reserve price scheme was effective because it took the roller-coaster rides out of the industry. When supply moved ahead of demand, there were depressed prices for the grower; when demand moved ahead of supply, there was disaster for the wool production industry. It was effective because it broke up cartels and buying pies that worked against the true price. Even now, the market gets tried on every couple of weeks or so. The overall proof of the scheme's success was that Australia's wool export sales grew from $1.270 billion in 1972-73 to $6 billion in 1988-89, providing in that year 14 per cent of Australia's overseas total exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The market reserve price scheme has its genesis in the Australian Wool Commission Bill, presented to the House of Representatives in 1970 by the then Minister for Primary Industry, Doug Anthony. Approximately two years later, in September, Ian Sinclair introduced the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, which combined the Australian Wool Commission with the Australian Wool Board to form the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). It is interesting to read those speeches. In Doug Anthony's address to Parliament he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government decided that no qualitative or financial limits should be placed on the amount of wool which could be purchased and held by the Commission as such a limitation could adversely affect the operations of the Commission. For example, to declare and publish a fixed limit to the level of stocks which the Commission would be permitted to hold could lead to the embarrassing pressure on the Commission as stocks approached-or were thought by buyers to be approaching-the fixed limits. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement by Doug Anthony showed a belief in the industry and a commitment to the scheme, unlike the wimpish lack of support that the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has given the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote Mr Duthie, the Labor member in 1970 who spoke on that legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been collusion at the auction for years. We have studied the pie system and we have proved it to be so. It has kept the price of wool down, there is no competition. There are fewer and fewer buyers attending the wool sales. This has emasculated the auction system. </PARA>
<PARA>Those statements were made in 1970 and I fear they are just as relevant today as they were then. </PARA>
<PARA> A former Attorney-General, Mr Hughes, said that the Australian trade practices legislation would protect Australian woolgrowers from collusion. In view of the statements by Professor Baxt, the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, that Australia had the weakest antitrust legislation in any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nation, I have grave doubts that the assurances Mr Hughes gave will be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to outline briefly the ups and downs in the market that have taken place over the last six years. In order to understand the implications of this Bill-the removal of the floor price as from the commencement of sales on 25 February-it is important to have a brief summary of what has actually happened to the industry over the last seven or eight years. In 1984, the price of wool rose because of a number of factors: the depreciation of the dollar against other currencies; in 1983, the International Wool Secretariat had a wonderfully successful promotion of cool wool, driving demand ahead of supply-no-one was condemning the floor price then; all the free marketeers were happy to cop it sweet and the Stoeckels and Maple-Browns of this world were raking the money in-the international consumer economies were booming and moving; and in 1988 the central Government in Beijing relaxed restrictions on the provinces, allowing the market to rise, pushing wool up to an almost unsatisfiable demand and pushing the price up to 1,250c. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that every Chinese received a woollen suit. I cannot verify that but, in response to the high demand, the Wool Corporation tried to steady the price by running down all its stocks. Wool was so popular then that even that would not dampen the price. Every person in the industry, the AWC, the Wool Council, the Government and the commentators believed that the 870c was sustainable. At that time, the AWC reserves amounted to $1.8 billion. As always happens in primary industry, every boom has a bust; every high has a low. We all realise that primary industries are cyclical but no-one could believe the run of outs that hit the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1988-89 season the market rose to 840 million kilograms; in the 1989-90 season the market dropped to 600 million kilograms; and this season it is down to around 400 million to 500 million kilograms. That is a catastrophe not only for the woolgrower but for Australia as a whole as it is going to affect the whole of our economic system. Wool export earnings fell from the 1988-89 season to the 1989-90 season by $2 billion-from $6 billion to $3.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry was king hit not once but five times. The Chinese withdrawal from the market because of international problems and the Tiananmen Square incident cost the market 80 million kilograms a year. The internal restructure of the Russian economy, moving into a free market, cost 90 million kilograms in 1989. Those two incidents alone reduced sales by 20 per cent. Another factor was the loss of the Middle East sheep trade in 1983. Australia was shipping seven million sheep into that market. The loss of that market allowed 35 million kilograms of wool to come onto the market every year. </PARA>
<PARA> But probably the greatest king hit of all was Mr Kerin's eroding of the floor price last April and May, and probably earlier than that. I sat in Parliament during that time and witnessed the tactics which the Minister used. I say that they were not Marquess of Queensberry tactics; they were goanna tactics. People in the bush were bewildered by them. </PARA>
<PARA> After providing Australia with exports earning $5.811 billion in 1987-88, or 14.3 per cent of total export earnings, and $6 billion in the 1988-89 season, the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council had the right to expect some support from the Government when the inevitable happened and there was a downturn in the season. But they never got that support. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy launched his attack on the wool industry, the score stood at: AWC stocks, 2.5 million bales; growers' equity, 69 per cent; AWC borrowings, $789m; Government borrowings, nil; trade buying between 60, 70 and 80 per cent. But the Minister had made up his mind. He had received his riding instructions from Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) and Mr Keating that the price was set too high and had to be reduced to get wool moving again. The stocks were up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy was hurting and the cash register had to start ringing. We were going to have a fire sale-not of the Government's assets but the farmers' and woolgrowers' assets. Mr Kerin's tactics were to brief the press to leak stories that the price could not be sustained. There was the odd remark at a door stop-it was a case of a nod being as good as a wink to a blind man. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the confidence in the floor was eroding. The Corporation was buying more and the trade less. It was John Kerin's non-commitment to the floor price scheme at a press conference on 10 May last year that sent panic into the market and sent clear signals to the buyers to keep out or get burnt.</PARA>
<PARA> After that press conference Mr Kerin hit the headlines of every paper in Australia. Let me quote some of them. The Australian Financial Review carried the headline `Wool Mountain Unravels-Price Stability'. Other headlines were: `Kerin Queries Wool-View Gloomy'; `Foreign Buyer Warns of Wool Price Disaster'; `Kerin Attacks Industry Chief Over Wool Crisis'; `Wool Crisis-750 Million Bales-No Buyers'. The Canberra Times carried the headline `Kerin Makes it Clear that the Wool Industry is in Deep Trouble'. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a guerilla attack on the great Australian wool industry and Mr Kerin should be condemned for it. At a time when this great Australian industry needed help, support and confidence, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy put the boot into it. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 May last year in the House of Representatives the Minister answered three questions from Labor backbenchers. No doubt these questions were written in Mr Kerin's office and were designed to denigrate and once again undermine the floor price. The press conference, the answers to the questions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate-and Senator Cook played his part in this chamber-leaked stories and press briefings all undermined the 870c floor. Buyers treated the wool auction as though it was the source of the plague. They stayed away in droves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation was forced into buying between 70 and 80 per cent of the clip. Before Mr Kerin's intervention the AWC was buying 20 per cent and the trade 80 per cent. The number of bales in stock climbed from 2.5 million to 3.1 million; growers' equity fell from 69 or 68 per cent to around 46 per cent; and AWC's borrowings rose $789m to $1.018 billion. The writing was on the wall for the 870c floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 May Mr Kerin announced that the floor price would be reduced from 870c to 700c. This was done one month before the selling season ceased, forcing the AWC to buy wool at 870c and sell it at 700c. That little episode cost the woolgrowers $500m in one month alone. That is how much their stocks were depreciated and how much equity they lost. That action mortally wounded the minimum reserve price; it very seriously wounded the wool industry as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Corporation was then forced to increase purchasing from the 30 per cent levels of the pre-Easter sales up to 90 per cent levels in June. So what started out to be a fire sale turned around and bit the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. In the past nine months, with the floor price set at 700c, we have not sold any more wool. But the industry has plunged deeper and deeper into debt. AWC stocks went up, the borrowings went up and growers' equity went down. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin's undermining of the floor price was wrong and went against all the advice the industry gave. The woolgrowers pleaded with him not to alter the floor. The wool exporters sent deputations to Canberra pointing out the dangers to our overseas customers. We actually bankrupted about three of them. The spinners, weavers and cloth makers wrote to Mr Kerin explaining what the consequence of his actions would be. The Wool Corporation offered him advice, and that advice was not to lower the floor because it would stampede the market. The industry knew the market philosophy but Mr Kerin chose to ignore it. Instead, he took his advice from ABARE and the economists and totally rejected any industry advice. </PARA>
<PARA> If he had gone to the industry, the Wool Corporation or the Wool Council and sat down with them and explained that he could see difficulties in the future, I think there would have been a response. But even if there had not been, he could have walked away. Mr Kerin may have gone through the motions of having meetings and discussions on many occasions but it was always his intention to alter and drop the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> If the industry's advice had been taken and sales did not pick up and the floor eventually crashed, as it has, Mr Kerin could have done a Pontius Pilate -he could have washed his hands of it, walked away and said, `It is not my fault. Be it on your head'. He could have walked away, exonerated. But that did not happen. Mr Kerin ignored all the advice and he now has to wear the consequences of his action. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 May Mr Kerin announced that the floor price would drop from 870c to 700c. He then guaranteed that the price for the remainder of the 1990-91 and 1991-92 season would remain at 700c. On 11 occasions, the Minister reassured both the growers and the buyers that the price was locked in at 700c. To describe that action, he used words such as `immutable', `rock solid', `cast iron' and `guaranteed'. That is the strongest support any Minister could have offered the floor price. Graziers made financial commitments on that assurance. They had done their budgets; they had been to their bank managers. The market responded to Mr Kerin's promise. Farmers have now found themselves financially disadvantaged. On Monday 11 February the announcement was made that the floor price was suspended. </PARA>
<PARA> That action has caused Australia tremendous embarrassment throughout our trading nations. Will we ever be able to hold our heads up in any overseas forums? When we go into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will anyone take this nation seriously? We are a laughing stock. After so many commitments and promises, Mr Kerin did a 180 degree turn and went back on his word. That is not John Kerin's word, that is the word of this Government of Australia that he treated in such a cavalier fashion. Mr Kerin has got to accept a lot of the responsibility, but not all. After criticising him, I do commend him for going to Russia and extending credit. I must say that after that trip things began to look up; sales began to take off. Again, confidence seemed to be coming back into the market. But for a number of reasons, we lost it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vines committee to investigate wool industry arrangements had one member openly asking how much people were prepared to pay. Fancy a salesman going out and asking what someone would offer to pay for a product. That was confirmed yesterday when the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) in the House of Representatives raised the issue with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy at Question Time. The Minister responded that he was aware and approved of the committee's canvassing the hypothetical 500c floor price. In a skittish and explosive market, once again this frightened the buyers off. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) to European and British newspapers added insecurity to an already shaky market. Mr Campbell does not carry a lot of weight around here. In fact, he is considered to be something of a joke around the Parliament-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said he was a lightweight and a bit of a joke. But he claimed to be a member of the Government. People overseas do not understand our political system. Then there was the failure of Russia to return to the market after a $400m extension of credit. Then we had to have the free marketeers, the Stoeckel and Maple-Brown report. They could not get in front of a television camera fast enough. They were given sufficient press coverage to frighten the market away again. When all these events happened we were right back to go, with the AWC buying up to 70 per cent and 80 per cent again. The position at present with the cessation of sales is that 4.8 million bales are stockpiled. Government borrowings are fluctuating between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, and growers' equity is down to between 34 per cent and 36 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry is now facing a desperate position and it is going to require skills, patience and tolerance on all sides to come out of this with as little damage as possible. With a crisis such as this, there is always a tendency for everyone to blame everyone else. That is not going to help. The Government has introduced legislation that I believe is going somewhere to helping the industry, but in my opinion the Bill we are debating puts an ever increasing debt on an ever decreasing number of growers. It has to be recognised that there are going to be casualties in the wool industry. The established grower with no debt will survive. Young people building their properties up will be in diabolical trouble. Farmers and growers who have been through drought will also be in trouble. Already land values in Queensland have come back between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, reducing the equity of the property owner below what is acceptable to his bank manager. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kerin proposal gives $300m supplementary payments with a guarantee to the AWC to increase borrowings to another $500m, and to pay the growers up to 700c, which was promised by Mr Kerin for the 1991 and also the 1992 seasons. The Wool Corporation has borrowed money to pay up to 700c for wool that has already come to the auction, until the suspension of sales. The remaining growers who have not auctioned their wool this year are entitled to some equity. Most of the remainder of the growers traditionally come from Queensland, which shears in the second half of the year. Estimates are that there are a further 2.5 million bales either waiting at auction for the recommencement of sales or to come in before the season. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Kerin proposal, if the price at auction reaches 500c, the AWC would have to borrow $592m less the $300m that is a supplementary payment, making a total of $282m. At 400c, the borrowings would have to be $588m. At 300c, borrowings have to go to $900m. The Minister has come to realise now that his $300m supplementary payments and his additional $500m with the extended overdraft to the AWC may not be sufficient to extend the 700c to the wool yet to be auctioned. So he has come up with a further plan-I think it has to go that way-which sets a benchmark and if the wool price does not reach the benchmark the difference is paid between the benchmark and the 700c. It is a difficult plan but I can see it has to go that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional borrowings of $500m, which takes the Wool Corporation total debt to $3.5 billion, will burden the industry with a debt that is going to require higher taxes on lower prices and fewer growers as the casualties take place and people move away from the wool industry. That is hard to accept. In effect, if the borrowings are allowed to blow out to $3.5 billion and the floor price falls to 300c, it is going to require a tax of 41 per cent to fund those borrowings, and we are going to weaken the strong to protect the weak to make sure the weak get the 700c; I think everyone ends up in a weaker position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to allow borrowings to escalate beyond the capacity of growers to pay. But I am equally convinced that the Government is culpable in the whole sorry mess, as I have said before. The Government's decision on 31 May last year to reduce the floor price from 870c to 700c one month before the season forced the AWC to buy wool at 870c and sell it for 700c. That cost the industry between $600m and $500m. That was a Government decision. It made it. It forced it on the industry. It should therefore compensate the industry for the decision to lift the supplementary payments to $500m. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot force growers to pay for another $500m. That $500m loss is clearly a Government decision. The $500m and the $200m borrowings would go some way to compensating growers, and I believe it is the least the Government can do. I have grave reservations about section 147 of the Bill which gives the Minister the power to replace the AWC board with a new board of administrators. That strikes fear into the hearts of woolgrowers. They want a say in their industry; they have paid for it; they are terrified the Minister might appoint someone with no sympathy or understanding of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of the floor price, let there be no misunderstanding. The 700c floor price is finished and growers face an open market on the resumption of sales. But I cannot bring myself to vote for the dismantling of a structure that has served the wool industry so faithfully and well. In 1988 it was a different story. The accolades for the minimum reserve price were unanimous from all sections of the industry, the Government and all other commentators. Not only the wool industry benefited but also the Australian economy as a whole, providing jobs and prosperity for 650,000 people connected with the industry. Who knows what the future holds. I am not prepared to throw the baby out with the bath water and therefore I cannot support the abolishment of the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry faces difficult times. Woolgrowers' incomes will be cut drastically. Their incomes will average a negative $5,700 and will stay around that level for at least two years. There will be a downturn in the whole Australian economy, driving it down further than it is already. The small regional centres are going to be affected as farmers tighten their belts and spend nothing. All sectors of the Australian industry and economy are going to feel the repercussions of this. The loss of export sales and buying power generated by the wool and wheat industries is going to be felt right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now up to all Australians to get behind this the greatest of all Australian industries. I have confidence in the product that the wool industry produces, and I have greater confidence in the men and women who make up that industry. I know that they will come through. Australia needs them and it needs the contribution that this industry makes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991 with a certain amount of emotion and a lot of feeling. I am a woolgrower and have been all my life, as I have said in this place before, not only in terms of producing that wool but also in terms of being involved in the shearing industry and other aspects of woolgrowing. This is indeed a sad and emotional day for me. It was wheat quotas and the collapse of wool marketing in 1969-70 that were the reasons for my getting involved in agro-politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leading up to this day I have spent many hours both thinking and researching what was the best solution to the current problem. I was doing this against a background of being not only a supporter of the reserve price scheme but also, unashamedly, a vigorous defender. In wrestling with this problem I came to the conclusion that in the final analysis the decision had to be one that allowed the maximum number of woolgrowers to survive and be with us in five years time. As well as talking about all woolgrowers in both Western Australia and Australia generally, I am also talking about my neighbours and my friends-people that I met in the early 1960s when we went to a place called Jerdacuttup on the south-east coast of Western Australia to open up new land under the conditional purchase scheme. Above all, I want as many of these people as possible to survive this disaster-and it is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an issue where we have to lift ourselves above politics because we are talking about the industry that has produced more export dollars for this country than any other in any 10-year period we care to nominate. I appeal to those on the other side of this chamber to put prejudiced thoughts behind them and get on with the job of sorting out the best way of handling this disaster. Our objective must be to put the industry back on the top of the tree. Having said that, we must analyse where we went wrong. The Wool Council of Australia, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), must shoulder most of the blame, but I doubt whether any of us in this place or in the other place is totally free of blame in terms of not speaking out more loudly and more vigorously against what became obvious some 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past 12 months, the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation have gone along with blind faith that the world would come back and buy our wool regardless of price. The responsible Minister has followed along behind them like a little lap-dog. With the amendments that were made in 1987 to the then Wool Industry Act, which took the discipline out of the reporting process and the financial controls required, the reserve price scheme became a market price centre and ceased to be a price support scheme. We in fact said to the rest of the world, `Pay the price we demand or we will lock it up'. We have in fact behaved like a hoarder of antiques. I seek leave to have section 41 of the Wool Marketing Act 1987 incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> (b) if, in respect of any wool submitted for sale at auction in accordance with any such arrangements, a bid equal to or greater than the appropriate reserve price determined by the Corporation is not made, the Corporation is prepared to buy the wool at the appropriate reserve price so determined; and</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let it be a lesson to us all. Since that time we have had two massive jumps in the reserve price and created a situation whereby the only way to keep the scheme operating was an ever-spiralling tax regime and an ever-growing stockpile of wool. On 1 July last year a decision was made in good faith. The reserve price was lowered from 870c to 700c, but I have to say that at that time I did not agree with the decision. From that point, the world's wool buyers, many of whom were hurt badly by that decision, said, `We don't trust you any more'. The fact we have to face is that the reserve price went too high. It became a market price centre and the industry could not afford the costs of it any more. The reality that was not faced was that under this scheme farmers and graziers were going to go on producing more and more wool to the point where we were producing two million bales a year more than our average sales had been over the last 10 years. At the price that was set, there was no opportunity for wool to compete effectively against other fibres. There was little opportunity for development of additional uses for the product, particularly in the area of blends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the announcement of the suspension of sales in late January, the reserve price was effectively finished. The world did not believe, nor did it have faith, that we would not endeavour to fiddle with the reserve price and it could come back into the marketplace and buy with confidence. The real criticism that I have of the Minister in all of this is that he allowed the scheme to go to a level where it was effectively bankrupt and had to cancel wool sales because of lack of finance. For the Government to have guaranteed $2.8 billion of borrowings and not know the precise status of that money is deplorable. If it is good enough for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to say that the South Australian Treasurer should have been keeping a watching brief on the finances of the State Bank of South Australia, then certainly both he and Minister Kerin should have been on top of the financial situation as it pertained to the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that, since the scheme was put in place and until recent events, the highest levels of the stockpile have been in 1974-75, with 1,600,016 bales, and at the end of the 1983-84 season, with 1,233,000 bales. We surpassed those figures approximately 12 months ago. At that time I personally gave warnings to the wool industry that the time to move to correct the problem was then. I regret very much that I did not pursue that much more vigorously. I accept, quite readily, part of the blame for that. The situation was obvious, and I should have fought a bit harder, as should have many other people. It is now history. We did not move to correct the oversupply situation, nor sell more wool, either by forward sales by the use of credit or any other mechanism that may have been available. In terms of marketing and promotion of the wool industry, one can say that it has been quite deplorable. We just sat back and thought that the rest of the world would front up. We also did not address the issue of price. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry's leadership's solution was to have an ever-increasing taxing regime. In other words, what was being created was, in effect, a dog chasing its tail. First of all it was a proposed tax of 25 per cent, which the Minister rejected with our support. Then it became a 20 per cent maximum tax set at 18 per cent. It was then raised to 25 per cent during the season. Is it any wonder that confidence was lost? Even the industry itself did not know where it was going. This created enormous inequity between producers. The crisis in the industry continued to grow and the answer became to increase the maximum tax regime to 50 per cent and quotas. This would never work because we cannot instantly stop sheep from growing wool. We might be able to decide not to plant a crop, but if we have sheep out in the paddock we cannot stop them from growing wool. </PARA>
<PARA> It was at this point that the Opposition, we on this side of the chamber, began to differ markedly from the Government's approach. We rejected quotas outright, said that supply and demand had to be brought into line and suggested that the commercial flock adjustment scheme should be implemented immediately. Instead, the Government and the Australian Democrats passed legislation for increased taxing and gave notice that a quota system was the way to go. In my view, that was the last opportunity that the Wool Corporation had to save the reserve price scheme, and that could be done only by selling more wool and having a major flock reduction scheme, not a quota scheme. Even so, the limited scheme that was put in place did account for close to 10 million sheep at an average cost of approximately $3.70. Had we put a commercial scheme in place, I have no doubt that it would have gone a long way to addressing the oversupply problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In going into a free marketplace even in the current situation we still have potentially massive oversupply, particularly when we look at the problems in our traditional markets such as eastern Europe and Russia. I suggest that a commercial slaughter scheme should stay very high on the agenda. I know it was unpalatable but nonetheless it was the most humane way to go in order to maximise the number of farmers staying in the industry and, at the same time, keep a reserve price in place and keep wool at the top of the tree as an export earner. Today we are faced with a stockpile with a value that is close to $5m and a debt that is close to $3 billion. I welcome the Government's decision to provide $300m to assist the Australian Wool Corporation to provide equity to growers who have yet to sell this season. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I cannot support giving the Wool Corporation what is virtually an open cheque by lifting the borrowings of the Corporation to $3.5 billion. I believe that is fiscal irresponsibility. I support wholeheartedly the position of the Opposition in respect of putting a cap on the total payout under the deficiency payments scheme. Any shortfall between the market price and the 700c should be met by the sale of assets of the Corporation and a substantial reduction in the overheads of the Corporation. The potential should be there to do this. The AWC will have a very reduced role in terms of staffing and other aspects of expenditure required. </PARA>
<PARA> I support aspects of the Bill other than the amendments moved by the coalition, particularly in relation to section 148 (2). I cannot agree in principle that a Minister should have the power to amend any provision of this Act or, for that matter any other Act, by regulation. I do not know whether this has been done before but it would set what I would term a dangerous precedent. If amendments need to be made to Acts, those Acts should be brought back to this Parliament. In fact I think it is absolutely outrageous that this should even be in the Bill before us now. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the three very important challenges we have before us. In doing that, it is important that we turn our minds to the best way of resolving these problems and challenges. The first challenge concerns the management of the stockpile. This must be frozen for at least 12 months and a strategy worked out on its management and proper release into the marketplace. It would be an absolute disaster in terms of the recovery period in front of us-allowing the world to adjust to a new marketing situation-even to contemplate releasing that wool. That must be at least 12 months in the future. Some so-called experts-and I have some doubts about the experts who have advised the wool industry in recent years-have suggested it could even be a period of two or three years. In this respect, I appeal to Mr Kerin to utilise the expertise on this side of the chamber when working out the mechanism so that every pearl of wisdom can be contributed to the final decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue which needs addressing immediately is the mechanism by which deficiency payments will be made. The payments must be fair and must go only to bone fide wool producers who normally sell wool during this period and they must be processed as quickly as possible. The draft proposals I have seen floating around in recent days have holes large enough to drive a truck through. It is very complicated and if they are not handled carefully we could have the situation where there could be collusion between buyers, and between buyers and growers, to take unfair advantage of the payments. It is important that this problem be addressed. The most important thing is to keep it simple because simplicity is the surest way to ensure fairness. Some of the formulas and documents I have looked at have been hard to follow. Indeed, I have yet to find anybody who understands precisely what they mean. When growers' figures are put into them, they end up being almost impossible to determine. </PARA>
<PARA> I have serious reservations about our performance in terms of marketing. For example, America is one of the largest users, if not the largest user, of apparel fibre. According to the figures, America's consumption of wool, particularly Australian wool, has not changed very much over the past decade. In view of our relationship with the United States, why have we not been marketing and promoting wool more in the American marketplace? Why have we not been promoting Australian wool? While I do not object to or knock the promotion of generic wool, why not promote Australian wool? Russia, China and the countries of eastern Europe have been significant users of our wool in recent years. I know, as does everyone else, that they have significant economic problems. These problems have interfered with their ability to operate in the marketplace and have contributed significantly to our problems. However, they are traditional buyers of our products and we should get in there and market the product and come to some arrangement on how the product will be handled. Why have we been storing wool at a cost of $300 a bale every two years? Why were we not using that $300 to invest in these wool industries and keep them operating? It would have made more sense had we invested that $300 in the pipeline and got something out of it at the other end instead of paying it to warehouses and to banks in interest and creating enormous storage problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's trip to eastern Europe and Russia last year was welcome, but it should have occurred at least six to nine months earlier. The problem was with us then. Unfortunately the unequivocal guarantee that the 700c would remain was given at that time and nobody believed it. It would have been better with hindsight-I know it is hindsight now-had none of that been said. We must get back into Europe and win back the confidence of the buyers, the traditional users of Australian wool, which is the best wool in the world. The buyers of Europe were certainly hurt more than the other part of the industry with the drop from 870c to 700c because they were buying our wool at that time and they had our wool in the pipeline. I believe we must look at some way by which we can assist these buyers to overcome their losses. It seems to me that, when we have the sort of stockpile of wool we have today, we must come to some arrangement with them in order to win back their confidence and get them back to their traditional way of not only buying our wool but also of using, promoting and selling the finished product. </PARA>
<PARA> We must win back the confidence of the Japanese. I know many of us do not have much sympathy for the antics of the Japanese in a number of areas, but nonetheless the Japanese market is very important to us. It is important that we encourage the Japanese to buy wool. It is also important to get it into China and utilise the facilities of its mills. We have an enormous task in front of us. We should leave no stone unturned in our efforts to get Australian wool into every fibre processing plant in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointless to suspend the reserve price at this time. It will create continuing uncertainty and lack of confidence, such as the lack of confidence which has beset this industry during recent times. As I said earlier in my speech, not only did I support the reserve price scheme but I was also a vigorous defender of it. It has certainly given me much pain to come to this conclusion. I do not believe that in the current situation we can afford to leave it in place because it will just create suspicion that will not go away until the decision is made. I cannot agree to allowing the Wool Corporation's debt to blow out and out. By doing that, we would not only place a horrendous tax burden on producers, including myself, but we would also be mortgaging the children of future woolgrowers. I think that, when we make decisions in this place today, we should think about that debt and about the individuals who are the future woolgrowers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the start of my comments, this is a very sad and difficult day for me as a woolgrower. It is also a very difficult day for the constituents that I know so well in Western Australia and the rest of Australia. I have listened to the debate; I have seen the emotion. In the last 25 or 26 meetings I have been to I have seen grown men cry, and it certainly has been a very draining experience. I hope I never have to go through it again. </PARA>
<PARA> I make an appeal, albeit an emotional appeal at this stage: the time has come for us to put our differences behind us and to recognise the situation we are in with the people involved in the shearing industry-the rouseabouts. When I go back home-I am sure this is occurring all over Australia-I am going to find it very difficult to tell these people, including one shearer who has worked for me for 17 years and another who has worked for me for 14 years, that we are going to do our own crutching in a crutching cradle because we cannot afford to pay them. That is when one gets down to the human face of what has happened in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the people who share most of the blame-the Minister and members of the board of the Corporation and the Wool Council-will now put their differences behind them, take away some of their blind faith, get out into the world and create a situation where our product can survive. It not only affects us as wool growers, but it also affects the shearers, the crutchers and the people who work in the sheds, the wool stores and a whole host of people in other areas who are directly or indirectly reliant on the wool industry. The industry and the individuals in it are too important for us to continue to attempt to solve this problem through the press. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991. It is not an easy debate for me to participate in as a farmer, a National Party senator, a member of the New South Wales Farmers Association or just an ordinary Australian. A number of conflicting views, opinions, options and solutions have been proffered in this debate. There is a wide divergence of views in the industry, on what growers should do and on what the Parliament should do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can only say that the conclusions I have reached on the industry and the decisions my colleagues in the other place have made and spoken about yesterday have been arrived at after considerable contemplation, much discussion with growers, and considerable reading of charts, figures, forecasts and predictions. I do not for one minute suggest that I get any joy from standing here and saying that I support the abandonment of the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme has served the growers well for many years. I can recall its introduction, although I was not in Parliament at that time, and I remember well the chaos and the financial dilemma that the wool industry was in prior to its introduction. I congratulate the Sir William Gunns and the Ron Hunters for their contribution to the industry at that time and the arguments they faced in setting up the scheme, because the wool industry was very divided when that scheme was set up. I also congratulate the Doug Anthonys for what they did at that time. It has served us very well. But times change, and in these uncertain economic times and changing world conditions, no industry can afford to remain static- least of all the rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Who would have thought, for example, that wheat growers today would be facing such falls in the price of wheat. Only 12 months ago our markets, particularly in the Middle East, looked secure and were growing. Twelve months on, we have world overproduction, an international conflict in Iraq and a trade war being engaged between the European Community and America, and Australian wheat growers are the innocent victims in the side-slashing of that. </PARA>
<PARA> For those of us in the National Party, this issue is just that much more personal, and Senator Crane made reference to it a minute ago. Not only are our constituents wool growers, but many of our friends, families and relatives are wool growers. It is especially hard for me and my colleagues to stand here and say to those people-I have come to this realisation- `Your industry is in a mess. The floor price is finished and has to stay finished. You have a massive debt and you have to trade your way out of it. You can't rely on the Australian taxpayer to do it for you.'</PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that what we as legislators do with this legislation ensures that the industry gets back on its feet quickly and that appropriate marketing strategies are adopted. I am critical of this legislation in that it does not provide that desperately needed confidence and direction for the industry and that is why the Opposition amendments must be included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry must know where it is going and what costs it faces. The open-ended arrangements provided by this legislation are not appropriate. They will do nothing to provide answers to growers who do not know what is happening to their industry-when they will sell their wool, or how much they will get for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Our goal must be to settle the wool market as quickly as we can, so that the sales can resume; so that buyers will return to the market confident that the prices they pay are not likely to be devalued next week or next month. While I regret that the reserve price scheme is finished, I have to support moves to ensure that the messages that go through are firmly conveyed to the industry-to the buyers and to the growers, the producers. We must get stability back. We must increase demand and get production back in line with that demand. That cannot happen while growers live in confusion and buyers are too nervous to enter the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking back over the industry and the history of wool, it is interesting and important-as others have already done-to acknowledge that unlike any other industry, wool has been Australia's shining knight. Australians have ridden on the back of the wool industry for a long time. The industry has seen both good times and bad. Wool is one commodity we grow better than anyone else in the world. But it is no good growing it if we do not have consumers using it. We have to sell it to get the consumers to use it. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the history of the reserve price scheme, it is interesting to read what the right honourable Ian Sinclair, the former Minister for Primary Industry, had to say last night in the other place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme I introduced was not one that set a market price. It was a scheme that was designed as a potholing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In hindsight, if we are to consider when the system got out of kilter, it may well be when the reserve price scheme stopped being a potholer and began to be relied on as a price setter; it became a price support mechanism. I will quote again what the right honourable Ian Sinclair said in the other place last night. He was talking about what happened to the scheme he started off in 1972 and what happened in 1987. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is fascinating that for so long it proved so successful until the Minister changed the requirement of consultation with Treasury, removed ministerial control over the setting of the floor price and removed the requirement that the comparability of the wool price with that of other fibres be taken as a criterion in determining the market floor.</PARA>
<PARA>How and why the changes to that legislation came about is open to conjecture. That removed the ministerial controls which applied in the original 1972 Act. Certainly, it has been a big contributing factor to the problems that we have in the industry at the moment. What started as a policy of minimum price, kept by the Government well below the market level to serve as a safety net in case of sudden market dips, was changed by the Australian Wool Corporation to a policy of price maximisation. In making that change, the Corporation and the industry failed to remember the basic principle of marketing: something is worth only what someone is willing to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the glorious, heady days of the 870c floor, when middle micron wools were making well in excess of that, market signals were ignored, and any of us who were in the industry at the time have to admit that. Naturally, growers increased their production to take advantage of the increase in the floor. I do not think they can really be blamed for that. Neither can they be entirely blamed for not listening to early warning signals. We must remember that 18 months ago the industry had no stockpile to speak of. The turnaround came very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> There were people trying to tell the industry that all was not well. The former Wool Corporation Chairman, David Asimus, warned of potential consumer reaction to the increased floor. He even suggested how long that resistance would take to manifest itself in sales. I am sure that he takes no joy today in knowing that he was right at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, added to the industry's difficulties were the actions of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who dallied with the industry last year when rumours first started to circulate about the floor price. The statements he made then and has made since have done irreparable damage to the industry. He will be long remembered for his statement last year at the time the floor was lowered to 700c. He said then, and has repeated frequently since:</PARA>
<PARA>My clear message to the market is that 700c is immutable. The next time the floor price is changed it will be upward.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that in May of last year and has repeated it frequently. He also said in June last year that the Vines inquiry into wool pricing policy would not affect the reserve price. We all now know that this legislation was precipitated by the Vines committee, which-it has been confirmed by the Minister himself-spoke to our European buyers earlier this year about the possibility of the floor price being dropped to 500c. For an industry marketing system that survives on confidence, that was sufficient to send the already nervous buyers out of the market again. What a pity it is that tonight and yesterday we did not have the benefit of the Vines committee report before this debate started. What a pity it is not coming out until the end of March. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the stockpile started to grow and today the industry faces a stockpile of some 4.7 million bales of wool, a mountain of wool, with a debt of just under $3 billion and the prospect of a blow-out to $4 billion by the end of the selling season. Figures and advice provided to the members of the National Party and the Liberal Party suggest that this situation cannot continue and ought not to be allowed to continue, despite the growers' desires to keep the status quo. Under the existing reserve price and tax scheme there was no affordable way around the problem. There was no way that I, as a member of the Australian Parliament, would allow the Australian woolgrowers to be saddled with more and more debt. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been irresponsible in the extreme to allow the Corporation to continue to amass such a debt. I remind the Senate that there are still 2.5 million bales to be sold before the end of this season, and, of course, the normal demand for the wool in that time is only 1.4 million bales of wool. I can see horrendous problems in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, it would be irresponsible for this Parliament to allow this legislation to pass without providing a cap on the size of the debt that can be accrued. As I said, I think we would be very irresponsible to allow, as Senator Crane said, the mortgaging of our children-the future woolgrowers. It has been suggested that the assets of the Wool Corporation could be raided to meet the debt. While the Corporation cannot remain blameless and must accept responsibility for some of the industry's problems, we cannot allow the Corporation to be dismantled, although, if it is in the best interests of the industry, there could be a rationalisation of the assets and other cost cuttings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation provides a range of valuable services to the wool industry and in the years to come the industry will need those services. It will need help to restructure and rebuild its reputation, and the services that the Wool Corporation provides are going to be invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read the criticisms made by the Wool Council about the Opposition parties. While I accept that it is the Council's right to make such criticisms, I am saddened that its members have not the same courage that I believe we have in the National and Liberal parties to take the hard decisions, to face the realities-bitter and unpalatable as they are-and also to accept their share of the blame, because they too are in part to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall last year, when there was so much confusion and so little known about what was going on, that the Wool Council did not communicate with its members particularly well and it did not communicate very well with the Opposition. Maybe the Government was also not particularly well communicated with. I just quote from some points that Mr Lloyd, the shadow Minister for primary industry, made in the other place last night. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The real point is that the National Party is, as it was then, in existence to represent country people, regional people, and particularly-as far as I am concerned-those people who make their living from the land. At all times we have to be aware of what is the best policy for those people. As we have at times indicated that things should be done for those people, equally we have a responsibility to be honest and, if what is in place is no longer to their advantage, say so. And we did, believing that in the medium term and the longer term, with the scheme not sustainable, wool growers would be better off with the removal of the floor price. That is a very grave statement to make, but on the evidence available to me and to others I believe that is an undisputable fact. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that he summed up the position very well. We now have to look to the future. Rather than spend the next few weeks and months looking for scapegoats and apportioning blame, it is vital that the industry works together to get back on track. </PARA>
<PARA> At the recent rally outside Parliament House growers and their leaders urged a return of confidence to the market and a resumption of wool sales. We in the National Party and Liberal Party believe that our actions will provide that. Sales must resume. We still have too many bales to sell and time is running out. Sales must start again, but they must be allowed to be conducted in a confident and stable market. There are 18 weeks of sales left, with 140,000-odd bales a week, but that can and will happen only if we give clear and unambiguous signals to the industry, to both growers and buyers, that the legislation we are putting in place today is precise and immutable. That is what the Minister, Mr Kerin, cannot give. He is saying to the industry that we shall let the floor price not be on for a little while, but he does not say whether it will come back on, or if it does come back on at what price. For people to have confidence, we have to say that it has gone for the moment. Buyers can purchase knowing that they will not be undercut. Somebody who wants to pay a little less will not get the product; but if somebody pays a little more he will get the wool. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that the stockpile be frozen for 12 months and disposed of in an orderly and predictable manner according to specified legislation. That is the immediate problem facing the industry. The next problem to be faced is to get production back more in line with demand. We have too many sheep in the country. Some commentators suggest that we have as many as 50 million sheep too many. We have 76,000 growers, 22,000 of whom are specialist woolgrowers owning 175 million sheep. Clearly the wool market cannot sustain that level of production. We need to reduce our wool clip, and that is obvious, but how we do that is not so obvious. Every grower must play a part. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Federal Government will account for some reduction by the mere fact that some growers will be forced off their lands by banks, by the sheer impossibility of trying to live on negative incomes. In the estimation of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, some 25 per cent of woolgrowers are `under stress'. Mr Hugh Beggs, the Chairman of the Corporation, puts the figure as high as between 30,000 and 40,000. I only hope that in that eventuality the rural adjustment and assistance measures are adequate to meet the demand, and they must be. I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the last few weeks asking for assistance for people who wish to defer their tax payments on previous years. I want to ensure that people are not penalised in their quarterly payments of provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Last year on the wool tax Bills I proposed a slaughter-cull scheme. It is unpalatable, but it is still the best option for reducing our flock. There are still too many old ewes being bred and they need to be got out of the system. I give my commitment to people in the industry on the question of rural adjustment and rural assistance, to people who need counselling and to those affected by this Government's changes to the wool industry that have been brought about by knocking industry confidence in the past year or so. </PARA>
<PARA> The third problem that must be addressed is how best to get wool industry compensation. The Australian Council of Wool Buyers has called for an emergency meeting of world wool industry leaders to be convened in Australia to allow the industry at least to put its views on recent events in Australia. We tend to forget that buyers, too, have been hurt and misled. Let us not forget that last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy toured the world saying that the 700c floor price was immutable. </PARA>
<PARA> We tend to forget that there are people on the other side of the industry. It will be a long time before international wool buyers and indeed commodity buyers can trust the word of the Australian Government. We need to redress that lack of trust and to try in some measure to restore Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier. People in the Japanese industry are very concerned, we know that the Italian wool industry is very concerned, and there are other buyers around the world who must be considered. Any industry has to have a bit in it for the producer, the person who mills the fibre, the person who wants to get the commodity at a competitive price with other fibres. People are in this industry together-the growers, the people in the middle industry and the people who are in end industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I had the opportunity to meet Mr Bud Leventhal, the President of Burlington Industries, which is widely acknowledged as one of the world's largest textile manufacturers; it employs 6,000 people. I met him at a time when there was much speculation in Australia about the future of the reserve price scheme. He told me that as a buyer he did not really care what the price was just so long as he had continuity of supply and stability of price. That is what we must get going again. Growers and government alike must look after Australia's customers. Judging by the way in which the wool industry has been conducted over the past six months, is it any wonder that the buyers have no confidence and growers are completely confused? I believe that this Hawke Labor Government has misled both sides of the industry, growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it gives me no great joy tonight to support the dismantling of what has been a remarkable success story in the reserve price scheme. However, it is important that we in the National and Liberal parties demonstrate that we are capable of making tough decisions, and we do so believing them to be in the best interests of woolgrowers specifically and of Australia generally. As I said earlier, in no way could I stand responsibly here and see the Australian woolgrower burdened with even more debt than he has to cope with at the moment. Time will tell if we are right. I have every confidence that history will judge us to be correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991, which the Senate is now debating, seeks to amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to provide for a wool industry supplementary payments scheme and to suspend the reserve price scheme. I believe that this Bill is vital for the survival of the wool industry as we know it at present. Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. The wool industry has over time provided so much of our export earnings. It is Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. Some 99 per cent of Australian wool is Australian owned and 97 per cent is exported-or perhaps I should say that it was until the troubles in recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wool has always helped Australia to pay its way, yet today in Australia wool has become so expendable that we daily read of farmers who have to shoot their flocks because it is not even profitable to ship these worthless animals to market. As one newspaper headline said, `$1.80 will buy you one beer or 18 sheep'. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry faces a very difficult time. Production is dramatically ahead of demand, so naturally we are witnessing an ever-increasing stockpile problem. With that are rapidly increasing taxes to finance the purchase and storage of those stockpiles. How dreadful it is that this once great industry has been reduced to such circumstances. I ask honourable senators: how can we have had such a profitable and efficient industry so quickly destroyed in a few years?</PARA>
<PARA> Just why are Australian woolgrowers in this current situation? Less than a year ago we debated in this chamber the Government's legislation to drop the wool floor price. The Government may have thought that it was helping the industry by its action of dropping the floor price, but I say to honourable senators that all it did was to help destroy the industry. The marketing scheme had been great for the wool industry and for Australia. Our sometimes first, and sometimes second, largest export earner-the wool industry-had developed and made an enormous contribution to our export earnings. European and Japanese wool buying interests disliked the success of the wool marketing scheme. They were not able to manipulate the market, and they have not benefited from the periodic collapse in price that was familiar prior to 1970 when the scheme was put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> For 20 years the Australian wool industry benefited from unprecedented price stability, yet the Government decided to intervene purely because it was unhappy that money was not going quickly enough into the Treasury coffers to cover the enormous balance of payments that it had created. As I told the Senate last year in a number of debates on this issue, nowhere had it been demonstrated-as distinct from asserted-that, were the offer price for Australian wool to be lowered, there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it had not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income to the industry would increase or even be maintained. Our current growing wool stockpiles, I regret, are testament to those predictions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I told the Senate, interference by the Government would only ruin the reserve price scheme and ravage future orderly wool marketing. We have to realise that the speculation about the floor price has done marked damage that may not be recoverable. The slightest doubt and lack of resolution only gave the buyers encouragement to continue their resistance to the floor price. Today Mr Kerin and, sadly, woolgrowers are having to adapt to some of those consequences. It is not that wool has been surpassed as a fine material. Woolgrowers are not facing a situation where a synthetic fibre has been developed that can replicate the desirable and superior characteristics of wool-not at any price, let alone a comparable one. </PARA>
<PARA> We can confirm this fact if we look at sales and exports data in the period prior to the reduction of the floor price last year. In the eight months to 28 February 1990 several traditional large and important wool buying countries with sophisticated and high technology processing industries had substantially improved their wool imports compared with the same period in the previous year. For instance, West Germany had increased its wool imports by 49 per cent; Italy by 9 per cent; the Netherlands by a huge 377 per cent; the United Kingdom by 9 per cent; and Taiwan by 19 per cent. But where countries purchased significantly less wool it has been agreed, in most cases, to be due to a shortage of foreign exchange currency, as in the Soviet Union, China and eastern Europe. The Australian Wool Corporation in its annual report last year said:</PARA>
<PARA>Demand . . . fell sharply, partly in response to high market prices in 1988 but also as major export markets in China, Russia and Eastern Europe almost collapsed because of totally unpredictable economic and political changes. </PARA>
<PARA>The conclusions, therefore, must be that today we are dealing with normal economic market forces of supply, demand and price. As such, we are constantly focusing at the moment on the supply side of the argument instead of looking at the demand side. The Government, together with the industry, should be doing more to address this aspect of the equation instead of constantly talking about reducing the supplies of wool. That means not only looking at an aggressive marketing system but also searching out markets, which we would never have contemplated in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be looking to find ways in which wool can be marketed not only a luxurious commodity but also as an essential part of everyday living. I well remember the cool wool campaign that the Australian Wool Board took up some years ago, and the great success that that was. Raw wool price has little effect on demand for wool. It did not in the late 1960s and early 1970s before the reserve price scheme began, when prices fluctuated wildly and buyers never minded the price of wool as long as it was relative to the price of other fibres. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the academic economists' approach to the current wool industry battle is badly flawed. It is no good talking all the time about a free market in a world where the free market, regrettably, does not operate. We should be ever vigilant that we do not allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to misplace the needs of people. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a statement on behalf of the President. Earlier today Senator Schacht asked the President two questions concerning the circulation of certain documents to senators by Senator McLean. The first question related to the right of a senator to circulate to other senators documents which the Senate has not permitted to be tabled. The circulation of documents by a senator to other senators is not a matter over which the President, or the Senate itself, has any control. It is a matter entirely within the responsibility of individual senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The President emphasises, as he did in responding initially to Senator Schacht's question, that the tabling of documents in the Senate automatically authorises the publication of the documents and makes the documents part of the proceedings of the Senate with the full protection of parliamentary privilege. The circulation of documents to senators does not authorise their further publication and does not necessarily attract any privilege. The circulation of documents to senators may be incidental to the transacting of the business of the Senate and may, therefore, attract the protection of section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, but that is not a matter on which the President wishes to express any concluded view in this or any other particular case.</PARA>
<PARA> The second question related to the use of the documents by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its inquiry into the cost of justice in Australia. The Committee could seek to have the documents laid before it and could seek to hear evidence in relation to the documents, but that is a matter for the Committee to determine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must express my concern as to the future of 9,000 disabled Australians in sheltered workshops if there is not a careful reassessment of policy by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and his Department regarding the Disability Services Act (DSA). I refer to the policy objective of retraining disabled people for open employment, while phasing out segregated employment in sheltered workshops. Whatever the merits of the ideal of open employment and independent living, policy cannot be humane if it ceases to be realistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I am posing a simple and relevant question as to whether it is feasible at a time of sharply rising unemployment to be preparing people for jobs that they cannot get. Australia has an unemployment rate of 8.4 per cent, and that in Western Australia has reached 9.3 per cent. It is a sober fact that we could soon be looking at a situation where one Australian in 10 is seeking work. Just what opportunities will this provide intellectually disabled people, no matter how willing? Even more important, should not a humane policy ensure that sheltered workshops are able to provide a meaningful lifestyle to disabled people who otherwise will not be able to work?</PARA>
<PARA> There was great concern among employees of workshops and their families when in November last year the Minister was stating that the Government would not arbitrarily close any service that was needed by disabled people while, at the same time, warning against obstructive organisations. If a workshop is arbitrarily excommunicated under the DSA, funding after 1992, to say the least, is in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees and parents are not getting the answers they need and deserve. At a public meeting in Bunbury on 12 January, called by the concerned parents of disabled people attending the Gelorup Training Centre, an officer of the Department was asked the very question I am raising: what chance do the intellectually disabled have of finding work when the non-disabled have difficulty? The answer from the minutes refers to `funding for independent living and services'. It seems that this amounts to making unemployment tolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been stated in submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiring into employment of the disabled that in practical terms successful competitive employment placement is directed to those workers who are the least handicapped. Even if they can get and retain jobs, those with greater impairment will need workshops. So too are the families, with parents getting older, who would be caring for them if they were deprived of this activity. All too often there has been denigration of sheltered workshops for paying low wages and failing to provide what is described as meaningful work. There may indeed be some organisations that deserve criticism, but I can only say that it is certainly not my experience of institutions such as the Good Samaritan Industries in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains, however, that thousands of Australians will have a continual need for sheltered workshops and the Hawke Labor Government must make a stronger commitment to providing this essential support, if necessary in preference to the implementation of the more idealistic aspects of the Disability Services Act. The reality of the Keating recession makes it irresponsible to pursue these objectives rather than ensure that limited taxpayer funds are used to maintain an essential service. </PARA>
<PARA> I do ask whether the Minister will seek from the Department an assurance that the program of open employment under the Disability Services Act is still relevant, given the dramatic deterioration of employment opportunities and whether the continuation of funding for sheltered workshops will be reassessed in the light of the increased difficulties that disabled people are likely to encounter if they have to seek competitive employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express my concern about the safety of Australian sailors on shore leave in the Middle East. I do this because of the news that I have learnt of the tragic death of a young Italian sailor while on shore leave in Dubai. Cosimo Carlino, aged 19 and from Calabria, served on one of the Italian ships in the Gulf-the Stromboli, a supply ship. The Stromboli was at the end of her mission and was about to return to Italy. Cosimo Carlino was a conscript and the youngest of eight children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At 3.30 on the afternoon of 13 Feb- ruary, Rosa Carlino, his mother, received a telephone call from Cosimo who was phoning from a public telephone in Dubai. Cosimo was excitedly telling his mother that he would be home by 1 March and that she must not worry about him, when his voice suddenly stopped short. It was at that very moment that he received a fatal stab wound. He bravely chased his assassin for 150 metres before collapsing, and he died three hours later on the operating table in Dubai hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> As reported in Il Globo of 18 February 1991, the murder is regarded as a political crime committed by a supporter of Saddam Hussein, according to the Head of Police of the United Arab Emirates. I am told that the Carlino family has a lot of relatives and Calabrian friends in the Calabrian community in Perth, Western Australia. There was a commemorative mass held in St Lawrence's Church in the northern Perth suburb of Balcatta yesterday evening. I wish it to be placed on record that I send my respects and compassionate good wishes to the Perth relatives and Calabrian friends of young Cosimo Carlino.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to inform honourable senators of some developments that have occurred in the past few hours in relation to the Westpac Banking Corporation documents and other matters surrounding these controversial documents. Honourable senators may not be aware that this afternoon these documents were read into the Hansard in the South Australian Legislative Council and, as such, are now public documents, provided that they are quoted from the Hansard of the South Australian Legislative Council. That was done by the honourable Ian Gilfillan, the State Leader of the Australian Democrats in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon, Senator Schacht in a question to the President, as did Senator Calvert on behalf of the President tonight, drew attention to the fact that I had circulated to honourable senators copies of these documents and other materials which I have tabled before in the Senate during the past two and a half years. Senator Calvert drew attention to the fact that I was quite within my rights to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise the Senate that in addition to circulating documents to other senators, I also sent copies of the documents to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It is probably a matter of interest to senators that I received a letter from Dr Hewson's office this afternoon. It was directed to my office manager and states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Ms Roach</PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time today an envelope was delivered to Dr Hewson's office by a member of your staff who said it contained `Westpac papers'. </PARA>
<PARA> This material has not been requested by Dr Hewson and I return it to you unopened. </PARA>

<PARA>Duncan Fairweather</PARA>
<PARA>Chief of Staff. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that this action by the chief of staff of the Leader of the Opposition and what has subsequently occurred in a telephone conversation with one of my members of staff, namely, an explanation that Dr Hewson was reluctant to accept these documents because he knew that the matter was before a court, frankly raises my concerns considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises the question: is the Leader of the Opposition really saying that he does not accept the same responsibilities under privilege that I, for instance, accept. He has precisely the same privileges of the Parliament as does the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and everybody else. I believe that I was quite within my rights to choose to direct those documents to him as a matter of public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course he did not have to accept them. In refusing them, surely Dr Hewson is indicating something about his attitude. Will he direct the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to reject them? Will he direct all Opposition senators to take the same position in relation to these documents of profound public importance, which are in wide circulation in this country and which have been subject to deliberation by the Speaker of the House as to whether actions taken by Westpac are in contempt of the Parliament in relation to those documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is he really going to tell the world that he is not interested in them, that he does not know about them or that he will reject them because they happen to be before a court of the land? I do not believe that such a rejection is really what was intended by the Leader of the Opposition. I simply ask him, on the record here tonight, whether or not he is directing his Leader in this House, his representatives in this chamber and, indeed, his members in the House of Representatives to adopt the same attitude towards these documents. I think that is a reasonable question to put to Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I would like to touch on in the adjournment debate is the circumstances in which Mr John McLennan finds himself. I think that most honourable senators are aware of the fact that John McLennan is a key witness who has made a submission to the bank inquiry. He is clearly acknowledged by that Committee as being a key witness because it has scheduled him to appear before a special session of the inquiry in Coffs Harbour on 20 March. </PARA>
<PARA> His submission to the Committee has been released for publication. Within hours of that happening, he was served court orders from the Supreme Court of New South Wales constraining him in relation to these matters. He has appeared before the Supreme Court of New South Wales today in relation to these court orders. Indeed, the Speaker of the House was so concerned about these actions that he was represented by Queen's Counsel before the proceedings in the Supreme Court today. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to honourable senators that John McLennan has been subjected to extraordinary intimidation as a result of this process. I spoke to him this morning; I speak to him often. This morning he said to me-and he allows me to say this to the Senate-that if he had known what was involved in appearing before a parliamentary inquiry, he would not appear before it in a fit. He has paid $10,000 of his own money in the last 48 hours to cope with the implications of the court orders that were placed upon him at the request of Westpac. That is intimidation of an enormous order. Not only that but also he believes-and he is absolutely confident-that his telephone is tapped; he knows that he is being surveilled. He has been served with similar court orders twice because the first time they were served it was a Sunday-and this is one of the humorous dimensions-and it is not legal to serve such court orders on a Sunday. So he was subjected to a similar process twice. </PARA>
<PARA> John McLennan believes that he has been intimidated. Intimidation is a psychological thing; it is not a legal thing. The significant thing is that this intimidation has a secondary spin-off to other people who may have been considering appearing before this inquiry or any other inquiry. Indeed, I would argue that, by undertaking these legal processes, not only has Westpac been in contempt of the Parliament but also it has put in place processes which are profoundly threatening to the parliamentary processes hereafter if they are supported by the courts. It will be possible hereafter to follow this example and to bring down injunctions against potential witnesses and intimidate them massively by virtue of doing that. As a result, whether those injunctions are ultimately effective or not they have dramatically interfered with the processes of the Parliament. Therefore, this very process is in contempt of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to yet another incident of someone being a victim of the banks. About 18 months ago, I tabled in this place the case of a Patricia Poulos who was in dispute with Elders Finance Group Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac. As I mentioned in this place the other day, Patricia Poulos has in the last 1 1/2 years spent $1m in litigation in the carriage of her cases in the courts of the land against Elders and two leading banks. Today was doomsday for Patricia Poulos because she was to be evicted from her home at midday. I had conversations with Patricia Poulos last night; she rang me. I had three conversations last evening and one this morning concerning her circumstances because she had convinced me-and I have been convinced of this previously-that the eviction orders which were to be put into effect at midday today were based on fraudulent documents and that the fraudulence of those documents had been admitted in court proceedings and were on the record of the court. Those documents-admitted to being fraudulent-were the basis upon which the eviction notices were issued today and which were going to be proceeded upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I took it upon myself to have a discussion with the sheriff of Sutherland Court. He had an open and frank discussion with me. He told me that he had no alternative but to proceed but, of course, he did not. He was acting on the instructions of the court. I asked him whether he was aware of the fact that it was alleged, and in fact possible, that the eviction notices were based upon fraudulent documents. He said he was not aware of that and, accordingly, had no alternative but to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I had also been advised by Patricia Poulos that she was armed and would resist any entry into her property. I advised her under no circumstances to resist by arms. The media moved in on the issue to observe what was going to happen. I advised the sheriff that he was likely to have a very difficult eviction on his hands, one that could be resisted by arms. As a result of that, at least there has been a 24-hour delay on the process which will occur in relation to the Poulos residence. </PARA>
<PARA> If one cites the coincidence in one day of a Patricia Poulos being subjected to this, allegedly over the basis of fraudulent documents, by the Commonwealth Bank, and we cite what John McLennan has been through today in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, as a result of injunctions brought down by Westpac, we see examples of the human dimension of what people suffer-in John McLennan's case, of taking what he believes to be appropriate and rightful action as a concerned and informed citizen and seeking to appear before a parliamentary inquiry and, in Patricia Poulos's case, of going through all the processes of the court at enormous expense and believing that she has been evicted from her home on the basis of fraudulent documents. We could not get a better illustration of what the human dimension of people in disputes with their banks is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply draw the attention of honourable senators to the documents which have been incorporated in the Hansard of the South Australian Parliament. Those documents are in the hands of all honourable senators. They are now public. They are on the airwaves of the nation tonight. They deserve to be there. Westpac will be judged and damned by its own words and its own documentary evidence, which is now public evidence. I believe that we have taken, as a nation, a significant step towards honest banking. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything that I have done over the last 2 1/2 years and in the last 72 or more hours in relation to those documents I do not resile from in the slightest. I truly believe them to be as they have been described-among the most potent documents in terms of what they, in their own words, admit as to having been the be- haviour of Australia's leading bank. I urgently request that my colleagues peruse those documents and react to them responsibly. I urgently urge Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to consider the documents and give me their response. I got Dr Hewson's response-I got the documents back. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply put the developments of today before the Senate. I can assure the Senate that quite clearly there will be further developments to report in future debates. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.51)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At about the same time as the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Kim Beazley, yesterday was launching what I call retribution on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), journalists at the respected Melbourne newspaper, the Age, walked off the job on a 24-hour strike to protest editorial interference by the Fairfax receiver, as their Sydney colleagues at the Sydney Morning Herald had done the day before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the other end of Melbourne, in the Flinders Street fortress of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, a division of News Corp Ltd, a few brave journalists were canvassing support for a meeting tomorrow night to protest editorial censorship on Gulf war stories, particularly those of a local flavour which show Australian resident muslims in a sympathetic light. </PARA>
<PARA> These journalists-who have Hobson's choice of working for either Murdoch or Fairfax-were putting their jobs on the line over what they see as editorial `bias'. Yet we have not heard a peep out of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Senator Ray, or their colleagues in the Opposition, about bias in the reporting of the Gulf war by any other news gathering organisations, apart from the numerous vitriolic attacks on the ABC. We know that the Prime Minister prefers to get his news live, though heavily Americanised, from Cable News Network (CNN), courtesy of Channel Ten. </PARA>
<PARA> This week the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) has brought down a report accusing the Ten network in receivership of being in breach of section 89q of the Broadcasting Act and has yet to investigate whether one of Ten's major lenders, the United States based Citicorp Bank, may indeed be in breach of foreign ownership restrictions. It is believed that the Tribunal is awaiting a Government decision on whether an offence has been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> With this entire mess to sort out, the Communications Minister has decided that the time is right to pick on the ABC for alleged bias in its Gulf war coverage. I think that last night Senator Cooney made some provocative and thought provoking statements on the matter of bias. Can we conclude that bias is only bias when the national broadcaster is not toeing an overtly jingoistic line and refuses to be the Government's press agent over the Gulf war? Or do we conclude that the attacks on the alleged bias in ABC Gulf war coverage are the political equivalent of the stealth bomber-big, ugly and deadly but carefully designed to creep up and prevent advance warning of what is to come?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the issue of bias is only a smoke-screen to distinguish the real issue, which is that the ABC is now approaching the end of the first triennial block of `inflation proof' funding. During the three-year funding block to date, the Corporation has suffered effective real cuts of $82m to its operating budget. The results have been severe restrictions on its ability adequately to service several defined and diverse audiences, as clearly stated in its charter. In order to redress current inadequacies and restore programming vital to its specialised audiences, the $82m lost over the past three years must be returned in total in the 1991-92 Budget allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> By alleging bias and an inadequate complaints procedure, the Government, I believe, is attempting to deflect attention away from its statutory and financial responsibilities to the Corporation. Moreover, it is also a means of avoiding the serious issue of providing adequate funding, and not just restoring what rightfully belongs to the Corporation. There is a need to provide a capital injection for property and re-equipment of the Corporation; to establish an adequate funding base from which future adjustments will be made; to exempt the ABC from arbitrary cuts; and to guarantee that any additional revenue gained by the ABC is to be retained by the Corporation and not deducted from ongoing direct government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegations of bias and the call for a watchdog complaints committee are even more than a cynical revenue driven exercise. This is another example of how this Government tampers piecemeal with legislation-in this case it will need drastic surgery to both the Broadcasting Act and the ABC's own special Act of Parliament-while at the same time attempting a major overhaul and restructuring of the broadcasting industry. Is it any wonder that the media industry is constantly complaining that the Government changes the rules while the last few minutes of the game are in progress? Although successive governments have attempted to muzzle the ABC since its inception in 1932, none have succeeded. In the main, this has been because of public outrage. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this Government has chosen its time and chosen its ground very carefully. Any criticism of the Gulf war is now seen as a distinct lack of patriotism and, in the ABC's case, akin to national treason. But that may change as the coalition forces embark on a ground offensive and the CNN cameras catch casualties live instead of Christmas lights from fighter planes. In the national interest, it is a very bad time to attempt to muzzle the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> The existence of a watchdog authority could serve to intimidate producers and program makers. In a country where most of the media is controlled by a handful of people, this would seriously jeopardise the functioning of the only independent broadcaster left to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current political climate, where both the Government and the Opposition are in favour of the Gulf war, and the only Federal parliamentary opposition to the war in our democracy is eight Australian Democrats senators, one independent senator, Senator Jo Vallentine, and Ted Mack, MHR, the ABC has a moral and democratic right to its independent viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that it was bad for the ABC to be investigating itself as it did recently in its internal investigation into its own coverage of the Gulf war. Other critics have suggested that the report was akin to police investigating the police. But I think there is one big difference. Viewers and listeners can switch off the television set or switch over to CNN, provided the Ten network is still allowed to operate. No viewer is forced to accept the findings, or alleged bias, of the ABC. As its charter maintains, the ABC is not a mass market medium. It has a specialised function and role in society. It is the Government which seems to wish to treat the ABC as it would a commercial television network. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech yesterday, Minister Beazley argued that the ABC should be more accountable in the same way as commercial broadcasters were subject to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. He even suggested the ABT as the potential watchdog over the ABC. It is the Government which seems to wish the ABC to accept sponsorship, advertising and audience rating figures, as if the commercial broadcasting industry is some kind of shining example for the ABC to follow. It is the Government which wishes to subject the ABC to the same regulations as the commercial broadcasting industry. But I would argue that the ABC was not intended to be, nor should it become, just another commercial network answerable to market forces and the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight cents a day is a very small price to pay for freedom. Some Australians may be willing to pay more than this. This Government and any future government should be warned that no government is going to be allowed to take away this precious right without a fight. </PARA>

I rise to respond just briefly to what Senator Kernot said. I reject categorically and out of hand her assertion that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is `picking on the ABC' and applying what she says is the pressure to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) because it is convenient to do so at this time. She has accused the Minister of putting direct pressure on the ABC because of this alleged bias-I quote her again-`trying to treat the ABC as if it were a commercial network'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I am able to do all that-and I hate to say this-is that I get by with about five hours sleep a night. Maybe it is my guilty conscience. Through the miracle of video cassette recorders I am able to watch a great deal of the news. I do not watch all of the programs, but I am pleased to say that my staff record the bits I am interested in. I rely on the ABC for the majority of the news. I simply assert to Senator Kernot that I know Mr Beazley's particular personal views on the ABC. He has the same admiration and commitment for the organisation that I have, and many people on this side of the chamber have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I make those points-without being tedious about it-is that I think Senator Kernot, with respect, is being a little precious about the ABC. It is because it is not a commercial television channel that it is more important, in my view, to ensure that we as a parliament have a more critical role to play in our assessment of the ABC's performance than a commercial television channel, because it is a public broadcaster; it is our broadcaster. It prides itself-as it should-on the impartial way in which it approaches its very responsible job of informing Australia about the news. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a view on bias-like everyone else in public life-and I say this without hesitation because the public record will show that I have never complained about bias in reporting, whether it is by the ABC or the Northern Territory News, our only daily newspaper, provided that bias is contained in that part of the reporting which is identified as being opinion. I would be appalled at the suggestion that bias, so-called, should be removed from journalism. It is bias that has a stimulating effect on people who read and see it; it is bias that provokes by its very nature the debate which the Fourth Estate has got such an essential role as part of our democratic system role in promoting; and it is bias which-dare I say it-entertains as well as informs. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, all journalists, whether they work for the ABC or not, have an absolute obligation-indeed, I know that the Australian Journalists Association's ethics say this-to keep that bias out of reporting. In my view, it does not just apply to the ABC; it applies to everyone. But where it is identified as opinion-much of the television coverage on the Gulf war has clearly been identified as opinion-I think that what fair-minded broadcasters have to do, but particularly the ABC, is to ensure, as I have recently said in relation to the controversy over the sacked announcer from the public radio station, not that they do not present that opinion, in so far as it is possible in the time they have available to them, but that a broad range of opinions are expressed on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is all one can ask of any broadcaster. Like everyone else, I have been intrigued and interested to see that the Gulf war, as well as providing the dreadful and ongoing tragedy, has also provided the most extraordinary boost for every retired colonel, general and air force major-they all seem to become consultants and analysts after they retire from the armed services-that it is possible to collect in one spot to talk about the war. There is no question that it is within those reports that the perceptions of bias to a great extent have occurred. The reason I comment on that is that in a recent interview panel I saw-I think it was on the ABC-talking about bias, one of the people being interviewed in terms of his analysis of whether he thought there had been bias or not struck a chord with me when he said that there had been so much continuous wall to wall coverage on the television channels on the Gulf war, there had been so much information flow coming in, that it would be very difficult to precisely determine without detailed analysis afterwards whether there had been any consistent bias one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, in much of the coverage I saw-and like everyone else I have been hopping from one channel to the other-I agreed with that analysis. But the ABC has a special place in news and public broadcasting in Australia that is not shared by the commercial television channels. The reason I make that point is that I want to refute Senator Kernot's statement that we can deal with the question of bias on the ABC-and she said this-`by simply switching it off'. With respect, that is what she said-if people are upset about bias on the ABC they can simply turn it off and switch to another channel. That is what I meant when I said, with respect, that Senator Kernot was being a bit precious about the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I do not think that the ABC should be afraid-and I know that it is not-of any analysis of the broadcasting or the current affairs programming that it runs is that I know how sensitive it is, from personal experience, and how responsive it is to the responsibilities that it does have to prepare balanced reports. After 15 years in public life I am well aware of that. The ABC in the Northern Territory has been publicly accused of bias on many occasions. It reached a point where the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham, complained so trenchantly about bias in respect of the only public affairs program on radio not just on the ABC but in the Northern Territory. That was a program called After Eight- or Morning Extra I think it was called in those days-the only public affairs broadcast on radio on which he refused, publicly, to appear or to give interviews to any of its journalists. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of those matters, I know that the ABC meticulously records, literally minute by minute, the amount of air time on the radio and the television that it gives to a particular point of view. I know from personal experience that it is in a position to respond with some degree of accuracy, on the occasions that have come to my notice, to accusations of bias with some informative opinion about whether it is biased or not. The reason I make that point is, from my experience with the ABC, it does not resent accusations of bias being made against it in the sense that it feels it is being unfairly singled out. The ABC does not respond to it by saying, `Why do you pick on us?'. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience with the ABC, it simply acknowledges that it does play a role which subjects it to this accusation of bias far more than any other broadcaster does, because the ABC is the public broadcaster and is therefore much more liable to this kind of criticism than any other broadcasting organisation. Having said that, to put this debate in context, I say that it is not simply the ABC that is being singled out as some special case. In fact, there is currently raging in Great Britain a very large debate on the bias being alleged against the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). If we can accuse the BBC of bias, we can accuse our public broadcaster of bias without feeling faint and falling in a heap about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out to Senator Kernot, as I did today, that the matter of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is not a matter that has suddenly leapt up in the context of the Gulf war. Australia is in the most unusual situation of being at war. So it is hardly surprising that the extent and passion of feeling about bias in our national broadcaster is higher at the moment than it would be under other circumstances. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is conducting its own inquiry into the bias, accuracy and impartiality of current affairs programs in Australia generally. As much as I have my own personal view about bias, I believe that a free press is an absolutely essential part of a democratic society; a democratic society cannot survive without a free press. Because of those very elements, the public debate about perceived bias, not just in the ABC but in any other element of the media, will go on all the time; and so it should. I am perfectly happy to say that if I have any complaints about the ABC I will deal with them by writing to Backchat. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am aware that certain documents were released pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act) and that, as a consequence, an article appeared in the Australian Financial Review of 12 June 1990 which drew on information contained in those documents. Prior to the release of the documents they were extensively edited with a view to deleting any material that might possibly have indicated the identity of the taxpayers concerned. I understand that some material which, to someone with close knowledge of the people associated with the taxpayer, might have identified one of the taxpayers involved was accidentally not deleted. This was regrettable and steps have been taken to avoid any repetition.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) When the secrecy provisions of the income tax legislation are read in conjunction with the FOI Act it is clear that there is not an absolute embargo on the release of information. In this case the information was released by officers authorised in accordance with the FOI Act and in the belief that they were acting in conformity with their obligations under the FOI Act. I am informed that the advice of the Attorney-General's Department was sought. Amongst other things this advice referred to section 92 of the FOI Act which relevantly provides:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is no requirement under section 68 of the Constitution for Parliamentary consensus in relation to a decision to deploy the Defence Force. Section 68 of the Constitution provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>  `The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative'.</PARA>
<PARA> The current legal position with respect to section 68 is summarized at page 346 of the Final Report of the Constitutional Commission as:</PARA>
<PARA>  `It is clear beyond doubt that whatever powers the Governor-General may exercise pursuant to this section, these powers are ones that are exercisable only on the advice of the responsible Minister.'</PARA>
<PARA> Ministerial responsibility for the Defence Force has been recognised by Parliament in section 8 of the Defence Act 1903 which provides that the Minister for Defence shall have the general control and administration of the Defence Force.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australian Construction Services, within my department, uses a combination of contract and in-house resources to undertake maintenance work. The proportions are varied as workload fluctuates, to ensure maximum utilisation and efficiency of the existing ACS workforce. Currently, 45% in value of total maintenance work is performed by private contractors.</PARA>
<PARA> For minor maintenance, it is more effective for departments to arrange execution of this type of work directly. In 1988 the Government agreed to increase minor maintenance delegation levels to departments, from a limit of $1,500 in value of work to $2,000. In the case of the Department of Defence, the limit is now $6,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the delegation levels were increased, no contracts have been cancelled. Contracts have reached the end of specified periods and have not been extended in the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA> - by mutual agreement between the contracting parties;</PARA>
<PARA> - where options to extend have not been taken up;</PARA>
<PARA> - by request of the client due to changed work requirements;</PARA>
<PARA> - as a result of changes in ownership/occupancy of properties;</PARA>
<PARA> - as a result of non performance of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Each department has the authority to arrange or carry out maintenance work within its delegation by whatever means it deems most efficient. I do not have figures of what staff are employed by departments for the purpose of undertaking maintenance work, nor the cost of that employment.</PARA>
