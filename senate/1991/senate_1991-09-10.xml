I do not believe it has ever been the case that Ministers, either in this Government or indeed in the one that preceded it, have been in the habit of tabling tape-recordings that may have been made at private meetings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer the Minister to reports in this morning's media of the ACTU's congress decision yesterday to adopt a charter for jobs. In light of last week's easing of interest rates by a full one per cent, is there scope for the Government to consider the kinds of initiatives advocated by the ACTU to promote employment growth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston intruded with one of his sort of supplementary questions when Senator Crowley was asking that question. The suggestion, when Senator Crowley was talking about unemployment projections, was that the Budget is dead in the water. With respect to unemployment projections, the interjection could not have been more misplaced than others made on previous occasions. In answer to Senator Crowley's question, let me say first of all that the Government shares the ACTU's concern about unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unemployment in this country is too high as a result of the recession. Before the recession, economic policy and industry policy had created a climate in which 1.6 million jobs had been created in Australia. I make the point that even with the job losses which have been occasioned by the recession, there are still 1.3 million jobs more than there were when this Government came to office.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the ACTU Secretary is reported as saying that the ACTU is not fundamentally at odds with the Federal Government on the issue of economic management. The objects pursued by the ACTU at its congress coincide precisely with the objects of the Government; that is, the return to steady and sustainable job growth underpinned by continued improvement in the competitiveness of Australian industry. I am quite willing to discuss any specific initiatives the ACTU wants to put forward in relation to problems which it has identified in its congress.</PARA>
<PARA> The best way to create employment is not through massive pump priming in order to create jobs. The best way of increasing employment is to remove the impediments to private sector investment in Australia, which is something about which the Government shares a common concern with the ACTU. However, it is not helpful to anybody who is unemployed or interested in investment in this country to provide magic wand solutions to some of these problems. The current magic wand being waved nervously by the Opposition, of course, is the consumption tax.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is something which the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer refuse to spell out in any detail. Indeed, as Senator Boswell well knows, at the National Party Conference at the weekend the unhappy members of the conference were lead along to debate the consumption tax on the stated assumption that it would be less than 15 per cent. You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink at a 15 per cent consumption tax level-not in the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason this nervous magic wand is being waved around by the Opposition is its failure to work through the basic premises of a consumption tax and how to sell it. Senator Vanstone has published a document on how to sell a consumption tax. There is a picture of a tank on the front of the document. The caption under the caricature of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, says `Dr Hewson is no wimp'. Dr Hewson has a soldier with a rifle standing beside him just to reassure him that he is no wimp.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone goes on to say that the Liberal Party has to accept that popularity is not everything. I thought that would have been something that it would have accepted over the last decade. It is said by Senator Vanstone that lots of things are unpopular at first glance, but that does not mean we do not need them-for example, pain-killing injections, going to the dentist or having chemotherapy. These are the sorts of analogies which Senator Vanstone draws with the consumption tax proposed as a magic wand by the Opposition parties. The consumption tax is a magic wand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already dealt with some of the most important parts of Senator Crowley's question in terms of the art form which one has to acquire in this job of answering a question. I will come back to other parts of Senator Crowley's question in a minute. I am just uttering a warning for those people-whether they be in the ACTU or in the Senate-who see the solution to the questions posed by both Senator Crowley and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in such glib terms and hook all of their belongings to this particular cart which Dr Hewson is trying to drive through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I can mix my metaphors for a minute, Senator Vanstone compared that cart with chemotherapy. The Opposition has no other proffered solution to the sorts of questions that are being raised by the ACTU. As I have said on previous occasions in the Senate, the solution to those questions really is in re-encouraging successful private sector investment in this country; not by waving magic wands or introducing a consumption tax as a panacea to all the problems which confront the Australian investment community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and, I think, representing the Treasurer on matters of Commonwealth-State relationships. I preface my question by referring the Minister to Mrs Kelly's part in the continuing campaign to undermine the Prime Minister by ridiculing new federalism as `crass politics'. Are there any moves within the Government to lessen Commonwealth control over environmental matters? Further, does the Minister believe that the present distribution of control over environmental matters between the Commonwealth and the States is appropriate and effective? If not, how should it be changed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell interjects to describe it as crass politics. He would know all about that; he has been involved in that for years. In answer to Senator Macdonald's substantive question, I do not regard the present arrangements between the Commonwealth and State governments in respect of a variety of functions as satisfactory. I would certainly include environmental management amongst those functions. Since there is a discussion taking place at the Premiers Conference on the appropriate division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and State governments on this issue, I do not want to prejudge or prejudice any of those discussions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. If I understand Senator Button correctly, he said that he was not happy with the sharing of power on environmental matters. Does part of his concern arise out of the inability of the Federal Government to proceed towards a decision on the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric project extension because of the Queensland Government's stalling on the project? I use the word `stalling' because it was used by departmental officers this week in Senate Estimates committee meetings when they suggested that the Queensland Government--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my original answer to the question asked by Senator Macdonald, I said that there were many matters in respect of which I thought Commonwealth-State functional arrangements were not as good as they ought to be. I said that the environment was amongst those matters. I am not familiar with the Tully-Millstream project, but it may well be that it falls into the category of an example. I will try to find out more details about that project. Because Senator Macdonald has had the advantage of questioning about this matter at a Senate Estimates committee, he may be much better informed than I am, and in that sense the question is not only not supplementary but also redundant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade whether it is true, as claimed in an article in today's Canberra Times, that Australia's flood relief to Cambodia, as announced last week, has dried up?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1315" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not true and that is yet another extremely misleading headline from the Canberra Times-something which has become endemic, I am afraid, with that paper. The article, if one reads what it actually says, makes clear that there are no references to any moves on Australia's part to cease assistance. In fact, it refers to funding problems for some UN agencies involved in the relief effort. Even here it is out of date. The UN in Bangkok has told us that it is making additional funds available to purchase relief supplies and has asked that the Australian Hercules stay on to fly more Bangkok-Phnom Penh-Bangkok shuttles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current scheduling is for two shuttles to be flown today-10 September-and two tomorrow. This would bring the total number to six. These shuttles have been absolutely crucial in bringing in urgently needed relief supplies to Cambodia. The main items involved have been sandbags for the construction of levies, medical supplies, blankets and mosquito nets. There is no doubt that, in sending the Hercules with a full relief cargo to Cambodia and then making it available to ferry in supplies from Bangkok, Australia has made a very significant contribution to the flood relief.</PARA>
<PARA> When I announced the relief flight last week, I did point out that an Australian disaster response expert would go into Cambodia on that flight. His brief is to monitor the Australian aid and to look into possibilities for additional assistance as well as the flight itself. We are presently awaiting his reporting before we make decisions on any such assistance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Firstly, does the Prime Minister stand by the Government's response to the Australian Conservation Foundation's 1990 election questionnaire, which pledged to assert greater Commonwealth power over the environment? Secondly, does the Prime Minister acknowledge that Discussion Draft Number 4 of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment dated April 1991 in fact does the reverse, in ceding substantial Commonwealth control to the States? Thirdly, what justification does the Prime Minister offer for a process which, as this draft agreement indicates, relegates the Commonwealth to a role equivalent to the post-coup central government of the Soviet Union, unable to act without the approval of the States? Finally, will the Prime Minister accept that the new federalism process needs a total rethink, as indicated by the front page story in Saturday's Australian, in which the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, was quoted by several sources as describing the process as `crass politics' and in which the prevailing Cabinet sentiment was described as resignation rather than enthusiasm?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the questionnaire which Senator Coulter refers to, the answer to that part of the question is yes. But once again it is a question in respect of what aspects and in what manner Commonwealth power is exercised. In so far as the discussion paper of the intergovernmental agreement is concerned, that agreement is still being negotiated between the Commonwealth Government and the States. Whatever may or may not have been in a discussion paper is not relevant as it has already been superseded by discussions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard the analogy with the Soviet Union in relation to our particular federalism problems as being based on a false premise and not relevant to the sorts of issues which Senator Coulter raised in his question.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the fourth part of the question is concerned, I have already declined to comment on an article in Saturday's Australian. However, let me say, as I have already said in an answer in the Senate earlier today, that I do not regard any-or very few-of the arrangements between the Commonwealth Government and the States as functioning perfectly. I never have. Indeed, those arrangements have never functioned as one would wish in a modern economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Will the Minister indicate whether the Government is prepared to more widely interpret the trade and commerce powers, the corporation powers and the external affairs powers in their application to the environment or is the Government seeking essentially to ignore these powers which it already possesses and to give over the care and control of the environment to the States in all those areas?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have essentially answered that question when I referred to the negotiations which had taken place about the discussion paper, to which Senator Coulter referred in the first part of his question. I think the use of external affairs powers by the Commonwealth in order to establish a Commonwealth environmental policy is probably necessary if Commonwealth environmental policy is to have any effect, but the substance of that issue is still being negotiated in discussions with the States. When there is an outcome, the Government will advise the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it true that the amendments made to the Industrial Relations Act last year have made union amalgamations much speedier by allowing multiple union amalgamations to be progressed simultaneously? Has this boosted the Government's micro-economic reform agenda of achieving larger industry-based unions? Have some of the success stories been the formation of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Workers Union with a membership of around 241,000; a hospitality union with approximately 250,000 members; the Finance Sector Union with 109,000 members; the Public Sector Union with 103,000; and a telecommunications union with 81,000 members?

Why has the Government cut the Australian Sports Commission's request for $3m for the Australian Olympic team for Barcelona to $1.5m in a budget that actually increases the overall sports funding, particularly in politically oriented areas? What action does the Government intend to take now that the Sports Commission has rejected the Minister's request to make up this shortfall from its funding to other sports and has written asking the Government to review its decision? What are the so-called administration savings that the Minister has now told the media can be made to make up this shortfall in Olympic funding?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the original request for the $3m was from the Australian Olympic Committee and that was supported by the Sports Commission. I think that was the evidence the Estimates Committee received last night. The Sports Commission had written to the Minister indicating that it would find it very difficult to find the $1.5m from within its budget. My understanding is that since then the Minister has spoken to Mr Ferguson the Executive Director who, as Senator Campbell mentioned, has said that there are administrative savings which can be made by the Sports Commission. As to where they are, I certainly do not know but I am more than happy to inquire from the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the transcript of Senator Hill's comments, along with those of several other Opposition members, on this subject. I have to say that were we to follow the advice of Senator Hill and the Opposition, our aid program would be utterly without credibility in the region and in the wider international community. I say that for a number of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of his contribution on International Report, Senator Hill made it very clear that the budget for aid under the Opposition-were it ever to get into government-would be dramatically cut. He said that he expected that there would be less cash and there would be considerable expenditure cuts. That followed a comment on ABC radio on 30 August by Mr Reith who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I'd cut back on overseas aid. I don't understand what it is that drives the Government's priorities to be spending among other things $20m in this budget on world environment programs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In light of all the crocodile tears that have been shed in the past day or two by the Opposition about this Government's environment policies, and to have that sort of statement about $20m being utterly irrelevant as effective, legitimate Australian expenditure coming from the mouth of the Opposition's shadow Treasurer makes absolutely clear what is the real attitude of this Opposition on environmental matters and positions and the nakedness of its policy credibility when it comes to that particular issue. Mr Reith's inability to understand what we are spending money on in terms of regional and worldwide environmental aid programs is matched only by Senator Hill's inability to understand-as also demonstrated in this particular transcript-just what legitimate aid expenditure is about in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill said that infrastructural projects in Indonesia, such as the building of roads and bridges, did not help the poor; were not, in effect, a legitimate part of an aid program. It is an extraordinary statement to make and demonstrates that Senator Hill simply does not begin to understand the utility, the necessity, of roads and bridges and other forms of communication in enabling poor people in rural communities to get their produce to markets and to make it possible for other projects to take place which involve employment and income generation. To be engaged in infrastructure projects of that particular kind is the most fundamental and fundamentally useful of all forms of development assistance. The long term contribution to the problem of poverty that growth generating projects of this kind make is absolutely essential to any country's aid program. For the Opposition to dismiss this kind of thing with cavalier disregard demonstrates both ignorance and culpable negligence in understanding what aid is all about.</PARA>
<PARA> I remember one further aspect of the transcript which was referred to by Senator Childs in which Senator Hill comments on the legitimacy of linkage between the aid program and influencing political change. Again, were this to be applied in the way in which Senator Hill seems to want, it would involve us in totally neglecting claims for humanitarian relief for assistance to poor people in a number of countries if he thought that some other larger political objective was to be served thereby. There can be occasions where that is legitimate, but it is only on the most careful case by case assessment that can ever be so. To apply it in the way in which Senator Hill seems to be adopting as a general rule, governing the operation of a country's aid program, again demonstrates manifest insensitivity to what the legitimate priorities of an aid program should be and whom our aid is trying to target and to help.</PARA>
<PARA> The contrast between that sort of attitude that has been demonstrated both on the quantity and quality of aid and the performance of this particular government is immense. We have created a situation this year where far from cutting back the dollars devoted to aid, we have increased the dollar sum by $53m, and that represents a one per cent increase, a bouncing back to 0.35 as the percentage of ODA to GNP.</PARA>

Perhaps some of his colleagues should check with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Shipping Industry Reform Authority, which is overseeing the implementation of this reform program, currently running well ahead of schedule, recently released its latest six-monthly report.

That is something that the Opposition consistently says cannot happen. I repeat that the Opposition has grudgingly acknowledged publicly the substantial process achieved in the shipping reform area. Of course, the Opposition will not be fully satisfied until our policy of protecting the Australian indigenous shipping industry on our coasts is destroyed. This is despite the fact that all major maritime nations in the world have a similar policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition continues to parrot invalid comparisons between various coastal and international freight rates in Australia without any examination of why foreign ships may offer cheap rates at the sacrifice of ship safety.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1320" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are confident that in decentralising the wage fixing system, as accord mark VI contemplates, we will be able to manage the transference to a more decentralised focus without there being any massive blow-out in wage outcomes for this country. The basis for our confidence is that, if one goes back over the past seven years of the Hawke Government, we find that in five of those seven years the aggregate wage outcome has achieved the Budget forecast. Indeed, in three of those five years, the aggregate wage outcome significantly undershot the Budget forecast. In the two years that the aggregate wage outcome exceeded the forecast-in 1986-1987 and 1988-1989-there was a general level of economic activity much higher than forecast in the Budget at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I were to provide a cumulative total of the forecast aggregate wage outcomes for the seven Budgets of the Hawke years, the figure would be 56.5 per cent. If I were to compare that to the outcome, the figure would be 57.9 per cent. In other words, the forecast versus the outcome produces a difference of 1.5 per cent over seven years-an extraordinary achievement by this Government in terms of aggregate wage results. If we were to compare that with the record of the Fraser Government, we would find that in the seven years of the Fraser Government the forecast cumulative total was 106.9. The outcome is 113.7, which is a difference of around 7 per cent. That is quite an excessively high difference between forecast and outcome.</PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at those figures, one sees that in the seven years of the Hawke Government the outcome was 57.9 per cent in wages growth compared with the wages growth in the Fraser years of 113.7 per cent, or almost double that of the seven years of the Hawke Government. In other words, not only is this Government better able more accurately to predict the wages outcome, but as well the outcome is a much more moderate level than the excessive levels of the comparative period of years for the Fraser Government.</PARA>
<PARA> To complete the picture, it should also be said that during the period of the Hawke Government the economy has been growing at a much stronger rate than it did during the period of the Fraser Government. The average annual rate of GDP growth under our Government was 3.6 per cent per annum, whereas the average under Fraser was 2.1 per cent. So in a more strongly growing economy the wages outcomes were more moderate and the wages targets were met. On that basis we believe that the accord has demonstrated that it has served this community extraordinarily well as an economic tool on wages policy and that the ability to deliver those results seven years in succession causes us to be confident that, now we move to the more decentralised focus on wage fixing, the result can still be the same-our forecast will be met.</PARA>

Secondly, will not this technology, which uses large launchers and large payloads, be replaced in the very near future by a technology which produces smaller, disposable or even renewable satellites which require only small launch vehicles?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question began by soliciting my comments on the spaceport proposal which, of course, is a Queensland proposal. It is quite distinct from any proposals which are currently being discussed in respect of the Woomera rocket range. I must say that at the start of Question Time Senator Kernot gave me an illegible photostat which depicts a Zenit rocket. I do not know what that means. The impression that one gets of the Zenit rocket depends on which way one holds that photostat; but it does not help one with anything else. So I did not have any real notice of this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as Dr Middleton has described the failure of one of these rockets as a setback, I think that is a correct description. As the senator well knows, the space industry has not been without failures of one kind or another, whether in the United States, the Soviet Union or elsewhere. I think it is probably not a low risk infinitely insurable industry. So I think the description of the failure as a disappointment is probably a fairly accurate description.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator then asked me about the possibility of using a lower powered smaller rocket which, as I understand the question, might be developed in the suburbs of Brisbane or somewhere.

<PARA> Senator Button's perspective, quite rightly, is to place at the head of his considerations the involvement of Australian industry. The priorities I set for the CAA are simple-and if anyone is to take any blame for this decision it is me. Australia's current antiquated air traffic control system is not only still using 1960s technology in Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra but is also in the absurd position of having its air traffic control sectors based on State borders instead of relating them to the actual routes over which aircraft fly these days.</PARA>
<PARA> The priority I set the CAA was to get a complete replacement program under way to provide Australia with a state-of-the-art air traffic control system which, firstly, works; secondly, comes in on budget; and, thirdly, is delivered on time. Anyone with a serious interest in this question who looks at overseas experience in Canada and the United States and the massive cost overruns of billions of dollars in developing in-house the enormously sophisticated technology that is related to these systems would be a little fearful of committing Australian industry to such a course.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that fundamental to this decision is that this Government has taken a policy decision-fully supported, I would assume, by the Opposition-of getting industry to pay for the costs of running aviation; that is, the 25 per cent of the community effectively that use aircraft rather than slugging the 75 per cent that do not. Therefore, the aviation industry has a keen interest in the provision of large infrastructure programs such as air traffic control. I can say that the experience within Australia of developing in-house technology is not encouraging. I do not have time to go into that now, but no doubt there will be heaps of time tonight in the Estimates Committee where this matter will be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that the first priority I gave the CAA was to get in place by 1995, which is a tight deadline, an air traffic control system that works and is on budget. The second priority I gave the CAA-and I have attended several board meetings following constructive discussions with Senator Button and his Department-was to involve to the maximum extent Australian industry.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian system of tariff preference has been given some recent attention. It was given attention in the March statement when the decision was announced to phase out four of the countries with the highest average per capita incomes which had previously been beneficiaries of that system. That, of course, does not include the low labour cost and impoverished countries, to which Senator Boswell's question refers, such as the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These schemes, to which many nations subscribe, are in a sense arbitrary in their application. The Government considers that our present system, which provides for universal product coverage, no automatic country or product exclusion provisions and a uniform preference margin that is limited to five percentage points, represents a balanced package that accommodates the concerns of local industry and developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that imports of pineapple products from the Philippines have increased to around 20 per cent of the local market does not justify singling out the local industry for increased import protection. I think some of the problems of the industry in Queensland are associated with lack of investment compared with the sort of investment levels which have taken place in countries such as the Philippines, largely at the instigation, as I think Senator Boswell's question points out, of United States companies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government regards as extremely doubtful whether the removal of the preference margin would have any positive impact for the industry at all. Experience is that increased border protection measures will do nothing to ensure the long term viability of industry in general. The pineapple sector is unlikely to be an exception to that fact.</PARA>
<PARA> For a variety of reasons we have subscribed to the present policies in relation to DC preferences, border protection generally and tariffs. This is for the simple reason that we consistently argue in world forums for a breakdown of agricultural protectionism and protectionism in respect of industries, such as coal, in Europe, North America, Japan and other places. The fact of the matter is that in order that we might do that as a country of some 17 million people and a fairly significant trading country, we have for those reasons, amongst others, embarked on the current course of reducing tariff protection. There are many other reasons for reducing tariff protection which go to the efficiency of our industries.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that we not be misled in this issue, or any other, by the belief that somehow if we abolished DC preferences in relation to Queensland pineapples, the health of the industry would automatically be restored.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that to be the case. As a matter of fact, I do not believe that, when the National Party thinks about it, it would believe that to be the case either. In this environment of reduced protection and so on we must ensure that Australian instrumentalities such as CAA give greater attention to the work of Australian companies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday, Senator Lees asked me some questions about the dispersal of some pamphlets around Department of Social Security offices and mobile review teams. I have quite a long answer to her question. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY LEAFLETS</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY</PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday, Senator Lees asked some questions about pamphlets which explain the rights of Social Security clients when they are visited at home by my Department's field staff.</PARA>
<PARA> She asked:</PARA>
<PARA> what steps I had taken to ensure that the pamphlets are available in CES offices;</PARA>
<PARA> why field officers and mobile review teams had not been handing out the pamphlets to DSS clients as promised; and</PARA>
<PARA> why leaflets on legal and appeal rights were printed but were still not made publicly available in all Social Security and CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA> She also asked whether leaflets about DSS appeals were displayed and available in Social Security and CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees referred specifically to problems in South Australia and New South Wales and I undertook to have the matter examined. She subsequently provided a list of DSS and CES offices where inquiries had been made about the availability of the home visits pamphlet and it had been reported to her that the pamphlets were not on display or were not in use by my Department's field assessing staff.</PARA>
<PARA> It was reported to Senator Lees that the pamphlets were not on display at DSS Regional Offices at:</PARA>
<PARA> Norwood</PARA>
<PARA> Noarlunga</PARA>
<PARA> Port Adelaide</PARA>
<PARA> Port Augusta</PARA>
<PARA> Berri</PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide</PARA>
<PARA> Glenelg</PARA>
<PARA> Edwardstown</PARA>
<PARA> Croydon</PARA>
<PARA> Elizabeth</PARA>
<PARA> Gawler</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by my Department that a check of these offices yesterday afternoon showed that the pamphlets are on display in the DSS offices at:</PARA>
<PARA> Noarlunga</PARA>
<PARA> Port Adelaide</PARA>
<PARA> Port Augusta</PARA>
<PARA> Glenelg</PARA>
<PARA> Croydon</PARA>
<PARA> Elizabeth</PARA>
<PARA> Gawler</PARA>
<PARA> In Norwood, a poster is on display and photocopies of the pamphlet are given to clients on request. The remaining offices did not have the pamphlet on display because of a shortage of supplies and I will deal with that aspect shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> The information given to Senator Lees indicated that field assessing staff from:</PARA>
<PARA> Norwood</PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide</PARA>
<PARA> Glenelg</PARA>
<PARA> Edwardstown</PARA>
<PARA> Marden</PARA>
<PARA>did not know about the pamphlet or were not using it. I am advised that checks by my Department yesterday afternoon showed that supplies of the pamphlet had been made available to the field assessing staff and mobile review team staff operating out of the offices concerned, together with instructions on its use and I am advised those instructions are being followed.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees had also been informed that supplies of the pamphlet were not on display nor available in the CES offices at Noarlunga and Edwardstown. Supplies had in fact been sent to the Noarlunga CES office but were not displayed. Because of a shortage of supplies the pamphlets had not yet been made available to the CES office at Edwardstown.</PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales the report showed that except where there is a shortage of stocks, the pamphlets are on display in DSS offices and that supplies have been given to CES offices. The pamphlets are also being used by mobile review team and field assessing staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The shortages of pamphlets have come about because a private sector contractor did not deliver 250,000 of them which were collected on 14 August. I believe it would be useful if I give the Senate some background to what happened.</PARA>
<PARA> On 29 June this year, 39,000 of the pamphlets were dispatched to DSS Area Offices and delivery was confirmed by the National Administration of my Department. Mobile Review Team staff and Regional field assessing staff started using them as soon as they were distributed in July. A further 61,000 pamphlets followed in late July. Again receipt was confirmed. Those deliveries were the first steps in the printing and distribution of 600,000 pamphlets for use by mobile review team and field assessing staff and for display in DSS and CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA> After the delivery of the 100,000 pamphlets in June and July, contact with seven Area Offices of my Department also confirmed that the pamphlets had been received. However, recent reports indicated that stocks were running low and it is clear now that the reason for this was a failure by a private sector firm to distribute supplies as contracted.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this difficulty, mobile review team and most field assessing staff continued to use the pamphlet. Checks by my Department confirm that it has been available in the majority of Regional Offices around Australia and, where stocks were sufficient, supplies have been given to CES offices and their Managers requested to display the pamphlet.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department let a contract for the distribution of 250,000 pamphlets to Area Offices for on-forwarding to Regional Offices. My Department telephoned the private sector firm on 13 August about the dispatch requirements and confirmed these by fax.</PARA>
<PARA> The company collected the pamphlets the next day ie. 14 August and took them to its distribution centre. The pamphlets were in boxes addressed by the Department to Area Offices. They were not in fact distributed.</PARA>
<PARA> A further 250,000 pamphlets were collected by the firm on 29 August for immediate distribution. In this instance, the pamphlets had been boxed by the Department and addressed to Area Offices.</PARA>
<PARA> The delivery failure is unfortunate. The firm concerned has successfully delivered over a million packages of various types for the Department since June this year, including 250,000 packages to 700 locations around Australia in one week. This is the first time such a problem has occurred. The problem was corrected yesterday with the bulk supplies being dispatched by air and road freight at the firm's expense.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that full distribution has taken longer than I would have liked but I can assure the Senate that my Department's staff, including mobile review teams, commenced using the pamphlet in early July this year in accordance with my direction. Where supplies were available CES offices also displayed them.</PARA>
<PARA> Area and Regional Managers of my Department have been advised that they must confirm by the end of this week that the additional supplies of the pamphlet have arrived and that it:</PARA>
<PARA> is available to clients in bulk in each Regional Office and is on display there;</PARA>
<PARA> is available to clients in bulk in each CES office in and is on display there;</PARA>
<PARA> is being handed to clients who are visited at home by Regional field staff;</PARA>
<PARA> is being handed to clients who are visited at home by Mobile Review Team staff; and</PARA>
<PARA> is having the first name and contact number of the field officer who makes the visit written on the pamphlet before it is handed to the client.</PARA>
<PARA> Assurances to this effect are being sought from the Managers in writing. Staff in the National Administration of the Department will check progress on a daily basis. I can report to the Senate that the additional supplies arrived in Adelaide this morning and arrangements were made immediately for them to be delivered to Regional Offices.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees also asked why the information card on appeals rights is not available in all DSS and CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA> This card is a Regional Admissions Procedure (RAP) card. It is different from the home visits pamphlet.</PARA>
<PARA> The Regional Admissions Procedure (RAP) card ``How can I appeal against a decision'' was first distributed to DSS offices on 13 February. An initial distribution of 750 cards went to each office. Since then, offices have been re-supplied on request. The most recent national distribution was another 100 cards per office in the final week of August.</PARA>
<PARA> The CES has declined to display the DSS card because CES has its own appeals leaflet.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Engagement of Ministerial Consultants under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, 1984 (MPO(S) Act)</PARA>
<PARA> The MOP(S) Act provides for Ministers to be able to appoint consultants, subject to the approval of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of Government policy only Cabinet Ministers are entitled to engage consultants. Non-Cabinet Ministers have no automatic entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> The appointment process requires that a Minister write to the Prime Minister seeking approval to engage a particular consultant, setting out the proposed tasks to be performed, the consultant's background and experience, the Minister's view (if any) as to remuneration, and whether the consultant will be engaged full time or part time.</PARA>
<PARA> A copy of this submission is sent to the Secretary of the Department of Industrial Relations, who is responsible for determining the remuneration and other terms and conditions of service of the consultancy</PARA>
<PARA> - this responsibility was formerly vested in the Public Service Board and was delegated to the Secretary in 1987 on the abolition of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary decides the remuneration and terms and conditions taking into account the consultant's background, experience and previous remuneration, the proposed tasks, and the remuneration paid to consultants undertaking similar functions, and any other relevant factors.</PARA>
<PARA> A draft determination setting out the proposed remuneration and terms and conditions is sent to the proposing Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> The Merit Panel, which currently consists of Deputy Secretaries from the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Administrative Services and a nominee of the Minister for Finance, assesses the suitability of the consultant to the proposed task.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter is then considered by Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA> If the consultancy is approved a final determination is issued by the Secretary of the Department of Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services administers the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>Early Termination Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> Where Ministerial Consultants are engaged on a contract of employment, the contract generally provides for a fixed term of employment, not exceeding three years.</PARA>
<PARA> The termination benefit is two months salary for each six months or part thereof of service forgone, with a minimum payment of four months and a maximum payment of twelve months salary</PARA>
<PARA> - where the Minister ceases to be a Minister as a result of an election, one month's salary is paid.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards' termination benefit was calculated on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Lesser benefits are paid where the contract is for a period of twelve months or less.</PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are consistent with the early termination for benefits for fixed term appointees to the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service whose appointments are terminated prematurely on other than health, unsatisfactory service or disciplinary grounds</PARA>
<PARA> - compensation where the appointment is terminated before completion of the turn for which he or she was appointed is based on that part of the term forgone.</PARA>
<PARA> Termination benefits for fixed term SES are equivalent to four months salary for each year of service forgone (for periods less than a year the amount is based on complete months forgone) with a minimum payment of four months and a maximum payment of twelve months salary.</PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal, in its 1985 report on its inquiry into a range of matters, including compensation for loss of office, recommended that compensation be provided for full-time public office holders</PARA>
<PARA> - with compensation to be calculated on the same basis as for Secretaries of Departments and members of the Senior Executive Service employed on a fixed-term basis.</PARA>

<PARA> Can the Minister explain why firms which employ staff on commission are not permitted to claim expenditure for the time spent by such staff attending eligible training programs even though, when calculating the training liability of the business, commission payments made to the same staff are deemed to be part of that firm's payroll?</PARA>

<PARA> Similar questions have been addressed in correspondence and discussions with the Real Estate Institute of Australia, involving my office and officials of my Department and the Australian Taxation Office. Commission payments to staff are not ``directly attributable'' to training, as required under s.25(1) of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. Unlike salary or wages paid to employees during their period of training, commission payments are only incurred during periods of work (eg sales activities) and are not a cost to the employer while the employee is in training.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, commission must be counted in the employer's payroll, for purposes of determining the training obligation of the employer, as required under the definition of ``salary or wages'' in s.4 of the legislation. It is wholly reasonable to include commission in payroll as this is an alternative to other forms of remuneration (such as wages). It would be inequitable to employers in other industries if employers in commission-based industries had a much reduced or no obligation to train because commissions were excluded from payroll.</PARA>
<PARA> Salaries and commissions are both forms of remuneration to employees and therefore form part of payroll for purposes of the Training Guarantee. The essential difference is that salaries are paid to employees during their training and work periods whereas commission is only payable when the employees are in a working situation.</PARA>

My involvement was to this extent: I gave the Civil Aviation Authority, whose prime responsibility, and mine, is aviation safety, of which this country has a proud record, two priorities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try not to keep the Senate very long. I shall be as brief as Senator Collins was. I draw the attention of Senator Collins to this matter: he accused the Opposition of what Senator Button attempted to do. In other words, Senator Collins was saying that it is the Opposition that is calling on the Minister to intervene in this contract. But the truth of the matter is that it is the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, who has called on the Minister to intervene in the matter. I see that Senator Collins understands that clearly-he has had to storm out of the chamber because it is too much for him. He cannot take it. The truth of the matter is that we are now in a situation where the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is trying to persuade the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to intervene in this contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time this Government got involved in its `privatisation policy'-a privatisation policy under which one does not privatise-a number of us on the Opposition side pointed out that all the Government was doing was creating independent government monopolies which left the Government in a situation where it wholly owned an organisation but had no control over it. This is one of the best examples of the disaster of the Australian Labor Party's policy in this area. Here is a body which is independent of the Government but which operates for the Government. How does the Government control that? That is the first problem. Senator Collins has accused us of doing what, in fact, he should be accusing Senator Button of doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that Senator Collins now says that all these tender prices have 50 per cent Australian contribution. There is no doubt that that has happened only as a result of the representations which have been made by Senator Button and his Department. The tenderers have been told in effect that if they want to be in this game they had better give Australian companies some sort of input into their tender arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone should clearly understand that we have criticised the CAA because, from the word go, it limited the tenderers to six named companies. It was not an open tendering situation at all. Australian companies had no right to tender; indeed, any company other than the six named tenderers had no right to tender. As we indicated to Senator Collins by way of interjection, this was a rigged tender from the start because it was limited by the CAA to those six tenderers. Senator Button has rightly indicated to Senator Collins that a wrong procedure was being adopted by this government's `private organisation'.</PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to require the tabling of the tape recording of discussions between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and representatives of conservationist groups. </PARA>
<PARA>We have to debate this motion because the credibility of a Minister is on the line. But of much more importance is the credibility of the leading conservationists in Australia, who have all said quite clearly and in an uncomplicated way that Mrs Kelly, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, is not telling the truth about the meeting at which she said-I do not say, `is alleged to have said'-that Mr Hawke's new federalism was crass politics. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be important and urgent enough to have this motion discussed if the intention were simply to establish whether Mrs Kelly failed to tell the truth in the other chamber-whether she failed to tell the truth to the people of Australia-about what she had said. It is far more important when we have Mrs Kelly defaming the good name of all those conservation leaders who have gone on record as saying that Mrs Kelly did describe Mr Hawke's new federalism as crass politics. I do not believe that it is proper for this chamber or for the Parliament as a whole to allow the clear implications of Mrs Kelly's statements to remain unchallenged. In particular, I think it is important that the people of Australia should not be left in a situation where the integrity of those conservation leaders is left in doubt because of Mrs Kelly's assertions or, indeed, the assertions of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the other chamber just a little while ago in Question Time when he claimed that a member of his staff had heard the tape and, as a result, the Prime Minister had no problems with this matter. If that is so, there is no problem here because there is nothing to hide. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reason for keeping this tape private is if there is something to hide. What is there to hide? Mrs Kelly said that she cannot reveal this because it is a private conversation. She has repeated that several times. How curious that it is a private conversation. All the participants in that conversation are happy for it to be revealed, except one person-Mrs Kelly. She is the only person who is being charged effectively with having misled the House of Representatives, with having misled the people of Australia and, in fact, with having impugned the good name and the integrity of those conservationists who, with clear recollection, have said exactly what Mrs Kelly told that meeting. The only private element of that meeting is that Mrs Kelly wants it to stay private. She does not want that tape to be released, revealing to us exactly what she did say and whether the conservationists were totally right and she was totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other chamber just now, my colleague Mr Chaney said that various conservationists-for example, Mr Toyne-have said that they have absolutely no difficulties about the material being disclosed. There are no difficulties in truth and honesty in revealing what is on the tape and in it being tabled here. There are difficulties in Mrs Kelly having to stand by her statement that she did not claim that Mr Hawke's new federalism was crass politics. The only conclusion, unless this tape is tabled, is that Mrs Kelly is the one who is misleading the Australian people and the conservationists are telling the truth. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be supporting the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. We draw a clear distinction between the motion for the suspension and the substantive motion which we will debate when this motion is passed. I indicate that we are supporting the suspension on the ground that the Government's policy of new federalism, which was the subject of several questions to Senator Button today and to Senator Richardson yesterday, is a very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the sharp differences that I draw between our position and that of the Opposition is that it is more concerned about drawing a wedge between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) than it is about the substantive issue of new federalism. That substantive issue is the important one to get to. One of the reasons we will be supporting the motion for the suspension is that we want to get to that debate. We hope when we get to the debate that new federalism will be the issue debated. To the extent that the revelations on this tape indicate the differences between the Minister and the Prime Minister, they do bear on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply observe, also in passing, that the Opposition is able to shove this wedge between a Minister and a Prime Minister because of the very tight party policy of both the Government and the Opposition, a policy that prevents the public from seeing the wide range of options that should be available in a democratic society and that will allow the public to indicate whether it supports the policy of new federalism-supported, incidentally, by the Opposition possibly even more strongly than by the Government-or whether it would choose a different policy, namely, one of much stronger and more effective Federal control over the environment. We will be supporting the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders and in the substantive debate we will deal with those issues. </PARA>

<PARA> I rise only to comment on one point Senator Michael Baume mentioned a few minutes ago. What we want-and I hope the honourable senator listens to this-is a factual and straightforward debate. That is not assisted when Senator Baume comes into this chamber and says that a few minutes ago in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave an answer saying that a member of his staff had listened to the tape and said the opposite-said something about it. What the Prime Minister said was that a member of his staff had read the relevant transcript, not that he had listened to the tape. </PARA>

<PARA> That there be laid on the table, on or before 11 September 1991, the tape recording of the discussions held on or about 4 September 1991 between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Honourable R. J. Kelly, MP, and representatives of conservationist groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Robert Ray asked that this debate be factual and straightforward. What a shame that Senator Ray when making that request seemed so determined to avoid the substance of the merits of this matter. The merits are very straightforward and simple. Is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, in this particular case telling the truth or not, and is she impugning the integrity of conservationist leaders who have a totally different view and a totally different memory of what went on at that meeting on or about 4 September 1991, at which she described the new federalism of Mr Hawke as `crass politics?'. </PARA>
<PARA> All we have heard from the Government so far in the preliminary debate about whether we should have this debate was Senator Ray's suggestion that the coalition was on the wrong track and that I was telling what he said were `lies'-a word he had to withdraw. He said that I had claimed that Mr Hawke's staffer had heard a tape. Mea maxima culpa: he did not hear the tape; he read a transcript of the tape. Presumably, unless the transcript of the tape was doctored, he was as good as hearing the tape and he was aware of the contents of the tape. That is the matter of substance that this Government does not want to approach. It does not want to talk about the serious issues in this matter. The substance is that Mr Hawke's staffer saw a transcript. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suddenly alerted; I am cautious following Senator Ray's comments. If Mr Hawke's staffer did not actually hear the tape, will this be Mr Hawke's excuse when the transcript reveals, if it ever does come out, that the conservationists were right and Mrs Kelly was misleading the people of Australia and the Parliament? Will this be Mr Hawke's excuse for not taking action? Will he now say, `The transcript was doctored'? It seems to be the significance of Senator Ray's most curious intervention that there is some significant difference; a difference in substance between the tape-recording we have asked to be tabled and the transcript that Mr Hawke's staffer saw. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that I had not recognised that there was such a risk. I did not think that a Minister of the Crown would provide the Prime Minister with a doctored transcript, but obviously Senator Ray thinks it is a very real possibility. Senator Ray is, after all, Mr Hawke's campaign manager. At least he is one of the two of them. I believe that the other, Senator Bolkus, is fairly wobbly at the moment. Senator Ray is one of the two campaign managers for Mr Hawke's keeping the prime ministership and-surprise, surprise!-Mrs Kelly is in the other camp, the Keating camp. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe there is a real reason for Senator Ray to express those concerns that the transcript was doctored and maybe that is why he made such a fuss about it. But this is a far more serious matter than just one of a tired, discredited ministry doctoring a transcript of what was supposed to have been said and giving it to the Prime Minister. It is far more serious than that. This is an issue which goes to the integrity of a Minister and the implications of her assertions about the integrity of the leaders of the conservation movement, who have clearly and uncomplicatedly said what was said and have confirmed repeatedly the comments that have been widely reported about Mrs Kelly saying that the whole process of the new federalism was crass politics. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue is central because what Mrs Kelly was saying-and I believe it will be supported by the tape when it is tabled-was that she is sabotaging the whole basis of the Government's policy in this area. She may well have a great desire to sabotage the Government's policy in this area. After all, she has a great desire to sabotage the Government-or at least the Government of this Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my Leader says, she is backing Mr Keating. So there would be nothing strange, unusual or untoward about Mrs Kelly using this opportunity, in what she now describes as a private meeting, to undermine the Prime Minister or to try to repair some fences with the environmental movement. No doubt this is what it is all about. She was trying to have two bob each way: she was telling one story to the environmental movement and another to her Government. She was behaving in an inappropriate and unacceptable way for a Minister or, in fact, for any member of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What intrigues me is that here is a Minister, whose statements are totally challenged and who is in effect facing a charge of falsehood, being defended by Senator Robert Ray's mock outrage at the fact that I had said one of Mr Hawke's staff had heard a copy of the tape rather than seen a copy of the transcript. If that is the best the Government can do-I look forward to hearing what Senator Richardson has to say-and if it cannot cope with the substance of this matter, it is even more bankrupt than it has made Australia. This is a disgraceful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with the matter of whether this was a private meeting and therefore should not be revealed. Not one member of the conservation movement who attended that meeting has expressed the view that this matter should not be made public. As the Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation told my colleague Mr Chaney, `I have absolutely no difficulties about the material being disclosed'. The coordinator of the West Australian Conservation Council, Ms Rachel Siewert, is reported in this morning's Australian as having said that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . she would have regarded the meeting as private, but Mrs Kelly had ``put it up for grabs'' when she said on Thursday that the conservationists had raised none of their public grievances at the meeting, a statement Ms Siewert said was not true. </PARA>
<PARA>That is charge No. 2 of untruth against Mrs Kelly. Is it possible that all the conservationists are totally wrong in their recollections and that the only person with an accurate memory is Mrs Kelly? Of course there is the tape recording, but we cannot hear it because we are not allowed to hear it. The Minister in this chamber, Senator Richardson, said, `No, we will not table it'. Mrs Kelly has said today in the other place that no, she will not table it. We have to believe Mrs Kelly as against the combined leadership of the conservation movement-or a large proportion of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The coordinator of the Conservation Council of the South-East Region and Canberra, Mr Rodney Falconer, said yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . when referring to new federalism, Mrs Kelly said it was a piece of crass politics. </PARA>
<PARA> She did not point to any individual or group when she used the term . . . she definitely used it to describe what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in total conflict with the statement by Mrs Kelly. When Mr Hawke was asked what he was going to do about this, he said that he had more important things to do than listen to the tape. He had more important things to do than to find out the facts about the extent to which one of his senior Ministers has either misled him or misled the conservation movement. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, this is a very central issue. I believe that what Mrs Kelly is trying to do-that is, sabotage the Government's policy-is something that maybe the conservation movement would welcome. But she has done it by trying to sabotage the integrity of the leaders of the conservation movement. As long as that tape remains not tabled, their word is in doubt in the minds of Australians because Mrs Kelly is in effect saying that they are not telling the truth and she is. </PARA>
<PARA> On those grounds, I believe that there is an unassailable case for this motion to be passed. A failure to pass this motion means that we are condemning those conservation leaders as people whose word is not to be trusted. I do not believe that that is an acceptable position. I believe it proper that Mrs Kelly should resolve this matter by ensuring that the Government makes the tape available to be tabled in this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this motion because I am concerned that the whole system of the Government's decision making process is grinding to a halt. This Government is incapable of making a decision of any significance because it is too tied up in the stupid fight between Mr Keating and the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, on who wants to be leader of the Australian Labor Party and the Government. Every aspect of government these days is determined by the question of who wants to be and who has the numbers to be the leader of the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are real problems with the environment and unemployment. Almost one million Australians are out of work. What does this Government do about those matters? It fights about who should be leader. Mrs Kelly deliberately set about to promote her candidate, Mr Keating, by destabilising Mr Hawke. That is what this is all about. She said these things, she accused the Prime Minister's new federalism of being crass politics, because she knew that that would create destabilisation in the Labor Party and in the conservation movement, most members of which are also members of the Labor Party. She deliberately set about to create this confusion and instability in the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly does not give a damn about the environment. She is more concerned in holding her position of power as Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. She knows, quite rightly, that as long as Mr Hawke stays as Leader of the Labor Party she has no chance of being the Minister for the Environment after the next election because she will be on the back bench-that is, if she is fortunate enough to retain her seat. Mrs Kelly knows, as does Senator Richardson, that as long as Mr Hawke is leader they have no chance of retaining power and of being in government. That is why they have to get rid of Hawke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Hawke. They do not care how they do it or who they hurt in getting to that conclusion. They are determined, in whatever way possible, to destabilise Mr Hawke. That is okay-I do not particularly care about that-but it is no good for Australia. That is what this debate is all about: it is a silly little matter about what was said. It could be very easily cleared up but, instead, we are left with three or four days of newspaper speculation and time being taken up in the Parliament on who is telling the truth. Is Mrs Kelly telling the truth or are the conservation leaders telling the truth? Which one is it? We have had three days of debate and uncertainty and government decision making is just falling down while members of the Labor Party indulge themselves in these family wars on who should be leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of making the hard decisions on the environment, we have this petty debate about what Mrs Kelly said. Mrs Kelly should be more concerned about what is happening in the environment. For example, she should be out there making the decisions on Tully-Millstream. She should be finding out why the Queensland Government is stalling on that issue and why it will not give the Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories the information it needs to come to a conclusion on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Is Mrs Kelly concerned about that? Of course she is not. She is more concerned about retaining her job. To do that she has to get rid of Mr Hawke. The whole Government should be doing something about the one million Australians who are unemployed. But are Ministers interested in doing that? They are more interested in trying to get rid of Mr Hawke so that they have some chance of maintaining their position in the Government. They know that as long as Mr Hawke stays they have no chance of getting back. The Government is breaking up over this continued leadership destabilisation, this continued leadership crisis, and Mrs Kelly is determined to stir it up. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were genuine about this-and this is what the motion comes down to-there is a very easy way to get rid of the question and to stop all the foolishness and pettiness that is going around in the Labor Party. We need to know exactly what is on the tape. That is a very simple answer. It does not require any great intelligence to reach that conclusion-even members of the Labor Party could think of that. All that the Labor Party has to do is show what is on the tape. All the indecision and controversy will then go away and the Government will be able to get on with trying to run the country and trying to do something with the one million who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Will Mrs Kelly produce the tape? Will she let us all hear it? If she did, the controversy and indecision would be over in a flash. We would all be able to hear it; we would all know what was on it. We would be able to find out what she said and what she did not say. We would know whether she is telling the truth or whether the conservation people are telling the truth. It is very easy to have such an outcome-all she has to do is table the tape. </PARA>
<PARA> Why will Mrs Kelly not table the tape? The answer, the conclusion, to this problem seems to be very simple. Mrs Kelly knows that if she does not table the tape the matter will continue to grab headlines and continue to destabilise Mr Hawke. In that way, she has more chance of getting her favoured candidate, Mr Keating, elected as leader of the failing Labor Party. That is what it is all about. Obviously, Mrs Kelly is not prepared to put aside the petty politics and allow the tape to be tabled so that we can all hear and know what it is about and get on with the job that we are supposed to be doing. That is why I urge that the Senate pass this motion. Once we know what is on the tape we will be able to get on with the job that needs to be done here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion strikes at the very heart of the credibility of the Government. As has already been said, on the one hand we have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) saying that she said one thing and, on the other hand, we have the conservationists saying that she said that Mr Hawke's new federalism policy was `crass politics'. The Minister says that she was referring to the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hawke must come out and prove once and for all who is telling the truth. Otherwise the conservationists will be left with a cloud hanging over their heads, because the Minister has virtually said that they are lying. We cannot allow that situation to continue. I am not accusing the Minister of lying. She has the opportunity to prove that she was telling the truth. Indeed, she has the opportunity to tell the people of Australia that she was telling the truth. The conservationists also have the right to tell the people of Australia that they were telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Macdonald has already said, this seems to be such a small and paltry matter. But the credibility of a Minister is at stake. The fact that she has been accused of misleading the House is a very important issue; it is something that must be resolved. What benefit would the conservationists get out of saying that the Minister had said that Mr Hawke's new federalism policy was just `crass politics'? I do not believe that the conservationists would get anything out of it. So I do not know why they would have made such a statement if it were not the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand what Mrs Kelly could get out of it. As has already been indicated, she is a keen supporter of Mr Keating. So she could get something out of it if she were not telling the truth. She could have made the point at that meeting that it was just `crass politics' by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I am not in any way accusing the Minister of telling lies. I am just saying to her: prove it; produce the tapes. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the conservationists, Ms Siewert, has said that she believed the meeting was private. However, the Minister brought the meeting to the attention of the public by claiming that the conservationists had not advanced any grievances. Again, they said that that was not true-they had advanced their grievances. It was the Minister who first brought that so-called private meeting into the public arena. It is the conservationists who now say, `Produce the tape. We have no objection at all if you produce that tape and make public who was right and who was wrong'. As I have said, unless the truth is established, the conservationists will be under a cloud. The Prime Minister will also be under a cloud and so will the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Why will the Prime Minister not produce the tape? Is it because he really does believe that the Minister was rubbishing him at a private meeting with the conservationists? Is it because he is terrified to make it public that yet another Minister has been undermining him behind his back at a private meeting? Is that why he will not produce the tape? Is that why he says that he will not listen to the tape because he has better things to do?</PARA>

One is listening to the tape and the other is reading a transcript. We might be naive on this side but we thought it was one and the same thing. It did not even enter our heads that it could have been doctored-but it certainly entered the head of Senator Ray. He pointed out very quickly to us that it was not a matter of listening to the tape; it was reading the transcript. He pointed out very quickly, forcefully and forthrightly that there was a vast difference; that we should not say that it was a matter of listening to the tape; that we should clarify the matter; that it was a matter of reading the transcript. We might be a bit naive because we are used to truth on this side. But it was very obvious that Senator Ray clearly understood the vast difference. If that tape is produced, Senator Ray wants it very clearly identified that the Prime Minister and his staff really did not know what was on it because they looked only at the transcript.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to the point I made at the beginning of my speech. I am not accusing the Minister of telling lies. I am not accusing the conservationists of telling lies. But I believe that, until the tape is produced, a cloud hangs over the heads of the conservationists, the Minister and certainly the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few brief words in support of the motion moved by my colleague Senator Michael Baume calling on the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to produce the taped recording of her discussions last week with eminent conservationists. Much of what I wanted to say has already been said, so I shall be very brief. The reason I intervene in this debate is, importantly, the grave damage Mrs Kelly's reported remarks-unless they are refuted-have done to the Government's whole cause, its new-found supposed conversion to federalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Mrs Kelly has reportedly done is cast in total doubt the Government's commitment to the federalism that for more than a year has been espoused by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, therefore, her own Government, and has been the basis of discussions between the Federal and State governments in a series of major Special Premiers Conferences on which the Prime Minister has pinned an enormous amount of his own and the Government's personal credibility. If the Minister for the environment criticised the Government's policies-it does not matter whether she used the words `Prime Minister'-if she criticised the policy of so-called new federalism as crass politics, she was criticising what this Government, since the last election in the middle of 1990, has placed to the forefront in terms of its policy proposals and advances for the future. Mrs Kelly is therefore putting at great risk a policy of the Government of which she is a leading member. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly has placed at great risk the Government's credibility in relation to its approach to federalism. She has also placed at grave risk several other credibilities. First of all, she has placed her own credibility on the line. Mrs Kelly's credibility is absolutely on the line because, in the absence of evidence, she is asking us to believe that the eminent conservationists in this country with whom she has been having discussions over recent days are lying. Her credibility is absolutely shot if she does not give evidence to refute that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly has gravely damaged the reputation of those very eminent conservationists. She has put at risk the credibility of the conservation movement in Australia, and she is the Minister responsible for conservation. The Minister's credibility is at risk. The conservationist's credibility is at risk. The Government's supposed approach to federalism is at risk. Therefore, the Prime Minister's credibility is on the line over this. As I said, it is the Prime Minister who has put such an enormous amount of his own personal effort and reputation behind the federalism policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are four or five very major concerns that the Government, Mrs Kelly, the Parliament and the people of Australia should have. They can all be cleared up very easily and very quickly. All that has to happen is for the Minister to make public-as requested by the Opposition-the taped record of her discussion with the conservationists. The conservationists have said that they have no objection to that. Why on earth, therefore, would Mrs Kelly have any objections to that taping of her discussions being made public if her report of those discussions is correct?</PARA>
<PARA> If those tapings are not made public, one can draw at least two conclusions, both of which I believe are very damaging to the whole parliamentary process-the process of democracy in this country. One will only be able to draw the conclusion that either Mrs Kelly is lying or she has deliberately set out, as part of this ongoing bitter leadership fight, to sabotage one of the shopfront, forefront to the public policies of this Government, namely, its approach to federalism. Behind all of that lies the battle of Mr Hawke versus Mr Keating for the prime ministership, because the only way Mr Keating is ever going to become Leader of the Labor Party is to whittle away continually at the Prime Minister's credibility. What stronger way could that be done in a policy sense than to have one of the key supporters of the Keating push for prime ministership undermine-sabotage from within-one of the fundamental Government policies that it has wheeled up for the life of this Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is ironic but perhaps very understandable that the Minister in this chamber who is obviously going to rise to defend Mrs Kelly and her actions in not releasing the tapes is none other than Senator Richardson. He and Mrs Kelly are two of the very few Ministers in the Hawke Cabinet who are bitterly opposed to the Prime Minister's continuing leadership of the Government and who, over weeks and months, have worked assiduously and unceasingly to change that situation and to install Mr Keating as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Many credibilities and reputations are on the line. If the tape of the proceedings is not released, not only will all of those credibilities suffer grievously but, as a result, the whole parliamentary process will suffer grievously. The short and long term implications of that for the people of Australia are very serious. </PARA>

I should have thought that, in listening to Mr Chaney today, we were hearing a lot more about what is actually happening in the Liberal Party. He is far more worried about Senator Crichton-Browne and what he is up to than anything that is occurring in the leadership of the Labor Party. I happen to have here a copy of the West Australian of only 6 September. This is hot-off-the-press stuff. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The bitterness between rival senior Liberals Noel Crichton-Browne and Fred Chaney escalated yesterday when both men took to the airwaves to defend their positions. </PARA>
<PARA> In a series of media interviews, the two men exchanged barbs publicly for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on; and there is another article on the same matter. The problem for me in trying to go through those two articles and expose the bitter division, which Senator Crichton-Browne says could cost the Liberals government at the next election, is that they have as much relevance to this debate as all the contributions of people such as Senator Short and Senator Macdonald. I would much rather concentrate on the substance of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In this chamber in very recent times I can recall a debate that concerned Senator Bolkus, as Minister for Administrative Services, tabling documents. In the end the Senate quite correctly made a decision that those documents did not have to be tabled, that there was no reason to force their tabling. In the end, as I also recall, the Minister tabled them in any event. The point was that the Senate got the principle right, and it is that that I hope can still be done here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The day I become jealous of Senator Kemp, I will be out at the Gap very quickly, but do not hang by the neck waiting for that day. As I was saying, we have to have a proper reason for going around those freedom of information requests, and we do not have one. All we have from the Opposition is an attempt at politicking on the issue. The Senate has to consider whether the Senator Macdonald contribution of `Let's get in and make the hard decisions; let's get in and quickly have the Tully-Millstream dam' is the real reason behind today's debate or whether there is a genuine reason to have the tape produced by next Monday, as outlined in the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can only speculate as to what might be on this tape. But, if Mrs Kelly has cast aspersions upon some people in the States at a private meeting or if other participants in the meeting have done the same thing, one wonders why that should be in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason one has private meetings is that one can make those comments without their being in the public domain. If the Opposition attempts to just pull the rug out from under the process of ever having a private meeting then the functioning of government is going to become very difficult indeed. But it does not stop there because it goes into the Opposition as well. At what point does one draw a line about producing in public the records of private meetings? One wonders whether there is one honourable senator capable of saying that there is nothing said in private that he or she would mind being in the public arena, because all of us at private meetings--</PARA>

If there are private discussions between Mrs Kelly and a constituent group-normally these are the representatives of the peak bodies of the conservation movement around Australia and it has been the practice that sometimes the participants will vary from meeting to meeting-it should be, as it has certainly always been the practice,  that they are private meetings. If the Opposition says to Mrs Kelly or indeed any Minister that no longer can private meetings be regarded as such, then the capacity of the Government to deal with constituent groups will be severely hampered. It is that which I would hope does not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today some honourable senators have attempted to canvass the broader debate. They have tried to turn this into an opportunity simply to comment on the processes of discussions between the Commonwealth and the States on the environment. As the Prime Minister has said, the Commonwealth will be giving up none of its environmental powers at all-not one. What we have is Mrs Kelly's Department holding the tape of a private meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate, for the most crass political reasons-to use a phrase we are hearing a bit of in this debate-is attempting to have the normal freedom of information legislation bypassed by requiring the tape to be produced next Monday. It is very doubtful whether the Senate has got the power to make Mrs Kelly do it. On the assumption that the Senate passes a motion and Mrs Kelly refuses, one wonders where we have got.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I actually want to deal with tomorrow because I think what we have to do in the Senate is make sure that legislation which has been passed for the purpose of providing information is adhered to. If requests have gone in-it is not simply a matter of what the Opposition might do but there are certainly those in the gallery who put in requests under the freedom of information provisions-why is it that they cannot be looked at in the normal course of events? If the tape should be produced under FOI, then at the end of the day it gets produced, but only after proper consultation with everyone who made a comment at that meeting and thus might be on the tape. There are many people in that category. Why should they not all be given an opportunity to learn what might be revealed about the things that they said? Why should there not be a reasonable time for all of that to be done before the Minister or the Department makes a decision at the end of what is a proper process that has stood the test of time?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only reason advanced here today is the crass political motive of the Opposition which attempts to say that in some way Mrs Kelly has made a remark in the leadership contest. I might say that it is very hard to say anything, think anything or do anything at the moment without the Opposition accusing us of that. I do not worry about the crass politicking of the day; rather, I worry about process. If those opposite interfere with the proper process here they are making a very big mistake indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a delicious irony in the motion which is before us today in that the Opposition is defending the integrity of the environment movement, which is committed to the wider use of Federal powers-something which, of course, is not shared by members of the Opposition. I find that a particularly delicious irony. We have heard Senator Macdonald today, for instance, argue most vehemently that the Federal Government should not use its Federal powers to protect the World Heritage wet tropics area and the Tully-Millstream proposed development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also a certain irony in the remarks made a few moments ago by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), who claimed that he had delivered on the promises of the Australian Labor Party in this respect. At the last election the Australian Conservation Foundation asked the various parties what their position was in relation to precisely this matter-the use of Federal powers. I have here the document in front of me:</PARA>
<PARA>ALP: Agreed. In addition it has been prepared to use Commonwealth powers to protect some National Estate areas, and International Treaty powers to protect World Heritage areas. It would consider a referendum addressing the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth over the environment. It has used Foreign Investment Review Board powers to protect Shelburne Bay in Queensland. The ALP was also prepared to use these powers to protect the Wet Tropics and Daintree Rainforest in Queensland . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ALP, using its foreign investment review powers, would subject the proposal for the CRA coal fired power station in the proposed Mt Lesueur National Park, in WA, to rigorous environmental tests.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the Government was outlining in there what it proposed in relation to the wider use of Federal powers. I have in front of me the fourth draft of the negotiations which are proceeding between the Commonwealth and the States. We read by contrast under subsection 3.1, Commonwealth responsibilities:</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) specifically consult with and (use its best endeavours to) secure the agreement of the States and Territories at First Minister level prior to entering into any international commitments which impose costs or obligations on the States or Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>This quite clearly indicates that if a State refused it would not use those powers. The draft goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>When ratifying any international agreement on environmental matters, the Commonwealth will include in the instrument of ratification a statement on the manner in which the obligations incurred shall be implemented in Australia. This statement will be consistent with the roles and responsibilities established pursuant to this agreement and may only be made following consultation with the States and Territories at First Minister level. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is deferring to the States. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The States and Territories have and will continue to have primary responsibility for the formulation and implementation of policy in relation to environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on in relation to standards and in relation to environmental damage as a consequence of toxic chemicals and the release of waste materials. Again these standards which would be accepted by the States are the standards which would apply. In relation to World Heritage areas the draft document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth agrees that it will not take action to nominate areas within a State or Territory, for inscription on the World Heritage list where the nomination is contested by the State or Territory in which the proposed nominated area is located. </PARA>
<PARA>The document quite clearly outlines a set of proposals which are completely contrary to the promises made by the Government at the time of the last election, as indicated in its response to the questionnaire which was sent out by the Australian Conservation Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking in support of the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, I also pointed to the way in which both the media and the Opposition-this has also been alluded to by the Minister-have exploited the differences between the Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over this issue rather than discussing the substantive issue: the proper protection of the environment. That has a great bearing on the issue of the public interest when it comes to the release of this tape. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, we see on the front page of this morning's Canberra Times the headline `Kelly refuses to release controversial tape'. We do not see a discussion of the new federalism policy and whether that will better protect or not so well protect the environment but, rather, whether the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, will release the tape. There is a long discussion between Mrs Kelly and Mr Hawke in the second column of the article where we learn that Mr Hawke told Parliament that he had roused Mrs Kelly early on Saturday morning after seeing the newspaper reports:</PARA>
<PARA> `Very calmly I picked up the phone and spoke to my Minister', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> `I must say I woke her from a well-deserved sleep. </PARA>
<PARA>The really important issue-the protection of the environment and the powers that the Federal Government has in that respect and the appropriate use of those powers-is not being addressed by either the Government or the Opposition. Indeed, I think it is fair comment that the Opposition would further weaken the use of those Commonwealth powers-section 51.(i) and section 51.(xx), and the external affairs powers set out in the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated earlier that I find it depressing that where there are clear options for the exercise of powers, or indeed any other powers, to be put before the public-on which the public should be able to make up its mind and determine whether it wants, for instance, Mrs Kelly re-elected at the next election because she more closely expresses the concern of the public for the proper exercise of Commonwealth powers over protection of the environment or whether it wants to re-elect the Prime Minister because he is prepared to give away those powers-that distinction is not able to be presented to the public by either the Government or the Opposition. Indeed, the Opposition seeks to exploit that very difference. Mrs Kelly has said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . `I can't be out of kilter with the Prime Minister's initiatives in new federalism'. </PARA>
<PARA> `For me to even attempt over-riding legislation, I don't think it would even have the support of the Cabinet in the current spirit of co-operation with the States. </PARA>
<PARA>That indicates, unfortunately, part of the way in which our democratic process is not working. It is deeply at fault because the full range of options are not given to the public; they are not available to members of the public to enable them to make up their minds. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, members of the public have a right to know that the Minister for the Environment differs from the Prime Minister in a very important respect if they are going to properly exercise their democratic powers at the next election, or even before the next election, in lobbying the Prime Minister, the Minister or any other member of the Government to change their attitude on new federalism or on any other part of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> That comes to the substantive issue of this motion: whether this tape recording should or should not be released for inspection by the Senate. I agree with the remark made by the Minister that there is a line to be drawn here. Quite clearly, the tape recording of every meeting which occurs in this place should not be made into a public document, into a public disclosure. There are such things as private meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this particular meeting. This was a meeting between the Minister for the Environment and persons, not individuals, representing tens of thousands of environmentalists around Australia-representing the peak conservation bodies at the national level and also the peak conservation bodies in each State. For instance, in my State, well over 60 conservation bodies are associated with the Conservation Council of South Australia. Each of those bodies has many hundreds of members. In a sense, this was not a private meeting; it was very much a public meeting at which representatives of the public were talking to the Minister about a very important aspect of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way as an individual attending that meeting on behalf of a conservation body may well have made a tape recording-in my view, quite legitimately-and taken it back to that person's membership and played it to members, so the tape recording made by the Minister, which is, as it were, an accurate set of minutes, in my view, should also be a public document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume has indicated, the further claim which has been made that conservation groups lied about some of the contents of that meeting calls into question the need to make a public disclosure of that tape. I would not draw the very long bow which the Minister has drawn to say that this opens completely a Pandora's box and that it necessarily means that all tape recordings should be disclosed. In this case, there is a very important public interest. In many respects, this was not a very private meeting; it was a very public meeting, attended by people from a large number of organisations, representing a large constituency of the Australian electorate. For those reasons, and for those reasons specifically, we support this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill gives effect to the Government's undertakings to provide an improved benefit under the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme for those personnel who served in the Middle East. Further, the amendments will recognise other operational service of Defence Force members who choose to revoke their entitlement to the Defence Service Homes loan in order to join the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme, now known as Defence HomeOwner, provides a subsidised housing loan of $40,000 for members of the Defence Force who joined after 14 May 1985. Interest on the loan is subsidised to the extent of 40% of the average interest that would ordinarily be payable over the term of the loan; the individual is required to meet the remaining 60%. The scheme commenced operation on 15 May 1991, and to the end of July some 41 loans had been provided by the National Australia Bank, the authorised lender under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence HomeOwner was essentially designed as a peacetime replacement for the Defence Service Homes scheme, which was closed on 14 May 1985. Defence HomeOwner encourages retention of personnel, and when introduced was not geared to provide a benefit based on war or operational service. Payment of the available interest subsidy is currently linked to completed years of service with a requirement for an initial period of service of six years, for which subsidy is not payable. The existing concession for personnel deployed on operational service in the Gulf is waiver of this six-year basic service period, which is a similar concession to that available under the Defence Service Homes scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that in view of the efforts of our personnel who served in the Middle East during the Gulf War, a revised benefit is appropriate, indeed necessary. Therefore the Government now proposes, as further recognition of these efforts, to provide under Defence HomeOwner a minimum benefit of sixteen years' subsidy, regardless of length of service. Naturally, in the case of those who serve past the sixteen year point subsidy will continue to accrue at the normal rate, to a maximum of twenty years. As widows or widowers of eligible members have the same entitlement that their spouse had accrued at the time of death, the sixteen year benefit of deceased Gulf members will pass to the surviving spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixteen year subsidy period was selected because the amount of subsidy payable over this period equated to the subsidy payable on a Defence Service Homes loan. This was based on present values and the interest rate applying at the time of the Government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change introduced by this Bill is the waiver of the six-year basic eligibility period for Defence Force personnel with operational service prior to the Gulf War who revoke their entitlement to a Defence Service Homes loan in favour of Defence HomeOwner. Under the Defence Service Homes scheme, members with operational service have no basic qualifying period, and it is considered that this benefit should be applicable to personnel with operational service whichever home loan scheme the serving member chooses. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment re-defines the Middle East operational area for the purposes of the Act to include Iraq and Kuwait in accordance with the declaration made at the commencement of the ground war. It also sets a cut-off date of 9 June 1991 for operational service in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Precise costing of providing the sixteen year subsidy to Defence Force personnel with Gulf service is not possible, because each year of service offsets one year of subsidy, and it is difficult to estimate how many years each member will serve. Other variables include the interest rates and annual take-up rates of the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming an interest rate of 13%, average resignation rates and an annual take-up rate of 20% of those eligible, the cost over the next four financial years would be $1.65 million. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation provides additional housing loan benefits to members of the Defence Force who have served their country on operational service as a member of Australia's contingent in the recent Gulf crisis, and builds on the worthwhile and effective scheme introduced earlier in the year by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 is essentially a machinery Bill. It is standard procedure for authorising the financing of an expected deficit of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The point that needs to be made at the outset is that the need for this Bill would not have arisen if the Government had not completely abrogated any pretence at responsible economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is now in the midst of the largest fiscal deterioration since at least the early 1950s and arguably in our history. Over a period of two short years, there has been a deterioration in the Budget outcome of almost $13 billion. It has gone from a surplus of $8 billion in 1989-90 to an expected deficit of $4.7 billion in the current year. In fact, after taking into account the important transactions that are described as `below the line' and which therefore do not appear in the Budget-but which all have the same impact on the economy-the effect of the public sector on economic activity is worse than the headline `Budget deficit' suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> Adjusting for asset sales, transfer of maturing debt to the States, net payments from government business enterprises' superannuation and profit transfers from the Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Bank, the underlying Budget deficit is about $10.7 billion in 1991-92. Compared with an underlying Budget surplus of $6.4 billion in 1989-90, there has, on that measurement, been an overall fiscal deterioration over the past two years of some $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Government's failure to control its spending, the expected deficit on the Consolidated Revenue Fund by 30 June 1992 is $10.2 billion. That deficit will be partly due to the official Budget deficit of $4.7 billion and partly because of some `off-Budget' capital transactions. Hence it is likely that some $5.5 billion could be required from the Loan Fund in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Loan Bill is a financing measure, the coalition will not be opposing it. However, I make it perfectly clear that our willingness to let the Bill pass can in no way be construed as endorsement of the Government's policy or its means of attempting to handle the terrible predicament it has created for itself. Indeed, the Government can only be condemned for its abject failure. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Australia is crying out for national leadership, all Government members can do is fight amongst themselves over who should lead the tattered remains of the Australian Labor Party. At a time when every effort should have been put into establishing the right climate for investment and jobs on a sustainable basis, this Budget is reduced to an exercise in protecting one job-the job of the failing Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Given the long term damage to the lives of millions of average Australians which the Government has caused, it is difficult to rationalise or comprehend how a party which calls itself the Labor Party and which once had a reputation-now nothing more than a distant memory-for concern for the well-being of working people could become such an instrument of destruction. That is an irony which must be profoundly depressing to philosophers of the labour movement. </PARA>
<PARA> But that does not seem to concern members of this Government. For one reason, they are not philosophers; for another, their focus is on preserving political power and their privileges, not on the well-being of average Australians. Why else would they have so callously thrown one million people out of work?</PARA>
<PARA> Nobody has made a greater mess of economic management over the past 60 years than this Government. Its recent Budget worsens the underlying problems because it does nothing to encourage savings, investment and, therefore, long term job creation. For that reason, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) engineering the worst economic recession for 60 years;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) knowingly putting over one million people out of work;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) its economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility revealed in the Budget;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) failing to create a climate for increased national savings, investment, growth and jobs;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) not curtailing its own purpose spending, running a reckless deficit and plundering the savings of households and firms; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) providing no leadership, no example and no hope to the people of Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA>The recent Budget fails to recognise the underlying problems of the economy. It certainly does not do anything to correct the basic causes of the economic mess which the Government has created. The evidence of that mess is all around us. It is mainly due to the fact that, under Labor, savings and investment have collapsed. As a result, so have jobs and living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at what has happened to job vacancies. Opportunities for work have been destroyed by this Government's policy failure. Two years ago the ratio of job vacancies per 1,000 unemployed was 145 : 1. The job vacancies ratio is now 32 : 1. Two years ago, the number of job vacancies was 69,500; it is now 25,700-a fall of more than two-thirds. This Government's incompetence has wrecked the business environment. If honourable senators have any doubts about that, they should go and talk to any firm which is struggling to survive under the yoke of this Government and ask them what they think of Labor. The number of bankruptcies has soared from 7,000 in 1989 to 16,000 this year and they are still rising. There is little prospect of new investment and employment with business being clobbered by such a bizarre caricature of a government as the economic vandals now in power. </PARA>
<PARA> Living standards have actually fallen under Labor. Average Australians are worse off now than when Labor came to government. In real terms, an average Australian family-a husband on full time average weekly earnings; a wife working part time on one-third of average weekly earnings; plus two children-is 2.7 per cent worse off in 1991 than it was in 1983. Were it not for the family allowance payments-which are transfer payments and do not represent an increase in national wealth as such-the real fall in living standards for the average family would be almost 5 per cent. So living standards have fallen for those average families-and they are average families who are doing well because they have jobs. Living standards have been absolutely decimated for those who have been thrown onto the scrap heap of unemployment due to Labor's policy failures. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has failed abjectly. The fundamental reason for this failure is the Government's inability to understand that an economy cannot grow without a level of domestic savings sufficient to sustain that growth. The most important economic problem Australia now faces is the low level of savings. Without savings there can be no investment. That is a basic fact of life that seems not to have dawned on those opposite, many of whom still seem to believe that money comes from taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> For Australia merely to sustain the minimum economic growth rate of 3 per cent required just to absorb new entrants into the labour force, let alone provide real per capita growth, we need to invest at least 25 per cent of national output. But total spending on fixed capital accounted for only 21.8 per cent of gross domestic product last year, a shortfall of some 15 to 20 per cent, and is expected to fall further over the current year. As a result we are going backwards; we are losing ground. Far from achieving a growth rate of 3 per cent, which is the bare minimum required, there is virtually no growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not hard to see why. The net operating surplus of firms-what they have left to invest after covering costs and paying taxes-has plummeted. In the year to June just ended it fell by 6 per cent. Under Labor the profit share of gross domestic product has deteriorated ever since it came into office. Labor of course does not like profits. It does not like the idea of investors getting a return on their capital. That is a fundamental part of Labor's ideological baggage. That is why the economic policy failures that we have seen throughout the past years of Labor government are there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister claimed three weeks ago in the House of Representatives that `company profits as a share of GDP are still above the long term average of the last 15 years', but-not for the first time-he has wilfully misled the Australian Parliament and the people. The truth, according to the Government's own Budget Papers, is that when account is taken of the impact of company tax and interest payments, the profit share as a proportion of GDP is now at its lowest level for over 20 years. That is shown in Budget Paper No. 1, pages 2.24 and 2.25. </PARA>
<PARA> With such a fall-off in net surplus or profits, investment has inevitably plunged. Private gross fixed capital expenditure fell by 13.7 per cent last year and is expected by the Government to fall a further 6 per cent in real terms in 1991-92. I believe that expectation is conservative. For more than a year business has been telling the Government that it is badly underestimating the downturn in business investment spending. For 1991-92 the firm of Syntec, which has a very good track record in the forecasting area, estimates a real contraction in business investment of 18 per cent. If it is right, or even near the mark, the fall in business investment over the past two years will approach 30 per cent. Such a dramatic collapse would be a national crisis. For over a million people it already is. The lesson of these events is the immutable link between profits, savings and investment. That may not suit the ideology of the Labor Party, but it cannot be denied or avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is happening to the level of savings under Labor? The household savings ratio has now fallen to 4 per cent. That is the lowest figure ever recorded. Total savings for the nation as a proportion of gross domestic product have fallen from 25 per cent in 1983-84 to 21.9 per cent in 1990-91-a fall again of about 10 to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The fall in Australia's savings has been the largest since the 1950s. With that collapse in savings, where will the investment funds come from? Without a fundamental diversion of funds away from consumption into productivity-improving investment, there will either be a fall in Australian investment or more capital inflow from abroad. Given the parlous state of our balance of payments, borrowing more money from overseas cannot be considered as an ongoing solution to the problems which this Government has created. Our net foreign liabilities already stand at $177 billion, a twentyfold increase over the past eight to 10 years. Of the $177 billion, foreign-owned equity is $47 billion and the debt factor is $130 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Servicing that debt will place massive demands on the Australian economy for many years into the future. Paying off the mortgage is the legacy which this selfish and shortsighted government has left to the Australians of the future, to our children and our grandchildren. The cost of servicing our foreign debt is today running at $17 billion a year, or some 4.5 per cent of our total national product. </PARA>
<PARA> The stark fact is that at least 4.5 per cent of what Australians produce at present is not available for use by Australians. Instead, it must be converted into another currency and sent overseas to pay for the debt that has been accumulated by the disastrous economic policies of this Government. It is about time that the Government came clean with the people of Australia about the disaster it has caused. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I ask rhetorically: what do consumers think about the outlook under Labor? I have talked about investors and savers, but in regard to consumers the latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research index of consumer sentiment shows that people are pessimistic. Can one blame them? They are now more pessimistic about their own financial situation and about the prospect of improvements in the economy in the coming year. The inescapable fact is that average Australians do not have confidence in Labor. Labor has lost the confidence of the people. It is incapable of making the necessary reforms to encourage investment and restore Australia to growth and prosperity. The 1991 Budget, the deficit in which is the reason for the Loan Bill we are now debating, is a disaster for business confidence, for investment and therefore inevitably for both existing employment and job creation in Australia for a very long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, although the Opposition does not oppose this Bill it feels very strongly about the amendment that it has moved to the second reading. In particular, it once again draws the attention of this Parliament and the Australian people to the cruel hard fact that the policies of this Government have put more than one million people out of work. When the family factor is taken into account, those policies have devastated many millions of Australians. They have condemned them to a hardship that will be an almost intractable problem to solve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991. This is the second Loan Bill to be debated this calendar year because of the decline in the Government's fiscal position during the Government's own recession. This collapse in economic activity meant that loan funds were needed at the end of the last financial year, even though the Government achieved a surplus approaching $2 billion for the year as a whole. The absence of a Loan Bill during previous years reflects the fact that the Commonwealth has been running substantial surpluses since 1987-88, but the purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1991-92 Budget deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The technical necessity for this Bill is not strictly related to whether the Budget is in surplus or deficit. Rather, it is necessary to balance a projected deficit in the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund. We are always told that the Consolidated Revenue Fund must not end the year in deficit. Indeed, the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that the exact legal reason for this is unclear, and certainly I have not been able to find any explanation for that statement. I ask the Minister to state the exact legal necessity in order to clarify this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Consolidated Revenue Fund is created by section 81 of the Australian Constitution, and all revenues or moneys raised or received by the Government must be deposited in that account. Even though this wording clearly covers loans raised by the Commonwealth, when the Audit Act was passed in 1901 it created both a loan fund, through section 55, and a trust fund, through section 60. There is, therefore, one main bank account called the Commonwealth Public Account. However, transactions are recorded in three separate accounts: the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund. In the first 10 years of Federation only the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Trust Fund operated. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Loan Act was passed in 1911. From this time until the Second World War, all recurrent revenue and expenditure were channelled through the Consolidated Revenue Fund, whilst all loan raising and capital expenditure were conducted through the Loan Fund. As I said before, some explanation of the necessity for raising loan funds in this way would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill specifies that the expenditure to be made from the Loan Fund is defence expenditure; that is, any defence expenditure otherwise authorised by the Parliament which is incurred after the Bill receives royal assent may be made from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund, thereby reducing or eliminating any deficit which may otherwise occur in that account. The reason defence expenditure is used to effect the appropriation is twofold: firstly, the defence budget is always large-in fact, the Australian Democrats believe that it is far too large; and, secondly and most importantly, clause 4, which grants the Treasurer the right to borrow money necessary to finance the expenditure authorised by clause 5, avoids the necessity for obtaining the approval of the Loan Council for the borrowings for defence purposes, which could indeed be politically embarrassing. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill-clauses 6 and 7- authorises the Treasurer to borrow money to supplement any deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund which may arise. It is not yet certain whether this authority will be necessary this year. All such moneys are to be applied to the Consolidated Revenue Fund except for that amount relating to the expense of borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 is not opposed by the Australian Democrats since the Bill is merely a technical machinery measure rather than a substantive one. The substantive measures in the Government's financial and fiscal policy have been announced in the recently delivered, and universally condemned, Commonwealth Budget. With one million unemployed one could have expected a Labor Treasurer to have introduced a range of measures to boost the economy and to reduce unemployment. Instead, he is budgeting for higher unemployment-an average of 10.5 per cent; a declining job market-down 1.75 per cent; a further decline in household savings; and, indeed, a collapse in private investment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no measures that seek to redress that in the short, medium or long term. The intelligent society is further away. Modest additional funds for tertiary institutions are welcome; but, to pay for these, higher cost barriers have been erected against students-an increase of $144m to the tertiary tax. However, none of this amounts to anything like a clear economic strategy to get Australia out of the recession, and the new Treasurer is proving that he can bear the misfortunes of others with great calm and fortitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties should be pleased. Their economic policy is in good hands. It is quite clear that, despite the statements Senator Short made at the Wailing Wall about the policies of the Government and their destructive social and economic effects, there are no measures the Opposition parties are putting forward that have any chance of addressing the coming calamitous situation. They would go even further: they would deregulate further; they would cut services; they would reduce public expenditure; they would not provide incentives for industry; they would not provide incentives for exports; they would not increase funds for research; they would not increase funds for education. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the Opposition's amendment to the second reading motion is hypocritical, to say the least. Certainly the Australian Democrats could support paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f). They merely state the obvious-that the Government has engineered a recession and that the Australian people are suffering as a result. However, paragraph (e) says that the Government should be condemned for not curtailing its own purpose spending, running a reckless deficit and plundering the savings of households and firms.</PARA>
<PARA> While the savings of households and firms certainly have gone down the drain in large measure, it is entirely hypocritical for the Opposition to condemn the Government for not pump-priming the economy even further. I would go the other way. It is absolutely essential that the Government adopt an interventionist strategy to get us out of this current mess, and the do-nothing attitude of the Opposition is to be condemned. At the appropriate time I will move an amendment to delete paragraph (e) from the Opposition's amendment to the second reading motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have put forward a number of proposals, which I briefly mentioned before. They are echoed more and more by both economic analysts and commentators, who believe that we must move away from the do-nothing free market ideology which condemns us to do nothing while a million Australians are unemployed. I believe that they are also echoed in what the Australian Council of Trade Unions congress has proposed. I believe that the coalition parties should consider carefully before they condemn out of hand constructive proposals that would enable the Australian economy to be boosted and jobs to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will support the Loan Bill (No. 2). As I have foreshadowed, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Omit paragraph ``e''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are today debating the Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 for the simple reason that this Government's Budget has run into trouble. Senator Short has already explained that the Government has had a turnaround of $13 billion-odd in two years, hence the Bill in front of us. As has already been pointed out, no-one will oppose it because it is a money Bill, although I am sure we would not mind giving the Government a chance to try its luck in the electorate at the moment. But that is the situation we are in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would think that the Government, having made the mess it has in the last couple of years, going backwards to the tune of $13 billion, would have brought down a Budget last August that redressed that. Senator Spindler has just said that the Government is doing nothing. Not only is it doing nothing, but it has also brought down a Budget that will continue the backward trend, and probably at a faster rate. I am afraid that Senator Spindler's solution for reversing the situation would only make it far worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and their advisers sat down to frame this Budget in the worst conditions for bringing down a Budget since the 1930s. I understand that in the 1930s the unemployment figure reached almost 30 per cent-in fact nearer to 28 per cent. This Government has an admitted 10 per cent unemployment rate but it considers anyone working one hour a week is employed. If we put those people into the unemployed category-we consider them to be unemployed-and add those who do not bother to register for the unemployment benefit because they know, with their assets, et cetera, they will not get anything and they do not register for employment because they probably would do better by going and seeking employment themselves, I would like to really see what that figure would get up to. It would probably approach some of the figures of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer sat down to frame this Budget they should have had two points in mind: the Budget had to provide measures to get Australia moving again and they believed that they engineered this recession. I do not quite know whether they engineered it or whether the recession is a result of just general incompetence in the last couple of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tend to agree with Senator Brownhill that it could be the latter because if something is engineered, the trend can be reversed. In this case, the Prime Minister and Treasurer either do not want to reverse the trend or they are not capable of doing so. I believe that they fell into this trap through bad management. Of course a lot of the bad management resulted from the blunder of giving in to the ACTU and other radical groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having this mess, one would think that the Government would have brought down a Budget that would give business and the resource sector confidence to start investing and thereby provide greater production, and with greater production comes employment. Employment is not created through Senator Spindler's idea of giving out more social welfare. That does not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially taxes. As I have always said, social welfare is a safety net for the needy and the needy alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this Budget was framed to keep the Prime Minister in his job. It does not worry about the jobs of the one million Australians who are unemployed. The whole manufacturing industry, the rural sector and the resource sector were waiting for the Budget to give the lead. This could have been done by adopting various measures, such as accelerated depreciation for new resource industries. A few valued at $3 billion or $4 billion, such as a steel mill in Western Australia, could have gone ahead on that basis. But, no, the Government would not listen. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacturing sector was waiting for an overall restructure of the tax system. Nothing like this was included in the Budget. All the Government gave us was further impositions. It increased the superannuation levy to 5 per cent, which will increase the number of unemployed people by another 100,000. Of course if the national occupational superannuation scheme, as it is called, was to be the saviour of all, I would be a supporter of it. I wonder whether anyone read the article on the weekend on compulsory superannuation entitled, `Compulsory super a den of inequities'. I will quote from it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting from an article in the West Australian by Brian Toohey. It was quoted in all the national media over the weekend. Senator Collins would have read it himself. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Most people would not consider they were ahead of the game if they spent $4 billion to get $2 billion back.</PARA>
<PARA>In his time as Treasurer, Mr Keating-and he is still present in the Government although there is a new, temporary Treasurer-did state that, by imposing this national superannuation scheme, the Budget would have a saving of $2 billion by the year 2020 measured in 1991 dollars. However, he forgot to allow for the fact that the superannuation contributions of the levy are tax deductible. When that deduction is taken into consideration, the figures are a mile behind. This Government has failed to take heed of that. At this stage, instead of increasing that 3 per cent to 5 per cent mandatory rate, it could have used other measures to get things moving. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government came in with a town renewal scheme, no doubt to fire up the housing industry. This will not necessarily improve the employment situation to any great degree, and I will explain why. While the housing industry has been experiencing a downturn, many builders have turned towards spec building. In other words, they use their resources in spec building and thus keep their key personnel in place. Of course they use their own resources. As soon as there is an injection of money into the housing industry, either by the Government or an upturn in the economy, their existing work force moves into those extra jobs. So employment will not necessarily be greatly increased because of that measure. The new town strategy was directed more at the shoring up the Government's numbers in the marginal seats. I was up in Brisbane last weekend and was told what will happen in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> New capital investment and expenditure are at an all time low. I told the Senate last week that the figures for investment in new machinery showed that the June quarter was 8.2 per cent lower in real terms than the March quarter. The right incentives would get capital investment up again. The Government should have restored some of incentives we had in the better days of government which Senator Walsh destroyed while he was Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> A lack of this sort of investment will put Australian manufacturing, the Australian resource sector and the Australian rural industry in a very bad position when things turn around because the plants will be run down. When I was a member of a delegation, I witnessed a case of this in Poland under a communist government. The Polish are now trying to fire up their economy, but they have nothing but run-down machinery. If the Government provided incentives for people to spend money updating machinery, when the economy turns around we would be in a position to produce far more. </PARA>
<PARA> In successive Budgets, the Government has shortened the period for the payment of tax. We are starting to feel the effect of this a little. Since this Government came to power it has looked at having its taxation grab nearer the end of the financial year. That has not been discussed enough or even allowed for in this Budget. The Government has been dragging the deadline forward more and more. For example, it originally set a date of 28 July for the collection of 85 per cent of company tax. But it has fiddled with that date ever since it knew the original plan has not worked. I understand that happened this year. Normally one used to pay tax on a quarterly basis with the last instalment to be made in March. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no mention in the Budget of a provisional tax uplift. If we look at the company reports and individual returns that would be lodged by now, we see that the profit in the last 12 months has gone down. Yet with provisional tax we still have that 10 per cent uplift. I know that the Government will tell us that we can do a provisional readjustment, but the provisional readjustment means another heap of accountancy fees and penalties if we happen to get it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything is being done to bleed the private sector-not to get some more work out of the public sector or anything like that. The private sector has been bleeding since 1983. I am afraid that cow has now run dry. The resource sector could have expected to have received some consideration, having regard to its contribution to the economy over the years. But no, the Government has not done anything whatsoever for that sector either. </PARA>
<PARA> I have here an article stating what Sir Arvi Parbo, Chairman of BHP, has had to say about the situation. In no uncertain terms, he told the Government that he thought the Government was lacking in leadership. The article, which was published in the Canberra Times on the weekend, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Negative and ``downright antagonistic'' attitudes to the mining industry were holding back economic development . . . the chief of Western Mining Corp Holdings Ltd, Sir Arvi Parbo, said last night. </PARA>
<PARA> It was impossible for mining companies to embark on great mining developments like those of the 1960s because of the ``hopeless bureaucratic and political maze built up over the past 20 years''. </PARA>
<PARA>The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Arvi, in an obvious but unspecified attack on conservationists, the Hawke Government and militant Aboriginal groups, said it was virtually impossible to embark freely on new mining and processing ventures. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Arvi is quite right. He was involved with hands-on mining in the 1960s. He was part of, and responsible for, many of the gold mining developments in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is an outstanding Australian. In the days when I knew him in Marvel Loch, he was an underground shift boss. He was part of the industry and knows what it is about. We have now reached the situation where this Government stands aside and lets resources be locked up. In this downturn, if we could get some of those resources, people would be employed. Mining has a great multiplier effect. The Government has failed again. All we have is restrictive practices that are supported by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook has now come into this place. He continually acts as a paid-up member of the ACTU rather than as a Minister of the Crown. He blindly defends set-ups such as Robe River tugs. Without giving us the full story, he told us the other day that the conditions on those tugs which are enjoyed by all other tug operators around Australia are to be done away with. The conditions are enjoyed by all tug operators, but that does not mean that they are wrong. Merchant seamen are in a different position. They are in a different situation-just like these conditions-where they work five weeks on and five weeks off. The tug operators never lose sight of land; they sleep in their own beds every night. They do not have to put up with the conditions that the merchant seamen work under, yet Senator Cook is defending them. I am using Senator Cook's example; he is defending them. </PARA>

I just cannot understand why Ministers of this Government continually support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, with a great fanfare in the March statement, eliminated or decreased sales tax on items such as oil and grease, but we have yet to have the legislation put in front of us. It is now September. When is the legislation coming?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) did not know exactly what sales tax was allowable for primary industry when he blundered on sedans earlier this year. I will not go into that matter now. The Government came with a fanfare announcement last March and we still do not have the legislation before us. When will we get the legislation to put the measures in?</PARA>
<PARA> The only winner in this Budget was the Prime Minister. He hopes to hold power by sopping to the Left with this Budget. I am greatly disappointed. I will give a few examples of what was contained in the Budget. There was $8m for the establishment of a Commonwealth environment protection agency. What is $8m in a Budget of this size? The endangered species program is to receive $5m. The endangered species in this country are the Australians who are out of work. We worry about endangered species-it was mentioned in the Budget-at a time of a recession. At this time we should be worrying about the one million Australians who are out of work and, hopelessly, cannot find work. That is what we have to look at. This Government stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not wait for another March statement. There is already talk of a March statement next year. The Government not only has not acted upon the statement of last March but also has failed us in this Budget. What is more, the Government is talking about a March statement again next year. When will we see action? The Government should gracefully withdraw this Budget and draw up another one. We will wait around another month for the Government to do that. The Government should do something to get Australia moving. This Budget does absolutely nothing. I support the amendment which has been moved by my colleague Senator Short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Loan Bill (No. 2) which is before the chamber. The reason this Bill comes before the chamber today was outlined by my colleague Senator Short, who mentioned the enormous blow-out in the Government's funding requirement. Despite that blow-out, we would not have had to have this Bill before the Parliament had it not been for our colleagues in the Senate chamber in 1985 and 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sixth edition of Odgers, which we have all been particularly gratified to receive recently, points out that in 1985 and 1986 the Government sought permanent authority for these loan Bills. Each time that permanent authority was rejected by the Senate. It is useful to read through this current loan Bill to make sure that the Government is not seeking any permanent authority to borrow. It is quite clear that, under the policies of this Hawke Government, we will continue to borrow until its demise. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats raised some points about their own policies. It is well-known in this chamber that the policies of the Australian Democrats are high taxing policies. I think there are some 40 to 50 new revenue measures in the alternative Budget presented to the press by Senator Spindler. The Australian Democrats want to raise an additional $6.4 billion. He says in that alternative Budget that he wishes to spend an additional $6.4 but, as we discovered when we looked through that alternative Budget, there is a $2.4 billion black hole or miscalculation in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, I want to speak about the problems with the Government's policies. They have been effectively outlined in the amendments proposed by Senator Short. I wonder how many Australian Labor Party people-especially Senator Bolkus, who is leaving the chamber, and Senator Cook-know that, faced with a similar problem in 1945 Mr Chifley, the then leader of the Party, presented a White Paper to the Parliament entitled Full Employment in Australia. Does Senator Cook believe it? At that time the Government was faced with the problem of a war economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were also faced with a history of more than 10 per cent unemployment during the 1920s and 1930s. The old Labor Party-not the new Labor Party-committed itself to a policy of full unemployment. In 1945, the Labor Party of old brought down a White Paper. I must admit that there were many problems associated with that White Paper, but the important thing is that it expressed the key value that full employment is vital in a modern economy for a variety of reasons that I shall be pointing out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What did the Labor Party do today? What did Senator Cook's Caucus do today? It did not propose a proper White Paper, a proper Government policy and a decent Budget to promote employment in this country. Today, it appointed Lloyd O'Neil. Quite rightly Senator Cook looks surprised. I had never heard of Lloyd O'Neil. However, he was appointed to head a Caucus committee of seven to investigate the causes of unemployment. The Labor Party of old under Chifley brought down a big White Paper titled Full Employment in Australia. Under the new Labor Party, Lloyd O'Neil will be carrying out a Caucus investigation into the causes of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> If one ever wanted to see a symbol of how the Labor Party has fallen, that is the symbol. There is a very clear reason for that. The present level of unemployment has been created by eight years of government by this Labor Party. Its senior Ministers have admitted that. It is astonishing that Senator Spindler comes into this chamber and tells honourable senators to start looking at the prescriptions of the ACTU.

Every major policy has been checked and cleared through the ACTU. When comrade Ferguson and comrade Kelty-or comrade Crean as he then was-said no, that brought those Government policies to a halt, including the goods and services tax. The Prime Minister and the alternative Prime Minister, whom Senator Cook supports, namely, Mr Keating, are on record as being very strongly supportive of that tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point that I wish to make is that we are seeing the example of the new Labor Party-the Labor Party of the spivs, the Labor Party of the wealthy corporate bosses and the Labor Party of every vested interest group-that has dropped its traditional base. Under Chifley, the traditional base of the Labor Party was working class Australians, and it committed itself to looking after their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> How far has the Labor Party travelled under this Government's policies? I am glad that Senator Cook is in the chamber. This Labor Party Government has cut the living standards of Australian workers.

<PARA> Throughout the 1980s the Labor Party Government cut the living standards of Australian workers. But that was not good enough for it. What is the Government doing now? It is throwing them out of jobs. That is what its policies have done. That is why I say that this is not the Labor Party of old. This is not the Labor Party of the Chifleys and the Curtins. This is the Labor Party of the new spivs and the corporate rich. It is the Labor Party of the Hawkes, the Keatings, the Cooks and even Senator Coates.

It appointed Lloyd O'Neil to tell it what was wrong with it. Let me tell the Labor Party that it does not need Lloyd O'Neil to tell it that. One has only to open any newspaper and read what any economist says. One of the central reasons for this disastrous recession, which is the worst since the Great Depression, is this Government's arrangements, its policies and its accord with the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are comrade Ferguson and comrade Kelty reported as saying yesterday at the ACTU conference? I ask honourable senators to remember that that organisation was part and parcel of this Government. When the Budget came down, comrade Ferguson was asked whether he was critical of the Budget. But not comrade Ferguson! He was true blue. He was part and parcel of this Government, and one must give him credit for that. Yesterday, comrade Ferguson said that he had discovered that unemployment levels in this country-now one million people-were `intolerable and unacceptable'. It took him a hell of a long time, with one million workers out of a job, to find out that the levels are intolerable and unacceptable. I stress that this is the man who played an essential role in the policy development of this Government. Now, before his conference, he has the cheek to stand up and complain about those policies. He should have complained three or six years ago when it was absolutely blatantly obvious that this crisis was going to be upon us. But no, finally, even comrade Ferguson has broken ranks and said that the unemployment levels are intolerable and unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months, honourable senators have witnessed the collapse in Eastern Europe of institutions that have been around for a long time-70 years in the case of the Communist Party and in many other countries since the Second World War. They were rotten to the core, but pretended to represent the interests of the people whom they so manifestly did not represent. I wonder whether we can draw any analogy with those developments. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Party is not a party of the workers. It is a party of the powerful and the privileged. I wonder how long Australian workers are going to stay with a party that has cut their living standards and lost their jobs. Senator Cook has been part of that history. In the mornings when he reads headlines about Eastern Europe, I wonder whether he sometimes gets a little hint that maybe the Labor Party is heading down that same road. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that this country had a union movement that represented the interests of workers not union bosses. When the election is held in four months time or six months time-even if the Labor Party tries to string out its term until 1993-as it rings out this Government, it will be ringing out the ACTU as well. The ACTU will pay a very heavy price indeed for being part and parcel of this disgraceful Government, which has cut the living standards of Australian workers and caused catastrophic unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite Senator Cook to see what gross hypocrisy, and what an aimless, pathetic group of people, we now have. I invite him to read through the debates in 1982. He should go to his database and get his huge staff-a few of those highly paid consultants-to tap out the debates on unemployment in 1982. He should pull out those debates because they are very interesting. He would see what Mr Hawke, his Prime Minister, and Mr Keating, his preferred Prime Minister, said about unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 is the second Loan Bill in the past six months which the Senate has had to address. It is indeed a pity that the Government has not been able to maintain its past good record of Budget surpluses, which required no loan Bills for the three years from 1988 to 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet, Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you and to fellow senators gathered here today that the Government has only itself to blame as the factors which have led to the need for this Loan Bill have arisen as a direct consequence of Government policy. The recession we had to have, courtesy of the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Keating, and the other economic decision makers of the Labor Party, has placed the Government in the deficit situation that has led to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 will allow certain Commonwealth expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. We are told that the Bill arises because the Government expects the Consolidated Revenue Fund to be in deficit to the extent of about $10.2 billion by the end of this financial year. This deficit will occur partly because of the Budget deficit of $4.7 billion and partly because of off-Budget capital transactions.</PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I would be pleased if the Government could provide the Senate during this debate with a breakdown of the off-Budget expenses estimated at $5.5 billion for the year between, firstly, transactions of a financing nature being related to the raising or discharge of a loan or comprising transactions involving financial assets and liabilities; secondly, contributions to the national debt sinking fund and the loan consolidation and investment reserve; and, thirdly, superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth to the employees of Commonwealth business undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> I am uncertain as to whether the Government wishes to review its Budget deficit of $4.7 billion in the light of its backing down on the Medicare levy of $3.50 and/or any further changes it may be considering to what was already an unimaginative, unconstructive and uninspiring Budget. Hopefully, the Government will at least admit that $4.7 billion does not represent the actual deficit. The actual deficit has been estimated at $7.7 billion, from which Mr Kerin then deducted $625m from asset sales and some $2.3 billion from the transfer to the States of the responsibility for financing their maturing debt. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this is not the only aspect of the Budget to have changed since 21 August. Mr John Kerin, the honourable member for Werriwa and Treasurer, stated that the fundamental objective of the Government's macro-economic policy is to achieve a solid and sustainable rate of economic growth. The important elements in achieving this are listed as generating enduring employment growth; ensuring that the gains made on inflation are sustained and built upon; and reducing the current account deficit and stabilising our external debt relative to GDP. The Budget Papers then go on to say that achieving these goals will require a coordinated and consistent policy response embracing all arms of macroeconomic policy and industry reform. The Government says it wants to do this but then does not include anything in its Budget to ensure that these objectives will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at fiscal policy for a moment. I mentioned before the Budget deficit, which for argument's sake we will put at $4.7 billion. Running a deficit puts the Government back into the money market, competing with the private sector for funds and thus putting pressure on the interest rate. Such a move is contrary to the Government's previous fiscal policy, where it purposely moved itself out of the borrowing market so that funds were available for the private sector to invest and thus to create employment. On this basis I do not see how fiscal policy would help the Government's objective to generating enduring employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly no wages policy identifiable in the Budget. Contrary to media speculation before the Budget, there was no 4 per cent or 5 per cent rate as agreed with the ACTU before the Budget. The Government is probably still trying to work out where accord 6 has left it and where it goes from there. </PARA>
<PARA> The one positive sign as far as the coalition is concerned is that the Government has listed, as a central issue for the AIRC and the parties involved in the forthcoming review of wages principles, how best to develop further a workable framework for enterprise bargaining. We on this side of the Senate have been advocating a move to enterprise bargaining for some time, although not as a second tier for wage negotiations, as the ACTU would suggest. If the Government is serious about its objective to contain inflation then it cannot afford to build in a percentage wage increase each year which acts purely as a fillip for the inflation spiral. This much, I hope, it has realised. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The town of Theodore is a small rural town in central Queensland. It has a population of 600 people, with 900 people in the surrounding district, which includes an Aboriginal community. There are two small shops and two hotels. It is suffering from the drought and the recession that is affecting the rest of Australia. For some years, people needing health care have been served by a doctor who was appointed as the Medical Superintendent of the Theodore Hospital. This is a part time position and because the town has a population of only 1,500, it can support only one doctor. He has given exemplary care to the people of that community for some years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Due to his desire to improve the rural health care throughout Queensland and that district, in particular, he became active within the Rural Doctors Association of Queensland. He became Secretary and, subsequently, President of the Rural Doctors Association of Queensland. In occupying that role, of course, he criticised government and had a certain amount of press exposure in relation to criticism of government and other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 August 1991, he received a letter from the Labor Minister for Health in the Queensland Government. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Dr. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Your most recent attacks on the Queensland Government follow a series of similar public criticisms of the Government in which you have resorted to untruths and distortions to create apprehension and uncertainty in the community about the policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, I can no longer have confidence in your ability to implement the policies of the Government as an employee of the Central Regional Health Authority. I have spoken to you on at least two occasions to remind you of your responsibilities in this regard. The first time was when you were officially summonsed to my office in this regard on Tuesday 11 December, 1990. The second occasion was in Emerald on Friday 31 May, 1991 at the Central Regional Medical Superintendents Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>The Director General of Queensland Health has also reprimanded you in response to certain public statements which he considered to be unacceptable from an employee of the Government. This occurred in Brisbane on Tuesday 11 December, 1990 and in Rockhampton on Tuesday 25th June, 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I enclose a list of media statements by you which documents what I consider to be a sustained campaign of criticism of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>As you have obviously determined to maintain a role as a constant critic of the Government, I think it is only fair that you be relieved of any responsibility to the public sector so that there can be no ongoing suggestion of divided loyalties. You will then be in a position to say whatever you will about the Government and the elected members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of all the circumstances then, I think it best that you tender your resignation as Medical Superintendent of Theodore Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>Your advice, in due course, will be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully</PARA>
<PARA>K. V. McElligott MLA</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER FOR HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary situation! It is interesting that in today's Courier-Mail there is a cartoon of the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss. The caption above the first drawing is, `Charges of racism over ministerial gaffes?!'; above the second is `Charges of cronyism over govt appointees?!'. Then there is a slight distortion of the cartoon of Mr Goss and a caption that says, `Don't you worry about that!'. I have inserted my own caption, `Charges of arrogance over criticism?!'. </PARA>
<PARA> The law in Queensland allows any public servant to stand in an election campaign and retain his or her position if unelected. There is no limitation on freedom of speech. However, the action of this particular Minister-and the Government, which obviously endorsed that situation-for the first time in mid-term shows the true arrogance of the Goss Labor Government. It is unbelievable that this doctor had no alternative but to resign from the position because of his devotion to the people of Theodore and the fact that it would be extremely difficult to get another doctor to go there in light of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known that only 23 per cent of doctors in Australia are located in country areas. There is enormous difficulty in getting people to go to small towns such as Theodore. It smacks of a totalitarian government which cannot stand criticism; it is extremely arrogant. Next, of course, we shall see further activities along this line. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting that the private secretary of the Minister for Health is a certain Mr David Butt, who was a secretary to Dr Blewett when he was the Minister for Community Services and Health. It is evident that the sensitivity of the current Queensland Minister for Health and the Government has been transferred from the activities of Mr Butt when he occupied the position in Canberra. The whole of the Health Department in Queensland has now been stacked with Labor appointees and it is occurring in other departments as well. There is a notice in the lift of the Queensland Health Department that says, `The Canberra branch of the ALP'. </PARA>
<PARA> An old saying that applies to all governments-far be it from me to tell you, Mr Deputy President, but you too were in such a position-is that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment this evening to bring to the attention of the Senate the case of Mr Vo Dai Ton. On Saturday 20 July 1991, I had the opportunity to attend the ninth commemorative anniversary of the imprisonment of Vo Dai Ton in Vietnam. This particular function was organised by the Vietnamese Community in Australia (Victoria Chapter). The Vietnamese Community, under its President, Ba Phuc Tran, is engaged in widespread community work in my State and assists Vietnamese families to settle in our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some hundreds of Vietnamese attended this function, as well as representatives from many other community groups. All the major political parties attended. I was the spokesman on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia. Dr Andrew Theophanous represented the Australian Labor Party. There were also political representatives from both the State Liberal and Labor parties in attendance. The speeches were unanimous in expressing their concern about Mr Vo Dai Ton, his health and his welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Vo Dai Ton was a former distinguished General in the South Vietnamese army. He came to Australia after 1975 and subsequently became a permanent resident. He was arrested in 1982 after returning to Vietnam from Australia. In other words, for almost nine years Vo Dai Ton has been incarcerated in a Vietnamese prison. At no time has the Vietnamese Government brought him to trial. Mrs Vo Dai Ton has been very active in seeking the release of her husband and has written to the President of Vietnam, Mr Vo Chi Chong. A number of efforts have been made to seek information on Vo Dai Ton and to request his release from prison. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as February this year, the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs again assured Australian officials that it was `trying very hard' to arrive at a decision on his release, but that no guarantee of any particular date for such a decision could be made. Again, in April and May of this year, further representations were made to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am pleased to report to the Senate that the coalition shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Mr Ruddock, has taken a personal and longstanding interest in this particular case. The Australian Government has indicated to the Vietnamese that Vo Dai Ton will be accepted again as an Australian resident. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Vietnamese Government has undertaken some reforms which have had some positive effects on human rights in that country. This process, called Doi Moi, began in 1986 and there have been some positive reports. For example, some of those reports have indicated that religious worship is largely tolerated but with some restrictions. Many people who had been detained pursuant to the defeat of the South Vietnamese Government have been released from the re-education camps. A commitment has been made to prevent the torture and ill-treatment of people detained in prison. Finally, there is some increased freedom of the press to report abuses of power by local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it also has to be reported in the Senate that a recent Amnesty International report on human rights indicates that there are still some concerns about the treatment of prisoners. The Vietnamese Minister of Justice recently indicated to our Ambassador that Vietnam's laws were framed in the context of a bitter war and that, with the passage of time, these laws could be relaxed. Mr Deputy President, I suggest the time has come to relax those laws now. </PARA>
<PARA> I have risen in the Senate this evening because many Australians and recent Vietnamese settlers have expressed concern to me about the well-being of Vo Dai Ton. The world is changing dramatically; there is widespread recognition throughout the world of the importance of human rights. I hope the Vietnamese Government will enter into this new spirit of cooperation and release Vo Dai Ton. I hope the Australian Government will pursue this cause with great vigour and perseverance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has recognised that it must upgrade a substantial part of its Air Traffic Control (ATC) System, in order to replace ageing equipment and improve the efficiency of its operations.</PARA>
<PARA>  In planning this upgrade, the CAA was mindful of the difficulties which have been experienced with many ATC development projects around the world in recent years. Cost overruns of hundreds of millions of dollars and schedule slippages amounting to years have occurred on major ATC development projects overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>  With this knowledge, the CAA adopted a low risk strategy by seeking proven systems and inviting interest only from organisations which have demonstrated success in the implementation, integration and commissioning of complete air traffic systems. This approach significantly reduces the potential for large cost and schedule overruns.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having adopted this strategy, the CAA assessed that no wholly Australian owned companies had previously implemented, integrated and commissioned complete air traffic systems. However, several multinational companies with Australian subsidiaries have proven records in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) In choosing the companies which were invited to register interest in The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) project, the CAA analysed the comparative credentials and achievements of an extensive list of companies which are in the business of providing and installing complete air traffic systems. To achieve timing requirements the list was pruned to include only those companies which had the greatest potential to provide and install the proven technology the CAA is seeking.</PARA>
<PARA>  Six overseas companies were invited to register interest in the project on the basis of their potential to provide and install the proven technology the CAA is seeking in the necessary timeframe. These were:</PARA>
<PARA>  Alenia</PARA>
<PARA>  Hughes Aircraft Corporation</PARA>
<PARA>  IBM Australia Limited</PARA>
<PARA>  NEC Information Systems Australia Pty Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>  Siemens-Plessey Electronics Systems, Australia</PARA>
<PARA>  Thomson Radar Australia Corporation Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>  Four of the six groups, IBM Australia Limited, Hughes Aircraft Corporation, Thomson Radar Australia Corporation and Siemens-Plessey Electronics Australia, have responded to the CAA's offer to register interest in TAAATS. Three of these companies are Australian subsidiaries of overseas parent companies, and two out of the three employ substantial numbers of Australians. IBM Australia employs around 4200 staff and Siemens-Plessey in excess of 2000 staff.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The CAA is fully conscious of the Government's Australian and New Zealand industry preference policies. However, because of the nature of the large scale system being sought and the lack of Australian suppliers of air traffic systems, it is inevitable that overseas companies will need to supply a major share of the product.</PARA>
<PARA>  The CAA has advised that, unfortunately, a local industry consortium would not have provided the same security as the approach the Authority has adopted. As no Australian company provides an air traffic control system, it could only be presumed that an Australian consortia would intend to `subcontract' to an overseas company the heart of the system and the consortia provide the periphery. It would seriously increase the risk to the CAA to distance itself from the key portion of the system.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The approach the CAA has taken does not preclude opportunities for Australian industry. The prime contractor selected will be obliged to comply with Australian Government policies regarding offsets and Australian and New Zealand industry preference.</PARA>
<PARA>  The CAA will also require that a support capability for the selected system is available or established in Australia. Initial assessment of offers now received suggests a significant amount of Australian industry involvement in all offers.</PARA>

<PARA>  (2) Has the Minister any indication from France if it intends to continue testing nuclear devices at its sites in the Pacific.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) It is particularly disappointing that France continues its nuclear tests program in spite of the well known opposition of South Pacific states. As a matter of principle, Australia condemns each test that takes place in French Polynesia and has made its opposition known at the highest levels. More recently, I had the opportunity to reaffirm our strong opposition to French nuclear testing with the French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alain Vivien, during his recent visit to Canberra. The Government also avails itself of other opportunities, such as at the United Nations and other international forums, to draw attention to the opposition in our region to such tests.</PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is also working to achieve the early conclusion of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban (CTBT) which would end all nuclear tests by all countries, in all environments, for all time. To this end, we will again co-sponsor a resolution with New Zealand at the United Nations General Assembly in October. A CTBT will be an important step towards ending and reversing the nuclear arms race and discouraging potential new weapons states.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) France has conducted six nuclear tests this year; no further tests are expected in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  The number of French nuclear tests annually has declined in recent years. However, the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, has stated that France does not intend to cease testing because it considers such tests essential to the modernisation of its nuclear weapons. France has adopted a more transparent attitude to its nuclear testing practices and Australia acknowledges this gesture.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) French officials have previously reported on their procedures for cleaning up, recovering and disposing of nuclear wastes resulting from French weapons testing in the Pacific. These procedures involve deep burial on Mururoa Atoll and were described in the report of the joint New Zealand,</PARA>
<PARA>Australian and Papua New Guinea Scientific Mission to Mururoa Atoll in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA>  France has ratified the South Pacific Environmental Program (SPREP) Convention which requires participating parties to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the Convention Area and to ensure sound environmental management and development of natural resources and the protection of the endangered flora and fauna. SPREP also requires Parties to the Convention and major extra- regional powers to prohibit the dumping and disposal of radioactive wastes and radioactive matter in the Convention area. However, France has declared that in so far as it is concerned, the prescriptions of the Convention will not cover wastes and other matter entailing a level of pollution caused by radioactivity to a degree less than that prescribed by the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</PARA>
